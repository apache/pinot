The terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably or in conjunction with each other ( TLS/SSL ) , but one is in fact the predecessor of the other SSL 3.0 served as the basis for TLS 1.0 which , as a result , is sometimes referred to as SSL 3.1 . With this said though , is there actually a practical difference between the two ? <h> Which is more secure SSL or TLS ? <p> It used to be believed that TLS v1.0 was only marginally more secure than SSL v3.0 , its predecessor . - However , SSL v3.0 is getting very old and recent developments , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now completely insecure ( especially for web sites using it ) . - Even before the POODLE was set loose , the US Government had- already mandated- that SSL v3 not be used for sensitive government communications or for HIPAA-compliant communications . If that was not enough POODLE certainly was . - In fact , as a result of POODLE , SSL v3 is being disabled on web sites all over the world and for many other services as well . <p> SSL v3.0 is effectively " dead " as a useful security protocol . - Places that still allow its use for web hosting as placing their " secure web sites " at risk ; Organizations that allow SSL v3 use to persist for other protocols ( e.g. IMAP ) should take steps to remove that support at the soonest software update maintenance window . <p> Subsequent versions of TLS v1.1 and v1.2 are significantly more secure- and fix many vulnerabilities present in SSL v3.0 and TLS v1.0. - For example , the BEAST attack that can completely break web sites running on older SSL v3.0 and TLS v1.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prevent the BEAST and other attack vectors and provide many stronger ciphers and encryption methods . <h> But wait are not TLS and SSL different encryption mechanisms ? <p> If you setup an email program you will often see separate options for " no encryption " , " SSL " , or " TLS " encryption of you transmission . - This leads one to assume that TLS and SSL are very different things . <p> In truth , this labeling is a misnomer . - You are not actually selecting which- method to use ( SSL v3 or TLS v1.x ) when making this choice . - You are merely selecting between options that dictate how the secure connection will be initiated . <p> No matter which " method " you choose for initiating the connection , TLS or SSL , the same level of encryption will be obtained when talking to the server and that level is determined by the software installed on the server , how that is configured , and what your program actually supports . <h> If the SSL vs TLS choice is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two distinct ways that a program can initiate a secure connection with a server : <p> By Port ( a.k.a. explicit ) : Connecting to a specific port means that a secure connection should be used . - For example , port 443 for https ( secure web ) , 993 for secure IMAP , 995 for secure POP , etc. - These ports are setup on the server ready to negotiate a secure connection first , and do whatever else you want second . <p> By Protocol ( a.k.a. implicit ) : These- connections first begin with an insecure " hello " to the server and only then switch to secured communications after the handshake between the client and the server is successful . If this handshake fails for any reason , the connection is severed . - A good example of this is the command " STARTTLS " used in outbound email ( SMTP ) connections . <p> The " By Port " method is commonly referred to as " SSL " or " explicit " and the " By Protocol " method is commonly referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many program configuration areas . <p> Sometimes , you have only the option to specify the port and if you should be making a secure connection or not and the program itself guesses from that what method should be used many old email programs like Outlook and Mac Mail did that . - In such cases , you need to know if the program will try and explicit or implicit connection to initiate security , and choose your port appropriately ( or else the connection could fail ) . <p> To Review : In email programs and other systems where you can select from SSL or TLS together with the port a connection will be made on : <p> SSL means a " by port " explicit connection to a port that expects to the session to start with security negotiation <p> TLS means a " by protocol " connection where the program will connect " insecurely " first and use special commands to enable encryption ( implicit ) . <p> Use of either could result in a connection encrypted with either- SSL v3 or TLS v1.0+ , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your program . <p> Both methods of connection ( implicit and explicit ) result in equally secure communications . <p> Sidebar : It is unclear why the " By Protocol " method is referred to as " TLS " as it could result in- either TLS or SSL actually being used . - It is likely because the folks who designed the SMTP protocol decided to name their command to switch to SSL/TLS in the SMTP protocol to " STARTTLS " ( using " TLS " in the name as that is the newer protocol name ) . - Then email programs started listing " TLS " next to this and " SSL " next to the old " By Port " option which came first . - Once they started labeling things this way , that expanded to general use in the configuration of other protocols ( like POP and IMAP ) for " consistency " . - I am not certain if this is the real reason , but based on my experience dealing with all versions of email programs and servers over the last 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your data is encrypted as it is transmitted across the Internet. - They also both enable you to be sure that the server that you are communication with is the server you intend to contact and not some " middle man eavesdropper " . - This is possible because servers that support SSL- and TLS- must have certificates issued to them by a trusted third party , like Comodo. - These certificates verify that the domain name they are issued for really belongs to the server ( all about SSL certificates ) . - Your computer will issue warnings to you if you try to connect to a server and the certificate that it gets back is not trusted or does n't  match the site you are trying to connect to . <h> So then , should I choose TLS- or SSL ? <p> If you are configuring a server , you must install software that supports the latest version of the TLS standard , and configure it properly . - This ensures that the connections that your users make are- as secure as possible . - Using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 2048+ bit keys , Extended Validation , etc. - You should avoid using SSL v3 and should use only strong- ciphers , especially if compliance of any kind is required . <p> If you are configuring a program ( especially an email program ) and have the option to connect securely via SSL or TLS , you should feel free to choose either one . as long as it is supported by your server . <p> Note : - many web browsers have special preference areas that allow you specifically enable/disable SSL v2 , SSL v3 , TLS v1.0 , etc. - In these cases you are actually telling the browser what versions of these security protocols you will allow your browser to use when establishing secure connections . We recommend turning off SSL v2 and SSL v3 ( they provide no real security ) . - Some web sites may support SSL v3 only ; if you encounter one of these please let them know that they are seriously behind the time and doing themselves and their visitors a serious disservice by pretending to provide safety while actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do not select either one ? <p> If neither SSL nor TLS is used , then the communications between you and the server can easily become a party line for eavesdroppers . Your data and your login information are sent in plain text for anyone to see ; there is no guarantee that the server you connect to is not some middle man or interloper. - For more on this , see : the case for email security . <h> Does LuxSci support these security protocols ? <p> SSL/TLS form the basis of client-server security used by LuxSci for all of its services . - Our web servers do not support SSL v3.0 and do support TLS v1.2 ; - our web sites are protected against the BEAST and POODLE attacks . - We use only strong , NIST-recommend ciphers for compliance reasons . - We offer a variety of ports for connecting securely to POP , IMAP , and SMTP- using both implicit and explicit methods for establishing TLS encryption. - - LuxSci also offers MySQL and WebMail over SSL and provides SSL for web hosting clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , LuxSci strongly recommends taking advantage of our secure capabilities , such as enforced use of PGP , S/MIME , TLS , and email Escrow protocols . <h> Update for July , 2016 : What about TLS v1.3 ? <p> TLS v1.3 is still an Internet Draft and the specifications for what will finally be in it and how exactly it will differ from v1.2 are not finalized. - - However , we do know some of things that v1.3 is going to provide . - These include the complete removal of things that are known to be cryptographically weak such as MD5 , RC4 , and weak elliptic curves ; dropping support for seldom-used features like compression and " change cipher " ciphers ; and adding new elliptic curves . <p> Once TLS v1.3 is finalized and stable in the standard TLS libraries ( e.g. openssl ) , I imagine we will see a strong push to move further away from TLS v1.0 and v1.1 and to use v1.2 and v1.3 exclusively . - This seems to be the rapid trend . - Who knows , maybe TLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-quantum algorithms . <p> Excellent article . Thank you for taking the time to concisely explain the subtle differences of SSLv3 &amp; TLS . Also , I love the iPhone reformatting support that you 've added to your WordPress installation . One note about it : It did say there were 4 comments on this article , but they were not displayed in the mobile iPhone version . <p> email encryption is one way to ensure that your email can only be read by the intended recipients . SSL and TLS connections are secure , but only to a point . While you can ensure that your users connect securely <p> The easiest thing you can do to make your email more secure is to use an email provider that supports " Secure Socket Layer " ( SSL ) for their Webmail , POP , IMAP , and SMTP servers . TLS is a type of SSL that can be initiated during a mail session ; unlike TLS , SSL must be initiated before sending the email ( see SSL versus TLS What 's the difference ? ) .

However , the main point is that the only certificate involved is the one that resides on the server owned by the service provider and which is sent to the user when s/he connects. - Since the user never needs to send his/her own certificate , there is no need to own it . <h> But without a certificate , how does the server know who I am ? <p> In most cases , when your SSL session is completed , the next step in sending or receiving email is to send your username and password. - The server uses this information to determine your identity and verify your access. - This information is secure and protected by the established SSL security connection . <p> You do not need your own SSL- certificate to establish your identity . <h> But is not using a client-side SSL- certificate more secure than a username and password ? <p> Ah ha ! This is the crux of some peoples confusion . <p> It is indeed possible to have an SSL- certificate on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server , providing that the server supports this kind of authentication. - It can be much more secure than a username and password , as it is tied to your computer and can not be stolen without physical access to your machine and your account on it . <p> However , most email services do not support identity authentication via client-side SSL certificates. - This is much more common with secure web sites. - I.e. some OpenID providers , like " myopenid.com " , allow you to authenticate with them using a free client-side SSL- certificate . This gives you better security with your OpenID- than you get with usernames and passwords. - It also means that you do not have to remember another password the client-side SSL- certificate is your effective " password " . <p> LuxSci itself does not support use of SSL- client-side certificates for any kind of login though it does support OpenID for WebMail access , and thus supports any kind of excellent authentication accessible in that way . <h> Ok , when do I- need to buy an SSL- certificate of my own ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LuxSci is concerned , you might need to buy your own SSL- certificate in the following cases : <p> You have your own web site and you would like to have some or all of it secured by SSL. - You will then need to get an SSL- certificate for your web sites domain name . <p> You have Private Labeling with LuxSci and wish to use your own domain name in the browser address bar when users are logged in to your branded WebMail securely ( i.e. , instead of them seeing https : //luxsci.com/ ) . - You would then need an SSL- certificate for something like " webmail.yourdomain.com " . <p> You have Private Labeling with LuxSci and wish to use your own domain name in your users email clients for their secure IMAP , POP , or SMTP- connections to your email server ( i.e. , instead of them using something like " secure-email.luxsci.com " ) . - You would then need an SSL- certificate for something like " mail.yourdomain.com " . <p> LuxSci can purchase these SSL certificates for you through its partner , Thawte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to LuxSci ( let us generate the CSRs- certificate signing requests for you to make things easier , however ) . - Its up to you which way to go ; however , if we buy the certificate for you , a lot of leg work will be taken care of on your behalf and we will ensure that the certificate does n't  expire without your permission .

Start with this article its purpose is to she 'd light on many of the most significant factors in secure web site programming/design and what you can do to address them. - At a minimum , reading this article will help you to intelligently discuss your web site security with the developers that you ultimately hire . <h> What is Involved In Web Site Security ? <p> Web site security is a deep and complex topic . We will only be hitting some of the high points . The focus of this article is to address the security issues involved with a web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors . What could be simpler , right ? <p> Well , not quite . Here are some of the issues that need to be considered : <p> SSL Is the form secured so that data is transmitted from the end user securely and does your site therefore evoke trust ? - Is your for page itself protected with SSL so as to prevent tampering with its contents ? <p> Web page content Is the HTML content sent to the end user protected from Cross Site Scripting ( XSS ) issues and does it avoid loading objects insecurely and/or from third parties ? <p> Script Security Are the scripts or programs that process the submitted data written with security in mind ? Do they have any vulnerabilities ? <p> Infrastructure Is the web site hosting provider you are using trusted and known for good security ? Are you on a shared server when you should be on a dedicated one ? <p> The Data What do you do with the data once it is submitted ? Is that data secured ? <p> Tracking Do you track events such as access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there processes in place to make backups and permanent archives of important data ? <h> SSL Web Security Starts Here <p> An SSL Certificate is absolutely required for a secure web site. - The SSL Certificate allows : <p> the data sent to and from your web server and your users to be encrypted <p> so it ca n't be eavesdropped on <p> so it ca n't be tampered with and changed <p> your users to trust that they are connecting to your web site securely and know that your site is secure <p> To get an SSL certificate , you can either order one directly from a third party , like Thawte , or contact your web hosting provider and to see if they can obtain one for you. - In either case , your web host will need to install the certificate on the server where your web site is hosted , and then you will need to make changes to your site to take full advantage of the secure channel that you have added . <h> SSL and Encryption <p> By far the most significant reason that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide encryption of the data sent to and from their web site and the end user. - When the end user visits a page of yours that is protected by SSL , their web browser communicates over a secure channel with the web server , and so that all data transmitted is sent over this encrypted channel. - This helps to prevent eavesdropping and " man-in-the-middle " attacks on the data ( more on these below ) . <p> Without SSL encryption , there is little or no protection of the data. - We will now review how to make sure that you set things up correctly to make maximal use of SSL and to prevent it from being circumvented . <h> SSL and Trust <p> The most overlooked and misunderstood aspect of SSL is the establishment of trust. - That is , enabling your end users to trust that they are connecting to your actual web site. - What else could they be connecting to , you may ask ? <p> Someone with access to the network between the end user and your site could be trying to intercept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site pages themselves ( e.g. changing your forms to submit the data to them instead of to you ) . - This is a man-in-the-middle who is eavesdropping , and it is trivial to do without SSL security. - Even with SSL security , it is easy to do if the man-in-the-middle can present the end user with an SSL Certificate for your domain name that they trust and which looks good ( i.e. like a forged I 'd card ) . <p> The users could be visiting another web site that is pretending to be yours ( i.e. it looks just like yours ) . - This " phishing " web site could be trying to collect information from your users for their own purposes. - Unless your users can identify that this site is not legitimate , they could easily be duped into revealing user names , passwords , and personal information. - How could they end up at a phishing web site like this ? - This can happen by , for example , clicking on a web site link emailed to them in a malicious email or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site address. - No site is immune from such attacks , but you can work to mitigate them . <p> So , how can your SSL Certificate help mitigate the possibility of eavesdropping , man-in-the-middle , and phishing ? <p> SSL Certificates are signed by a third-party authority , the so-called " Certificate Authority " . - This can be : <p> If you sign your own certificates , then your web site will generate trust warnings when anyone comes to visit it. - These can be made to " go away " on a per-visitor basis if the visitor chooses to permanently trust your self-signed certificate. - However , this is never recommended for a public web site as self-signed certificates provide no inherent trust that they are legitimate ( anyone can generate one and pose as your site ) , they look amateurish , and they are annoying to the end user. - Self-signed certificates should only be used in internal or test environments . <p> When ordering a certificate from a trusted third party authority ( e.g. Thawte or Verisign ) , there are various types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap ones merely send an email to your domain contact and if you can click on a link there you get the certificate . - These " domain validated " certificates are fine and provide great security ; however , as no humans are involved in the validation process , it may be easier for an attacker to get an illegitimate one of these certificates . <p> You can also order Extended Validation certificates . - They cost more because real people actually validate your organization and your ownership of the domain . - They make phone calls and ensure that everything looks right . - If you have one of these certificates , then the address bar of your browser turns green when visitors come there to indicate that " hey , this is a really trusted site ! " - If you want to maximize trust and make it very easy for your end users to identify your site as legitimate and to be able to easily tell if someone is trying to trick them with a fake certificate , you will want to use an Extended Validation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in terms of the security and trust that they provide. - See : Extended Validation ( EV ) SSL Certificates . <p> If that is outside of your budget , then you should still go with an SSL certificate from some trusted third party . <h> Securing your Web Form with SSL <p> Once your web site has an SSL Certificate and it has been installed by your web host , your web pages can be accessed with addresses that start with " https : // " instead of just " http : // " . - The " s " in " https " means " secure " . - Note : <p> When you are connected to a web page using a secure address like " https : //yourdomain.com " , the web browser will show a " lock " icon to let you know that the connection is secure . <p> Web pages that end in " . shtml " are not necessarily secure. - The " s " there means " server " ( i.e. server-parsed page ) and not " secure " . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a secure page , but " https : **27;30;TOOLONG " is a secure page . <p> In many- default web server configurations that have SSL enabled , you can access the same page both securely and insecurely. - I.e. both " http : **26;59;TOOLONG " and " https : **26;87;TOOLONG " work and show the form the only difference being the use of SSL or not . <p> So , let 's say that you have a web form located at " http : **26;115;TOOLONG " . - You have gotten an SSL Certificate and your web host has installed it. - Next you want to : <p> Make sure people connect securely to your form page <p> Make sure that no one can connect to your form page insecurely <p> These two goals might sound the same , but they are not . <h> Make sure people connect securely to your form page <p> Since your regular web site pages are probably insecure , you need to make sure that the links to your secure form page are absolute links starting with the prefix " https : // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links will be taken to your form page on a secure connection . <p> Wrong Links : Relative links are not recommended because , if the user is on an insecure page of your site , relative links will always take them to insecure versions of the destination page. - So relative links like the following should be avoided : <p> &lt;A href= " /form.html " &gt;Fill out my form ! &lt;/a&gt; <p> &lt;a href= " form.html " &gt;Fill out my form ! &lt;/a&gt; <p> Correct Links : Absolute links will ensure a secure connection by specifying that SSL must be used via the link prefix " https : // " . - For example : <p> &lt;a LONG ... out my form ! &lt;/a&gt; <p> Be sure that ALL links to all secure pages of your site use this secure format with the " https : // " prefix . <p> Side Note : These days , it is recommended that you use SSL for ALL pages of your web site , not just the " important ones " . - This is good for user trust , security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Search Engine Optimization ( as Google will reward you for securing your site ) . - If you have set up your site so all pages are secure , always , then relative links are safe- once more . <h> Make sure that no one can connect to your form page insecurely <p> So , now all of the links on your site will take your users to the proper secure version of your form. - However , as mentioned before , most web hosts leave the insecure version of the form there and can still be accessed by users if they enter the insecure address directly ( or if you missed some of the links in your updates ) . - As a next step , you should ensure that it is not possible to access the form page via an insecure connection. - This is locking down or enforcing the use of SSL for this page . <p> There are several different ways that this can be done. - Some of these include : <p> Separate space for SSL pages : If your web host has this feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages for secure ( SSL ) connections are stored in a different directory from those for insecure pages. - If you enable this feature , you would put your form page and any other secure pages in the secure directory and make sure that there are not any copies of these pages in the insecure directory. - Thus , any insecure requests for these pages would result in a " page not found " error. - You could , then , implement some server-side redirection rules where if someone does request the insecure page , they are automatically redirected to the secure version ( this can be done using . htaccess files and the " Redirect " directive ) . - If you did this , then secure AND insecure requests for the page would take the user to the secure version with no errors , warnings or issues for the end user . <p> Scripted pages : If your form page is generated by a server-side script ( i.e. PHP , Perl , Python , or JAVA ) , then your script itself can look and see if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the server environment variables ) . - For secure requests , it can render the form as usual. - For insecure requests , it can either give the user an error or redirect the user seamlessly to the proper secure location . <p> Securing all pages : ( Recommended ) You can configure your site so that all requests for insecure pages are automatically redirected to the respective secure page . - In this way , all pages will be secure and any accidental / incorrect requests for the insecure pages will still get people to the right place . - If you have set this up pervasively for your site , then security is greatly improved . <h> If my form is posting securely to a secure form processing script , then why does the form itself need to be secured ? <p> This question is usually asked when the form processing is managed by a third party- is securing the form itself with SSL needed ? <p> E.g. - does the web site owner need to undergo the time and money cost of actually getting an SSL Certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the following facts : <p> The data sent from your end users to the server will be secure and encrypted during transmission. - This is critical- for some applications , such as HIPAA compliance . <p> The form itself will be sent to the end user unencrypted. - If there is nothing sensitive in the form itself , this may be OK but is risky . <p> End users who are non-technical will have no way of knowing if their data will be submitted securely until they actually try it . Many end users will not want to submit their data to an insecure form on your site for this reason . <p> End users have no way of knowing if they are viewing your site , or a phishing site , or if there is eavesdropping and modification going on. - Many users will not trust the connection and will not want to submit their data through your site . <p> If your form page is insecure , it is very easy for any malicious party to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to eavesdrop on connections , to modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the data is sent , and to set up phishing sites. - It is impossible for your end users to tell if this is going on . <p> If you do not SSL-secure your web form itself , you make it very vulnerable to attack and provide no way for your end users to trust your site. - If there is nothing untoward going on , you do have transmission security to rely on ; however , that minimal level of security is not recommended for production web sites or anywhere that compliance is required . <h> Other Aspects of Web Forms Security <p> Proper use and locking down of the SSL connection for encryption and trust is only part of web form security. - There are many other aspects that you must be concerned with in order to protect your users , your application , and your companys reputation. - These include ( but are not limited to ) : <p> Cross Site Scripting ( XSS ) . - If you include dynamic content on your web pages ( i.e. things submitted by other users or content submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such things as JavaScript and HTML , then it is possible that people could make arbitrary content appear on your web site , capture data from your users , and worse . - - All data displayed should be cleaned of undesirable content ( script tags , special characters , HTML , and other things ) . - This is one of the biggest security issues with dynamic web pages across the internet . <p> Secure Server-Side Programming : The scripts and programs that accept and process the data from your form must be created with security in mind. - They must validate all submitted data as needed , not making any assumptions about its format and content. - They must not provide avenues for attack such as " SQL Injection " and use of submitted content as actual file names or URLs for loading remote content. - They should log any strange errors or problems for later analysis. - They should provide a mechanism , if possible , for blocking undesirable actions or users from using the scripts . <p> Validation : Validation of all input data is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it is so essential , that we will repeat it and go over some of the fundamental points : <p> If you validate submitted content , always perform your validation on the server side. - Even if you use JavaScript to validate the data on the client side , you should always re-validate on the server side . Why ? Because people can get around your JavaScript and submit arbitrary content directly to your scripts the scripts- should be able to handle that . <p> Always de-taint submitted data. - What does that mean ? - It means to never trust the submitted data and to take pains to ensure that the submitted data matches what you expect. - For example , if you have a select list that sends your script a number as the value , do not assume that you are actually getting a number ! - Instead , check that it really is a numeric value or convert whatever is submitted into a number . <p> Remove disallowed content from text submitted by users. - I.e. special characters , embedded codes and other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for and removed or blocked . <p> Make sure the submitted data is not " too big " to be used . <p> Do not assume anything program defensively . <p> Preserving State with Hidden Form Fields or Cookies : If your program remembers things from one page to another by saving the data in hidden form fields , then your program must also make sure that the content of those fields was not tampered with ! - One good way to do this is to make a hash of all the data , together with a secret value , and to include that hash in the form data as well. - Then , when the form is submitted , you can recompute the hash and compare it with what passed from the form. - If they match , you are OK ; if they do not , then the data has been tampered with. - No one can break this scheme without knowing your secret value or without breaking your hashing algorithm. - This method can also be used to validate data saved in cookies . - You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replay attacks . <p> Third-Party Applications : If you install programs from third parties on your web site , then you must take care that there are not any known security issues with these programs , and you must be sure to update these programs as soon as new versions are released. - If you let your web site languish with an older , vulnerable version of a program on it , it will become a target for hackers as they constantly search the Internet for such web sites. - Your site will likely be hacked in these cases , possibly causing loss of business , deactivation of your web site , and tarnishing of your web sites reputation. - Using a third-party application is quick and easy , but you need to make sure to pick a good one , and that places the burden of keeping it updated on you. - An exception is using a third-party application that is hosted by the third party itself. - In these cases , the third party ensures that the program is always updated with anything needed to address any security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not you. - If you choose a good , respectable vendor , then you should have no problems , E.g. see : WordPress for HIPAA and ePHI ? <p> All of these things , and more , are critical to the development of a secure web application . <h> Securing the Data After it Arrives <p> Ensuring that your users data is transmitted securely to your web server is certainly critical , as is ensuring that your application itself is secure and will not be hacked. - However , what happens to that data after your program receives it ? - Do you still need to protect it in any way ? - Does it need to remain encrypted ? - How do you access or receive the data ? - Many people forget that getting the data from the web server to them securely may require just as much preparation as getting it from their users in the first place ! <p> In the following subsections , we will look at three different ways of saving and retrieving your users data and see what is needed in each case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and then to being saved on disk and in backups. <h> 1 . Emailing the data to you <p> By far the most common action that data processing scripts do is email the submitted data to the web site owners email address. - The web site owner knows when there are new submissions just by checking his/her email and can access the data immediately there. - As most people running web sites checks their email fairly often , this integrates well with their business operations . <p> However , the standard ways of sending email are completely insecure . To understand why , see The Case For Email Security. - So , what can be done to still use email , but ensure that the data is secure and viewable only by the intended viewers ? <p> Have your web site script encrypt the data <p> Send this encrypted data ( or a link to download the encrypted data ) to the intended viewers via regular email . <p> As the form data is encrypted within the email message , most insecurities inherent in email are obviated. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web site owners like to have the submitted form data saved in a database ( even if it is also being emailed to them ) . - Why ? <p> The data is saved online and potentially accessible from anywhere <p> If the emailed copies of the data are lost , the copies in the database are still there <p> The data in the database can be accessed through a web browser if there is a suitable user interface <p> The data is presumably backed up for you <p> Ok , so if storage in an online database is for you , then you need to : <p> Optionally use some kind of encryption , like SSL or PGP , to ensure that the data is stored in the database in an encrypted manner. - - Why ? - The contents of database tables are not encrypted or secure in general. - Storing unencrypted data- makes that data available to anyone else with access to the database or its backups.See : Encryption and Auditing of MySQL Databases for HIPAA . <p> Provide a user interface that allows you to access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have strong access controls , and should provide a means for decrypting the encrypted data for you . <p> If you are really interested in security , the database option actually requires quite a lot of work or cost to make a solution that is secure and usable. - For this reason , most small organizations do not end up using secure database storage for important form data . <h> 3 . Saving the data in files <p> The file storage option is the " quick and dirty " alternative to secure database storage. - Essentially , your program will : <p> Make a file containing all of the form data <p> Encrypt that file using PGP or SSL <p> Save that encrypted file in a directory on the web server that is not accessible from the web site or save it in an online file sharing service . <p> Then , the web site owners can login to the web server using Secure FTP and download these files as needed. - They can be decrypted locally when the data must be accessed . - Or , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share , other simpler mechanisms for accessing the data are available . <p> This solution is secure and provides a good backup to securely emailed data . <h> How Secure is Your Web Host ? <p> The choice of web hosting provider and environment is critical for the security of your web site application . <p> A web hosting provider that does not specialize in security will likely not have an especially secure infrastructure , and the software they use is more likely to have unpatched vulnerabilities. - This will result in your web site being significantly less secure . <p> If your web hosting provider does not have good security and privacy policies or is generally not well trusted in terms of the sanctity of your data , you may have a problem. - System administrators and technical support staff at the provider can access your web site application and raw data. - If the data is not encrypted , they can read and copy it. - They can modify the application to capture and store information. - Do you have a good sense that this will not happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server ? - If you are on a shared web server and another web site on that server or the server itself is compromised , then your web site and data could also be compromised ( depending on the nature of the issue ) . - If you can afford it , dedicated servers and virtual private servers provide your site with a much higher level of security than a shared hosting account will offer . <h> Other Technical Security Tips <p> There are many , many other considerations in developing and maintaining a production secure web site. - It would be impossible to cover or even list them all here. - However , here are some more interesting and useful tips . <h> Use Secure Cookies <p> If your secure site is using cookies for anything , be sure to set the " secure " cookie flag ( and the " httpOnly " flag ) . - This will ensure that these cookies are never sent insecurely over the Internet when the visitor arrives at any insecure pages of your web site ( they are not sent at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contents of these secure cookies . <h> Prevent Form Spam <p> Form spam occurs when automated programs find your web forms and try to submit data through them so as to send you spam. - Form spam can result in hundreds or thousands of useless form posts each day. - - Once you start getting form spam , stopping it will be your desperate goal. - There are two primary ways : <p> CAPTCHA This method requires end users to read text embedded in an image and type that text successfully into a form field. - This is then validated by the back-end program. - Since most spam programs can not read text embedded in images , it will successfully block almost all automated form spam. - However , CAPTCHA does require that the users perform one more step and can be a little annoying . <p> JavaScript and Cookies Most automated form spam programs can not process JavaScript or use cookies. - If your web form requires JavaScript to successfully submit the form , the form bots will not be able to do this and most form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little less reliable than CAPTCHA ; however , it does not require any extra work on the part of the end user. - Note that if you wish to use the JavaScript method , you must be sure that arbitrary submissions to the default action URL of your forms will never succeed only submissions made after the execution of your custom JavaScript should succeed . <h> Minimize the Need for Trust <p> A good rule of thumb is to minimize the need to trust third parties , and to trust only the trustworthy . <p> If you do not trust your internal IT staff , do not host your web application on your own servers or give them access to the server used . <p> If you do not fully trust the third party hosting your web site , be sure to encrypt the form data as soon as possible. - This helps ensure that the data is not saved anywhere in plain text and also is not backed up in plain text , thus minimizing your exposure to nosy people at the web hosting provider. - Further , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data are NOT stored on the web hosts servers , if possible , so that they can not decrypt the data themselves ( and so no hacker who has broken into their systems can do so ) . <p> Ensure that only authorized staff can access the submitted form data. - Ideally , it should always be encrypted and only authorized people should have the capability to decrypt it . <p> These are just a few obvious points. - As you evaluate your web application itself and the flow of data , ask yourself " who can access the raw data and how " at each stage. - Are there stages where you are trusting people who should not be trusted ? Are you using " security by obscurity " ? - If so , re-evaluate . <h> Forced use of strong encryption in SSL <p> The strength of encryption used by SSL is a function of both the users web browser and the server. - Even if your web server supports very good encryption , like AES256 , the browser may choose a weaker level of encryption so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for choosing weaker encryption in the interest of speed . <h> Use OpenID and/or Two Factor Authentication <p> If your web site uses logins to access " members areas " , you can support OpenID so that your users can use very secure methods to login to your site , such as smart cards and biometrics , without you needing to do anything special to support these access methods explicitly. - Your users , if they use OpenID and are security conscious , can lock down their access to your site themselves. - OpenID also provides a single sign on across multiple sites for your users making use of your site easier . For example , see Extreme WebMail Login Security with OpenID . <p> Two factor authentication is almost standard on very secure sites now . - It means that you require both a password and something else ( e.g. a token texted to the persons phone ) to validate their identity . - Without both , the user can not login. - See DuoSecurity for a good solution that is free for small web sites . <h> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your form processing is the fastest and most cost effective solution ?

<h> The Forgery : Received . <p> The forged email from Bank of America was based on a legitimate email message , so that the forgery could look as close as possible to actual email from them . <p> In truth , the majority of forged email simply changes the " From " address and does not bother with anything else . - These forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough people to be worth it , through numbers . - What we are looking at here is a more carefully crafted message designed to fool filters and a careful eye . - These kinds of fakes might be used in spear phishing attacks on an individual or in more sophisticated Spam campaigns . <p> The the forged Bank of America email that arrived in the recipients mail box looked like this ( the raw headers ) : <h> Analyzing the Forgery <p> We have color coded the headers from the received forgery to help us visually see where the- parts came from : <p> The BLACK lines were provided by the hacker. - These could contain anything and can not be trusted . - E.g. headers like " From " , " Reply-To " , " Subject " , " Message-ID " , " date " , " Return-Path " and even all " Received " headers added before the message arrived at your inbound email servers are completely suspect . <p> The BLUE lines were added by the LuxSci inbound email processing servers ( and are analogous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system ) . - These include : additional " Received " lines , tracking lines , Spam filtering results lines , etc. - A clever hacker may try to inject additional header lines that look like ones that your mailing system would normally add ( e.g. Spam Filtering success headers , etc . ) <p> The RED lines are more subtle efforts at forgery ; we will look at these next . <h> Subtle Forgery : Trying to Fake the Mail Delivery Path <p> First , you must understand that the " Received " lines are added by all servers and interactions in the path sending , processing , and delivering a message . - They are important for identifying what servers touched the message when and how ( e.g. was TLS used ? - Who was it for ? etc. ) - As each new server in the mail delivery pathway " does its thing , " it adds more Received headers on ( to the top of the message ) , leaving any existing ones " as is " . <p> There is no way to know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are legitimate or not . <p> In this example , the hacker added a FAKE received line that was poached from a real message from Bank of America ( with slight tweaks to make it not identical ) . <p> The purpose of this FAKE Received line is to make everyone believe that the message originated from the real Bank of America server " **30;143;TOOLONG " . - Indeed , this header looks exactly like a legitimate one there is no way for the recipient to differentiate . <p> The next header that has red is the one that records the receipt of this message by the recipients server from the hacker. - E.g. the first Received header the recipients servers added themselves and the first one that we can be sure is not lying . - It says : <p> The message was for- testuser@luxsci.net ( based on the " envelope to " the recipient address specified in the SMTP dialog which could be different from the " To " and " Cc " addresses in the headers ) . <p> The I 'd code - t15FVnRD023664 was assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received on : - Thu , 5 Feb 2015 15:32:39 GMT <p> A computer at IP Address - 71.174.64.40 ( which appears to have the name ( based on reverse DNS ) - **43;175;TOOLONG delivered the message TO rs302.luxsci.com <p> That computer said its name was- **25;220;TOOLONG <p> Everything here is real and verifiable except for the name that the hackers computer was pretending to be ( in the HELO or EHLO SMTP command ) . - In this case , s/he was still pretending to be Bank of America the same server as that in the FAKE Received header . <p> However , the hacker can not forge the IP address that s/he is coming from . - In this case that IP address , - 71.174.64.40 , appears to be used by a Verizon FIOS customer ( it was mime at the time , actually , because I did that test ) . - This is clearly NOT this IP address of- **25;247;TOOLONG . <p> In fact , this is the only part of the headers in the received , forged email message that one can point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't  really give us a lot to work with ! <h> You Ca n't Forge The Senders IP Address <p> Unless the hacker has infiltrated Bank of Americas servers , s/he can not send a forged email message that actually comes from any of Bank of Americas servers IP Addresses . - We can always identify the IP Address of the server delivering an email message . - Everything else in the headers can be fabricated , replayed , and look completely legitimate ( at least to the degree that the hacker did his/her homework ) . <h> What are Your Defenses ? <p> In the next article , we will look at SPF ( Sender Policy Framework ) to see how it is used to combat forged email by allowing domain owners to specify what servers are allowed to send email on their behalf . - Well also look at the limitations of SPF and how those can allow forged email to slip through anyway . - Well follow that with an analysis of further escalations- to the war against forged email ( e.g. DKIM , DMARC , other encryption methods , and closed systems ) .

@@22227173 @2227173/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> Tracing the Origin of an Email Message and Hiding it <p> Published : March 17th , 2015 <p> We are often asked by our users to help- them determine from where an email message has originated . " Where did this spam come from ? " <p> In general , it is fairly easy to do this if you have access to the " headers " of the message. - In this post , we will show you how to determine a messages original location yourself and also how you can protect yourself from others determining your location when you send email messages to them . <p> Why would you need to protect yourself If you are traveling and do not want people to know where you are ; if your messages are not going through because your ISP is blacklisted or has a poor reputation . <p> Here are the headers of a Spam message that LuxSci Support received. - Well look at these and see where the message came from ( we have removed some data from these headers so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get the Internet ( IP ) address of the sender of the message. - To do this we note a few facts : <p> Each server that accepts the email message adds a " Received " header to the message. - In this header , the server records the IP address of the server from which it received the message ( we have colored these red ) . <p> The " Received " headers are added to the top of the message each time. - I.e. the " oldest " " Received " headers are at the bottom of the list of all " Received " headers . <p> It is possible , though not common , for the sender to add forged " Received " headers to the end of the list of headers . <p> So , in the best case scenario where there are no forged " Received " headers ( as in the above message ) , we look at the last " Received " header in the list : <p> Next , we take this IP address to a web site like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see where it is located. - In this case , we see that the Spam came from Tulcea , Romania ! - We see also that the IP address is owned by " RIPE.net " of Amsterdam and we can send abuse complaints to " abuse@ripe.net " . <p> It is possible with more detailed IP address databases ( paid ones for example ) , to narrow down the location of the IP to the region , city , or even approximate physical address of the user. - I.e. if you send an email and say you are in Paris now people can check and see if that is true . <h> What about if there are forged Received lines ? <p> If you suspect that there are forged " Received " lines ( or if the 1st Received lines do not have useful public IP addresses listed ) , then you have to work a little harder. - You need to go into the list of " Received " lines and find the oldest one that corresponds to a server that you trust is real. - I.e. the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real server which will record a real " Received " line ( e.g. your own email server ) . - We do this by starting at the top , first reviewing the received lines added by your own organizations mail servers , and working your way down though servers that you recognize ( you will need to know what servers are used in your network ) . - The " Received " line added by the last one that you recognize may be the last trustable one . <h> Hiding your location from message recipients <p> OK , so now that you know how easy it is to find out the approximate location of the sender of an email message , the natural question is " how can I hide my own location ? " <p> The simplest thing to do is to use a web-based ( WebMail ) email interface. - Messages sent from these interfaces are sent from the providers mail servers and not from your local machine. - While the email provider may record your actual IP address for auditing purposes , this information will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Received " headers of the message. - As a result , your recipients will only be able to track the message back to your email providers mail servers and not to you . <p> If you are not sure about your WebMail provider , send yourself an email message and see what is in your Received lines . - Compare this to your own current physical IP address ( see- www.whatismyip.com ) . <p> If you need to send messages using an email program , like Outlook or Thunderbird , then you need an SMTP service that is able to " anonymize " your outgoing message. - I.e. the service needs to be able to " scrub " the message of all information identifying your location and resend the message in a way that permits the recipients to only track it back to the services mail servers ( like in the WebMail case ) . <p> LuxScis anonymous SMTP email service offers this option for no additional cost ; it is included as a feature with all email marketing and email hosting accounts . 
@@22227174 @2227174/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> How Can You Tell if an Email Was Transmitted Using TLS Encryption ? <p> Published : August 19th , 2013 <p> Frequently , we are asked to verify if an email that someone sent or received was encrypted using SMTP TLS while being transmitted over the Internet. - For example , banks , health care organizations under HIPAA , and other security-aware institutions have a requirement that email be secured at least by TLS encryption from sender to recipient . <p> This can and should be locked down to ensure that the email message content can not be eavesdropped upon. - This check , to see if a message was sent securely , is fairly easy to do by looking the the raw headers of the email message in question. - However , it requires some knowledge and experience. - It is actually easier to tell if a recipients server supports TLS than to tell if a particular message was securely transmitted . <p> To see how to analyze a message for its transmission security , we will look at an example email message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not use TLS when sending this message . - Hotmail is not a good provider to use when security or privacy is required . - Even Gmail does not provide a level of security and privacy required for HIPAA compliance . <h> An Example Email Message <p> First , we must understand that an email message typically passes through several machines on its way from sender to recipient. - Roughly speaking : <p> The senders computer talks to the senders email or WebMail server to upload the message . <p> The senders email or WebMail server then talks to the recipients inbound email server and transmits the message to them . <p> Finally , the recipient downloads the message from his/her email server . <p> ( for more details , see this article ) It is step 2 that people are most concerned about ; they usually assume or check that everything is secure and OK at the two ends. - Indeed , most users who need to can take steps to ensure that they are using SSL-enabled WebMail or POP/IMAP/SMTP/Exchange services so that steps 1 and 3 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is transmitted between two different providers , - is where most messages are insecurely transmitted . <p> In order to determine if the message was transmitted between the senders and recipients servers securely ( over TLS ) , we need to extract the " Received " header lines from the received email message. - If you look at the " source " of the email message , these are all the lines at the top that start with " Received : " . - In an example email message from someone on Hotmail , the Received headers look like this ( I replaced the email addresses , IPs and such with fake ones for obvious reasons ) : <h> What do These Received Headers Say ? <p> They are in reverse chronological order. - The first one listed shows the last server that touched the message ; the last one is the first server that touched it . <p> Each Received line documents what a server did and when . <p> There are three sets of servers involved in this example : one machine at Hotmail , one machine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some machines at LuxSci where final acceptance of the message and subsequent delivery happened . <p> Presumably , the processing of email within each provider is secure ( though maybe that is too presumptuous for many providers it is true of LuxSci ) . - So , what you really have to watch out for are the hand-offs between Hotmail and McAfee and between McAfee and LuxSci as these are the big hops across the Internet between providers . <p> In the line where LuxSci accepts the message from McAfee , we see : <p> ( version=TLSv1/SSLv3- **26;274;TOOLONG bits=256 verify=NOT ) <p> This section , which is typical of most email servers running " sendmail " that have TLS support , indicates that the message was encrypted during transport with TLS using 256-bit AES encryption . ( " Verify=not " means that LuxSci did not ask McAfee for a second SSL client certificate to verify itself , as that is not usually needed or required for SMTP TLS to work properly ) . <p> So , the hop between McAfee and LuxSci was locked down and secure. - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAfee servers Received line makes no note of security at all ! - This means that the message was probably NOT encrypted during this step. - Whose fault is that ? - Well , at the time of this example , either Hotmail did not support opportunistic TLS encryption for outbound email , OR - McAfee did not support receipt of messages over TLS and thus TLS could not be used . without further context you would not know which server ( or both ) did not support - TLS . <p> We know for a fact that McAfee , like LuxSci , supports inbound TLS encryption. - In fact , from another example message that we have , where LuxSci itself was sending a message to McAfee , we see the Received line : <p> It is apparent that the message was indeed encrypted. - However , unlike LuxSci , McAfee does not record what kind of encryption was used , just that it was " over a TLS secured channel " . <h> Some things to consider when making your own analysis of email headers for encryption usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message headers what kind of encryption , if any , was used in the receipt of the message . <p> Different email servers use different formats and syntax to display what kind , if any , encryption was used in the receipt of the message. - You should look for keywords like " SSL " , " TLS " , " Encryption " , etc. , which will signify this information . <p> Not all servers will record the use of encryption there is nothing that says that they have to encrypt email. - I.e. , while LuxSci has always logged encryption use , - McAfee has only been logging this since 2008 . Prior to that time , TLS encryption was still possible and normal with their servers , but there was no way to tell from the headers if it was in fact used . <p> Messages passed between servers at the same provider do not necessarily need TLS encryption to be secure. - For example , LuxSci has back-channel private network connections between its servers so that information can pass between them unencrypted but not subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and more efficient than using TLS on every connection. - So , the lack of TLS usage between two servers does not mean that the transmission between them was " insecure " per-se . <p> If you are a LuxSci customer , you can look at your online email deliver reports to see if TLS was used for any particular message and recipient that you have sent . - We record this fact in our delivery reports so there is no need to obtain and read messages headers . <p> With some servers not reporting use of TLS , and in some cases TLS not being needed , how can you really determine if a message was transmitted securely from sender to recipient ? <p> You really have to understand the properties , servers and networks involved in order to answer this question accurately. - While you may be able to answer in the affirmative , based on headers , in some cases , you can not necessarily answer in the negative without knowing what things are recorded by each systems servers . In our example of a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> McAfee and LuxSci will always log use of TLS in the headers this tells us that the Hotmail to McAfee hop was not secure as nothing is recorded there . <p> Transmission of messages within LuxScis infrastructure is secure due to private back channel transmissions. - So , even though there is no mention of TLS in every Received line after LuxSci accepts the message from McAfee ( in this example ) , the transfer of the messages between servers in LuxSci is effectively as secure as using TLS. - Also , multiple received lines can be added by the " same server " as it talks to itself . - Generally , these hand offs on the same server will not use TLS , as there is no need . - We see this also in the LuxSci example , as " abc.luxsci.com " adds several headers . <p> We do n't  know anything about Hotmails email servers and so do n't  know how secure the initial transmissions within their network are. - However , since we do know that they did not transmit the message to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have much confidence that the transmissions and processing within Hotmail ( which may have gone unrecorded ) were secure at all . <h> What about the initial sending and receipt of the message ? <p> So , we skipped steps 1 and 3 and focused on step 2 the transmission between servers. - Steps 1 and 3 are equally if not more important. - Why ? - Because eavesdropping on the Internet between ISPs is less of a problem than eavesdropping near the sender and recipient ( i.e. in their workplace or local wireless hotspot ) . - So , one must take care that messages are sent securely and received securely. - This means : <p> Sending : Use SMTP over SSL or TLS when sending from an email client or use WebMail over a secure connection ( SSL / HTTPS ) . <p> Receiving : Be sure that your POP or IMAP connection is secured via SSL or TLS ; If using WebMail to read your email , be sure it is over a secure connection ( SSL / HTTPS ) . <p> WebMail : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a message sent using WebMail was transmitted from the end user to WebMail over a secure connection ( SSL- / HTTPS ) . <p> You can generally control one side and make sure that it is secure ; you generally ca n't control the other without taking extra steps. - So , what can you do to ensure that your message is secure even if it might not be transmitted securely and if your recipient might try to access it insecurely ? <p> You could use end-to-end email encryption ( like PGP or S/MIME which are included in SecureLine ) or a secure email pickup service like SecureLine Escrow that does n't  require the recipient to have to install or setup anything in order to get your secure email message. - These all meet the security requirements of HIPAA , and organizations that mandate email transmission encryption . <p> Of course , if you can ensure that the email sent from you to your important recipients will always be transmitted securely , that is the best solution . <p> accounts that enable " TLS Only " can have their outbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose email services support it. - This mitigates the need for using PGP , S/MIME , or <p> The only way to see if TLS is broken is to simulate an SMTP transmission using TLS . If your simulation gets through the STARTTLS command OK and can issue other commands , then their TLS is in good shape . 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

For example , did you know that messages which you thought were deleted years ago may be sitting on servers half-way around the world ? Or that your messages can be read and modified in transit , even before they reach their destination ? Or even that the username and password that you use to login to your email servers can be stolen and used by hackers ? <p> This article is designed to teach you about how email really works , what the real security issues are , what solutions exist , and how you can avoid security risks . <p> Information security and integrity are centrally important - as we use email for personal and business communication : sending confidential and sensitive information over this medium every day . While you are reading this article , imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and your identity . if they have not already . <h> Section 2 : How Email Works <p> This section describes the general mechanisms and paths taken by an email message on its route from sender to recipient . This should give you an overview of the different protocols ( languages ) involved , the different types of servers involved , and the distributed nature of email networks . The examples I present are representative of many common email solutions , but are by no means exhaustive . <p> Sending an Email Message <p> Sending an email message is like sending a postal letter . When sending a letter , you drop it off at your local post office . The local post office looks at the address and figures out which regional post office the letter should be forwarded to . Then , the regional post office looks at the address and figures out which local post office is closest to your recipient . Finally , the recipients local post office delivers your letter to its recipient . Computers are like " post offices " , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " procedure " which an " email post office " uses to figure out where to send the letter next ( e.g. the " next hop " ) . Any program that sends an email message uses SMTP to deliver that message to the next " post office " for " relaying " it to its final destination . <p> Most people send mail in one of two ways with a web-based interface like Gmail , Outlook Web Access , or LuxSci WebMail , or with an " email client " program like Outlook , - Thunderbird , iPhone Mail , Android , - or Mac Mail . <p> When you send a message with an email program on your personal computer ( or your phone or tablet ) , you have to specify an " SMTP server " so that your email program knows where to send the message . This SMTP server is like your local post office . Your email program talks directly to the server using the computer protocol ( language ) known as SMTP . This is like dropping off a letter at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your personal computer uses an Internet connection to communicate with a web server . The " language " that the internet connection uses is HTTP " HyperText Transfer Protocol " . When you send your message with WebMail , the web server itself takes care of contacting an SMTP server and delivering your message to it . <p> When an SMTP Server receives an email message , it first checks if an account for the message recipient is configured on the server itself . If there is such an account , the server will drop the message in that persons Inbox ( or follow other more complex user-defined rules ) . - If there is no local account for that recipient , the server - must " relay " the email message to another SMTP server closer to the recipient . This is analogous to how your local post office forwards your letter to a regional post office unless it is for someone served by the post office itself . - ( Post offices do n't  actually work this way in general , but the concept is easily understood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMTP relaying " . <p> How does your SMTP Server know where to relay the message to ? <p> If the recipients email address is " bob@luxsci.net " , then the recipients domain name is " luxsci.net " . Part of the " DNS settings " for the recipients domain ( these are the " mail exchange " or MX records for the domain ; see also Understanding Domain Name Service ( DNS ) ) includes a list of SMTP Servers that should be able to accept- email for this recipient . Multiple servers can be listed and they can be ranked in terms of " priority " . - The highest priority SMTP Server listed is the recipients actual/main inbound SMTP Server ; the others are " backup inbound SMTP Servers " . These backup servers may merely either queue email for later delivery to the recipients actual SMTP Server or may perform the same real-time delivery actions as the main SMTP server ( e.g. they are there for redundancy ) . <p> There are many scenarios that govern the path an email message may take from the senders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> The senders server successfully contacts the recipients server and sends the email message directly ( black line in the figure ) . <p> The senders server can not contact the recipients actual SMTP server ( maybe the recipients server is busy , down , or has some other connection problem ) . In this case the senders server tries to contact and deliver the message to the recipients first backup server . <p> The senders server can not contact the recipients actual SMTP server or its first backup server . In this case the senders server tries to contact and deliver the message the recipients second backup server . <p> The senders server can not contact any of the recipients servers . In this case it will queue the message and try to send it later . It will keep retrying periodically for several days until it succeeds in sending or gives up . <p> Any message delivered to the backup servers which queue email could go through the same process of trying to contact the recipients main SMTP Server , or higher priority backup servers . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process the email themselves . ( Note that a recipient may have zero or more backup servers , not necessarily two as in this example ) . <p> Note : a senders and recipients email systems may have arbitrarily complex server configurations actually handling the delivery process performing operations such as : backups , filtering , forwarding , queueing , etc . Any number of servers may be involved and and number of copies or backups of messages may be made . <p> Once the email message arrives at the recipients SMTP Server and is finally delivered to the recipients email box , the recipient may pick up the message and read it whenever s/he chooses ( as discussed below ) . <p> Each server that receives your message adds its own " Received " stamp to the message headers . This stamp identifies what server received the message , at what time , and from what other server . This information allows the recipient to trace a messages entire journey . <p> The take away- from this discussion so far is that : <p> Most email servers communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will take an email message to get from sender to recipient because you do n't  know how busy the servers are , how much traffic there is on the Internet , what machines are down for maintenance , etc . <p> Your messages may sit in queues on any number of servers for any amount of time . Some of these servers may belong to third parties ( i.e. may not be under the purview of either the sender or the recipient , may be an external email filtering or archival organization , etc . ) . <p> When you receive an email message it sits in a file ( or database ) in your email server . If you wish to view this email message you must access this content . - Any computer wishing to access your email must speak one of the languages the email Server does . With some exceptions ( like MS Exchange and ActiveSync ) , there are really only main 2 languages that email servers understand ( for email retrieval , as opposed to email sending , for which they use SMTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protocol " ( IMAP ) and one is called the " Post Office Protocol " ( POP ) . ( We will not discuss the details of these here , but you may be interested in Understanding Email Services for information about them . ) <p> As a recipient , you can generally retrieve your email by either using a web-based interface known as " WebMail " , or via an " email client " program , such as Microsoft Outlook or iPhone Mail , running on your personal computer or device . The email client programs will talk directly to your email server and speak IMAP , POP , or something similar . With WebMail , your computer will talk to a WebMail server using a web connection ( speaking HTTP ) ; the WebMail server will , in turn , talk to your email server using POP or IMAP or something similar ( like a direct database connection ) . <p> The Lack of Security in Email <p> Email is inherently insecure . In the following sections , we will see just how insecure it is . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurity in the email delivery pathway just discussed : <p> WebMail : If the connection to your WebMail server is " insecure " ( i.e. the address is http : // and NOT https : // ) , then all information including your username and password is not encrypted as it passes between the WebMail server and your computer . <p> SMTP : SMTP does not encrypt messages ( unless the servers in question support SMTP TLS ) . - Communications between SMTP servers may send your messages in plain text for any eavesdropper to see . Additionally , if your email server requests that you send your username and password to " login " to the SMTP server in order to relay messages to other servers , then these may also sent in plain text , subject to eavesdropping . Finally , messages sent via SMTP include information about which computer they were sent from and what email program was used . This information , available to all recipients , may be a privacy concern . <p> POP and IMAP : The POP and IMAP protocols require that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not encrypted ( unless you are using an SSL-secured connection ) . So , your messages and credentials can be read by any eavesdropper listening to the flow of information between your personal computer and your email service providers computer . <p> BACKUPS : Email messages are generally stored on SMTP servers in plain , unencrypted text . Backups of the data on these servers may be made at any time and administrators can read any of the data on these machines . The email messages you send may be saved unexpectedly and indefinitely and may be read by unknown persons as a result . <p> These are just a few of the security problems inherent in email . In the next section , we will talk about communications security problems in general so we can see what else can go wrong . Later on , we will see how these problems can be solved . <h> Section 3 : Security Threats to Your Email Communications <p> This section describes many of the common security problems involved in communications and in email in particular . <p> Eavesdropping <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . It is very easy for someone who has access to the computers or networks through which your information is traveling to capture this information and read it . Just like someone in the next room listening in on your phone conversation , people using computers " near " the path your email takes through the Internet can potentially read and copy your messages . <p> Identity Theft <p> If someone can obtain the username and password that you use to access your email servers , they can read your email and send false email messages as you . Very often , these credentials can be obtained by eavesdropping on SMTP , POP , IMAP , or Webmail connections , by reading email messages in which you include this information , or through other means . <p> Invasion of Privacy <p> If you are very concerned about your privacy , then you should consider the possibility of " unprotected backups " , listed below . You may also be concerned about letting your recipients know the IP address of your computer . This information may be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out what your address is in some cases ! This is not usually an issue with WebMail , POP , or IMAP , but is an issue with the transport of email , securely or insecurely , from any email client over SMTP . <p> Message Modification <p> Anyone who has system administrator permission on any of the SMTP Servers that your message visits , can not only read your message , but they can delete or change the message before it continues on to its destination . Your recipient has no way to tell if the email message that you sent has been altered ! If the message was merely deleted they would n't even know it had been sent . <p> False Messages <p> It is very easy to construct messages that appear to be sent by someone else . Many viruses take advantage of this situation to propagate themselves . In general , there it is very hard to be sure that the apparent sender of a message is the true sender the senders name could have been easily fabricated . - See " Who stole my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message can be modified , messages can be saved , modified , and re-sent later ! You could receive a valid original message , but then receive subsequent faked messages that appear to be valid . <p> Unprotected Backups <p> Messages are usually stored in plain text on SMTP Servers . Thus , backups of these servers disks usually contains plain text copies of your messages . As backups may be kept for years and can be read by anyone with access to them , your messages could still be exposed in insecure places even after you think that all copies have been " deleted " . <p> Repudiation <p> Because normal email messages can be forged , there is no way for you to prove that someone sent you a particular message . This means that even if someone DID send you a message , they can successfully deny it . This has implications with regards to using email for contracts , business communications , electronic commerce , etc. - See : DKIM : Fight Spam and Forged Email by Signing your Messages . <h> Section 4 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand how we can mitigate the security problems described in Sections 2 and 3 , a basic knowledge of the two main types of encryption will be very useful . This section presents these concepts in a simple , straightforward form . <p> Symmetric Encryption <p> In symmetric encryption , you and your friend share a " secret " key . Using this key , you can encrypt a message into " cyphertext " . Cyphertext looks like a random sequence of characters and is completely meaningless to anyone unless they also have the secret key , in which case they can decrypt the cyphertext back into the original message and read it . <p> Using symmetric key encryption , eavesdropping and unwanted backups of your messages no longer are a problem ( unless the eavesdropper knows what your secret key is ) . It also becomes harder for someone to modify your messages in transit in any kind of a meaningful way . <p> An example of a popular , excellent method used for symmetric encryption is AES-256 . <p> The problem with symmetric key encryption is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same secret key . Unless you meet in person , how do you communicate this key in a way that is secure ? What if you want to send a secure message to someone on the other side of the world ? How do you get them the secret key quickly in a way that eavesdroppers cant detect ? <p> Message Digests / Authentication Codes <p> A " Message Digest " or " Message Authentication Code " is really a very simple concept . You take your message and pass it through an algorithm that spits out a relatively short sequence of characters ( maybe 128 or 256 or so of them ) . This sequence of characters is a " fingerprint " of the message . Any minute change in the message would produce a significantly different " fingerprint " . There is no way to " reverse engineer " the original message from its fingerprint and it is almost " impossible " ( assuming that your method of making these fingerprints is sufficiently " good " ) to find two messages that yield the same fingerprint ( just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same fingerprint ) . <p> Message Digests are quick ways to check to see if a message has been altered . If you have a digest of the original message and compare it with a digest of the message you just received and they match , then you know that the message is- unaltered . <p> Asymmetric Encryption <p> In asymmetric encryption , also known as " public key " encryption , each person has TWO keys . Any cyphertext created using one of the keys can ONLY be decrypted using the other key . For example , say you have keys " K1 " and " K2 " . If you encrypt your message with K1 , then ONLY K2 can be used to decrypt it . Similarly , if you encrypt using K2 , ONLY K1 can be used to decrypt it . This is distinctly different from symmetric key encryption where you only have one key that performs both functions on the same message . <p> In asymmetric key encryption , the two keys that each person possesses are commonly named the " private " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published or given out freely to anyone who wants a copy and the " private " one is kept secret . The security of asymmetric key encryption depends only on whether you can keep your private key secret . <p> Asymmetric key encryption allows you to do many clever things : <p> Send an Encrypted Message : To send a secure message to someone , all you have to do is encrypt it with their public key ! Only the intended recipient who has the matching private key will be able to decrypt and read the message . This solves the problem of eavesdropping and the problem of sending secret keys that is inherent in symmetric key encryption . <p> Prove You Sent a Message : To prove to someone that you sent a message , you can encrypt the message ( or just a piece of it ) with your private key . Then , anyone can decrypt it with your public key and read the contents . The fact that your public key decrypts the message proves that only you could have sent it ( or someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A message signature proves that you sent the message AND allows the recipient to determine if the message was altered in transit . This is done by using your private key to encrypt a digest of a message at the time of sending . The recipient can decrypt this digest and compare it to a digest of the received message . If they match , then the message is unaltered and was sent by you . <p> Encrypted , Signed Messages : The most secure form of communication is to first add a signature to the message and then to encrypt the message plus signature with the recipients public key . This combines all of the benefits of all of the techniques : security against eavesdropping and unexpected storage , proof of sender , and proof on message integrity . <h> Section 5 : Securing Your Email With TLS <p> The easiest thing you can do to make your email more secure is to use an email provider that supports " Transport Layer Security " ( SSL / TLS ) for their Webmail , POP , IMAP , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and symmetric key encryption mechanisms . If you connect to a server using TLS , the following things happen ( roughly see a full discussion ) : <p> The server uses its private key to prove to you that it is in fact the server that you are trying to connect to . This let 's you know that you are not connecting to a " middleman " that is trying to intercept your communications . <p> You send the server your public key . <p> The server generates a " secret key " and sends it to you encrypted using your public key . <p> You and the server then communicate using symmetric key encryption using this shared secret key . ( Symmetric key encryption is faster than asymmetric key encryption ) . <p> The benefits of TLS- are twofold : 1 . you can determine if you are connecting to the right server , and 2. you and the server can communicate securely . <p> If you get any warning messages when connecting to a server using TLS , you should think twice about ignoring them . While your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the warning , these warnings can also indicate that your communications are being intercepted . These warnings usually indicate one of the following : <p> Some of the information in the certificate does n't  match the information you expect i.e. the certificate was issued for a different server name than the one you are trying to connect to . ( You could be inadvertently connecting to the wrong server . ) <p> The certificate was issued by an untrusted agency . <p> There is a " man in the middle " eavesdropping on your connection <p> SSL/TLS certificates are ( generally ) issued by third party agencies such as Thawte.com or VeriSign . These 3rd party companies do a background check on companies that request certificates , and only issue certificates if the companies have a right to them . The certificate includes the name of the company , the name of the issuing company , and the name of the server to which it is issued . When you connect to an SSL server you can verify this embedded information and the fact that it was issued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate is valid then you can have a high degree of confidence that the server you are connecting to is the server you want to reach . <p> By using TLS- for WebMail , POP , IMAP , and SMTP- - you ensure- that communications between your personal computer and your email service providers servers will be encrypted . Your message contents , username , and password will be hidden from eavesdroppers but only hidden from eavesdroppers between you and your service provider ! <p> TLS- services do not protect your messages once they arrive to your SMTP Server or when they leave your SMTP Server and head to their destinations ( unless your provider can and is using- SMTP TLS- to talk to the recipients SMTP server ) . - So , it does n't  generally- protect your message contents , but it does completely protect your username and password from detection . This is very important because it prevents identity theft , forged messages , etc . <p> TLS- is very easy to use . It usually only involves clicking a few checkboxes in the configuration of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use TLS- for these services even if your recipients can not or do not . These measures protect you and your password . We strongly encourage the use of TLS- for email communications ( and , really , any communications over the Internet ) whenever possible . <h> Section 6 : Privacy with Anonymous SMTP <p> In Sections 2 and 3 we wrote that when you send email via any email client ( not usually WebMail though some providers WebMail also does this ) , your computers Internet IP address is included in the message for all recipients to see . Depending your Internet Service Providers privacy standards and what kind of connection and service you have , this information may be used to determine what region or the country you are in , what city you are in , or even what your address is ! This could be a serious issue for people very concerned about their privacy . Additionally , other information such as what email program you are using is also visible to the recipient . <p> Anonymous SMTP services , or re-mailers , provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMTP that you require , while giving you back your privacy . These services typically receive your message via ( Authenticated ) SMTP ( ideally they would also support SMTP over TLS , as described above ) and then " scrub " the message , removing all information about your computers address , your email program , and any other non-standard information . These services then re-email your scrubbed message to the intended recipients . <p> The end result is that the recipients get the message just as they would have without the " Anonymous " service , except that they can only track the message back to your Anonymous SMTP server . They know who you are , based on your email address and your message content , but they have no way of knowing where you are or what email program you are using . <p> Most anonymous SMTP services log all information that they scrub out of messages and track all activity . So , while your recipients do not know where you are , your email service provider does . This prevents this type of service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forged email their service provider can quickly respond to complaints or abuse , identify the sender , and terminate the account and/or bring legal measures to bear . <p> What it does provide is a level of privacy in sending email that is functionally equivalent to the level of privacy you get from sending through a WebMail interface ( unless the WebMail in question makes it a point to add your computers address into the outgoing message most do not ) . <p> LuxSci offers Anonymous SMTP services to all clients who have SMTP Relaying services . This service is compatible with LuxScis SMTP over TLS- services as well and only requires changing the port you use to connect to LuxScis SMTP servers . <h> Section 7 : Asymmetric Key Encryption and Email ( PGP and S/MIME ) <p> While TLS- protects your password and your message contents to some extent , it does not solve any of the other problems we have discussed : repudiation , encryption , unwanted backups , message modification , etc . This is because TLS- only protects the message path as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between servers . - It does not protected messages while they are stored on disk or when transmitted between servers that do not both support TLS . <p> The ultimate solution is to use asymmetric key encryption to provide message signatures and/or encryption . This completely solves the issues of : <p> Eavesdropping ( everything is always encrypted ) <p> Message modification ( message digests are used ) <p> Message replay ( you can include a timestamp in the signature ) <p> Repudiation ( signatures allow proof of who sent the message ) <p> Unprotected backups ( everything is always encrypted ) <p> Asymmetric key encryption should be used in combination with SSL so that your username and password ( and messages headers such as the subject ) are also protected . Why ? These credentials are not part of the message body and thus would not be encrypted along with the message . <p> Fortunately ( or unfortunately ) , there are two widely used forms of asymmetric key encryption for email : S/MIME and PGP . Both allow you to add signatures and/or encryption to your messages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard email clients . S/MIME is built into most email programs , but you must obtain an S/MIME certificate from a third-party company such as Thawte.com- or LuxSci . <p> Interoperability Problems <p> PGP and S/MIME solve many problems , but they also create another : interoperability . One interoperability issue is that PGP and S/MIME are completely incompatible . If you are using PGP and your friend is using S/MIME , you will not be able to send each other secure messages . <p> That said , PGP has been an Internet standard ( OpenPGP RFC 2440 ) since 1997 and PGP-encrypted email accounts for a large fraction- of the current encrypted email traffic on the Internet . So , using PGP will make you compatible with many people . However , S/MIME is easier to use as it is installed ( free ) in most email programs and the distribution and management of certificates is often easier than with PGP. - It is useful to know that some email clients , such as Microsoft Outlook , can be configured to use BOTH PGP and S/MIME so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . <p> The other interoperability issue involves " key exchange " . If you want to send your friend an encrypted message , you first need his/her public key ; if your friend wants to prove that you signed a message or that the message that you sent him/her was unaltered , s/he first needs your public key . So there is the necessity of trading public keys before secure communication can begin . There are various ways to trade keys ( including email ) . PGP offers " key servers " from which your correspondents keys can be downloaded to make the process easier . However , not everyone has their PGP keys listed on a key server , let alone the same key server , and not everyone uses PGP , so the key exchange issue is still an impediment to sending secure messages especially if you have to send them quickly . <p> Keys are usually communicated ahead of time via email or key management is taken care of for you by your secure email service provider . <h> Section 8 : Compatible Security with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trusted " encryption middleman " to give you the almost same level of security offered by asymmetric key encryption , but with universal compatibility . Here is how it works : <p> The sender connects to the middlemans SMTP or WebMail portal on a secure TLS- connection <p> The middleman validates the sender . <p> The sender creates a message . <p> The message sender chooses some method for the recipients identity to be verified ( e.g. via a password , a question an answer , a login to a portal , etc . ) <p> The middleman encrypts the message ( e.g. using AES256 ) and stores it on his server . <p> The middleman sends a plain text message to the recipient that contains only a secure link to the middlemans web- portal , and a unique message password that is part of the encryption key . The middleman then forgets this password so that he can not decrypt the message until he gets the password back from the recipient . <p> The recipient connects to the middlemans web portal over a secure TLS- connection and logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The middleman decrypts the message and presents it to the recipient . <p> The encryption middleman handles all the encryption dirty work ; it does n't  matter if the sender uses PGP and the recipient uses S/MIME . In fact , it does n't  matter if either uses encryption at all ! All that the sender and recipient need is a web browser and regular email service . The middleman takes care of everything else . <p> How does it solve the security problems we mentioned earlier ? <p> Eavesdropping : No one can eavesdrop on the message because the sender and recipient connect to the middleman on a secure TLS- connection . <p> Identity Theft : No one can steal the senders login information or the recipients verification information because both the sender and the recipient use TLS- connections . <p> Invasion of Privacy : The recipient knows nothing about the senders computer , email client , or location . She only knows that he used the middleman . <p> Message Modification : No one can modify the message because it never leaves the middlemans server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ False Messages : The message is only accessed on the middlemans server , so no one else can pretend to send it . <p> Message Replay : No one can re-send the message because it never leaves the middlemans server . <p> Unprotected Backups : The message is encrypted when it is stored , so it is secure even in backups . <p> Repudiation : The recipient knows that the sender really did send the message because he was validated by the middleman and because digital signatures are used . <p> In addition , the middleman can keep a log of who accesses the message and at what times . Thus the sender can audit the message to see who has viewed it . <p> Notice that the message is secure and anonymous : the message is encrypted and stored on the middlemans servers , so it is not subject to the security of intermediate relaying servers . Only the middleman can encrypt and decrypt the message , and only authorized recipients can access the message . The recipient knows nothing about the senders computer , only that he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the message is completely secure , completely anonymous , and completely compatible . <p> LuxScis SecureLine service provides complete provides " Escrow " encryption as a form of " Secure Message Pickup " along with options for PGP , S/MIME , and TLS . <h> Section 9 : SMTP TLS <p> There is a growing trend for SMTP Servers to support " opportunistic TLS . " If the sending server and the recipient serer both support opportunistic TLS , then they will automatically negotiate a secure TLS-encrypted connection and transport your email message in that manner . - This has the effect of securing server-to-server delivery of email across the Internet. - This is great , except : <p> If it is not supported or security setup fails , your email will be transmitted insecurely . <p> An alternative to opportunistic TLS that is supported by LuxSci as part of SecureLine is " Forced TLS " . - With Forced TLS , <p> Email that is going to a recipient whose servers support opportunistic TLS will be delivered via TLS or not delivered at all until TLS is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server does NOT support opportunistic TLS will automatically " fall back " to use of some other form of encryption ( e.g. Secure Message Pickup ) <p> When TLS is " good enough " for you , it is ideal , as it is easiest form of encryption to use , being transparent to the sender and recipient . - It is " business as usual " , which everyone likes . - So , if TLS is good enough , use TLS with recipients who support it and use other means with those that do not . ( SMTP TLS is " good enough " for HIPAA , for example ) . <p> TLS : It is simple and easy to use TLS- to secure the communications between your computers and your email service providers computers . This works no matter who your recipients are . TLS- improves security in these ways : <p> It establishes that you are contacting your service providers computers and not someone elses <p> It encrypts the username and password that you use to login to these servers . This mitigates identity theft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between your computer and your SMTP server . <p> Anonymity : If you have access to an Anonymous SMTP server , you have an easy way to increase your Internet privacy . Anonymous SMTP provides : <p> Email client privacy so that the recipients of your email messages can not determine what type of email client you are using . <p> A means to strip out any other non-standard " email header " data that may be lurking in your outbound messages . <p> PGP and S/MIME : PGP and S/MIME keys use asymmetric key encryption to protect the contents of your messages throughout their complete journeys . They provide : <p> Protection against eavesdropping and unwanted backups <p> Message Digests to detect whether messages have been altered in transit <p> Signatures to prove sender authenticity <p> I highly recommend the use of TLS- for email communications . Unfortunately , PGP and S/MIME are not being used as extensively as they should be . In my experience , more and more companies are using TLS- and secure message pickup to encrypt communications , but some- are using PGP or S/MIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the effort needed to setup , to enforce usage , and to train employees is seen as much larger ( or costlier ) than the benefit of use . Clearly , the cost savings gained by using secure messaging is in having less information leakage or modification which is very difficult to quantify , especially as most companies assume that they do n't  ( or wont ) have significant problems in this arena anyway . These assumptions are changing as the threat of security issues and breaches is changing . - Technologies such as S/MIME and PGP are starting to gain more traction by the general public . <p> " Secure Message Pickup " encryption avoids the impediments of PGP and S/MIME encryption while providing complete security , anonymity , and other features . There is no learning curve for this because it can be easily integrated into an existing email system . Anyone who is concerned about security but does n't  know how to set it up can use Secure Message Pickup as easily as they use WebMail . In addition , it can communicate securely with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enforced TLS " provides a means of communication with all or select recipients whose email servers also support TLS in away that is very easy and transparent . - If - the added benefits of having the message always encrypted , even at rest , are not requirements , Enforced TLS is a good option . <p> Unlike computer break-ins and other security problems , problems with email security are very hard to detect . You can not tell if someone is reading your email or modifying messages subtly until it is too late ( see : how do you know if someone has read your email message ? ) . You can not quantify the cost of email and information security problems until it is too late imagine all of the things people write in their messages . and think twice . <p> the standard ways of sending email are completely insecure . To understand why , see The Case For Email Security. - So , what can be done to still use email , but ensure that the data is secure and viewable only by <p> only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users connect securely to LuxScis servers , who is to say that your recipient 's connection is secure ? With LuxSci SecureLine , even if the recipient 's connection is n't secure , you can be <p> Postini filters inbound email for spam , viruses , and other content it is essentially a slightly inferior version of what McAfee offers ( formerly MX Logic ) and what we offer through our Premium Email Filtering service . <p> JumbleMe is a service somewhat like the " Escrow " feature of LuxScis SecureLine end-to-end email encryption service . it allows you to secure parts of an email message and that does help with some of the problems discussed in this article . <p> Jumbleme may not be as secure as you think . Let 's suppose you put a strong password on a file and send your email . You would expect your recipient to need to use that strong password , right ? Well , yes , except if that user has a jumbleme account . In that case the recipient receives the email with THEIR jumbleme password regardless of what you sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many many password crackers exist that can crack 6 or 8 character passwords with relative ease . <p> See for yourself : <p> LONG ... or If you are having trouble opening an email , the first question to ask is , are you a member ? If so , all emails sent to you should be encrypted with YOUR password . This was done for convenience , for if you are working at a business using our system , and you have 20 different people sending you encrypted emails , you do n't  want to remember 20 different passwords . Just the one you signed up with . Keep this in mind if you send yourself a test email . It wont matter what password you use in the body of the email , it will always be encrypted with your password . <p> JumbleMes security is very robust , while allowing convenience for our users . All emails are actually secured with two passwords . One password is given to the recipient , the other stored on JumbleMes servers and is unique to each email . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipient tries to read an email , he/she enters her password on the website or using our software . They have 4 attempts to enter the correct password , at which point there is a lockout and the Sender is notified of the failed attempts . After the lockout , they may try again up to a total of 10 times , then the email is completely disabled . Only with a correct password entry is the second key then used to decode the email . By using a 2 password system , a password cracker software would be trying to crack the equivalent of a 20+ character password ( exact length reserved for security reasons ) . And this password would be unique to each email . This seemed the best way to allow our members the convenience of one password , but the security of long and unique passwords for each email . <p> in SecureForm refers in part to the fact that the emailed form data can be secured using PGP or S/MIME. - This , combined with enforced use of SSL , ensures that the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it helps to understand what SSL ( https ) does and what it does n't do Case for Email Security Why Use Encryption ?

When you have a lot of email , a lot of folders , and/or a lot of users and your old email provider supports IMAP . NOTE : calendars , address books &amp; tasks are NOT automatically migrated as part of " email migration . " These can be manually imported . See below for more details . With managed email migration , LuxSci can : <p> Bulk create your users in LuxSci for you ( you provide a spreadsheet of the user data and passwords ) <p> Connect to your old provider and automatically download all email from all folders for all users and save this email in their new LuxSci accounts . <p> Perform multiple download passes ( i.e. one ahead of time and one after the fact ) to get any last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the migration period . <p> Manage and monitor this process for you , no matter how much email needs to be copied . <p> This is the ideal solution if you have a lot to move and/or do not want to do it yourself . There is a small migration fee involved , based on the number of users being migrated and any special complexity in the migration . <p> The migration is a copy operation and not a move . LuxSci copies all of your email from your old provider to LuxSci . This does not an can not delete any of your email from your old provider . The only ways that email could be lost are if : <p> Some folders can not be copied ( e.g. your old provider is not exposing them via IMAP so our migration tools can not see them ) . <p> Your email folders at your old provider are corrupted so that we can not copy the messages <p> You delete messages from your old provider before it is copied to LuxSci <p> You have email that is not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in local folders ) . This email would not be migrated and would be lost if your deleted it from your computer . <p> In a standard migration , two " passes " will be performed . A " pass " is one full copy of all data for all of your users from your current email provider . The data is then saved in their new LuxSci email accounts . We perform two passes to make sure that all data is copied from your current provider before you end your services with them . <p> In order for the migration to begin , our technicians will need the following information : <p> The mail server name that we can use to access your users ' email and whether this server requires a secure connection ( e.g. over TLS ) . This information can be given to you by your current email provider . <p> Confirmation that IMAP has been enabled on the mail server you 're providing . This information can be given to you by your current email provider . <p> A CSV file or Excel Spreadsheet containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ login usernames and current passwords ) . If you have a large number of users , you may be able to export this information from your current provider . <p> Your best estimate of the total amount of data to be moved for all users . <p> The migration can happen in hours to days to weeks . The factors that slow the migration down include : <p> The more email there is to migrate , the longer it takes . <p> The slower your old email servers are , the longer it takes . <p> If your old servers are " flaky " and frequently terminate IMAP connections , do not like it when many messages are read or when a lot of data is downloaded ... this can significantly increase the migration time . <p> If the data provided ( i.e. the usernames and passwords to the accounts at the old provider ) is incorrect or becomes incorrect , this will slow things down as we will need to coordinate with you to get updated login credentials . <p> Our technicians use migration software that looks at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each folder and email on LuxSci servers . This copy will preserve your folder trees and location of emails without affecting service or performance at your current provider in any way . The migration can be done at any time with no downtime for you at either LuxSci or your current provider . <p> When the first pass of the migration is complete , our technicians will respond to your Support Ticket . You can then check your LuxSci account for all expected folders and emails . Once you have confirmed that everything is in order and you are prepared to end services with your current provider , we will perform a second pass . This pass copies any data that may have arrived between the end of the first pass and the time you end services with your current provider ( i.e. when you request a second pass ) . <h> Minimize the Transition Time <p> If keeping the email service transition time to a minimum or having control over exactly when the transition occurs is important to you , LuxSci 's technicians can help you with a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for the transition to happen in as little as 15-20 minutes on a date and time of your choosing . However , this requires some preparation that we can assist you in planning . <h> Ready To Make the Change ? <p> If you have any questions about any of these migration and transition options , or if you would like us to assist you in any of these areas , please contact us . <h> Managed Email Migration Pricing <p> Managed Migration Pricing ( a one-time-fee ) : <p> $50 for 1-49 users and up to 50 GB of email . <p> $150 for 50-149 users and up to 250 GB of email <p> $250+ for 150+ users or more than 250GB of email <p> Custom price for more users , more than 2 copy passes , unusually large or complex scenarios , or other special considerations . <p> In the case where IMAP is not available at your old provider , but you do have your email in Outlook PST files , you can mail us DVDs or hard drives containing this data and we can manually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction thereof ( special pricing available for large uploads ) . <h> Additional Migration Options <h> Bulk User and Alias Creation <p> LuxSci 's bulk user and alias creation tools allow you to use a CSV ( comma separated values ) file to quickly add all of your users and aliases to your account . <h> Self-Service Email Migration <p> There are several ways that users and/or administrators can migrate their own email to LuxSci at no additional cost . <p> IMAP : If your former provider supports IMAP , you can set up your LuxSci IMAP account in parallel to your old account in your email client ( i.e. Outlook or Thunderbird ) and drag and drop messages and folders between the accounts . This will always work , no matter what kind of system your former provider uses . <p> POP : If your former provider supports only POP , you can migrate your INBOX email to LuxSci using our WebMail-based POP-downloading tool . This tool can connect to your old provider and copy all your INBOX email to your new LuxSci INBOX for you . <h> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to migrate users separately or in groups such that some users will be using your old system while others switch to LuxSci ; we have a solution . We can set up a special migration domain for you on LuxSci to which you can forward email from your old system for the users who have been migrated . This email will then be delivered to their new mailboxes on LuxSci where they can effectively send and receive email using their real address ( the inbound email will merely pass through your old servers on its way to them ) . When all users are migrated , you simply change your DNS , remove the migration domain , and you are done . <h> Migration of Other Data <p> Aliases : Aliases can be created easily in bulk using either a multi-alias creation form or by uploading a comma-delimited or tab-delimited file of aliases into our administrative interface . <p> Domains : If you have many domains , LuxSci can add them for you automatically using its API . <p> Calendars , Tasks , and Contacts : LuxSci 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the WebAides using CSV files on a per-user basis . Alternately , if you use Outlook , you can use LuxSci 's proprietary " WebAideSync " plug-in to copy all of this data from your Outlook into your LuxSci accounts and then keep it synchronized thereafter . 5314 @qwx205314 <p> The Internet and my web site have grown to become essential components of my business .

@@22227179 @2227179/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> What exactly does HIPAA say about Email Security ? <p> Published : August 30th , 2013 <p> Performing daily business transactions through electronic technologies is accepted , reliable , and necessary across the nations healthcare sectors . Therefore , electronic communications and email have become a standard in the healthcare industry as a way to conduct business activities that commonly include : <p> Interacting with web-savvy patients ; <p> Real time authorizations for medical services ; <p> Transcribing , accessing and storing health records ; <p> Appointment scheduling ; <p> Referring patients ; and <p> Submitting claims to health plan payers for payment of the services provided . <p> Collaborative efforts amongst healthcare providers have improved the delivery of quality care to patients in addition to the recognized increase in administrative efficiency through effective use of email and other types of electronic communication . Patients are becoming more and more comfortable with emailing their physicians office to schedule an appointment , discuss laboratory results , or request refills on medication . Medicare and some other insurance payers also recognize and pay for " online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the web ( telemedicine ) . <p> Using the web , undoubtedly , poses concerns about the privacy and security of an individuals information . In healthcare , the confidentiality of a patients information has been sacred since the days of the Hippocratic Oath ( Hippocrates the Father of Medicine , 400 B.C. ) . Today , merely taking an oath to respect ones privacy has been overshadowed by regulations that govern how certain healthcare establishments must handle an individuals health information . So , if a healthcare organization employs email as a means of communicating medical and/or mental health data to appropriate parties , they must also ensure that information is well safeguarded . <p> This white paper will address the specific issues that a healthcare provider must address in order to be in compliance with HIPAA , HITECH , and Omnibus . It will also lay out how LuxSci enables providers to meet these requirements though HIPAA-compliant email outsourcing . <h> Overview of HIPAA <p> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) implemented new rules for the healthcare world . Mandating compliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to enforcing patients rights . Industry professionals financial , administrative and clinical are no strangers to the regulatory compliance culture . HIPAA laws apply to a covered entity ; i.e. healthcare providers , clearinghouses and health plan payers that meet certain conditions . In essence , most providers are covered entities if they employ an electronic-based office meaning they function by storing and exchanging data via computers through intranets , Internet , dial up modems , DSL lines , T-1 , etc . Additionally , HITECH and Omnibus extend the requirements of HIPAA to any business associate of a covered entity and to all business associates of - business associates ( all the way down the line ) who may come into contact with Protected Health Information originating from a covered entity . <p> HIPAA email security applies specifically to protected health information , not just personal information . Protected Health Information ( PHI ) , as defined in HIPAA language , is health information of an identifiable individual that is transmitted by electronic media ; maintained in any electronic medium ; or transmitted or maintained in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial , and clinical information on a patient is considered PHI . For more details on this , see : What exactly is ePHI ? - Who has to worry about it ? - Where can it be safely located ? <p> Privacy Standards : The HIPAA Privacy Rule sets standards for protecting the rights of individuals ( patients ) . Covered entities must follow the laws that grant every individual the right to the privacy and confidentiality of their health information . Protected Health Information is subject to an individuals rights on how such information is used or disclosed.Privacy Standard Key Point : Controlling the use and disclosure of oral , written and electronic protected health information ( any form ) . <p> Security Standards : Taking the Privacy Rule a step further , HIPAA implemented the Security Rule to cover electronic PHI ( ePHI ) . To this end , more secure and reliable information systems help protect health data from being " lost " or accessed by unauthorized users.Security Standard Key Point : Controlling the access to electronic forms of protected health information ( not specific to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules focus on information safeguards and require covered entities and their business associates to implement the necessary and appropriate means to secure and protect health data . Specifically , the regulations call for organizational and administrative requirements along with technical and physical safeguards . <p> Starting on February , 2010 , the HIPAA rules were enhanced by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. - The HITECH section of this act implements significant penalties for breaches of HIPAA and requires that the business partners of organizations covered by HIPAA must themselves obey the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules , and face liability if there are any unauthorized disclosures. - For more information on what HITECH has done to HIPAA , see : HIPAA 2010 : HITECH Impact on Email and Web Outsourcing. - Starting in September 2013 , the Omnibus rule goes into effect , further expanding the scope of coverage and drastically strengthening the penalties and enforcement of HIPAA. - For more information on Omnibus , see : How the HIPAA Omnibus Rule Affects Email , Web , FAX , and Skype . <h> Provisions of the HIPAA Email Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressable . Required means that complying with the given standard is mandatory Addressable means that the given standards must be implemented by the organization unless assessments and in depth risk analysis conclude that implementation is not reasonable and appropriate specific to a given business setting . - Important Note : Addressable does not mean optional . <p> With regard to addressable , an organization should read and decipher each Security standard separately and deal with each piece independently in order to determine an approach that meets the needs of the organization . <p> The General Rules of the Security Standards reflect a " technology-neutral " approach . This means that there are no specific technological systems that must be employed and no specific recommendations , just so long as the requirements for protecting the data are met . <p> Organizational requirements refer to specific functions a covered entity must perform , including the use of business associate contracts and the development , documentation and implementation of policies and procedures . <h> Risk Analysis <p> Risks are inherent to any business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization must take into consideration the potential for violating an individuals right to privacy of their health information . HIPAA allows for scalability and flexibility so that decisions can be made according to the organizations approach in protecting data . Covered entities and their Business Associates must adopt certain measures to safeguard PHI from any " reasonably anticipated " hazards or threats . After a thorough yearly risk analysis , a yearly assessment of the organizations current security measures should be performed .

And , count on the physical security of our servers . <h> Chart of LuxSci Services and the HIPAA Rules they Satisfy <p> If you are interested in specific services at LuxSci and would like to know exactly which of the HIPAA rules each service meets , the following charts will assist you . Please contact LuxSci for more information . <p> ( a ) Our secure document storage service and use of SecureLine for communications may assume that the recipients have special passwords for their " Secure data access certificates " ( PGP or S/MIME ) . These passwords are may be stored in a " Password Escrow " ( a special secure password database ) if the users so choose . In these cases , passwords to security keys- can be retrieved in case of emergency or in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage service and use of SecureLine for communications encrypts data so that only the intended recipient(s) can ever view the data . The encryption process also allows the recipient(s) to verify that the data was not altered since it was sent or stored using digital signatures . <p> ( c ) SSL/TLS solutions encrypt the message during transport to and from LuxScis servers and your personal computer . Email sent from LuxSci to external addresses is secured with the use of SecureLine ( Solution #3 ) . <p> Essentially , it is not possible to have any external scan to determine HIPAA compliance for web sites as a large degree of compliance depends on on how ePHI is handled on the server and behind the scenes . How it is stored , how it is transmitted , how access to it is gained , how it is disposed of , etc . External tests can not analyze these things . You really need a knowledgeable IT person to review both your site architecture and your hosting situation to determine your degree of HIPAA compliance . <p> At LuxSci , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what they should and should not do and have tools to make compliance easier . However , there are still things that are " up to the customer " which can not be enforced by LuxSci or monitored for externally . For example , a web hosting customer could accidentally post ePHI behind a secure password protected web page which is accessible to a lot of people who should not see such ePHI resulting in a breach of HIPAA . <p> This would sure make many peoples lives easier . However , due to the nature of HIPAA , no automated tool could do much beyond scratching the surface of determining if an organization is complaint . Why ? Because compliance reaches from employee training and written policies , to access controls and auditing mechanisms , to enforcement of encryption , to access to and policies for disposal of computer hardware to name a few . Additionally , HIPAA compliance requires frequent reviews of policies , self audits , extensive documentation , and disaster testing . <p> The only way to really see " where you stand " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your organization and its management of PHI . The more you can outsource the management of ePHI to HIPAA-compliant services , the less you have to be responsible for and audit yourself . <p> You have provided a lot of useful information in this article . I have recently been helping some practices are beginning to utilize the encrypted email sites that insurance providers now give them in order to upload patient record information for appeals which is more secure and easier to use than faxing . <p> I agree with Erik that written policies must be exact on procedures such as this to avoid unauthorized disclosures . <p> This is an ever changing world especially with the social media exchanges now being made by medical practices .

" Many electronic FAXing companies ( unlike- eFax Corporate- ) have not caught up all the way with the current HIPAA HITECH requirements . - I.e. while they may mention " HIPAA " they do not provide signed Business Associate Agreements and thus they probably do not follow all of the practices required for HIPAA , yet . - By using such a service , you will not actually be compliant yourself . <p> " Recipient Security : " When sending ePHI over FAX , that data typically ends up being transmitted over insecure analog phone lines and sitting in plain sight on some FAX machines . - While this itself is not exactly non-compliant , it is certainly in a gray area . - You should consider carefully if the lessening of security this affords is appropriate to your business and its compliance needs . - This is something you need to answer for yourself . 
@@22227181 @2227181/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> Customers of our High Volume bulk outbound email service often ask how they can " send faster " . - They want to get their mailing out ASAP , no matter if it is to hundreds of recipients , or millions of recipients . <p> This post codifies all of the various types of advice we give for optimizing outbound email throughput . - Much of it applies to outbound email sending over SMTP in general i.e. its not limited to the LuxSci High Volume service . <h> Use Concurrent Connections <p> When sending an email message , your emailing program connects to our servers , establishes your identity , and passes the message through . - If you have to send 1000 messages , then you might connect 1000 times to do this . - Many sending programs can be configured to make more than one connection at a time . - If you make 10 connections at once ( e.g. concurrently ) , then you could send those messages about 10 times faster . - That is a really significant speedup ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - The more connections that you make at once , the harder your server has to work to process the mail . - At some point , the server can get so busy and overloaded that the average time to send a message starts getting longer and longer . - You never want to push your server to the point where it is struggling to keep up with your sending , as that will only make things slower for you . - Instead , you want to use a modest number of concurrent connections so you can take advantage of parallel sending and so the server can easily and efficiently process all of the messages . <p> For shared High Volume accounts , where you are sharing capacity with other bulk senders , we recommend keeping your number of concurrent connections to 1o or less . - Single dedicated servers can support 20-30 concurrent connections ( or more depending on many factors discussed below ) , and dedicated server clusters can support as many as you need ( depending on how large a cluster you have ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 are very significant relative to the time it takes to upload the message data . - With SMTP Pipelining , the connection is reused for successive messages . - I.e. when sending 3 messages , it would look like : <p> Connecting to your SMTP server <p> Establishing SSL or TLS encryption , if configured <p> Authentication to establish your identity and permission to send <p> Message 1 : Upload the list of recipients and message content <p> Message 2 : Upload the list of recipients and message content <p> Message 3 : Upload the list of recipients and message content <p> Disconnecting <p> By not repeating the **31;330;TOOLONG steps for every single message , a lot of time in saved and your messages are sent much faster . - SMTP Pipelining should always be used if supported by your email sending program and outbound email service ( LuxSci High Volume supports SMTP Pipelining ) . <h> Multiple Recipients in One Message <p> Imaging sending the same message to 1000 recipients . - If your send these one at a time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is almost 20 minutes to send . - However , if you instead include all of these recipients in the BCC line of one single message , then it will take only about 1-2 seconds to get the message uploaded to the server ( though it will still take the server some time to actually deliver it to those recipients ) . <p> Sending messages to multiple recipients using BCC allows you to upload your messages to the server very much faster than otherwise . <p> There are two downsides , however : <p> The received message may appear more SPAM-like , since the recipient would not see his/her email address as the " To " recipient . - Bccs are more SPAM-like than messages individually addressed ( because it is so much easier and faster to send this way ) . <p> A single message to 1000 recipients may take longer to be delivered to all of those recipients as the mail server will not generally parallelize delivery to the recipients but will instead process them sequentially . - If the delivery time is not very time sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Volume servers allow you to send to up to 1000 recipients in each message . - Customers with dedicated servers and clusters can have this limit increased arbitrarily . <h> Smaller Messages are Better <p> A significant factor in determining how fast messages can be delivered is how long it takes to upload each one to the server . - To see the difference , let 's look at an example sending a PDF to 1000 people in 1000 separate messages . - This PDF is 1 Megabyte in size . <p> Case 1 the PDF is attached to the message and it takes 10 seconds to upload the large message to the mail server . - This results in it taking 10,000 seconds ( almost 3 hours ) to send these messages ( unless you use concurrent connections or multiple recipients/message ) . <p> Case 2 the PDF is placed on a web site and a link to it included in each message instead . The resulting email message is only 10 KB in size ( 100 times smaller ) and it is able to be sent about 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other- optimization . <p> It is best to remove images and other attachments from bulk messages to decrease the size . - Images can be hosted on a web site and displayed in the message by merely linking to the image , rather than including the image content every time . - Attachments that are not sensitive in nature can be similarly hosted on a web site and linked to . - Keeping your email message size down will have a big impact on sending speed . <h> Clean Mailing Lists are Important <p> Obviously you should only be sending bulk messages to addresses that have opted into your mailings and/or with whom you have established business relationships . - This , and all that is implied , are standard terms for the use of any bulk mailing service . <p> However , mailing lists get stale as people change addresses , domain names go defunct , etc. - It is very important to cull invalid email addresses off of your lists . Why ? <p> Bad Domains . Sending email to an email address whose domain name is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slow as it can take much more time to determine that the domain is bad than to determine that it is good and where to deliver the mail . - The delay caused by bad domain names can really slow down your sending . <p> Defunct Addresses . Sending email to now-invalid email addresses looks like spamming. - Recipient servers like Yahoo ! , AOL , McAfee , etc. , are very sensitive to the number of messages that come through addressed to defunct email addresses . - If they see a lot of these , they will either block your emails , or slow down the rate at which they process them . - This will result in more delays and/or non-delivery to valid recipients . <p> Waste of Time . Obviously , sending messages to invalid recipients also just wastes time and money . <p> You should take advantage of any and all tools available to track what recipient email addresses are failing and to actively remove them from your mailing lists . - LuxSci provides many such features including ones which can automatically email you digests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own reports . <h> Insecure is Faster than Secure <p> OK , while encrypting your username and password and message content is always a good thing and always recommended , this encryption will always slow things down to some extent . - It requires extra processing on the part of the server and your sending machine . - It also requires somewhat more bandwidth to transmit all of the data . <p> So , if you are looking to " eek " out every bit of speed , we would recommend not using TLS or SSL when connecting to your bulk SMTP server . - However : <p> Be sure that the username and password being used to authenticate the message sending is NOT used for anything else . - I.e. it is not your administrator user , the password is not one of your " standard " passwords , etc. - You must assume that this username and password could be compromised . <p> Do not grant this user any permission except for sending email . - In LuxSci , you can restrict it from using the web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check that noone else is using this user to connect to your SMTP service . - I.e. LuxSci provides alerts and reports about logins ( successes and failures ) , which you can use to be sure that no one else is accessing this user account . <p> In the worst case scenario , if you have followed these guidelines , the username could be only used to allow someone to send email though your account until you next change your password or until you hit your sending limits . <h> Use an Appropriate Email Program <p> Many programs that are good for regular email usage are terrible for sending email in bulk . - E.g. do n't  try to use Outlook , Thunderbird , Mac Mail , and similar programs to send bulk mail if you are- interested- in sending speed or efficiency . Why ? - Such programs <p> Generally do not support concurrent connections <p> Might not support SMTP Pipelining <p> Can not handle large mailing lists ( e.g. more than 100s of recipients ) well <p> Get bogged down and can be very slow when sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or optimized for it . - Instead , use a program explicitly designed for bulk mailing . - I.e. <p> See our videos on how to set these programs up with High Volume email . <h> Increase Capacity ! <p> Finally , if you must send to many recipients in a short time , you may need to increase your outbound servers sending capacity . - At LuxSci there are tiers of capacity : <p> Shared Your account shares a single server with multiple other accounts . - The capacity of the server is shared and your sending throughput ( i.e. maximum concurrent connections , maximum recipients/month , etc. ) is more restricted so that you play nice with other customers . - Your outbound IP reputation is also shared with others . <p> Dedicated This is like " shared " , except that the sending server and IP is yours , and yours alone . - You get all of the capacity to yourself and thus can attain a much higher throughput . - Your IP reputation is also not subject to other customers actions . <p> Cluster When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cluster is the perfect solution . - It consists of 2 or more ( really , any number ) of outbound servers behind a load balancer. - The more servers you put in your cluster , the higher your throughput can be . - As a " side effect " , you also end up with- multiple- sending IP addresses for reputation management and with fail over so your sending can be resilient against server failure . <p> Which one should you get ? - That really depends on the number of recipients you want to send per month . Also , if you have requirements to send to large numbers of recipients in a very short time , you may need a dedicated or cluster solution even if the overall number of recipients in a month is not excessively large . - Contact us for help in determining the best solution for you .

<p> The " public key " file for your SSL certificate contains several important pieces of information : <p> Information for encrypting data <p> Information about your domain name and possibly also your organization <p> A date range where the certificate is valid ( e.g. when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " signed " your public key . <p> The " private key " file for your SSL certificate contains only information for encrypting data it does not expire or have any details regarding your organization or domain name . <p> The " signing request " contains all of the same information as the " public key " except for information about who has signed it . <p> What is a " self-signed " certificate and when would you want one ? <p> A " self-signed " certificate is one in which you yourself have " signed " the certificate ( e.g. when you or your hosting company created it ) . - Self-signed certificates are free and anyone can make them with any information in them regarding organization and domain name . - E.g. you could make one yourself that is for the computers of the NSA ( National Security Agency ) . <p> However , anyone who connects to a server using a self-signed certificate will immediately get a significant warning message in their connecting program ( e.g. web browser , email program , etc. ) that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should proceed with extreme caution . <p> Self-signed certificates are typically used only for : <p> Services hosted inside of your own corporate network where you control who accesses the server and the server itself . - E.g. your staff may trust your own certificates in that case . <p> Public services where the users care only about the fact that the data is encrypted and which do not care who is on the other end of the data stream ( this is rare ) . <p> Everyone else wants a " signed " certificate . - E.g. they pay some company like Verisign , or Thawte , or even GoDaddy to " sign " their certificate so that all these trust warnings just " go away " . <p> What does certificate signing do and why does it cost money ? <p> A company that signs your certificate must first verify your right to the certificate in question . - Then , they add stuff to the certificate that allows others to see that they indeed have verified your ownership of and right to use this certificate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domain name in the certificate is actually owned by you and the people in charge of the domain approve the creation of this SSL . <p> If there is information about your organization ( e.g. your company name ) in the certificate , then this must also be verified . - People in charge of this company must approve the certificate . <p> So <p> You cant get a certificate signed for domains that you do not have control over <p> You cant get an organizations name in a certificate unless you have permission for that <p> You 'll never get that " NSA " self-signed certificate to be signed by a trusted third party ( unless you happen to work for the NSA , that is ) . <p> The expense of the certificate covers <p> The time and effort needed to verify <p> The more things that must be verified and the better job a third party does , the higher the cost and the higher the trust of the result <p> An " EV " certificate is an " Extended Validation " certificate . - For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to verify the company and domain in the certificate . - Visiting a site that has an EV certificate generates a high degree of trust that the site is really the one you are trying to connect to ( and not some fraudster ) . - As a result , most web browsers identify this with a green address bar . <p> The way that SSL ( and TLS ) works , the establishment of a secured communication channel comes first , before any information is sent between your computer and the server . - When establishing this secure channel , your computer connects to the Internet address ( IP Address ) of the server and " does the encryption stuff " . - Telling the server what domain name you are trying to get to is not part of this process . <p> E.g. if you are trying to get to https : //luxsci.com , your web browser would connect to LuxScis servers on IP address " 66.216.79.80 " and do the encryption things without ever telling the server that it is trying to connect to " luxsci.com " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all set ) . <p> So , the server can not choose what SSL certificate to present to you based on what site you are trying to connect to . it has to give the same certificate every time for every connection the certificate configured for the IP address- " 66.216.79.80 " . <p> Thus , every SSL certificate needs to reside on a different IP address . - When a web browser connects to your dedicated IP address to access your web site securely , it will absolutely be given your SSL certificate . - If the wrong certificate was presented , then the web browser would complain that the certificate received does n't  match the domain name it is trying to connect to . <p> The same process applies to connecting to email servers over SSL and any other service over SSL . <p> What about " wild card " SSL certificates ? <p> A wild card certificate covers a wide range of domains . - E.g. , the certificate for " *. luxsci.com " covers all direct subdomains of " luxsci.com " . - For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " www.luxsci.com " . <p> However , such a wild card certificate does not cover plain old " luxsci.com " . - It also does not cover lower-level subdomains like " a.b.luxsci.com " . <p> The benefits of a wild card certificate are : <p> You only need to buy 1 SSL Certificate to cover a large number of similar domains <p> You only need 1 IP address for that certificate <p> While wild card certificates are more expensive , in general , they are a good value if you have many domains to protect . <p> Can I use the same SSL Certificate for different things like email and web sites ? <p> That depends on if those services are located on the same server ( IP Address ) . - If your domain was " secure.com " and you wanted to use this for both secure email ( e.g. POP and IMAP ) and your web site , then these things would generally need to be served on the same server so that the IP address of your web site and your email is the same and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that address . <p> If your mail and web sites were on different servers or IP addresses , then you would not be able to setup your domain " secure.com " so that it goes to one place for web and another place for email ( without special hardware firewalls and other types of traffic redirecting rules that are not generally in place in common configurations ) . <p> At LuxSci , customers of our shared services have their email on one server , their web sites on another server , and their WebMail on a third set of servers this is for security and performance reasons . - So , if they wanted to secure all three things with their own branded domain name and SSL , they would need up to 3 certificates ( or 1 wild card certificate ) one for each server . - Customers with dedicated servers can have all of these services located on their single machine and can use 1 regular certificate for all of them . <p> LuxSci provides SSL for your for secure email and WebMail. - If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own secure domain name . - If you want to secure your web site , you might want SSL for that as well . <p> Does adding an SSL certificate to my web site make it secure ? <p> Merely adding an SSL certificate to a site does not make the site secure . - Once you have an SSL Certificate for your site you need to ensure that web pages that require security are only accessed over SSL ( e.g. you need to link to them with https : // and not http : // links ) . <p> You may also want to construct your site so that secure pages can not be accessed via insecure links ( e.g. http : // ) . - This is easily done at LuxSci as we can provide a separate area of your web site for files only accessible over SSL . <p> It is a common misconception that " . shtml " web pages are " Secure HTML " . - This is not so . - The " S " stands for " Server-Parsed " and is related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of encryption and does not mean that the page is secure . <p> The page is only secure if the URL in the address bar starts with " https : // " and your " lock icon " in your browser is closed ( locked ) . - Also look to be sure that the lock icon does not have a warning sign or " X " on it and that the address bar is not " red " as these can indicate that there is either some problem with your SSL certificate ( like it expired ) or that there are items ( like images or JavaScript ) in your web page that are being loaded without SSL and thus defeating some of the reasons for having the page secured in the first place . - Contact your web developer if you have questions about such issues they may be " OK " in some cases and not in others .

Diagnosing and Resolving Issues with Missing Email <p> Published : December 1st , 2014 <p> In many ways , the Internet is still like the Wild Wild West . Email messages sent to you or from you can and do " go missing " for no apparent reason. - This can happen no matter what email provider you use . So , what happened to these " AWOL " messages ? - How can you diagnose and solve the problem ? <p> In some cases , you can figure out the reason yourself. - In most cases , you may need the assistance of your email providers Technical Support team they should be experts at this kind of " Sherlock Holmes " work because it is so prevalent we receive questions about missing messages on a daily basis . <p> However , many email providers ( we have heard reports of unsolved email mysteries at popular freebie email providers that offer paid business accounts ) Technical Support teams will not assist you with these kinds of issues. - Their idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it resent " . - That can be frustrating to you , the customer ; - however , what it comes down to is that their Tech Support may not want to " waste " time with matters like this because their margins and prices are so low . <p> At LuxSci , we have never lost a client because we have lost their email ( to our knowledge ) . Instead , very often we help our clients " find " missing messages or determine what might have happened to a message. - - Excellent customer support is a standard feature of our services. - It brings to mind the old adage " you get what you pay for " . - If email delivery is not a critical success factor of your business , then you may be able to justify your email providers unwillingness to troubleshoot technical issues. - But where do you turn when email you need , or expect , or do n't  even know about , never gets to your Inbox ? <p> In this article , we will discuss a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appear to never be delivered . As the possible problems are really limitless , we will discuss some of the most common ones. - Any particular issue may require extensive diagnosis , knowledge of how email flows between servers , how the servers involved behave , knowledge of the content of the message sent , etc. - At the end of this article , we will go over how an email provider might actually track an email message through its systems . <h> Some Messages Really do " Just Disappear " <p> There are many things that can cause an email message to simply disappear , for real , and be forever lost in the void . - Messages that " just disappear " are ones that are not received by the recipient and for which the sender never receives a " bounce message " indicating why or even that the delivery failed. - Some of the reasons for missing email include : <h> Incorrect " From " Address <p> Many email servers , including LuxScis , will do some basic validation on the " From " address used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is determined to be invalid , the message will be denied/bounced. - However , since the " From " address is invalid , the bounce never makes it back to anyone and the message seemingly disappears. - What can cause an invalid " From " address ? <p> The senders domain name does not exist or its registration has expired . <p> The DNS on the senders domain has been changed and now has no DNS MX records . <p> The senders domain is or was hosted by the same email provider that the recipient uses ; as far as that provider knows , your specific " From " address is not valid on their system although the your domain is apparently still active there . <p> What can you , as a sender , do to diagnose this ? <p> Look in your " Sent " email folder and find the " From " address . Check for subtle spelling errors and check to be sure that your domains registration and DNS are active ( Check EasyWHOIS and the MX Toolbox ) . <p> Have the recipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their server logs for any message from you that may have been bounced or denied . You will need to provide the " From " address used , the recipients address , and the time/date that the message was sent . <h> Filters , Filters , Filters <p> If the recipient of the message has any kind of email filtering ( Spam filtering , Virus filtering , Content filtering , etc. ) it may be that the message was inadvertently filtered and saved in some folder or quarantine area , discarded , or bounced. - It is also often the case that email providers filter certain kinds of messages without the recipients knowledge to provide " a better service " . - What to do ? <p> If the recipient has a place s/he can go to look for spam or quarantined email , that is the first place to check . <p> If the recipient has any custom filters setup on his/her email server or email program , s/he should check those and see if any of them may have inadvertently caught the message in question . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message was filtered by some server-side rules that s/he has no control over. - The provider may need to look in its mail server logs to check. - You , the sender , will need to provide the " From " address used , the recipients address , and the time/date that the message was sent . <h> It Was Deleted <p> It is very often the case that the recipient actually did receive the message , or that it was at least delivered. - S/he might not be able to find the message because : <p> The recipient accidentally deleted the message. - This happens. - Perhaps there is a backup or archival area where the recipient can look for another copy of the message . <p> The recipient has some custom email filters that caused the message to be saved in a different email folder than expected ( or caused it to be forwarded or otherwise diverted ) . <p> The recipient could be checking his/her email using multiple email programs. - One program could have downloaded and deleted the message , thus making it appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common when people use a combination of desktop programs , like Outlook or Thunderbird , and mobile devices , and have the mobile devices configured to delete email from the server . <p> The recipient is looking in a Web-based email interface and his/her POP email program , i.e. Outlook or Thunderbird , at work or at home has already downloaded and deleted the message from the server. - This is the " Oops , I left my computer logged in ! " scenario . <p> The recipients email provider can look in their email logs to see if the email message was ever actually received by them and , possibly , what happened to it after it was received . <h> Server , Firewall , or Blacklist Trouble <p> Some email server at the senders provider , the recipients provider , or somewhere in between could be having technical difficulties and either <p> have accidentally deleted the message , <p> have it queued somewhere from where it is not being released , or <p> have trouble sending it onward due to network connectivity issues , firewalls , blacklisting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will need to start with the senders email provider and have them track the message sent as far as they can ( see the end of this article for an idea of how this is done ) . They will be able to determine if there was any problem on their side , or if not , will provide details as to where it was delivered and tracking codes that they can use to further extend the search . Proceeding through each provider will eventually yield the culprit or a service provider who does n't  care and wont help you . <h> Messages that Bounce : Temporarily or Permanently <p> " Bouncing " is another term for a message that is " denied " by a server and returned to the sender . <p> Messages may seem to disappear or never be delivered because , in fact , they are " bounced " or " denied " . - There are two kinds of message delivery failures : temporary and permanent . <h> Temporary Failures : 400 errors <p> A temporary failure , a failure where the target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 499 ( or where the target mail server is down and not accepting connections ) , means that that mail server is temporarily refusing to accept the email message , but might accept it later. - There are all kinds of reasons why this could be : maybe its too busy , maybe the recipient is over his/her disk quota , etc . When one mail server tries to talk to another and gets a " temporary failure " like this , the mail server will queue the message and try again later. - Usually , mail servers will try for up to 5 days before giving up ; after 4 hours , they usually send a notice back to the sender explaining why there is a delay. - At the end of 5 days , a final delivery failure message is sent back to the sender . <p> Note : not all providers send the 4-hour explanation message. - Also , many free , bulk , and public email providers will not keep trying for a full 5 days , but only for a few hours so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stuck in transit , in the process of " trying again and again " for many days ; and you may or may not get any indication of this. - The way to diagnose this is the same as with the " Server , Firewall , or Blacklist Trouble " problem contact your email providers support team and ask them to start the tracking process . <h> Permanent Failures : 500 errors <p> A permanent failure , a failure where the target mail server actively returns and SMTP error code between 500 and 599 , means that the mail server will not accept the delivery of this message and it should be returned to sender ( and not re-tried ) . - Some typical reasons for these kinds of refusals include : <p> the recipients email address is defunct or does n't  exist <p> the email server no longer hosts email fro this recipient address e.g. their account has been suspended or closed , or the customer ha moved to a new provider without properly updating the domains MX records <p> the sender misspelled the recipients email address <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senders mail server is blacklisted <p> the recipients mail servers are misconfigured <p> the recipients domain name has expired or his/her DNS MX records are incorrect <p> etc. , etc . <p> Permanent errors generate a delivery failure message that is sent back to the sender . <h> Non-delivery Reports / Delivery Failure Messages <p> Messages sent back to the sender to report the failure of delivery to a recipient are called " non-delivery reports " ( NDR ) . - These usually indicate exactly why the message was not able to be delivered. - If you have trouble interpreting one of these , ask your email service providers support team they should be able to decipher it for you , as they deal with these as a matter of course . <p> Any problems with missing email are most easily solved if the sender gets a bounce message / non-delivery report. - If you are missing a message that someone sent to you , ask them if they got a bounce. - This may resolve the problem straight away ; maybe they just misspelled your email address ! <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that a non-delivery report was sent back to the sender , but s/he never got it ! - - - This could be for all the same reasons that email might go missing in the first place , as well as : <p> the sender could be filtering out bounce messages for anti-spam reasons , and thus does n't  see legitimate ones. - This is common if someone is using the senders email address to send spam and the sender is trying to get rid of all the back scatter non-delivery reports . <p> the senders From address could have been invalid or misspelled , so the bounce message never makes it to him/her . <p> the senders spam filters could be catching the bounce message . <p> the recipients mail servers may be configured to handle email for the senders domain ( maybe because the sender used to host email there ) , and thus the bounce message may have been delivered locally there and not to the servers where the sender really gets his/her mail . <h> Other Strangeness that Affects Message Delivery <p> There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email message. - Some of these include : <p> The message could still be in the senders " Outbox " because the senders computer is not connected to the Internet , or because his computer is having issues with the sending of email messages . <p> The sender may have " sent " the message but turned off his/her computer before the message actually left his/her Outbox .. so the recipient would not receive the message until the sender goes back online , perhaps the next day ( this is a big source of " delayed " email issues that we see ) . <p> Someone else logged into the recipients email account and deleted the message before s/he saw it . <p> The message was too big and got stuck or refused somewhere along the way and a bounce couldnt get back , as the bounce was trying to include the entire message . <p> The senders or recipients email servers could be having DNS issues causing them to think that the senders or recipients domain name is non-existent or has no MX records. - This could result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . <p> A server crash somewhere could have caused a loss of data which included the contents of the message-in-transit . <h> What Can you Do To Mitigate Message Loss ? <p> There are several things that can be done : <p> Make sure that your email providers Technical Support team is available and willing to help you track down any issues that occur. - The cause might not be theirs , but their assistance may be needed to determine where the real problem lies . <p> Use a " backup " system where copies of your recent email are stored in a separate folder , location , or archive. - In the case that your message is somehow inadvertently deleted after delivery to you , you will still have a way of retrieving a copy of it. - LuxSci provides both simple " Backup " folders that save copies of your most recent email , and archival systems for keeping copies of all sent and received messages . <p> Understand your email filtering rules. - Know what happens to different kinds of messages and what kinds of filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting a summary of these rules . <p> Ask your provider what system-wide rules are in place that may affect email delivered to you. - Find out what happens to messages affected by these rules . <p> Choose a provider that provides delivery status reporting . - This way you can easily see if messages that your send actually make it to and are accepted by your recipients email system . - E.g. LuxSci provides this . <p> It comes down to ( a ) having able and willing support , ( b ) having reliable backups , and ( c ) educating yourself about your own filters. - This is the best you can do and will go a long way to ensure that when you discover a missing message , that you are able to recover it or at least find out what happened . <p> It should not be a " mystery " what happens to missing messages . <h> How an Email Provider Tracks a Missing Message <p> Each server at an email provider may handle hundreds of thousands or millions of email messages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened with these messages can be hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes in size for each day. - For this reason , email providers- ( a ) only keep their logs for a short period of time , and ( b ) can not search for your missing mail without some good details to go on . <p> If you are missing a message , ask for help sooner rather than later. - The longer you wait , especially if you wait for weeks , the more likely it is that the mail provider no longer has the logs necessary to track what happened. - For example , LuxSci only keeps these mail logs for two weeks . unless a customer has a dedicated server and a special need for longer retention . <p> Give the technical support team as much information as possible to help them comb their logs. - Typically , they will want <p> The date and time that the message was sent ( be sure to let them know what timezone this information is in ) . <p> Exactly who the message is from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest way to get this information is to copy the full headers of the message from your " Sent " mail folder . In this way , you will have the exact details , including any subtle spelling or formatting errors that may be present . <p> Next , your mail provider will look in their mail server logs for messages that match the criteria provided. - If they do find the message , the message will have been assigned an " I 'd code " by their servers. - They will be able to use the is " I 'd Code " to track the message on their servers and see where it went . <p> These mail logs lines will indicate if there were any errors or reasons why the message could not be processed or sent. - If all was well , the log lines will record how their servers talked to the recipients servers and if the message was accepted. - There are several possibilities here : <p> Messages permanently denied. - This is the " permanent error " discussed earlier which generates a bounce back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this along with the reason provided by the recipients mail server . <p> Messages temporarily denied. - This is the " temporary error " discussed above which causes the message to be queued to keep trying to send again and again. - Your support team will see a record of this along with the reason provided by the recipients mail server. - They should also perhaps see the messages still in the mail queue . <p> Your mail provider can not connect to the recipients servers due to network connectivity issues , firewalls , or blacklists. - This will be recorded in the mail logs and usually treated as another kind of " temporary failure " . <p> The messages are delivered to and accepted by the recipients mail server . <p> In case #4 , the recipients mail server generally tells what " I 'd Code " it is using to identify the message in its system and what server accepted the message. - At this point , your mail provider has done its job and delivered the message out of its systems. - Any remaining delivery problems lie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the " I 'd Code " obtained from the logs and give this to the support team at the recipients mail provider and ask them to see what happened to that message on their side. - With the " I 'd Code " and name of the server that accepted the message , the recipients support team should not have any problem continuing the tracking process . <h> 3 Responses to " Wheres the Email ? Diagnosing and Resolving Issues with Missing Email " <p> A few months ago , I sent an important Email to my university counsellor and the Email never received . Now my counsellor claims that I never sent the Email because the E-mail was not in the her account server database . Can anyone tell me if her evidence is sufficient to prove her claim ?

Viewing the actual " From " email address of email messages sent to you . <p> Email messages generally specify from whom they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sender and can also include any textual " name " to go with it . - Many email programs by default show only the textual name and hide the actual address for simplicity . - E.g. it is perhaps easier to read " John Smith " in your message list than his actual address " kjdhkjd6876@yahoo.com " . <p> However , anyone technically can set these addresses and names to anything they want . - So , someone can send you an email that is from any email address of their choosing and have the " name " show up as " John Smith , " or your mothers name , or your spouses name , etc . <p> So , it is a good practice to have your email or WebMail program show the actual email address of the sender so that you can check that . - This could be done in the list of messages or when you actually view the message . - Do n't  trust that just because a name is presented as the " From " , that the message is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ( unless you take further actions well discuss below ) . <p> In LuxSci WebMail , the full from name and address is displayed in the message view pane if you have it expanded ( e.g. click the " + " on the left if the From , Date and Subject are displayed on a single concise line ) . <p> Additionally , you can change your preferences to " always display the email addresses of message senders and recipients instead of their names " in the WebMail message list . <h> 2 . Only view plain text previews of messages until your trust them <p> When you open an email message " fully " , you render its HTML content , download images , and other things . - This action can inform the sender that you have read their message ( see how ) . - Once the sender knows that , they know that your email address is " good " and that you will open their messages and so they are likely to send you more . <p> Additionally , it is possible that malicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infect your computer if opened fully ( e.g. due to old versions of software on your computer , newly discovered problems with your software or with images ) . - It is best to open the message in a " plain text preview " mode first so you can evaluate if it is legitimate before opening it fully . - In a plain text mode , you will not notify the senders of your actions via web bugs , and you are not opening yourself up to attacks . <h> 3 . Get a good spam and virus filter <p> Most good spam and virus filtering systems will detect common social engineering / forged emails that are being sent in bulk to many people on the Internet. - E.g. they can stop such things as forged email from your bank asking you to login to verify your account . <p> These will help prevent many generic attacks , but not necessarily ones targeted directly at you or your domain / organization . <h> 4 . Get email link filtering <p> The most advanced email filtering systems can re-write the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the filtering system will scan the target page to see if it is legitimate or contains malicious content . - This gives you a good measure of real-time protection against malicious links . - See : prevent email phishing attacks with real-time link click protection . <p> If you do follow links in emails , be aware of the red flags that can tell you if a link is malicious . - See the " Phishing " section of " What is Social Engineering ? " <h> 5 . Use DKIM to identify forged email <p> DKIM is a system that cryptographically signs email messages sent and allows recipients to ensure that such messages were sent from the email servers owned by the purported senders organization . - E.g. DKIM prevents a hacker from sending forged email because the recipient can then easily identify it as such . - Your Spam and virus filtering should use DKIM to eliminate forged email . <h> 6 . Use DKIM for your own domains <p> If your email service provider supports it , you should setup DKIM for your own email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine if email forged as coming from you is legitimate or not . - It also helps you identify email that is coming in forged from yourself . - See : Bounce back and backscatter spam " who stole my email address ? " <h> 7 . What about SPF ? <p> SPF Sender Policy Framework is also a good mechanism to help identify if messages have originated from the trusted servers of the purported sender . - It is not quite as good as DKIM , as it does n't  prevent messages from being captured , altered , and re-sent later those may also show up as valid . <p> However , as various spam filtering systems use DKIM and SPF to varying degrees , it is best to setup your domain with both SPF settings and DKIM support and to enable both in your email filtering software . <h> 8 . Common Sense <p> Last but not least is use of common sense ! <p> Most forged email does not read exactly like messages that you normally receive from that sender if they are your family or friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hover over it first and see if the link looks funny going to some domain that does n't  look like it should . - If so be very wary . <p> If the request is unusual or extraordinary , best to verify it with a phone call or text message or something . - Many messages appear time sensitive emergencies that require you - to do something to help someone , or yourself , fast . - They try to use pressure and familiarity to make you skip any checking and just act out of fear or altruism. - Unfortunately , you need to be skeptical until you can have some certainty that the request is legitimate . <p> Even if DKIM and SPF are all OK a messages could still be fake . - E.g. a virus could have infected the senders computer or email account and be sending messages to his contact list through his regular servers . - This will all look " Ok " on the surface and will all be valid and may even slip past your filtering software only the content of the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veracity if you keep you eyes open . <p> If you are using LuxSci WebMail : <p> We have a preference for always showing the sender email address <p> We have preferences for previewing email messages ( text only ) and for not showing images in email right away <p> We support DKIM and can assist you with setup of DKIM , SPF , and other suggestions listed herein . 
@@22227186 @2227186/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> Background <p> The " Introduction to Internet Programming with Perl and HTML " is classic a 12-part lecture series that Erik Kangas has given many times in the past to advanced high school and college students who are just starting to learn about programming web sites . This course works its way through the basic aspects of HTML and Perl gives new programmers and designers a solid foundation . This lecture series has been resurrected for the LuxSci FYI blog due to popular demand for its content . <p> Once you have completed this course , you will be ready to learn about JavaScript , Cascading Style Sheets , intermediate Perl , databases , and more . <h> Original Introduction <p> By the time you are done with this course , if you have done or understood all the exercises and homework , you should know enough HTML and programming in Perl to write basic interactive web sites ! The various lessons in this course build up to a " final project " a web site designed , for example , to allow users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Introduction to HTML <h> 1.1 What is HTML ? <p> HTML stands for " Hyper-Text Markup Language " . The " Hyper-Text " part refers to the fact that you can make " links " from one web page to another ( i.e. those underlined words you can click on , or those images you can click on to take you to a different web page those are " links " ) . This is a link to the front page of Lux Scientiae . <p> The " Markup " part refers to the fact that a web page does n't  have to be plain old text like that which comes off a typewriter , but can contain different fonts , font sizes , colors , and other formatting to make the content more interesting or readable . " Markup " also implies that in order to make use of such styles , you have to manually specify them within your web page using special commands . This is like LaTeX , but unlike Microsoft Word or WordPerfect which hide the style commands from you ( you never need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and just display your text as bold , for example . <p> To get a feel for what using HTML implies , let 's consider an example : to make the text " John Smith " bold using HTML , we would have to type " &lt;b&gt;John Smith&lt;/b&gt; " which would display " John Smith " . You will notice the added " &lt;b&gt; " and " &lt;/b&gt; " . These are known as markup tags or just tags . The " &lt;b&gt; " marks the beginning of a section of bold text . The " &lt;/b&gt; " indicates the end of the bold text . <p> The basic rules of HTML markup tags are <p> All tags are names enclosed in angle brackets , " &lt; ... &gt; " . <p> Almost all tags come in pairs of start and end tags . <p> The end tag is differentiated from the start tag by the leading forward slash ( " / " ) before the name of the tag ( i.e " b " ) . <p> The names of tags are case insensitive . This means that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith&lt;/B&gt; " , and " &lt;B&gt;John Smith&lt;/B&gt; " are all equivalent . <p> That 's it HTML is just plain text with lots of tags that specify how the text should look . In the following sections , we will introduce you to many of the basic tags you can use , and describe how you can construct your first full web page ! <h> 1.2 The Anatomy of a Web Page <p> A " web page " is a text file containing text marked up with HTML . You should use a text editor to create and edit such files , such as : Notepad or Textpad ( my favorite ) if you are using Windows , or vi , or emacs if you are using UNIX of Linux . If you use a word processor , like Microsoft Word , be sure to use the " Save As " feature to save the file as a " text file " , otherwise it may contain a lot of unwanted hidden stuff . We do not recommend the " Save as HTML " option in many word processors , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is overly complex , and does n't  look quite as you intended . Text files containing HTML should be saved with names ending in the " . html " extension ( many Microsoft products save them as " . htm " which is a throw-back to the old days when file name extensions could only be 3 letters long ) . <p> In order for your web pages to be visible to people on the Internet , it must be installed into a " web server " " a machine with a connection to the Internet running special " web server software " . You typically obtain the services of a web hosting company such as LuxSci to provide you with such a server . They will tell you how to install your files on their servers . <p> You do NOT have to install your HTML files on a web server to preview them yourself . You can just save them to your local computer , then ( in Windows ) double click on them to display them in your default web browser , or open your favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then browse to and choose the file you wish to see . We recommend this method for previewing your work and making corrections before even thinking of installing it on your web server ( where anyone on the Internet may be able to see it ! ) Writing HTML is an iterative process of writing text , adding HTML tags , previewing , and making corrections . However , if you have 2 windows open one where you are editing your text file and one where you are previewing it this integrative process can be very fast and efficient . <p> So far , we have defined HTML as being some plain text with tags added ( of which we have only taught you the boldface tag ) . While this gives you " HTML marked-up text " , it is not a complete " web page " . To write a complete web page , you need to put your HTML marked-up text inside a simple framework <p> The entire web page contents must be enclosed in the " &lt;html&gt; ... &lt;/html&gt; " tags . These say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page is composed of 2 parts : the " header " which is enclosed in " &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; " tags and comes at the top of the document , and the " body " which is enclosed in " &lt;body&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; " tags and comes after the header . <p> Inside the header , you can optionally indicate the title of your web page by using the " &lt;title&gt; Enter Title Here &lt;/title&gt; " tags . This title , if included , will appear in the title bar of the viewers web browser ; it will not appear in the web page itself only stuff in the body of the web page appears there ! There are many other things you can include in the header , some of which we will cover later . The general purpose of the header is for the specification of information about the web page and instructions on how to better handle the contents of the body section . <p> You put all your HTML marked-up text inside the body section . This can be QUITE LONG there is no limit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you include a lot of text it may take a long time to download for your viewers who have slow Internet connections ( its nice to break up very large pages into several smaller pages for this reason and for peoples short attention span ! ) <p> The example is a complete web page . You can save it to disk and use it as a template for making your own web pages . Remember , the HTML tags are not case sensitive , so you can use " &lt;html&gt; ... &lt;/html&gt; " or " &lt;HTML&gt; ... &lt;/HTML&gt; " as you prefer ( but you should pick and stick with one for consistency ) . <h> 1.3 Tags , Tags , and More Tags <p> In this section we will introduce you to many of the basic tags of HTML and provide examples of their use . These effects can be all also accomplished using CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) and probably are better done that way ; however , when just learning HTML , its is good to lean these basic markup tags as well . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " b " tags : " &lt;b&gt;Bold Text&lt;/b&gt; " , yielding " Bold Text " . <p> Italic : To make text italic , enclose it in the " i " tags : " &lt;i&gt;Italic Text&lt;/i&gt; " , yielding " Italic Text " . <p> Underline : To make text underlined , enclose it in the " u " tags : " &lt;u&gt;Underline Text&lt;/u&gt; " , yielding " Underline Text " . Note that underlining text is different from making a link to another document , even though they often look the same . For this reason , it is advised to avoid underlining text unless absolutely necessary ( as in book titles ) to prevent confusion . <p> Strike-Out : To make a horizontal line through the middle of your text , enclose it in the " s " tags : " &lt;s&gt;Invalid Text&lt;/s&gt; " , yielding " Invalid Text " . <p> These tags can be nested ( as can most tags ) to produce a combination of effects , like bolded italic text : " &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bold Italic Text&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; " , yielding " Bold Italic Text " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse order that you opened them as in this example . <p> Paragraphs and Line Breaks . As you have probably already seen , HTML pretty much ignores your spaces and line breaks , running all your text together in 1 long line ( that wraps at the edge of the window ) . There are many ways of correcting this behavior , the simplest of which is the use of the break tag , " &lt;br&gt; " . This tag ( which is one of the few that does not come with an ending tag ) literally means " insert a line break here " . You can use multiple break tags in a row to insert blank lines in your page . You can also use the paragraph tag , " &lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt; " , Which marks the beginning and end of a paragraph of text . Text in a paragraph is separated from the rest of your web page by some vertical space before and after the paragraph . Paragraph tags are recommended over break tags for demarking paragraphs of text . <p> Example 1.3.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation&lt;/b&gt; is n't the first company to come up with a pie-in-the-sky idea promising to bring seamless wireless service to rural America . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some have proposed filling the coverage gaps by launching communication equipment on blimps , rockets and &lt;i&gt;solar-powered gliders&lt;/i&gt; . As yet , for a slew of financial and technological reasons , none has proven feasible . &lt;/p&gt; LONG ... LONG ... **43;363;TOOLONG **26;408;TOOLONG <p> Results : <p> Space Data Corporation is n't the first company to come up with a pie-in-the-sky idea promising to bring seamless wireless service to rural America . <p> Some have proposed filling the coverage gaps by launching communication equipment on blimps , rockets and solar-powered gliders . As yet , for a slew of financial and technological reasons , none has proven feasible . <p> Items : <p> SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL <p> EDUCATION IN-DEPTH <p> Font size : You can change the size of the text displayed in several ways . The easy way is to use the " &lt;big&gt; " and " &lt;small&gt; " tags which indicate the enclosed text should be " one step " larger or smaller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make text even bigger or even smaller ! I.e. " &lt;small&gt;Small Text&lt;/small&gt; " gives " Small Text " and " &lt;big&gt;Big Text&lt;/big&gt; " gives " Big Text " . <p> Another way to alter the size of your text is to use the " &lt;font&gt; " tag . This tag is interesting because it takes " parameters " which shape its function . For specifying the font size , you use " &lt;font size= " NN " &gt;your text&lt;/font&gt; " , where NN can be " +1 " , " +2 " , " -1 " , " -2 " , etc . These act just like the big and small tags ( for size= " +1 " and size= " -1 " , respectively ) and the nested big and small tags for greater changes in the font size , changing the size relative to whatever it currently is . You can also specify an " absolute " font size from 1 to 7 ( where 1 is very small , 7 is very large , and 3 is normal ) ( i.e. " &lt;font size= " 4 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bold face , and font size tags , you can now create nice headings and subheadings in your web pages . However , since this is such a common thing , HTML has six special heading tags : " &lt;h1&gt; " through " &lt;h6&gt; " . Level 1 headings ( h1 ) display the most prominent headings , and level 6 are the least prominent . Headings are usually displayed bold and with a larger font that the default body text . Most browsers also add some space before and after headings to further set them apart from the rest of your text . <h> Space Data <h> In the News <p> Space Data Corporation is n't the first company to come up with a pie-in-the-sky idea promising to bring seamless wireless service to rural America . <p> Space Data <p> In the News <p> Some have proposed filling the coverage gaps by launching communication equipment on blimps , rockets and solar-powered gliders . As yet , for a slew of financial and technological reasons , none has proven feasible . <p> Size 1Size 2Size 3Size 4Size 5Size 6Size 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag to change the color of your text as well . You do this by putting a color= " XXXX " parameter in the font tag with XXXX being the color you want . This color can be either the name of a color , or a 6-letter code for the color . The list of standard color codes can be obtained at : Web Monkey ( symbols ) , and at Netscape ( names ) . For example , you can make text red via " &lt;font color= " red " &gt;Red text&lt;/font&gt; " which will display " Red text " . You can have both color and size parameters in the same font tag , and you can nest font tags for a combination of effects . <p> Body Background Color : Now that you can change the color of text , you should also know that you can change the background color of you web page as a whole ! The body tag takes an optional parameter " bgcolor= " XXXX " " which specified the background color of the page . You specify " XXXX " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> My Blue Heading ! <p> Some have proposed filling the coverage gaps by launching communication equipment on blimps , rockets and solar-powered gliders . As yet , for a slew of financial and technological reasons , none has proven feasible . <p> While this example illustrates the use of color , it is kind of gaudy . You probably want to make use of much subtler colors in your web pages . This is something we will return to when we discuss aesthetics ! <p> Additional Formatting Tags <p> Horizontal Rule : The hr tag ( another tag without an end-tag ) produces a horizontal line across your page . This is perfect if you want to separate 2 parts of you page with a line ! <p> Block Quote : The blockquote tag encloses a set of text ( like the paragraph tag does ) . All the text enclosed is set apart from the surrounding text by adding vertical space before and after it , and by indenting the text on the left and right . These pages actually make heave use of the blockquote tag ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make lists of items . The two most used are ordered lists and unordered lists . In ordered lists , the items are numbered ; in unordered lists , the items are bulleted . You designate an ordered list with the ol tag and unordered lists with the ul tag . Between the begin and end list tags , you use the li tag to designate individual list items . Your can easily nest lists as well ! <p> Example 1.3.4 : Lists <p> LONG ... &lt;p&gt;Ethically acceptable incentives , not the checkbook , should be used to persuade people to donate organs and close the alarming gap between supply and demand of vital body parts , a group of doctors recommended in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Mindful that there has been limited success in persuading families to allow organs to be removed from dead loved ones , the doctors said new federal laws should encourage organ donations in the same the way society rewards other charitable gifts . &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Some US States&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; **25;436;TOOLONG **34;463;TOOLONG **27;499;TOOLONG &lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Results : <p> Ethically acceptable incentives , not the checkbook , should be used to persuade people to donate organs and close the alarming gap between supply and demand of vital body parts , a group of doctors recommended in last weeks New England Journal of Medicine . <p> Mindful that there has been limited success in persuading families to allow organs to be removed from dead loved ones , the doctors said new federal laws should encourage organ donations in the same the way society rewards other charitable gifts . <p> Some US States <p> Ohio <p> Massachusetts <p> Akaska <p> <p> Some Countries <p> Unites States <p> Canada <p> Comments : One very important part of programming ( and HTML as well ) is writing comments descriptive text telling you or others what you are doing , but which should not be included in the displayed output of your web page . To include a comment in your HTML document , simply enclose the comment text in the begin ( " &lt; ! -- " ) and end ( " --&gt; " ) comment symbols ; i.e. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also useful for stopping arbitrary blocks of HTML from being displayed . <p> Special Characters : ( HTML Entities ) Since ALL tags are defined via the left and right angle brackets , how would you actually display one of these symbols in your web page ? You use a so-called " character entity " ; a special set of symbols that stands for the character you want to display . These character entities always start with an ampersand ( " &amp; " ) and end with a semi-colon ( " ; " ) . The left angle bracket ( less than sign , " &lt; " ) is displayed using the set of symbols ( " &amp;lt ; " ) ; the right angle bracket ( greater-than sign , " &gt; " ) is displayed using the set of symbols ( " &amp;gt ; " ) . A complete set of character entities that you can use is given at Web Monkey . You can use either the name code or the number code as given in that web page . <p> Another very useful special character is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HTML " I really want a space here ! " To enter a non-breaking space , type " &amp;nbsp ; " . This will insert a space . If you put many of these in a two , you can do things like indent the first line of a paragraph , or separate words . It is called a non-breaking space , because if you put it between two words , like " my&amp;nbsp ; father " , HTML will NEVER wrap your text such that these 2 words would be on different lines it wo n't break them apart . Of course , this only works if there are no normal spaces , tabs or line feeds between these words , only non-breaking spaces , so " my&amp;nbsp ; father " would n't work because of the presense of the normal space ! <p> Example 1.3.5 : Comments and Entities <p> LONG ... &lt;p&gt;Ethically acceptable incentives , not the checkbook , should be used to &lt; ! -- persuade people to donate organs and close the alarming gap between supply and demand of vital body parts , a group of doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;55.379 &amp;lt ; 99.873&lt;/p&gt; **26;585;TOOLONG <p> Results : <p> Ethically acceptable incentives , not the checkbook , should be used to weeks New England Journal of Medicine . <p> 55.379 &lt; 99.873 <h> 1.4 URLs , Links , and Images <p> What is a URL ? URL stands for " Uniform Resource Locator " . It is a means by which you can refer to anything on the Internet an HTML page , an image , a video clip , etc . It is that text which appears in the Address line in your browser ad usually starts with " http : // " . For example , " https : //luxsci.com " is the URL for the home page of Lux Scientiae , and LONG ... is the URL for the character entities page on Web Monkey that we linked to above . <p> Links . To make a hyper-text link from your web page to some other web page , you use the anchor tag ( " &lt;a href= " URL " &gt;Displayed Text&lt;/a&gt; " ) . This tag takes the parameter href which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The text between the begin and end anchor tags will be displayed underlined and , if you click on it , you will be taken to the web page that corresponds to the specified URL . <p> The examples of URLs so far have all been absolute URLs , in that they include all the information needed to find the web page the protocol ( i.e. " http : // " ) , the domain ( i.e. " hotwired.lycos.com " ) , and the directory and file name on the web server ( i.e. LONG ... You can also specify a relative URL . Relative URLs can be relative to the domain or relative to the current directory . For this example , let us take this web page as the current URL , i.e. our Address line in our web browser says LONG ... Let us say that we want the syllabus page . Its absolute URL is LONG ... We can specify it via a URL relative to the current domain as " **41;613;TOOLONG " or via a URL relative to the current directory as " index.html @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative URLs is the presence of the " / " as the leading character . <p> It is usually best to use the simplest form of the URL that you can so that you are minimally dependent on the domain name or directory that your files are located in ; i.e. if you need to move your site someplace else , fewer changes will be needed if you use relative URLs . <h> Some Links <p> Images ! Now for what youve all been waiting for how to include an image in your web page ! Each image has a URL just like a web page does , only , instead of a text file ending in " . html " , an image is a binary file with an ending " . gif " , " . jpg " , or " . png " . Note that this means that images are not embedded in your web pages , only references to the locations of your images on the Internet are located in the web page ! <p> You include an image in your web page using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " WWW " height= " HHH " &gt; " . The image tag does not have an ending tag . The URL works just like the URL used for making links , except that it refers to an image and not a web page . You can optionally specify the size with which the image should be displayed using the width and height parameters . The " WWW " and " HHH " are the number of pixels ( dots ) wide and high that the image should be displayed . If you know how big the images is , you should include its dimensions here as it will make your web page load faster . <p> You can also dynamically change the size of your image to any width or height you like using these parameters . The web browser will automatically resize the image to the specified size you can get some pretty interesting stretching and compressing effects this way ! <p> Copyright Most images that you find on the web are copyrighted . You should NOT download and use them on your web sites unless you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Any you should especially not just link to someone elses images on their web sites ( using their server and bandwidth to serve you viewers is a bad thing ) . <p> Linking Images One interesting trick is to nest the link tag and the image tag so that you can click on an image to go to a new web page ! <p> This example shows how to include images in your web page and also how to resize the image . Note that relying on the web browser to resize your images for you will often result in a poor quality result . It is better to resize your images in a graphics tools such as Adobe Photoshop for making professional-looking web sites . <p> Note the new center tag we have also introduced which causes everything inside to be centered in your web page ! <h> 1.5 Your Homework ! <p> Now it is time to practice what you have learned here . Your assignment is to do the following : <p> Create your " home page " the front page of your personal web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You should include your name , a picture of you or something that represents you , and some quotation that you like . Include links to other web sites that you like or use a lot . <p> Use as many of the HTML concepts we have taught here as possible , while making the page look nice and present your information readably the whole idea of a resume is to impress someone , so it should look good ! <p> Make a prominent link to this page on the home page you created in part 1 . <h> 1.6 Additional Resources <p> There are lots of web sites out there which expound on HTML and all the features and usages of these tags ( and the tags that we have n't yet mentioned ) .

Setup email forwarding from your old address to your new one . <p> Your old free email provider should have a mechanism or configuration option where you can forward your new inbound email to another email address . - If you cant find it ask their Support for assistance . - You will want to forward email going to your old address to your new address . - This ensures that any email going to your old address is properly delivered to your new system . - You will no longer need to check your email at the old provider ! <p> 2 . Migrate your old email to your new provider <p> If you have a lot of email sitting in your INBOX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to copy this to the new system to " get it out of there " . - If your old provider provides IMAP access to your email ( so you can connect via Outlook and keep your email folders on the server , for example ) , you can either : <p> Drag and drop your email from your old folders to your new ones at your new provider by setting up both accounts in your email program ( i.e. Outlook , Thunderbird , Mac Mail , etc . ) <p> Have your new provider perform an automated managed copy of all your old email to your new account(s) for you ( e.g. Luxsci.com does this for a small fee ) . <p> If your old provider does not provide IMAP access , but does provide POP access , then you can either : <p> Download all your email to your computer using POP and the copy it back up to your new account using IMAP <p> Download it all to your computer using POP and keep it there <p> Use a POP-download tool at your new provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account ( LuxSci provides such a tool free of charge ) . <p> 3 . Update your marketing materials <p> Next , you should update your business cards , letter head , envelopes , web sites , and any other advertising or branded materials to show your new email address instead of your old one . <p> If you have a " signature " , " tagline " , or " disclaimer " at the end of your email messages , check to be sure that those too use your new email address . <p> 4 . Let everybody know about your new address <p> This is a good excuse to send a bulk email to your customers and vendors letting them know about your change of email address . - Maybe also let them know more about your business , products , services , or specials while you are at it . - If you have a large contact list , you may need to use a bulk mailing service to send these out . <p> 5 . Create an Auto-Responder <p> At your old or new email provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails back a notice to folks to send you messages at you new email address . - This notice would inform them of the change of address . - If your old provider does not have this feature , your new one may ( LuxSci allows you to have custom auto-responses that fire based on , many factors , for example , to what address the message was sent ) . <p> 6 . Use your new address and account exclusively . <p> At this point , you should never be using your old free email address for sending out email messages . <p> 7 . Keep the old address <p> In most cases , there is no need to disable or delete the old email address immediately or even at all . - If you are not using it , then all it will do is sit idle and forward to you any miss-addressed email messages . <p> 8 . Final considerations <p> If you get a lot of Spam at your old email address , then perhaps you do want to stop forwarding your email as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . - Or , at least be sure that your new provider has really good spam filtering ! <p> Free email providers often have security issues and are sometimes attacked . - Be sure that the password to your old account is changed and is very good . - Also be sure that any security questions and answers you can enter there are also very good and hard to guess .

It contains forms , news and some company polices and procedures but no patient information whatsoever . Thank you . " <p> Thank you for your question ! - Here , we delve into how you can answer this for your site . <h> When does a web site need HIPAA compliance ? <p> HIPAA compliance is specifically needed when electronic protected health information ( ePHI what is ePHI ? ) is stored in , transmitted through , or accessible through a web site . - Common examples of these situations include : <p> Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) web sites <p> Patient portals <p> Email systems for sending or receiving messages <p> Any web site providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form that could be collecting- or producing ePHI <p> Let 's break the example given in the question down to see if it qualifies or not . This web site contains : <p> Company policies and procedures . This is information about the company and not about specific patients . - It would be public information , not ePHI , and thus would not trigger HIPAA . <p> News . As long as this news does not identify any specific patients and thus does not include ePHI , it would not trigger HIPAA. - For example , the notice of a 5k charity road race or of upcoming holiday hours is not ePHI. - However , news consisting of a success story of how a particular patient did really well could be ePHI. - It could be Ok to publish anyway if the story is already public ( e.g. due to the patients actions ) or if the patient has given written consent . - Otherwise , such a story may well include- ePHI and would require all of the trappings of HIPAA to protect it from being viewed by unauthorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIPAA " gotchas " for small web sites . - A form itself- is not ePHI , but it may well be the case that when someone fills out the form and submits it , that data contains ePHI ( or that data in context is ePHI ) . - If the user can enter arbitrary information s/he may put sensitive medical data in there even if you give instructions not to . - Even filling out a simple request for consultation or information form may result in ePHI coming your way . - These forms must be HIPAA-compliant when they are filled out online . <p> A simple web site generally does not ned HIPAA compliance . - A simple web site that has online forms would do very well to protect those forms with the level or security and privacy - required by HIPAA. - This will certainly make your HIPAA risk analysis go much better ! - Fortunately , this is pretty easy to do . The simplest thing is to move the form itself to a HIPAA-compliant form processing provider , like LuxSci SecureForm. - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just upgrade your forms to achieve compliance and to still receive the form submissions business as usual . <h> But my forms are different ! <p> As long as you allow people to enter free-form text in your forms , you have lost control over what they may send you . - You know it some people will find a way to squeeze in their whole life story into a little box in the hope that you will hear them and help . <p> You can make disclaimers such as " do not put any sensitive information here " or " by filling out this form you give consent that it may be delivered insecurely , " however , unless you take some pains to ensure that they really see and understand this consent and that they explicitly agree to it- ( note : tacit agreement though the action of filling out the form does not count , legally ) , - then this may not be a good escape clause for you . - Furthermore , HIPAA states that you should take reasonable precautions to protect ePHI if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and inexpensive to properly secure a form , not doing it and soliciting information that is , or could be , ePHI would- be looked upon as somewhat negligent if there were to be a breach . <h> What if your forms are the kind that patients download and fill out and bring in ? <p> In this case , the forms do not contain ePHI and you are not providing an avenue for patients to send you ePHI electronically , so HIPAA does not apply . - However , would be very respectful of your patients/users to provide these forms through a secured site ( e.g. over SSL/TLS ) . <p> Why ? <p> Because if the connection is not secured , then the content of your web pages can be modified between your site and the end user without anyone knowing . - You may think that this is far fetched , but it happens . - Its done often to infest end users with malware and spyware . <p> The attack could be much more malicious and targeted . - It could change the link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different file with different content and different instructions . - E.g. , this new PDF could be an online form that requests that users fill it out and press " submit " . and then the attacker captures their sensitive data . - There are a multitude of possible scenarios : some obvious and some very subtle . - In this day and age when medical information is of high value to attackers , proactively respecting patient privacy is of high business importance .

- However , many users wonder how this is even possible , while others are concerned if their Spam filters are not catching these messages . <h> How can Spammers use your email address to send Spam ? <p> The way that email works at a fundamental level , there is very little validation performed on the apparent identity of the " Sender " of an email. - Just as you could mail a letter at the post office and write any return address on it , a Spammer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " email address and name. - This is in fact very easy to do , and Spammers use this facility with almost every message that they send . <p> So , while you do own your domain name and can lock down the accounts you are using to send and receive email , there is no way to prevent someone else from sending an email message that purports to be from you or some address at your domain. - The best you can do is to use SPF- and/or DKIM or PGP or S/MIME- digital signatures to allow your recipients to verify the messages if they want to ( though most recipients may not know how to use these technologies ) . - E. g. with SPF and/or DKIM , recipients ( including yourself ) can use Spam Filters to determine that these messages were not authorized and can thus discard them as fraudulent . <h> Why do Spammers send you Spam that appears to be from you ? <p> Sending email to you that appears to be from you is an increasingly popular Spamming trick. - As spam filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding their own email addresses and/or the their domain names to their spam filtering allow lists. - The intention is to ensure that no email from other people in their organization ( or that they send to themselves ) is ever caught in the spam filter by mistake because no one in their domain is sending spam , right ? <p> The problem is that as soon as you add your own email address or domain name to your spam filtering allow list , all email from these addresses will sail through your spam filters ( as requested ) . - This includes all Spam email where the sender address is forged to appear to be from you. - It is not really from you , but the only thing that the Spam filters allow lists care about is whether the From address is on your allow list or not . <p> So , users who see that their spam filters are being ineffective against email that appears to be " from themselves " probably have their email address or domain name on their own allow list and thus have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the alternatives to having yourself on your allow list ? <p> Of course , most people do not want to take their domain or address off of their allow list for the very reason they put it there in the first place they do n't  want to risk having their internal email caught in the filters. - So , what can they do that will meet this requirement and still allow the forged messages to be filtered ? <p> The best thing to do is to add only the Internet addresses ( IP- addresses ) of any servers from which you send email ( e.g. SMTP servers and WebMail servers ) to your allow list instead ( if your spam filter allow list supports this ) . - This way , messages sent from the servers that you and your coworkers actually use for sending email will be allowed ( and thus you will not lose internal email ) ; however , messages sent from other servers ( even if those messages appear to be " from you " ) will be subject to the normal filtering process. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if you add DKIM and SPF to further assist your Spam filter in identifying fraudulent messages . <h> But are not DKIM or SPF good enough ? <p> It is true that DKIM and SPF can be used to block email send from servers that are not authorized to send email from your domain ; however , how everyone is willing to allow their filters to be so harsh as to block all messages that fail SPF or DKIM test as that can happen for many different reasons . - As a result , failed SPF and DKIM checks commonly make a message more spam-like , but do not always force the message to be considered spam . - Contact your filtering provider if you want to update your spam filter so that SPF or DKIM failures will cause the message to be rejected . <h> So , what do we recommend ? <p> Make sure you have robust , reliable spam filtering software , and make sure that its enabled . <p> Make sure that any catch-all email aliases are turned off ( the ones that accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to you anyway these are giant spam traps ) . <p> Make sure that your email address and your domain name are NOT on your own allow or white list(s) . <p> Make sure that , if you are using your address book as a source of addresses to allow , that your own address is NOT in there ( or else do n't  white list your address book ) . <p> Add the Internet IP address(es) of the servers from which you do send email to your allow list , if possible. - Contact your email provider for assistance in obtaining this list and updating your filters with it . <p> If you want to go further , consider use of technologies such as PGP or S/MIME for cryptographic signing of individual messages and consider " closed " email systems where only the participants can send messages to each other . <p> me " lists , you may find yourself the target of increasing amounts of spam even spam appearing to come from yourself or backscatter spam where your address was used to send spam to others. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see that this is a Spam message where the sender has forged the message so that the apparent " from " address matches the " to " address to attempt to get around our spam filters. - For more on this technique , see Save Yourself From " Yourself " : Stop Spam From Your Own Address . 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

The user has the opportunity to read the agreement , ask questions , gain clarification , and to NOT agree if s/he does not understand or in fact just does not agree .

With the US Government striking down a set of privacy laws that were set to boost individual rights on the internet , things are getting pretty grim . <p> In recent years , VPNs have become more popular for personal use as individuals attempt to reclaim some sense of anonymity online . Given how many entities could be looking at your activity " governments , advertisers , your ISP and criminals " a VPN is one of many tools you can use to help protect yourself . VPNs can also be useful for circumventing censorship or accessing geo-restricted content . <p> A VPN can be excellent for helping you stay safe online , but you also need to be aware of the limitations . Unfortunately , VPNs are n't  some magic technology that immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your security . <p> You also need to be aware that not all VPNs are created equal . In fact , the VPN industry is incredibly messy and the dodgy operators far outnumber the good . There is a huge disparity in the services and protection level that are on offer . This ranges from the free VPNs , which are poorly regarded , to the scammy companies that are just in it to make a buck , to the more trusted options that generally have good reputations . Finding a reliable VPN is n't the end of the battle . You also have to set it up and use it properly . <h> Does Using a VPN Make You a Target ? <p> VPNs help to obscure your identity online , so it is only natural to assume that they attract a fair amount of illegal activity . Of course , there are many legitimate reasons to use a VPN as well , but that does n't  stop the authorities from paying extra attention to VPN servers . <p> When the details of the NSA tool , Xkeyscore , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion that governments would target users of privacy-enhancing technology such as TOR and VPNs . <p> Just because these technologies are being monitored , does n't  mean that you should avoid using them . It means that you should look for high quality vendors that you can trust , preferably those based outside the jurisdictions of hardcore surveillance states . <h> Can You Trust a VPN ? How Do You Know If They Are Telling the Truth ? <p> VPNs encrypt your traffic only between the VPN client on your device and the VPN server . This means that your ISP and others can not see the details of what is traveling through them . This is great if you do n't  trust your ISP or the government . The problem is that you have to place your trust in your VPN provider instead . <p> Given how many dodgy operators there are on the market , finding a VPN you can trust is n't all that easy . In your search for a reliable provider , you will encounter many VPNs that promise anonymity , say that they do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never hand over your data to the authorities . How do you know if this is true ? <p> It can be difficult to find out just how genuine an operator is , but one of the first steps is to see how transparent they are . Is their privacy policy available on their website ? Do they give you the technical details of their encryption ? What happens when you ask them questions ? <p> If any of this is hidden or they rebuff basic questions about their jurisdiction or their logging policy , run for the hills . If they ca n't be clear and honest with you upfront , they probably are n't  a service that you can rely on . <p> Another good way to judge the reliability of a VPN is by looking at its past performance . Give the provider a quick Google to see if it has received any news coverage . If you check out the provider HideMyAss , for example , you will see that they have previously given the authorities data on a LulzSec hacker , while PIAs log policy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep activity logs . <h> What Payment Methods Do They Accept ? What Details Do They Need ? <p> If you are engaging a service in an attempt to stay anonymous , you do n't  want to give them any details that could be linked back to you . If your VPN provider only accepts credit cards and asks for a stack of personal details , these are huge red flags that they do not respect privacy . <p> An ideal VPN provider should accept payment in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies , but you still need to be cautious with your payment . If you do n't  clean your Bitcoin through tumblers , the money can still be traced back to you . A good VPN provider shouldnt need any more of your information than a burner email address . <h> Does the VPN Provider Take Logs ? <p> Many VPNs will log your connection times or even your activity . There can be legitimate reasons for doing this , such as to assist in managing their servers . Despite this , any logging adds an extra element of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company for the records of a user , few executives will risk going to jail over noncompliance . In all likelihood , they will give up all of the information that they have on the suspect . If they do n't  keep logs , then there is n't much that they can give to the authorities . <p> If a VPN provider keeps activity logs or even connection logs , agencies can use this data to piece a case together against a suspect . This is why it is important to choose a provider that does n't  take any logs , particularly if you are engaged in any high stakes activities . <h> Where Is the VPN Provider Based ? <p> The location of the servers and where an operator is legally incorporated will also impact how much you can rely on a VPN . If it is based in the US or any of the 14 Eyes ( Australia , Canada , New Zealand , the US , the UK , Denmark , France , the Netherlands , Norway , Germany , Belgium , Italy , Spain and Sweden ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . <p> This is because the spy network between these countries shares information . Given what we 've seen since the NSA releases , it is not unreasonable to suspect that VPNs in these locations could be compromised . <p> If you are engaging in a high risk activity , choosing a VPN from outside of these countries probably wont be enough to keep you safe . In this case , it is probably best to combine a VPN with other privacy technologies such as TOR . <p> Ideally , you should look for a VPN that is based in a country with a high degree of internet freedom . It is also best to stay away from areas that are renowned for online crime , such as Eastern Europe . <h> What Type of Encryption Does the Provider Use ? <p> VPNs mainly use the L2TP/IPSec , PPTP or Open VPN protocols . The first two are considered insecure . If you are serious about your security , you will want to choose a provider that offers AES-256 encryption with the OpenVPN protocol . <h> The Danger of DNS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? Not necessarily . If your VPN is n't configured properly , you could have a DNS leak that exposes your activity to your ISP and other parties . To keep your activity private , you need to make sure that your DNS requests are- routed through your VPN providers DNS servers . When choosing a VPN , make sure that it has DNS leak protection to help keep you safe . <p> You can check whether the DNS request is going through your VPN providers servers by visiting DNS leak test.com . If your real IP address shows up , you have a DNS leak . If the request is being routed through your VPNs DNS servers , it should show the IP address of the server instead . <h> The Problem with Free VPNs <p> A VPN service costs money to run . If you are n't  paying the service provider , then who is ? The answer is usually advertisers . Many free VPNs make their money by selling your data to marketers , while others plaster their service with ads or give you limited bandwidth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy and security , it is generally recommended that you stay away from free services . If you are n't  paying them , then they do n't  have much motivation to keep you safe . Given how many paid VPNs are dodgy , the free market is even more of a minefield . <h> The Market Is Manipulated by Affiliate Schemes <p> Have you ever Googled VPN reviews ? Did you find any of the links helpful ? You may want to consider throwing all of that research out the window , because the vast majority of VPN review sites are fraudulent . <p> Many VPN providers have a number of affiliates who they pay to write positive reviews on their products . We wont link you to any of these dishonest sites to avoid giving them any extra traffic , but there are many fake reviews out there . You need to be especially cautious whenever you are researching . <p> How can you tell if a review site is fake ? One hint is if the site has high levels of praise for any of the dodgy operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep mentioning the same companys name all over the site . A good review should also discuss the shortcomings of a VPN . If they do n't  say anything bad about a VPN " and all VPNs have their issues " then its pretty safe to bet that you can dismiss the opinion altogether . <p> There is at least one source out there that can give you relatively unbiased reviews . That One Privacy Site features a helpful comparison chart as well as more in-depth reviews on a range of VPNs . The site does n't  categorically tell you which is best , instead it gives you all of the information you need to make the decision for yourself . <h> Which VPN Is Right for You ? <p> Everyone will have different needs and abilities when it comes to using a VPN , so it is impossible to name a single option that fits all use cases . The right one will depend on what you want to do with it . <p> If you just want a VPN for accessing geo-restricted content such as foreign Netflix or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of some of the free trials and see which ones work for you . Because this is a relatively low risk activity , you do n't  need to be too concerned about the log policy or the jurisdiction of your VPN . <p> If you are looking for a VPN that offers you a higher degree of protection , you will need to think about exactly how you want to use it and what features you will need . It is best to do your own research to get an idea of which VPN will fulfill your needs . <p> Make sure that you avoid affiliate sites " one of the better places to look for relatively impartial reviews and comparisons is on That One Privacy Site . The site owner seems relatively committed to staying objective " they even give away any donations that come fromV PN providers to charity , so that they do n't  sway the sites opinions . Another very good review of VPN services for 2017 is from The Torrent Freak . <p> The world of VPNs can be confusing and it is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some VPNs that offer a reasonable service include AirVPN , BlackVPN , BolehVPN , iVPN , Mullvad , NorpVPN , oVPN , SecureVPN and VikingVPN . Do your own research to find one that suits your needs best .

This message blocking often happens even if a user is sending outbound email through a legitimate email provider like LuxSci . <p> Users invariably ask : <p> Why is the mail blocked even though I am sending through LuxSci or some other email provider and not directly from my ISP ? <p> What can I do about it ? <p> Fortunately , there is a good reason why the blocks occur and an easy solution to them anonymous SMTP- service- to hide your IP address . <h> Why are so many ISPs commonly on Blacklists ? <p> Well , its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally ) , it is certain IP- addresses or ranges of IP- addresses that the ISP gives to its customers . <p> ISPs really have a choice and do one of two things regarding outbound email : <p> Do not allow customers to send outbound email except using the ISPs own email servers. - I.e. they block port 25 ( the standard SMTP- port that all email servers use to communicate with each other ) outbound , so that spammers can not use their services to send spam as easily . <p> They are more permissive and allow anyone to connect to any server on port 25 so that they can send email messages . <p> Choice 1 : Block SMTP <p> The ISP really cuts down on the amount of spam that can be sent from its networks and has much less blacklisting. - However , this really hurts customers who have email services with third party providers , like LuxSci , as they can not send email using the " standard port " of 25. - Many email providers have no alternative ports and this results in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet service to do their jobs or send and receive email with the company they desire . <p> Other email providers , like LuxSci , provide alternate " ports " that customers can use to send outbound email in the case that , for example , port 25 is blocked like this. - This permits " business as usual " even in this scenario where things are blocked by the ISP. - ISPs actually like this , as it allows these customers to get the service they need ( authenticated SMTP with a real provider ) while the ISPs can still stomp out the SPAM . <p> Choice 2 : Allow SMTP <p> By allowing outbound connections on port 25 , ISPs are " nice " to their users and also allow spammers to send spam email from their network. - The best they can do is to take action and disable spammer accounts if there are complaints. - However , by that time its is already too late and the IP- address(es) used by the spammers are already blocked by many places. - The unfortunate thing is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone could be assigned this blocked IP- address later on . resulting in that unfortunate user being suddenly blocked when they did nothing wrong themselves and when everything was previously working fine ! <p> These blocks on IP addresses last from hours to months to forever , depending upon the blacklist in question and the severity of the spam transgression. - Most of the major ones will de-list IP addresses after a few days or weeks if there has been no serious continuing activity. - On the other hand , some blacklists will block not just the single problem IP address , but all 255 IP- addresses that are " near to it " in one fell swoop. - So , your IP could be blocked merely as a " side effect " of someone elses malicious efforts on a similar IP- address . Oh the pain . <h> OK , but if I am sending through a reputable company , like LuxSci , how can the sent email still be blacklisted ? <p> Good question ! - You would think that if you send mail through a respected email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would not be any chance that your email would be blocked. - That used to be the case years ago , but blacklists have become smarter . <p> When you send an email message , part of the message is the so-called " email header " that contains information about the message such as the subject , sender , recipients , etc. , - plus a bunch of " Received " lines that document the path the message took through the Internet . Every computer that touches the message , as it transits from you to your recipients , puts its own two cents there describing from what server it received the message , when it got the message , and other statistics . <p> This set of " Received " header lines provides a kind of " audit trail " that allows anyone to look and see where the message traveled and also to see where any delays occurred. - The first " Received " header line will generally be made by- the outgoing email server to which the email program on your computer connects ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it did so. - That line will contain the IP- address of your computer as granted to your by your ISP ( or hotel , or office , etc . ) ! <p> Spam blocking services have gotten smarter in that they no longer just look at the servers talking directly to them to see if they are to be blocked . - Now-a-days , they also look at several or all of the Received lines to see if any of the machines along the way should not be trusted. - If your mobile phone or personal computers IP- address is on a blacklist and that IP address is recorded anywhere in the message headers , then the spam blacklist analysis can see that and block the message ! <h> Example bounce due to this situation : <p> Here is an example bounce message that came in to a LuxSci user because his/her Comcast IP- address was on the SpamHaus blacklist ( the information in this example has been modified to be generic ) : <p> The original message was received at We 'd , 18 Oct 2013 04:46:12 -0600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading. - At first glance , it looks like the server " rsXX.luxsci.com " is blocked by SpamHaus.org. - But that is not actually the case. - What is blocked is the IP- address " 44.44.44.44 " , which is not a LuxSci server at all and which actually belonged to Comcast ( well , the actual IP- did 44.44.44.44 does n't  ) . - You can always look up information about an IP- address by using a service like this one . <p> So , even though this user was sending outbound email through LuxSci , the message was blocked by SpamHaus because his/her Comcast the IP- address was blacklisted and that IP was recorded in the email message headers . <p> What 's the Solution ? <p> WebMail : One solution is to send outbound email via a WebMail service , like LuxScis WebMail portal. - WebMail services are accessed by a web browser ( like Chrome , FireFox , or Internet Explorer ) will not generally include your computers IP- address in the message header ( LuxScis wont ) and thus any blacklisting of your IP- address will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to this issue for a very long time our " Anonymous SMTP Service " . - With this approach , the user configures his/her email program to send outbound email via a special alternate port ( either 587 , 6025 , or 6465 , which we use for all sorts of things related to special care and handling of outbound email for customers ) . - When sent via an anonymous SMTP port , all kinds of unneeded information is removed from the message headers such as : <p> What email program you are using <p> What operating system you are using <p> Any custom information and comments added by your email program <p> The IP address that your computer is using <p> Thus , with anonymization enabled , there is no way for the spam filters to associate the message with your blocked ISP IP- address they can only track it back to LuxScis servers. - It also means that no one can tell from where in the world you are actually sending email or what software you are using . <p> So , if you are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are included free with any account that has regular SMTP service ( even our high volume bulk email service ) at no additional cost . <p> an in-house solution , your outbound email comes from your ISPs IP address , which could be easily blacklisted ( even if it is not your fault ) . Additionally , many ISPs block outbound email sent from their <p> However , because port 25 is standard for outbound email , many ISPs , wifi networks , hotels , airports , and other locations that provide Internet access will arbitrarily block any connections to servers ( except perhaps their own ) on port 25 in order to stop spammers from using their services for the sending of spam , viruses , or malware and to prevent their IP addresses from being black listed . 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

When they write me back from their regular email address ( its often hard to get them to sign up at LuxSci ) , they are putting PHI /Medical Information out without security , but that is not my HIPPA violation as I understand it because patients are not required to keep their PHI secure . Yet often a patient replying to my email simply hits reply and my email is attached to their reply , putting my original email in an insecure from on the Internet . Does that become therefore a HIPPA violation of mine , especially if I continue to allow this without telling the patient to stop doing this ? <p> Hello ! <p> It seems that you are referring to sending email messages to patients via " SMTP TLS " i.e. where the message is encrypted in transit but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal message once it arrives at the recipients email servers . In this case , it is indeed true that when the patient replies , you have no control over the security of the message . It could be secured using TLS , or it could be insecure . You are correct in your understanding that the security of this reply is , strictly speaking , up to the patient and it is not your breach if it goes insecurely . In fact , patents can even legitimately request that you send them messages insecurely through a process called mutual consent . <p> You do have a good point , however . If your messages encourage them to reply and/or if you know that they are going to be replying insecurely , then you may have some responsibility . Generally , this would be addressed by : <p> Clearly stating in your message that replies may be insecure and that direct replies are not desirable . You can and should even provide some guidance as to the risks involved . In reality , you should probably have this training and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage with them over email in this way in the spirit of mutual consent . <p> You can include a link in your message that they can click on and use to send messages to you securely . Providing a method for secure communications legitimizes your communications with them . If they choose to reply insecurely , at least that was their explicit choice in this case . LuxSci customers can send users to https : //securesend.luxsci.com , where they can register and send the messages for free . <p> You could choose to forego use of " just " SMTP TLS and to always use a more secure method of email delivery . E.g. use of SecureLine Escrow would save the sensitive email on the server and send the patient an emailed notice to pick up the message .

Any replies from there are automatically secure . <p> As with many things in HIPAA , the choice of what implementation is best for your business and patients is up to you .

@@22227208 @2227208/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> We get calls and text messages from pharmacies like CVS , reminding us that it is time to pick up and/or renew our prescriptions for drugs or other medical items . When you think about HIPAA , this is confusing . In many cases , these reminders constitute Protected Health Information ( PHI ) so is this really allowed ? <p> The default answer of " it must be OK if CVS is doing it " is naive as it loses all of the context about what is and is not permitted and does not she 'd any insight into when and how other organizations may similarly inform or remind patients of things such as prescriptions and appointments . <h> Is it really PHI ? <p> A prescription notice or an appointment reminder is PHI in many cases . From the definition of PHI , it is , succinctly , health-related information that is identifiable . Clearly , these are messages identifiable as they are coming to your phone ( phone number ) or email address and those are explicit identifiers under HIPAA . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisioning of healthcare " ( which is what an appointment reminder is ) and also about " present medical conditions or care " ( which a prescription notice would be ) . <p> So , yes . In most cases , these notices are PHI . <p> The grey area would be a message that is excessively generic . For example : " You have a prescription ready for pick up at CVS . " This is about your current medical care but it is so generic it says nothing other than that you are under medical treatment for something . It is technically PHI , but might slide . If the message instead ended with something like " pick up at the Acme AIDs Clinic " instead of " at CVS " then there would not be any gray area at all . <h> Is sending these messages permitted ? <p> Many people and government organizations have had a lot to say about sending these notices . Reading through them can be confusing . Here is a simple breakdown of some of the major areas : <p> The notices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance that exempts communications about prescriptions reminders from being considered " marketing " for the drugs in question . This gives healthcare facilities greater flexibility in communicating this information to patients and allows for them to disclose prescription information to third parties as needed for this process ( e.g. to CVS ) . This guidance removes 1 obstacle in sending the notices : the laws against encouraging patients to buy specific drugs . <p> The FCC allows it . The FCC ( Federal Communications Commission ) has many rules about what kinds of communications are allowed and which are restricted . E.g. sending unsolicited email is restricted by the CAN-SPAM act . They also have rules about robot-calls and texts restricting an organization from calling , faxing , or texting to solicit business unless that person has given prior express consent to be contacted . The FCC exempts healthcare-related messages from these restrictions . <p> So it is permitted to send patients appointment reminders , prescription notices , and the like . It is permitted in the sense that you do not need the patients prior consent to send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government because you are sending the message . <h> The big question : How can I send them ? <p> Just because you are permitted to send message does not mean that you are free to choose any method of delivery . <p> For a long time , it has been OK to send these messages via postal mail and phone message ( which is not yet considered form or electronic communication go figure ) . Back in 2002 , the government issued guidance about this very topic and we still can get phone call reminders today , and that seems to be fine . Even messages left on answering machines are considered OK ( though that seems to be a gray area to me like sending FAXes is ) . <p> What people really want are email and text message notices and reminders . These types of messages are clearly electronic and thus fall squarely under HIPAAs Security Rule and its requirements for encryption , authentication , etc . <p> Combining what we have learned , text message and email message notices and requests can be sent without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured according to the HIPAA Security Rule . This means no insecure emails or regular text messages . It does mean encryption , recipient identity verification , logging , and all the trappings of HIPAA compliance . <p> You can get around the need for encryption . HIPAA permits patients to consent to receive insecure messages if they have been advised on the risks involved and if a ( secure ) alternative is available . This is called " Mutual Consent " . <p> You may notice , that before you start getting text-message notices from CVS , you had to approve that it is OK . This is their " mutual consent " agreement . To the extent that they provide good alternatives to insecure texting , provide sufficient training to the patient on the risks of insecure messages , and otherwise meet all of the facets of mutual consent that is complicated , nuanced , and really , really a gray area . <h> What should you do if you wish to send notices and reminders ? <p> Be sure to invest in a secure email and/or secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive and easy to use , so the bar is low enough that there is no excuse under HIPAA for not using them . Be sure that you follow the best practices for consent if you wish to send insecure notices . And finally , be sure that you are keeping your own HIPAA-compliance up-to-date with yearly reviews , risk analyses , etc.

Your message is then re-emailed to the intended recipients . <p> The end result is that the recipients get messages that look just like they would have without the anonymous service , except that now they can only track the message back to your LuxSci SMTP servers . They know who you are , based on your email address and your message content , but they have no way of knowing where you are or what email programs you are using ! You have masked your IP , hiding it from view . <p> What this service DOES N'T do is provide a method for potential spammers to conceal their identity . LuxSci 's anonymous SMTP service logs all information that it scrubs from the messages and tracks all activity for internal auditing purposes . So , while your recipients do not know your computer address , LuxSci does - as does your account administrator . This prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send unsolicited or forged email ; LuxSci can quickly respond to complaints or abuse , identify the sender , and terminate the account and/or bring legal measures to bear . <p> What this service DOES do is provide a level of privacy in the sending of email from your email programs that is functionally equivalent to the level of privacy that you get from sending through our WebMail interface . It also helps you solve email sending problems that may arise if your ISP is blacklisted . <p> The hidden IP address from which you are sending is logged for auditing purposes , just like it is with normal SMTP . This means that you , your account administrator , and LuxSci support can see reports of your SMTP connections and the IP addresses you are connecting from . However , no one else can access this information . Thus you have good privacy and good security - auditing . <p> LuxSci 's Anonymous SMTP Service is complete , easy to use , and part of any email and web hosting package when you order " SMTP Relaying " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have any questions ! 5314 @qwx205314 5318 @qwx205318 5319 @qwx205319 5315 @qwx205315 5317 @qwx205317 5323 @qwx205323

You have to change how email encryption is selected . - Instead of allowing senders to choose which messages need encryption you force all messages to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . - With this simple change : <p> As messages are sent encrypted by default , mistakes generally result in messages going encrypted instead of being sent insecurely. - There is no breach . <p> When messages do go insecurely , the sender must have willfully indicted that the message does not contain ePHI . There is a much smaller chance of error here , and with these decisions being logged and tracked , users can be directly " on the hook " for what is sent insecurely. - They ca n't blame a mistake nearly as legitimately as they can with " opt in " encryption . <p> So when choosing your HIPAA-complaint email vendor , choose one that does opt-out encryption and stay away from the risks involved with opt-in encryption.

To accomplish this verification a public/private pair of encryption keys is used . The most notable use of public/private key pairs in email is with S/MIME or PGP for encrypting an email itself . Outside of email anyone who browses the web has benefited from public/private key pairs , as they are used to establish the SSL-encrypted connection of any reputable website for things like entering payment information securely . <p> With DKIM , a special signature string is created from the private key , the message body , and some of the headers from within the email you are sending . The recipient 's server then uses the public key to verify the signature was created using the matching private key . Since the private key is on your server , and has not been shared with anyone , only email sent from your server with the correct private key will pass this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages can then be completely denied as invalid or let through ( possibly to a separate folder ) for review before deciding it is unwanted email . <p> For DKIM to work properly your email servers need to be setup for signing outbound email and verifying inbound email , which is precisely what we have done here at LuxSci . <p> Outbound <p> Outbound DKIM uses the private key for your domain to create the signature for each email you send .

Allowing employees to bring and use their own devices for work purposes generally means that they are more comfortable and efficient at using them . It also saves businesses from purchasing and replacing devices as technology progresses . <p> BYOD policies are n't  exactly a win-win situation for enterprises , as these benefits come with a range of security complications . One of the biggest questions is which operating system is better , Android or iOS ? <p> Despite Android dominating the rest of the market , in a 2015 survey ( the latest reliable data ) iOS dominated the enterprise scene with 66% of devices . Although there are n't  any more recent figures that can be trusted , Androids security issues over the last few years may have acted as a deterrent for uptake in the business environment . <p> Android is open source in nature , while iOS is closed source . While there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen it develop more significant security issues than its rival OS . <p> Another key issue that Android faces is its fragmentation across the market . Six months out from its release , Androids latest version , Nougat , has seen little more than a 1% adoption rate . About 31% of users are still using the previous version , Marshmallow , while about the same number again are using the version before that , Lollipop . iOS 10 was released at a similar time , however it is already used on 76% of devices . <p> This is largely due to Android being used across devices from a wide range of manufacturers , including many budget models . Each manufacturer can add their own software to their Android devices , which results in security complications that Apple does n't  have to deal with . Apple only has to worry about its own devices , which makes it much easier to deploy the latest versions of their operating system . <h> Androids Security History <p> Android has made the headlines again and again for security flaws , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor iOS instead . These flaws appear year on year , with some capable of unfettered access to the devices without the user needing to interact at all . Android suffers from its version fragmentation as well as lack of control when it comes to firmware . These responsibilities fall on the shoulders of manufacturers ad wireless carriers , which often leads to severe security issues that can take months to rectify . Some of the most recent security issues include : <h> The Quadrooter Vulnerability <p> In August 2016 , Check Point , an Israeli security company , publicized findings on four security issues that affect phones that have Qualcomm chipsets . These are found in approximately 80% of Android handsets , including their flagship phones . According to Check Point , the vulnerabilities affected over 900 million devices . The flaws allow malicious apps to access a users location and their data by manipulating them to escalate the apps privileges . <p> The vulnerabilities were found on the chipset drivers for Qualcomm LTE modems , rather than the Android operating system . This meant that each hardware vendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the first companies to address the issue , but it took Google about a month to provide patches for all of the vulnerabilities . <h> The Certifi-gate Flaw <p> One year earlier , Check Point brought attention to another key security flaw affecting versions up to Android 5.1 . This flaw was found in two mobile support tool plug-ins , which are used by many of the biggest phone manufacturers . In a similar fashion to the Quadrooter vulnerabilities , the Certifi-gate flaw could lead to attackers sneaking in through faulty apps and elevating permissions to take control of the phone . ZDNet reported that the flaw was even found in a Google Play approved app called Recordable Activator . The company behind the app quickly addressed the issue , and according to Googles 2015 Android Security Year in Review , the flaw had not been exploited successfully . <h> Stagefright Vulnerability <p> Just one month beforehand , a critical flaw was found by a researcher from Zimperium . A group of software bugs , collectively known as Stagefright , made it possible for an attacker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the device without the user having to take any action . All the attacker needed was the targets phone number and they could infiltrate handsets with versions 2.2 and above . <p> One of the most alarming parts of this vulnerability is that it affected 95% of Android devices . It was first publicly announced on July 27 , 2015 , but only a small number of devices had been patched within the first week . The main reason for the lack of action is that the carriers and phone manufacturers are responsible for the firmware updates , not Google . When combined with the fragmentation and organizational complexities of the Android system , it led to severe delays . <p> Further vulnerabilities were found in the coming months , and it was estimated that one billion devices were affected . While patches have been released and those running newer versions of Android should be safe , those with older models that have not been updated are- still and always will be vulnerable . Despite the huge concerns over the flaw , Adrian Ludwig , the Director of Android @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been no reported cases of the flaws being exploited . <h> Other Android Security Issues <p> These are just some of the most significant security flaws that we have seen on Android in recent years . There was also the Android Installer hijacking which affected versions up to Android 4.3 , the Android FakeID vulnerability which affected versions up to Android 4.31 , as well as many others , including some that render old Android web browsers vulnerable . <h> iOS Security History <p> One of the main advantages of iOSs walled garden approach is that it makes it much easier for Apple to keep their system secure . Because Apple has complete control , they can typically offer fixes within days and push the updates to all devices ( that are enabled to receive them ) . This limits the amount of time that vulnerabilities can be exploited , giving attackers less of an opportunity to take advantage of them . Despite this , it should not be assumed that an iPhone is impenetrable " they have also had numerous security issues over the years , however not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the latest version of iOS was released , it included a security glitch that allowed hackers to attempt passwords 2,500 times faster than in iOS 9 and older versions . Changes to the way that iPhones encrypt backups made it significantly easier to brute force passwords . Apple has since addressed the issue with updates 10.1 and 10.2 . These updates used hashing , subsampling and noise injection to help protect user data . <h> Goto Bug <p> Back in 2014 when iOS 7 was released , there was a simple flaw that led to a significant vulnerability . In the code , an error was made and goto fail was repeated twice , which bypassed the authentication check . The result made it much easier for attackers to access user emails or other data . While this vulnerability was significant , Apple was swift to address the problem by releasing iOS 7.06 . <h> Other iOS Security Issues <p> Over the years , iOS has also had other security vulnerabilities , but these werent as significant as the prior two . One threat that users used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by malware when plugged into an unsafe charging station , such as at an airport . iOS 7 helped to mitigate these attacks by asking the user whether they trusted the source . In 2014 , there were also problems with the iOS MobileMail.app not encrypting attachments . This bug was fixed in iOS 7.1.2. - In 2016 , iOS also had an issue similar to the Stafegright Android vulnerability , allowing attackers to penetrate iOS devices using specially-crafted messages send through iMessage . <h> Android Nougat vs iOS 10 <p> The latest offerings from both Google and Apple have continued to push more enterprise oriented features into their operating systems . Apple may have led the way , but Google is quickly adapting to make Android more secure in the business environment . <p> If your business is contemplating whether to embrace iOS or Android , it is important to remember that only a tiny percent of Androids devices currently use Nougat , the latest version of Android . Older versions will lack many of these features . <h> Encryption <p> Encryption is crucial for sensitive data , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encryption support first came about for Android in 2014 . With Marshmallow , Google introduced support for ARMs Trustzone hardware to keep encryption keys more secure . This is now required for Android Nougat devices , which is excellent from a security perspective , but has also meant that many devices can not upgrade to Nougat . In Nougat , it is also possible to encrypt files rather than all of the data . This enables users to use some of the devices functions without entering their key . <p> Data protection has been offered since the iPhone 3GS . Apple offers- multiple protection classes for different levels of data . In addition to an unprotected class , data can be encrypted unless open , or encrypted until first user authentication . <h> Remote Wipe <p> Devices can easily get lost or stolen . If an employees device contains sensitive data , it is important that it can be remotely locked or wiped to ensure that thieves can not access valuable information . If an employees phone does n't  come with the Android Device Manager , they will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users need to log into their Google account and set it up beforehand . <p> iOS offers the built-in Find My iPhone feature . Users can remotely wipe their data whenever the device is online . If the device is returned , the data can be restored- through iCloud if backup was turned on beforehand . <h> Other Security Features <p> Nougat features many upgrades that have made it a worthy competitor to iOS 10 . Some of its key offerings include passcode enforcement for individual apps , upgrades to app permission policies and more granular access management . Googles Android For Work initiative has also provided Enterprise Mobility Management ( EMM ) solutions . In addition , there is an option for a VPN that can not be bypassed when the device is in work mode . <p> iOS 10 comes with a Universal Clipboard that allows content to be shared with MAC OS devices through the cloud instead of AirDrop . This is much more secure . The latest version of iOS also supports VPN IKEv2 EAP-only mode , which provides a secure way for employees to access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of the big security concerns for enterprise is the difference between the app stores of the two major players . Unless a device is jailbroken , Apple users can only download apps from the official App Store . On the other hand , Android allows users to download third party apps in addition to those from Google Play . This provides an additional avenue for malware to slip into Android devices . <p> Apple has also implement much stricter control over their apps than Google . The apps are reviewed- by Apples app team and can be rejected for minor errors- and for violating Apples app policies . Apple also has the ability to remotely disable apps when problems are discovered . <p> For the past two years , Google has been trying to tighten up security controls in its apps . It has forced the developers of 275,000 Android apps to patch their security issues as part of the App Security Improvement program . Android does n't  provide an out of the box feature to restrict the resources that applications can access , however external applications such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store and configured with these restrictions . <p> From the start of this year , Apple has required all of its apps to use the App Transport Security feature , which forces- app traffic to flow through encrypted HTTPS connections . <h> Best BYOD Security Practices <p> Having a good BYOD security policy is just as important as finding the best OS . While Android has a long history of issues , the latest version of its OS has become much more competitive with iOS on a security level . Despite this , the majority of devices are still using older and less secure versions . If a business decides to let Android devices into the workplace , it needs to understand the security issues that come with older Android devices and have a policy in place that restricts access to sensitive data and systems . - This policy should also spell out exactly what kinds of apps are permitted and what device settings ( e.g. password strength , device encryption , etc. ) must be in place . <p> While iOS has long been a clear market leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security issues . For optimal security , employees need to have the latest updates , patch any prior security issues , and generally be trained on security vigilance and best practices . <p> BYOD policies come with a range of security risks that are challenging for businesses to manage . Android is generally more flexible , while iOS is more streamlined and tightly controlled . Despite the benefits of Androids flexibility , it has also had severe security problems- over the years and still suffers from an inability to generally push out security updates quickly . <p> At this stage , Androids fragmentation and past performance issues make iOS seem like the more appealing option for enterprise . Despite this , the recent leaps that Google has made with Nougat could see the tables turn in the coming years .

Microsoft is really just leaving it up you to determine if the use of Skype is appropriate without taking any steps to ensure that use of Skype really meets all of HIPAA 's requirements . Additionally , even though Skype is covered under Microsoft 's BAA , the regular , free Skype used by most people is not covered . So , for example , a doctor should under no circumstances have a session with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skype program . This patient must use the web browser-based business Skype interface in order to be covered . <h> Alternative to Skype : SecureVideo <p> LuxSci 's SecureVideo service was built to be HIPAA compliant and in fact provides better video quality in one-on-one video calls and in group video teleconferencing . LuxSci SecureVideo : <h> Some background on Skype <p> When considering if Skype can be used in a HIPAA-compliant manner , there are many relevant items to consider : <p> Encryption : Skype uses AES 265-bit encryption for securing the chat sessions and the voice and video phone calls . This level of encryption is beyond sufficient for encrypting the transmission of ePHI . <p> Wire Tap : It is well known that many countries can " wire tap " Skype communications so that they can record calls , videos , and chats . Changes that Microsoft has made to Skype make it easier for them to wire tap communications , in general and domestically . it is also well known that the NSA can wire tap Skype video calls . <p> HIPAA Requirements : Use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Provide notifications in case of a breach <p> Offer technical support and frequently dropped calls may cause problems for some organizations ( e.g. in terms of emergency access , etc . ) <p> Provide archives of chats or video <p> Provide administrative emergency access to previous chat histories <h> So , what does this mean ? <p> These items taken together mean that : <p> While Skype uses a strong level of encryption , the privacy of data sent via Skype is suspect <p> Copies of calls , chats , and videos could be stored in unknown locations as a result of wire taps or other undisclosed recording by Skype , Microsoft , or government officials <p> non-Business Skype does not claim any kind of HIPAA compliance and will not sign a required Business Associate Agreement <p> Skype does not provide the tools to use Skype in a way that allows you to meet your own HIPAA-compliance requirements ( e.g. auditing and archival/backup ) . <p> Skype does argue that it does not need to offer compliance tools and is a vehicle for communications --- just like your cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , Skype provides better security than those other methods of transmitting PHI . This argument is inaccurate as Skype is not a " common carrier ; " it is a Software-as-a-service provided through Microsoft . <p> The problem is that this argument does n't really hold water very well : <p> Chat . PHI in Skype chat is just like an email message being sent from one party to another and will be cached and/or recorded by Skype . Use of Skype for ePHI over chat should be strictly avoided . <p> Safeguards Principle . When we looked at HIPAA compliance for FAX , we saw that encryption and compliance comes down to the " Safeguards principle " of HIPAA : " Individually identifiable health information should be protected with reasonable administrative , technical , and physical safeguards to ensure its confidentiality , integrity , and availability and to prevent unauthorized or inappropriate access , use , or disclosure . " <p> The Safeguards principle means that if you can reasonably apply measures to ensure privacy , you should absolutely do so . With analog FAX , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible with everyone else . Since use of FAX may be required and there may be no really feasible way to send them securely , you might choose not to -- as long as you take all other reasonable measures to ensure privacy . This is a risk-benefit analysis you must perform and on which you must make your compliance business decisions . <h> What about Secure Chat ? <p> For a secure , HIPAA-compliant chat solution , you must look to a vendor that offers this service and provides a Business Associate Agreement and all of the appropriate security controls specified by HIPAA . Skype does not pass muster . Regular text messages ( SMS and MMS ) certainly do not . <p> One good solution is SecureChat by LuxSci , as it is HIPAA-compliant , simple , has easy-to-use iOS and Android apps , works in a web browser , and stores all of your chats and attachments permanently and without storage limits . <p> With video conferencing , the situation is somewhat different : <p> You are generally not required to use it <p> There are companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allows you to remain HIPAA compliant in a cost-effective manner <p> Since it is relatively easy to choose a Safeguard that allows you to be more fully compliant with HIPAA when video conferencing , it would be neglectful to instead use Skype for this purpose . <p> It does come down to the individual organization weighing the risks . If you choose to use Skype and accept the risk-benefit analysis , that is up to you , but you must be able to justify your decision in your internal HIPAA compliance reviews and be prepared to answer pointed questions from auditors , should the need arise . <h> What are the alternatives to Skype for Video Conferencing ? <p> There are many organizations that offer video conferencing and which claim HIPAA compliance and/or which offer Business Associate Agreements . <p> LuxSci 's SecureVideo is one option which provides a BAA and a service specifically designed to meet the HIPAA-compliance requirements for telehealth . <h> Welcome to LuxSci ! <p> *for non-dedicated-server orders placed between 9am and 10pm Eastern Time , USA .

E.g. maybe it knows of a problem with SHA1 and its trying to force everyone to update without revealing the problem . - This is conceivable , but less likely especially considering the fact that Google is still using SHA1 across all of its servers . <p> So , its very unclear why Google is forcing this with such a short timeline. - The Internet community is very unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Holiday online shopping season as well ! <h> What is the Down Side of Upgrading to SHA256 ? <p> So , fine , we need to make sure our certificates that expire in 2016 or later are using SHA256. - This means we either get new certificates now for ones that are in use and which are expiring then , or we get SHA256 when we next renew . - The first is annoying as we are forced to update things " now " rather than waiting for the normal update time - The latter is no big deal . <p> But there is somewhat serious a catch . <p> SHA256 is not supported by Computers running Windows 2000 or Windows XP before Service pack 3 . So , folks using Internet Explorer 6 , 7 or 8 on Windows XP who have not updated to SP3 cant use SHA256 . <p> What does that mean ? - It means that if you update to an SSL certificate with SHA256 , then any of these folks that tries to visit your secure web page will completely fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the encryption . <p> Sure , support for Windows XP SP2 ended 4 years ago , support for Windows XP altogether ended in April . - People " should not be using " XP and if they do they have pretty serious security issues to worry about . - However , lots of people still are . - We note that as of September , 23% of desktops still use Windows XP and probably a significant fraction of those are not up to SP3 yet . <p> So do you choose the rock or the hard place ? <p> Update to SHA256 so you look secure in modern Google Chrome , or <p> Keep using SHA1 for the time being since its " fine " and keep compatibility with old XP visitors <p> This problem is made worse by Googles move earlier this year " forcing " web sites to use SSL for all web pages in order to maximize their ranking in search engines . - For sites that now use SSL pervasively , SSL-compatibility is even more critical . <h> Recommended Choice for Maximum Compatibility <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current certificate expires in 2016 or later or early in 2015 ( or if you are thinking of buying a new certificate ) , then you should purchase a NEW 1-year certificate using SHA1 and have it issued BEFORE 12/31/2014 . <p> This will ensure that it is compatible with everyone , will not cause warnings in Chrome , and will defer this XP compatibility issue by 1 year when hopefully , hopefully , there will be many fewer XP users and you will have a much better case for cutting them off ( and they will have had a lot of warning and chance to move on ) . <h> What LuxSci is Doing <p> Most of our customers get 1-year long certificates . - These are all still unaffected by Chromes changes ( as they expire before 2016 ) . - It is only new 1-year certificates and renewals made after 1/1/2015 that will be affected if SHA1 is used . <p> LuxSci is issuing all new SSL certificates using SHA256. - If you want one that uses SHA1 , please ask explicitly . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch back to SHA1 , LuxSci can re-issue your certificate for you at no additional cost though this can take a few days ( as the certificate has to be re-submitted , re-verified by you , and re-installed ) . <p> LuxSci itself will be following the Maximum Compatibility guidelines , above . paying extra to make sure that our users can access our sites .

Use of SSL can meet HIPAAs data transmission security requirement in terms of communications between the end user and your web site . - However , your SSL configuration must be strong enough to prevent methods of encryption that are " too weak ; " it is up to your web host to be sure that this is the case . - See : What level or SSL or TLS is Required by HIPAA ? Next , what if the end user submits PHI that is collected on your web site and then your web site transmits that data elsewhere , or stores it ? - This process must also be HIPAA compliant. - We will discuss this below , as it is one of the hardest things to do and still be compliant . <p> Backup : Is not lost , i.e. is backed up and can be recovered.You must be sure that all PHI- stored with your web site or collected from your web site is backed up and can be recovered in case of an emergency or accidental deletion. - Most web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - If your site sends information elsewhere ( for example , to you via email ) , then those messages must also be backed up or archived and you must take care that those backups are robust , available , and accessible only by authorized people.Note that the PHI stored in backups must also be protected in a HIPAA-compliant way with security , authorization controls , etc . <p> Authorization : Is only accessible by authorized personnel- using unique , audited access- controlsWho can access the protected health information that resides on your web site or which is collected there ? - Your web hosting provider probably can . Are they a trusted HIPAA Business Associate with a privacy agreement ? - If the site collects health information and sends it to you or others , it is important to know who can access those messages. - Anyone with access to your email or the messaging system ? - Are they all trusted and " in the loop " ? If your web site stores or provides access to PHI , does your web site enforce unique , secure logins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that data ? Are these logins and the data accesses audited ? - This will be up to your web site designers to setup properly for you . <p> Integrity : PHI is not tampered with or altered.Unless the information that you collect and store is encrypted and/or digitally signed , there is no way to prevent it from being tampered with or to verify if tampering has happened. - It is up to your organization to determine if tamper-proofing your data is needed and how to best accomplish that . - Generally , using PGP , SSL , or AES encryption of stored data can accomplish this very nicely and also address the next point . <p> Storage Encryption : Is encrypted if it is being stored or archived.It is up to your organization to determine if this is needed ; though it is highly recommended . - If storage encryption is necessary then you need to ensure that all collected and stored protected health information is encrypted and that it can only be accessed/decrypted by people with the appropriate keys. - I.e. , this makes backups secure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protects the data no matter what happens ( unless your special keys are stolen ) . Storage encryption is especially important in any scenario where the data may be backed up or placed in locations out of your control , or where you may be sharing a web server with other customers of the same web host . - Should something unfortunate happen and a server become compromised , your liability is significantly limited by having the data encrypted . <p> Disposal . Can be permanently disposed of when needed.This sounds easy , but you have to consider all of the places where the data could be backed up and archived . You need to ensure that all of those backups will expire and disappear. - Consider that every location that the information touches could be making backups and be saving copies of your data indefinitely. - It certainly helps if the data is encrypted in the backup but if the backup is there and the keys to open the data exist , then it is not really " disposed of " . - It is up to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal in order to be HIPAA compliant.It is up to the folks managing your servers to also ensure that the media ( e.g. the hard drives ) containing PHI are properly disposed of when you are no longer using them . <p> Business Associate : You must have a HIPAA- Business- Associate Agreement with every vendor that touches your PHI.If your web site or data is located on the servers of a vendor , then HIPAA ( first HITECH and then in Omnibus ) requires that you have a signed Business Associate Agreement with them . - This agreement ensures that the vendor will follow the HIPAA security rule requirements with respect to your data and its servers.Note that web sites are complex beasts and no web hosting provider will be policing your web site functionality and content they cant. - Instead , they will be providing an " infrastructure " that meets HIPAA compliance requirements and they will require you to design and manage your web site so that its functionality is HIPAA compliant . - Choosing a provider will not make your web site HIPAA compliant unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that its design and functionality is complaint . - This is universal unless you buy a web site that is pre-designed and fully under the control of the host . <p> So , there are many things to do and a lot is all " up to you " . - Of course , just because you are on the " honor system " does n't  mean that you can make whatever choice you feel like. - If you make a poor choice and something bad happens or if you are audited , you will be found willfully- negligent ( ignorance is not an excuse here ) . - You really have to carefully consider what is necessary and appropriate to suitably protect health information and the privacy of your users , based on your web site application and how the patient data is used and transmitted . <h> Collecting health information from people <p> One of the first things that doctors and medical practices like to do when they expand online is to collect patient information on their web site so that they can : <p> Sign up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about medical situations <p> Get into digital prescriptions <p> Securing the transmission of the information from the patient to the web site is pretty easy ( its #1 use web site secured with SSL ) . - However , what do you do with that information ? Common solutions include : <p> Store it in files on the web server to download later <p> Store it in a database for download or remote access <p> Email it to someone <p> The third option , email it to someone , is the most popular choice because it is the easiest and requires the least additional software or infrastructure everyone is already checking their email. - It also opens a whole can of worms in terms of " how do you make the email component meet HIPAA ? " <p> 1 . Storing the data in files requires that <p> The web site encrypt the files <p> Someone downloads the files over a secure channel ( i.e. Secure FTP ) <p> The web site owner gets notified via an email that a new file is waiting <p> Backup and disposal are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ database allows you to write software for remote access and management of that information , however <p> Transmission to and from the database needs to be secure <p> The software that provides management access must be secure and meet all sorts of HIPAA requirements in terms of access control and auditing <p> So , option 1 is easy , but requires a bit more technical knowledge on the part of the users and puts the onus of backup and disposal on them. - Option 2 is better and allows more flexibility , usability , and control and a centralization of the data into one place. - However , Option 2 is more technically complex requires more cost and effort to implement properly. - Option 3 is easy , but how do you make the email HIPAA compliant ? <h> Securing data emailed from your web site forms <p> The ideal procedure for securing your emailed data is basically as follows : <p> Your secure web site encrypts the submitted data ( using PGP or S/MIME , TLS , or a secure web-based email pickup solution ) such that only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This data is emailed to those recipients and " forgotten " by the web site ( or an encrypted copy is stored on the site if you prefer ) . <p> The recipients receive the data and it is stored on their email server ( still encrypted unless TLS was used for delivery ) . <p> The recipients can access these messages securely ( over SSL ) and decrypt the data either in their email program or on a Web-based interface that supports decryption . <p> The email provider takes care of backups . <p> Deleted messages will expire from backups after a while ( get a signed statement saying this from them , if you like ) . <p> Keep copies of all of the encrypted messages on the server instead of downloading them all , so that you are responsible for backups and so that they are all stored in a central location . <h> Make your Web Forms HIPAA compliant Quickly <p> LuxScis SecureForm service allows you to collect data from your web ( and PDF ) forms and deliver it to you via email , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both automatically HIPAA compliant and does not require any programming on your part : <p> We can get and install SSL for your web site so that transmissions are secured . <p> We can integrate your web forms with special scripts that will encrypt your submitted form data ( using PGP , S/MIME , TLS , or SecureLine Escrow ) and email it to you . <p> We can optionally provide immutable archives of all of your inbound and outbound email so that none of it can get lost or deleted or edited and so that you have a secure backup available for 1 , 3 , 5 , or even 7 years . <p> Our web browser-based email access allows you to decrypt and view all of your secure messages , over a secure channel , from anywhere . <p> Users can HIPAA-securely reply , via our WebMail interface ( or even from their email programs ) back to the web site user so that the web site user can get a secure message via our SecureLine Escrow service. - The web site users can even reply back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth conversations , initiated from your web site , that are fully HIPAA compliant .

After those are entered , you can select what you want to sync ( e.g. email , calendars , tasks , contacts , notes ) . - Done . - Setup is quick and simple . <p> IMAP + SMTP <p> IMAP and SMTP have many more settings . - There are 1 or 2 server names with sometimes different usernames and passwords , depending on the provider . - There are various ports to choose from , options for secure or insecure connections , IMAP folder paths , different types of authentication methods , etc. - The options are rich and complex , and can lead to frustration unless the instructions you are using are tailored to your specific situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transport Security <p> ActiveSync <p> These days , all ActiveSync connections are automatically and always performed over connections encrypted using SSL. - There is no choice and nothing to configure its just secure ( during data transport ) . <p> IMAP + SMTP <p> IMAP and SMTP can technically connect with or without SSL-style security . - It is up to your provider which security options are available to you and to provide you with instructions on how to set up your device appropriately . <p> If setup to use SSL and/or TLS , these connections have the same level of security as ActiveSync . <p> LuxSci , for example , enforces use of SSL and TLS on IMAP and SMTP by default , so you cant set your device up " wrong " and end up with an insecure connection this is not the case with all providers . <p> Winner : ActiveSync by a hair . - While both provide the same level of security , ActiveSync makes it simpler to setup and thus it is more likely that you end up with a solid connection . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same when using ActiveSync or IMAP. - The difference is in how email can be checked and what email can be seen . <p> ActiveSync <p> ActiveSync supports " Push " email . - When enabled , this allows your phone to be notified of and to download new email as soon as it arrives . - Push email is also very kind to the life of your devices battery meaning that you can get fast updates and have a long battery life too . - Push email is great . <p> If you do n't  like Push email , you can still access email " on demand " or have your device check for new email " periodically , " just like with IMAP . <p> One downside of ActiveSync is that it may only show your recent email in each of your folders . - This can be a device limit and a server-side limit . - Some devices will show only email from the last week or month ( this is sometimes configurable ) . - Sometimes it is a server-side limit . - E.g. LuxScis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a folder , for speed , efficiency , and mobile bandwidth reasons . If you really need ALL email , no matter how much that is , then IMAP is the way to go . <p> IMAP <p> IMAP works great , but by default ( e.g. on an iPhone ) , you can check for new email only " on demand " or have the phone ask the server for new messages up to once every 15 minutes . - E.g. there is no " Push " and the polling of the server is a larger battery drain than Push . <p> Some devices ( e.g. Android , but not iPhone ) do support something called " IMAP IDLE " . - This is a way for the device to hold open the IMAP connection and wait for the server to let them know about new email ( and other changes to the folder ) . - From an end-user perspective , this is essentially the same as Push email ; However IDLE- does consume much more bandwidth and much more battery power than ActiveSync Push . <p> IMAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. - This can be a distinct advantage over ActiveSync . <p> Winner : ActiveSync for Push email and battery friendliness . <h> 4 . Sending Email <p> The email program interface- looks the same- when using ActiveSync or SMTP to send email . - The difference is in how email is actually routed . <p> ActiveSync <p> With ActiveSync , outbound email messages are delivered to the server over the same secure ActiveSync connection being used to check email and synchronize calendars , etc. - This " just works " . <p> SMTP <p> When using SMTP to send email from your App , a new connection is made to your providers SMTP server for outbound delivery of your message . - Due to the pervasiveness of SPAM , these outbound SMTP connections can often be blocked without notice by whatever ISP , cellular , or Wifi service you are currently connected through , resulting in errors and an inability to send your email . <p> To get around this issue , some email providers like LuxSci offer " alternate " ports to configure in your phone for sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LuxSci , for example , has lots of extra ports in addition to the standard one ( port 25 ) . - E.g. 80 , 465 , 587 , and more . <p> However , even with the option to use alternate ports , SMTP is a recipe for aggravation . - You will likely set up your phone with one port that works and find that 3 months later it does n't  ( due to settings in your network that you have no control over ) and you need to change ports . - Yes , you may be able to resolve the problem . - But it is still extra time and stress that no one needs . <p> Winner : ActiveSync for not needing to worry about ports . <h> 5 . Remote Wipe <p> ActiveSync <p> ActiveSync allows you to " Remote Wipe " your phone . - E.g. if it is lost or stolen , you can issue a command from a user interface that will delete data off your phone if it is ever enabled again . - This is very good for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such functionality with IMAP and SMTP . <p> However , many mobile phones now have other free options for enabling Remote Wipe so ActiveSync is not really needed . - For example : iPhone- and Android . <p> Winner : ActiveSync , barely . <h> - 6 . Synchronizing Calendars , Contacts , Tasks , and Notes <p> ActiveSync <p> ActiveSync allows you to synchronize your calendars , contacts , tasks , and notes with your providers server . - These can and often are different- from your personal calendars , contacts , tasks , and notes . <p> E.g. I have my personal calendar synchronized through iCloud but my work calendar and contacts synchronized through ActiveSync with our office accounts which are then also synchronized with my co-workers phones . - I could not do that with iCloud unless everyone used the same Apple I 'd which might be fine for a home environment , but is a no-go in a work environment . <p> This synchronization service " just works " and includes " Push " updates so changes appear on your phone in real time without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than that . <p> IMAP + SMTP <p> There is no such functionality with IMAP and SMTP . <p> Winner : ActiveSync. - This is the most significant reason of all to use ActiveSync. <h> - The Winner ? <p> The clear winner is ActiveSync. - Given the choice , the only significant reason that you might consider IMAP is if you have very large folders and need to access all email in these folders from your mobile device not just the recent ones .

" One of the central factors governing the deliverability of your messages is the reputation of the Internet Protocol ( IP ) Address of your sending email server its " IP Reputation . " <p> Here you can learn how to manage 8 factors that affect your servers IP Reputation in order to maximize your reputation and increase the number of eyeballs that see your marketing email messages . <p> But first , you may want to check to- see if you are on any common blacklists using mx toolbox . <h> 1 . How many messages has your server sent ? <p> If your server has not sent lots of email before , then it is a relative " unknown " out there in the wilds of the Internet. - It has little or no existing reputation . - This is Ok as long as you do not suddenly start blasting out huge amounts of email . - That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services and cause your servers reputation to go down and for your server to be black listed . - E.g. your server would look like some machine on the Internet that was compromised by a spammer and which suddenly started spouting as much spam as possible . <p> Your best bet is to " warm up " your servers IP address . - Send small mailing blasts of a few thousand messages at a time . - Slowly increase the size of your mailings over the course of a few weeks . - This serves to introduce your IP to the world in a smooth and cautious way that spam filtering services appreciate . <h> 2 . How many of your messages have been marked as Spam by your recipients ? <p> Recipients who do n't  really want your email will often mark it a spam rather than unsubscribing or deleting the messages . - This , unfortunately , makes it look like you have sent them spam even if they subscribed to your mailings ! - The more this happens , the worse your IP reputation can become . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or use a mailing service that includes ) so you can be notified when folks do this ; you can unsubscribe anyone who complains of your email in this way , preventing them from complaining in the future and thus minimizing- the number of complaints ( legitimate or not ) against you . <p> Even well maintained mailing lists may- contain some email addresses that are invalid , as people change addresses frequently . - However , purchased email lists , old lists , and lists gotten via methods other than through the use of good subscription practices , will often contain large numbers of invalid addresses . <p> If your server tries to deliver messages to significant numbers of invalid addresses , that will be noticed and your reputation will go way down your server will look like it is run by a spammer . <p> So use new opt-in lists and make sure that you remove addresses that are bouncing right away so that you do not keep trying them over and over on every mailing . <h> 4 . What is the rate that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always better . - The more messages you try to deliver in a short time , the more likely your recipient servers are going to put up walls to throttle your sending or block you altogether . - Many recipient domains , most notably Yahoo ! , have explicit low limits on the number of messages they will receive from an IP address in a given period of time . If you try to push beyond that , you shoot yourself in the foot . <p> Best is to ( a ) deliver the messages more slowly and ( b ) use multiple servers and thus multiple IP addresses in tandem if you need to increase your mailing throughput without tripping on recipient rate limits . <p> If your server is blacklisted anywhere , that significantly decreases your IP Reputation . - You should work to get your IP address de-listed from any blacklists it is on and seek to ensure that your mailing patters do not land you on any new black lists . <h> 6. - Is your IP address static and set up properly by your ISP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ISP ( e.g. Verizon , Comcast , cox , etc. ) or from a virtual machine in the public cloud ( e.g. Amazon , Rackspace , etc. ) , then your IP reputation is automatically lowered because that IP can be used by many different people over time and can often change hands without notice . - Be sure that your sending IP address is not changeable ( dynamic ) , not owned by your ISP and not in a public cloud . <p> Also , make sure that there is a valid " Reverse DNS " entry for your IP address and that that matches the hostname of your server . - E.g. if your servers name is " joes-mailer.com " then " joes-mailer.com " has a specific IP address ( e.g. 1.2.3.4 ) . - If you look up what name goes with " 1.2.3.4 " it should say " joes-mailer.com " and when your mail server talks to other servers it should say " Hello , I 'm joes-mailer.com " . - If these things do not all match up , then your servers IP will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using your server for sending email ? - What are they doing ? <p> If you are sending email through a server shared with other people , or the mail is going out trough IP addresses that are not dedicated to you , then you are not in control of our own reputation . - These other folks could suddenly start sending spam , degrading the reputation of the IP that you use , and harming the deliverability of your messages . <p> The best solution is to have a dedicated mailing server once that is used only by you . - In this way , you can control exactly what gets sent through it . - You are in control and there should be no surprises . <h> 8 . Have others used your server or IP before you ? - What is their legacy ? <p> Let 's say you just set up or got a new server and a new IP address . - This IP address was likely used by other folks before it was assigned to you if these folks were not good custodians , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor reputation ! - If that happens to you , your best bet is to either get a new address or to : <p> de-list the IP from any black lists <p> wait a few weeks before you use the IP for your own mailings <p> warm up the IP by sending small mailings of solid non-spam-like messages to known good mailing lists <p> This should bring the reputation back up to good standards . <p> When it comes down to it , your IP reputation is based on your mail server provider , your configuration , and your behavior. - You can pick a good provider , proactively control your behavior , send good messages to good opt-in mailing lists and have excellent deliverability.

And , if you are sending an email messages to a group of clients who have provided their own email addresses , it is likely that a significant number of them are using email services that do not support TLS and thus the message sent to them may not be HIPAA compliant . <h> Are there any alternatives ? <p> Yes , here are some : <p> Use an email service that ensures that the recipients will only receive encrypted copies of the messages. - One such service is- SecureLine , which allows you to send secure email messages to anyone on the Internet , no matter what email address or provider they use. - SecureLine encrypts the content of the messages and ensures that only the intended recipient(s) can access it. - It also splits up any BCC list into a series of individual messages , so that each message goes in a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security for each . <p> Provide your recipients with addresses on an email provider that supports TLS ( perhaps even the same provider that you use ) . - If you can be sure that you and the recipients all use TLS ( and SSL when checking your email ) , then you can be sure that all email communications between yourselves will automatically be HIPAA compliant , in terms of transmission security .

Messages thought deleted can still exist in backup folders on remote servers years after being sent . Hackers can read and modify messages in transit , use your usernames and passwords to login to your online services , and steal your identity and critical information ! <p> As the amount of crucial business conducted via email increases , so does the amount of Spam , viruses , hacking , fraud , and other malicious activity . Unless precautions are taken , email can leave you and your business open to escalating security and privacy risks . What are these risks ? <h> Email Threats <p> Eavesdropping : In the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all message content ( including usernames and passwords ) is transmitted between their personal computer and email servers in easily accessible " plain text " . This means that anyone who can intercept this flow of information can read your email and obtain your usernames and passwords ; this is referred to as eavesdropping . <p> It is surprisingly easy to eavesdrop . Often the culprits are others in your organization , individuals at your Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , or even other clients of your ISP . Simple eavesdropping attacks , like tapped phone lines , lay all of your critical communications wide open to attackers . Worse , these attackers can access your accounts , send email messages appearing to come from you , and steal your identity , all by simply obtaining your usernames and passwords and other confidential information in this way . <p> Privacy : Did you know that your physical location can often be determined fairly accurately just by examining the email messages you send ? Recent legislation allows your ISP to read your email without your permission , and data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely without your knowledge . With such potential for malicious activity , taking measures to maintain your privacy is more important than ever . <p> Privacy afforded to your communications , to the data you entrust to your service providers , and even to your physical location is as critical as protecting your communications from eavesdropping , as a lack of privacy is equivalent to allowing people to " eavesdrop " on you and/or to discover your actual address . <p> Spam and Unwanted Email : While Spam is technically not a privacy or security issue , the sheer quantity of Spam today ( reports currently indicate that more than 75% of all email is Spam ) decreases productivity and dramatically increases the cost of email use . Spam filtering also poses the potential loss of legitimate email while attempts are made to weed out unwanted messages . <p> Viruses and Worms : These malignant entities , though almost as prevalent as Spam , are infinitely worse . viruses and worms can take over your computer , send your private information to attackers , destroy your hard drive , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general . They are a threat to your privacy and make you suspicious of legitimate email . <p> Email Bombs and Other Attacks : " Email bombs " occur when you receive an immense number of email messages in a very short time . Dictionary attacks are generated by spammers trying to discover valid email addresses at your organization by sending email to thousands of different addresses . Floods like these can bring your email service to its knees , fill up all your email storage space , and result in the loss of legitimate messages and business . <p> All of these threats are significant individually ; together they pose a serious , on-going , and escalating problem . How can you take advantage of email technology while mitigating your risk from these and other negative factors ? And , how can you keep the costs to your organization reasonable ? <h> Mitigating Email Threats <p> Several technologies and mechanisms can be used to significantly reduce the potential of all of the threats described above . These include : <p> Encrypted Communications : Information sent between your computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not access any of your data . Encryption is commonly accomplished using " Secure Socket Layer " ( SSL ) protocols that are supported by web browsers and email programs . You need to ensure that your provider supports them and that your users enable them . <p> Privacy Policies : Make sure that your ISP and email provider have strict privacy policies stating that your data will never be accessed without your explicit consent . Barring legal injunctions , you can become more secure in the integrity and confidentiality of your data . <p> Anonymization : If you are concerned about people discovering the physical location from which you send email , find a provider that allows outgoing email to be stripped of location-identifying information . This is sometimes known as outgoing email anonymization . <p> Spam and Virus Firewalls : Use services that stop Spam , viruses , and other unwanted content before they reach your infrastructure and users . These services should actively protect you against email bombs and other attacks , greatly reduce the impact of Spam and viruses , and insulate your infrastructure from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and virus filtering provider has teams working 24/7 to monitor Internet threats . They must detect these new threats quickly and install stopgap rules and filters to block them well before mainstream anti-virus companies release official filters . Where viruses are concerned , the sooner you are protected , the better ! <p> Note employing commodity virus and Spam filtering tools and software may not be sufficient as anti-virus companies might not release new rules for stopping the latest viruses for hours or days after they appear on the Internet , and such tools by themselves may not provide adequate protection against email attacks . <p> These and other technologies , such as public key encryption , will go a long way to ensuring that your organizations information security practices are protected from for the dangers of todays Internet . <h> Conclusions <p> The cost of ignoring email threats can be catastrophic : loss of email and confidentiality , identity theft , lack of privacy , even the loss of the use of your computers . <p> The cost of mitigating all of the factors yourself " in-house " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continual training , monitoring and support , etc. , quickly amount to large sums of money and exclusively dedicated man power . <p> The most cost-effective and robust solution is to outsource your email infrastructure to an organization , like LuxSci , that specializes in premium email security . They can ensure your privacy , provide enterprise-level Spam , virus , and email content filtering with 24/7 threat-monitoring and email attack protection . Finally they should provide responsive , personal technical support to address issues your organization will face as it grows and as the Internet evolves . <p> Breaches of email security and privacy are hard to detect . You can not tell if someone is reading your email or subtly modifying messages until it is too late . You can not quantify the cost of email and information security problems until after they impact you imagine all of the things people write and receive in email and think carefully about how you need to address these critical issues for your organization !

However , most people do not know that the degree of security and privacy inherent in a " secure " connection of this sort can vary from " almost none " to " really really good good enough for US- government TOP- SECRET data " . - The piece which varies and thus provides the variable level of security is the " cipher " or " encryption technique " . - There are a large number of different ciphers some are very fast and very insecure. - Some are slower and very secure. - Some weak ones ( export-grade ciphers ) - are around from the days when the USA- did not permit the export of decent security to other countries . <p> AES , the Advanced Encryption Standard , is a relatively new encryption technique/cipher that is the successor of DES. - AES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is currently one of the most popular algorithms used in symmetric key cryptography ( which , for example , is used for the actual data transmission in SSL- and TLS ) . - It is also the " gold standard " encryption technique ; many security-conscious organizations actually require that their employees use AES-256 ( 256-bit AES ) for all communications . <p> This article discusses AES , its role in SSL , which web browsers and email programs support it , how you can make sure that you only use 256-bit AES- encryption of all secure communications , and more . <h> More about AES <p> AES- has been available in most cryptographic libraries for a long time. - It was available in " OpenSSL " starting in 2002 with v0.9.7. - OpenSSL- is the foundation of most SSL services in UNIX- and- Linux environments , such as that used by LuxSci . GPG , the open source implementation of PGP , also include an AES- 256 option . <p> So , while AES is the new kid on the block , it has been around long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , this does not mean that is its actually being used on your computer ! <h> How Secure is 256-bit AES ? <p> AES is FIPS ( Federal Information Processing Standard ) certified and there are currently no known non-brute-force direct attacks against AES ( except some side channel timing attacks on the processing of AES that are not feasible over a network environment and this not applicable to SSL in general ) . - In fact , AES security is strong enough to be certified for use by the US- government for top secret information . <p> The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm ( i.e. , 128 , 192 and 256 ) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level . TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths . The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use . " ( Lynn Hathaway , June 2003 reference . ) <p> If you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose. - Also good are 128-bit and 192-bit versions of AES . <p> The Beast Attack and SSL-secured web sites <p> For SSL used for web site traffic ( as opposed to other things like IMAP , SMTP , encryption of files , etc. ) , there is an attack knows as The Beast . In this attack , people in a trusted location on your network can potentially break into your SSL session and eavesdrop on your communications . <p> The solution is to use TLS v1.1+ ciphers. - However , this BEAST is not considered an important attack vector anymore . <h> And there alternatives to AES ? <p> There are many alternative ciphers that can be used in SSL- and TLS . A- good alternatives or additions to your cipher suite would include " 3DES " ( e.g. for compatibility with Windows XP ) . - We would not recommend using RC4 anymore , due to known weaknesses . - If you look at the list of ciphers recommended by FIPS/NIST for high security , they are all essentially AES or DES with various hashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cipher chosen in an SSL or TLS session ? <p> In general , when an SSL- client , such as an email program or web browser , connects to a server and wishes to use SSL or TLS , the client sends the server a list of encryption ciphers that it supports. - The server then goes through the list , in order , and chooses the first match that it also supports. - Usually , the client orders the list with the most secure methods first , so that the most secure method supported by both the client and server is selected. - Sometimes , the client orders the list based on other criteria to make a compromise between security and speed ; this can result in a sub-optimal cipher being chosen . <p> Most modern web and email servers that support SSL- encryption , like LuxSci.coms servers , support many different strong encryption techniques all the way up to 128-bit RC4 and 256-bit AES. - They provide a variety , instead of just a single really good method , so that users who have old or broken software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is weaker than it should ideally be . <p> Additionally , most companies that provide security services do not permit use of techniques that deemed are " too weak " and which can be broken very easily ( like the old " export grade ciphers " that used to be in prevalent use ) . - So , if you are connecting to a reputable service provided over SSL- or TLS , the type of encryption that will be used is almost certainly determined by your client program ( i.e. email program or web browser ) based on the options ( and the order thereof ) presented by the server . <h> What encryption techniques are supported by modern web browsers ? <p> For any given web browser , it is easy to see what the best encryption technique it supports by browsing to the web site : - https : //www.howsmyssl.com/ <p> So , by default , only some browsers will take advantage of AES encryption , when available. - We also see that any program that uses the windows default SSL- libraries , will use RC4 in Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone using Windows XP ( or 2000 ) should really use a program that includes its own SSL- cipher management ( i.e. FireFox , Opera ) . <h> What encryption techniques are supported by modern email programs ? <p> Asking this question about web browsers begs the question as to what is supported by the various email programs out there. - Clearly , if you are using a WebMail interface to your email , then the answer depends on what web browser you are using . <p> Note that email connections are not subject to The Beast attack . <p> We tested several popular email programs to see what encryption cipher they end up using when connected to a server like LuxScis that supports a variety of strong ciphers.1 Here are the results : <p> We see a similar pattern here . For most cases , the cipher used depends on the Operating System and not the program . - Some programs roll their own SSL ( i.e. Thunderbird/Eudora ) and some use the OS built-in libraries . - So , from this we can infer that any newer version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 128bit AES , most things on Windows XP will use 128bit RC4 , etc . <h> How to force use of 256-bit AES- for secure web and secure email <p> As discussed above , the choice of email client is the prime determination of what encryption cipher will be used. - So , for example , if you use Mozilla Firefox or Opera for web browsing and Mozilla Thunderbird for email , you will be using 256-bit AES encryption , as long as it is supported by the server . <p> However , if you would like to go a step further and be sure that you do not make any secure connection unless 256-bit AES encryption is used , that is also possible. - This level of security is needed if your organization mandates that secure connections use 256-bit AES , or if you do not trust that all of the servers which you connect to will have good security ciphers in place . <p> It is also useful if the web sites that you are connecting to have prioritized RC4 over AES , but your know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. you are using TLS v1.1+ ) and you would prefer AES. - Currently , the most recent versions of almost all all modern browsers ( e.g. Internet Explorer , FireFox , Chrome , Opera ) are safe from The Beast . - Also , old browsers will be affected by The Beast . <p> Following the instructions below , you can be sure that 256-bit AES- will be used for all secure connections ; the connections will flat out fail if the server does n't  support this encryption technique . - If you have instructions appropriate for other operating systems or programs , please drop us a comment ! <p> Note that if your remove RC4 cipher support , you may not be able to connect to some web sites ones that require RC4 and do not present other options . - They are out there the pizza place near our offices where we can order lunch online is one example . <p> Mozilla Firefox : <p> Type " about:config " in the address bar to open up the detailed list of configuration parameters . <p> Make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for SSLv2 and SSLv3 . <p> Search for " security.ssl3 " <p> Change to " false " the value for all ciphers that do not include " aes256 " in the name ( e.g. the RC4 , camellia and des ones ) . - This will make them no longer available for use . <p> You will be left with various versions of AES- 256 with TLS v1.0+ . <p> You do n't  even have to restart Firefox for this to take effect ! <p> Note that there is a cool plugin for FireFox called " CipherFox " that allows you to view the cipher information for any site you are connected to . <p> Under the " General " section of the " Advanced " tab of the resulting " Options " dialog box , click on the " Config Editor " button . <p> Follow the same instructions as for Firefox in terms of disabling SSL2 and SSLv3 , and turning off all ciphers that do not include " aes256 " in the name . <p> Restart Thunderbird so that any persistent connections are broken and re-opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configured to use SSL- or TLS ( not " if available " , but " always " ) . <p> If possible at your email provider , disallow insecure connections to your account altogether. - This will make the connection fail even if the email program is accidently configured to make a secure connection. - ( LuxSci allows this to be set on the user-level or to be enforced by policy account-wide ) . <p> Google Chrome <p> Chome generally uses whatever SSL support is available via your computer operating system . So , if you change the cipher order or remove RC4 via the operating system ( see below ) , that should solve the issue for your in Chrome . <p> We have found that if you startup Chrome with some additional command line parameters , you force TLS v1.0+ and can block use of certain ciphers. - E.g. adding this to your Chrome shortcut ( as the " Arguments " ) or command-line <p> To disable RC4 or make AES256 be the main cipher , you will need to change the cipher support in your Windows Operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Off topic , but Skype uses 256-bit AES- encryption , so if you use it for chat or voice calls , your data is also being encrypted in this fashion . <h> Windows Vista , Windows 7+ <p> Windows Vista and higher , we have seen , does support 256-bit AES , but it publishes 128-bit first in the list and thus this is what is used by most applications in a Windows environment that rely on Windows built-in SSL libraries ( i.e. Internet Explorer , Chrome , Outlook , etc . ) . <p> If you have Windows " Small Business Edition " or better , you can remove ciphers that you do not want and change the order of their presentation by using the " group policy editor " . - For example , to make 256-bit AES the default choice , rather than 128-bit AES or RC4 , follow these instructions : <p> Open your group policy editor by entering gpedit.msc at a command prompt . <p> Now here 's where you need to tread carefully . You 'll see that the list is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns , they 're simply separated with commas . The first item in the list **25;683;TOOLONG And the second item **25;710;TOOLONG Cursor your way through the list . Change that first 128 to 256 . Then cursor forward a bit more and change the 256 to 128. - ( If you ca n't edit or type copy the value , paste it into Notepad , edit it there , then paste it back in the field ) . <p> If you want to get rid of RC4 and other non-AES ciphers , so that your computer uses AES instead of RC4 , and you know that your browsers are safe from The Beast , remove the RC4 items in the list as well . E.g.- TLSRSAWITHRC4128SHA , - TLSRSAWITHRC4128MD5 , and SSLCKRC4128WITHMD5 <p> Similarly , you can use the same procedure to remove all ciphers that are not wanted and thus lock down Windows to AES-only encryption or 256-bit AES- only encryption . <p> However , for those of us who have Home Basic or Home Premium Edition , there is no " group policy editor " ( and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is thus much harder to make this change. - All of the settings that you would be changing above are found in the Windows Registry and can be changed directly therein. - We are not going to go into how to do this here , as it is not for the faint of heart .

Perhaps this is specific to Vista x64 My Vista and XP both have the most recent updates <p> There is nothing wrong or out of date here . The thing is that Vista supports AES256 and AES128 , but given the choice of the two will pick AES128 for speed over security . XP does n't  support AES at all by default . <p> In your web server , you specified only 2 possible ciphers and the only AES one you allow is AES256 . Thus , given the choice between AES256 and RC4 , Vista will happily choose AES256 . XP will choose RC4 as it does not support AES . This is what you see . However , if you included AES128 in your list of allowed ciphers , then Vista would use that instead of AES256 . <p> I have done the Mozilla AES-256 encryption method ( editing the about:config ) and now I can not login Yahoo !

Alternatively , use the command found in the help menu to report this broken site . <p> Looks like Yahoo ! Mail does n't  support AES 256 encryption so by restricting your browser to using it you have loced yourself out of Yahoo ! Mail .

So , if you are connecting to a site that is not 256-bit only , these systems will use only 128-bit AES .

These documents provide all sorts of information to prying eyes your social security number , bank account numbers , business details , clients and vendors names and contact information . The list goes on and on. - This information could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards in your name , assume your identity , take over online accounts , and more . <p> Accountants and agents who accept and send this information over insecure email , or even worse , via free public email accounts like Gmail , Yahoo , AOL , etc. , often show little concern for the potential impact that any single security gap can have on their clients . <p> Those who take these issues with the seriousness that is warranted by the for the protection of customer data offer a serious value-add to their services . <h> What do accountants need to do to prevent- data privacy breaches ? <p> The easy thing to do is to never send sensitive documents over email ( or insecure FAX ) . - That , by itself , will go a long way to safeguarding client data . <p> However , if you want or need to use email to facilitate quick and inexpensive paper-free communications , you , as an accountant , need to ensure that : <p> All sensitive information sent to your clients is encrypted in transit to them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> All sensitive information that your clients send to you is encrypted starting from their computers all the way to your desktop . <p> Privacy can be guaranteed in a way that is not " painful " - i.e. , not too cumbersome to be a problem in and of itself . <p> Knowing what needs to be done and finding a cost-effective way to do it are two very different issues .

Domain Registration Expired <p> Email domain names are " leased " and will expire if not renewed periodically . - Notifications that it is time to renew are usually sent to the email address " on file " at the registrar . - If you never get these notices ( because you no longer use that address , it gets deleted or files as spam , etc. ) you may forget to renew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you web sites go offline , you stop getting email , and may have trouble sending email and doing other things . <p> Check if this is the case : Use EasyWhois- to look up your domains current registration status . - You should be able to tell from the results if your domain has expired or when it does , and what company - manages the registration . <p> If - it has expired , you will need to contact the company at which it is registered and pay them to renew it ( you cant transfer an expired registration to a new registrar at this stage ) . - Once you renew , you should be fully back online within 24-48 hours , or sooner . <p> 2 . Domains DNS MX Records Changed <p> Your domains DNS settings tell the world what servers handle different services for your domain . - If these settings are changed , then email will no longer flow to your proper email servers and it will look like you can not get email anymore . <p> This can happen , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new company to manage your web site . - They may update or change your DNS settings and also alter the information regarding email flow in the process . - This happens all the time . <p> Check with your email provider to see what your DNS MX records should be and if they have been changed on you . If they have , then you need to update this information with the proper settings to restore email flow . - Once you have made that change , it could take a few minutes to a day for email flow to be back to normal ( depending on other DNS settings that you have ) . <p> If you are a LuxSci customer , you can see if your DNS settings are correct by going to your Domain Status page for your domain in your LuxSci domain administration interface . - That page will also provide your domains registration status and details . <h> 3 .

The Case of Missing or Disappearing Messages <p> POP ! If someone has set up an email program or device to connect to your email account using POP , then it is likely that that program/device is connecting frequently , downloading any new email , and deleting that email from the server . - Happens all the time . - Usually when this happens , all email in your INBOX is suddenly gone , you rarely see new messages , and new messages that you do see disappear soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use IMAP , MobileSync , or to keep messages on the server . <p> Forwarding : If you have enabled email forwarding , such that all of your inbound email is being forwarded to another address , then you may not see any new email messages at this address . <p> Search On : If you are using an email program , device , or WebMail and have performed a search ( e.g. for email with some subject ) and that search is still on then you might not see any new email messages until your turn that search off . <h> 6 . Can not connect to server <p> Errors relating to connecting to your email server could be a " Networking or Routing Issue " ( see below ) or an ISP Block issue described above . - It could also be : <p> Mobile Devices and Towers : Cellular cross-talk. - You have moved away from the cell towers that your device was using , but it has not properly switched to new towers and as a result some services , like email , are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reset . - Also , try switching from cellular to Wifi , if you have Wifi available . <p> Mobile Devices- and Wifi : If you are using Wifi , try turning it off and using your cellular connection . - Sometimes there is an issue with your Wifi network that is affecting connections and switching to cellular resolves it . <p> Corrupt Outlook Profile : - Microsoft Outlook is notorious for - random corruption of your " profile " that saves information about accounts and servers . - If you are using Outlook and everything seems OK except for your Outlook connection , you may need to delete your Outlook account and re-create it . <p> Incorrect settings : If you just set up your program or device you may have entered the incorrect server name for your services ( e.g. maybe there is a typo ) . - Please contact your email service provider for the exact host name to use . <h> 7 . Networking or Routing issue <p> Occasionally , problems crop up on the Internet that impede connections between certain people and certain locations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not some specific ones but other people CAN access those web sites . - These are " Internet routing issues " that usually resolve themselves in minutes or hours , and there is nothing that your email provider can do to alleviate it ( as the issue is outside of their control ) . <p> If you have access to a different Internet connection or proxy , you might be able to get to your provider by connecting through that e.g. by going via a " route " that does not hit the " roadblock " . <h> 8 .

These range from confusion over auditing of access to stored ePHI to what HIPAAs data encryption requirements actually are to how HIPAA applies to MySQL databases . Here , we will attempt to address some of these subtle questions for you . <h> ePHI Access Auditing <p> Let 's start with the " easy " question . <p> We are often asked about database audit trails for all of the accesses ( reads , writes , updates ) made to customer databases as at first glance , it may appear that HIPAA and other forms of compliance are asking for that " the more and more detailed the logs , the better , " one may think . <p> However , let 's back up a step . - HIPAA wants to make sure that you log " who " accessed ePHI , when that happened , etc. - The " who " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the majority of cases , all literal database reads and writes are performed by a single " database user " acting at the bequest of your web site application . So , while it is possible to log all database activity , that does not actually address HIPAAs requirements at all , - as this activity generally will not include any information about " what person " interacted with your web application to cause that activity . <p> The full detail of your database activity is also known as a " transaction log " and it is very useful if you are replicating your database from one server to another , or if you want to make certain kinds of backups or provide recovery points for certain kinds of server failures . - However , these logs can and will get VERY large . - In practice , when they are kept , they are kept only for a relatively short period of time ( on the order of hours or days far short of the " years " timeline inherent in HIPAA ) . - LuxSci can enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wish to also pay for all of the disk space required to keep them ; however , this is generally discouraged in favor of other methods for backup and recovery . <p> But wait so how does one actually audit access to ePHI in the database ? <p> It turns out that this is the job of your web application . - Your application knows " who " is logged in and accessing it and it " knows " what that person is doing and it should know if that person is reading , saving , or altering content that is or could be ePHI. - Therefore , it is up to your application to record such events with a degree of granularity that you deem appropriate for your compliance needs . - E.g. <p> Are you going to record access to each individual piece of ePHI , or <p> Are you going to record only access to a particular patents records ? or <p> Are you going to separately record views and edits , or treat these as a lump ? <p> It is up to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function of what your web application does , how ePHI fits into it , and what your compliance team deems appropriate . - It is then up to your web application developers to implement this auditing ( saving the history of these ePHI interactions to that database or a different one and providing the means for your compliance team to access and generate reports on that information ) . <p> Unfortunately , there is no database-level panacea that will " take care of this " for you and generate the kinds of auditing information needed for HIPAA it wo n't happen without your web developers building it into your web application . <h> MySQL Database Encryption <p> HIPAA does not actually require that your ePHI be encrypted at rest when stored in your MySQL database . as long as it is isolated so that no unauthorized people can access it . - That said , it is generally always better to have your data encrypted at rest , if possible , as that prevents a breach from happening should the data be compromised . <p> Beyond trusting in the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can mitigate your potential risk of breach without at-rest encryption to a significant degree by : <p> Hosting your web and database on a dedicated server . - In a shared server environment , your potential risk is greater more customers using your server means possible risk from other customers and from those who would attack those other customers and compromise your data as well . - A dedicated server is like a " private room " . Your exposure is much less . <p> Hosting your database on a separate dedicated server from your web site . - By putting your database on its own server , you isolate it even from your dedicated web server . - Should your web server be compromised , your database server is much less likely to be . - This is the recommended architecture for anyone very security conscious , - independent of their decision for at-rest data encryption . <p> But still , how can MySQL data be encrypted at rest ? <p> There are essentially 3 ways this can be done . <p> 1 . Disk Encryption <p> The hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be encrypted. - This is like the " FileVault " built into modern Mac computers or the encrypted hard drives your can buy at the store . - This method ensures that if the hardware is lost or stolen , the data is safe . - This is very good for laptops and servers in an office environment . - It is marginally useful for databases located in world class data centers or in the cloud as the chance of someone " stealing " or " losing " your hard drive here is very , very low . <p> The big down side of " Disk Encryption " is that each time the server is " booted up , " some person must be there to enter the password to unlock the drive before its data can be used . - E.g. if your server is ever rebooted or restarted without someone authorized to know that special password standing by your database will be DOWN until such a time as that person can either be physically present at the servers console and enter the password , or can login @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on how it is set up ) . - This is very bad for reliability and uptime . <p> For drives in world class data center or in " the cloud " you are not worried about loss or theft of the drive , you are very much more worried about someone gaining system-level access to the server and accessing your database files while the machine is running . - Disk encryption does not protect against this at all . <p> For these reasons , disk encryption is not generally used on live servers at LuxSci and most other providers . - We use it for off-site backup servers , corporate servers , and the like . <p> 2 . Real-Time Virtual Partition Encryption <p> Imagine that instead of encrypting your disk itself , you have a large file or partition that " looks like a disk " . Access to this " disk " is through a special software application .. which encrypts data to be stored and decrypts data to be read from this " disk " . - Data at rest is always encrypted and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far , this is just like " Disk Encryption " . - Next , let 's assume that this special software allows only " authorized programs/processes " to access this data . - This is better than " Disk Encryption " because it ensures that the encrypted files are opaque even to a hacker who has gotten unauthorized access to your server . a very good step for HIPAA compliance . <p> This is a great solution , but it has 2 significant disadvantages : ( 1 ) Its not free licensing it will increase the cost of your solution ; ( 2 ) Supporting it is not free it will take additional operational support hours to manage a database encrypted in this way ; ( 3 ) downtime it still suffers from the need to enter a password or key when the system is started , making the possibility of extended MySQL downtime much more of a possibility . <p> LuxSci can support this solution for dedicated server customers . <p> 3 . Cell-Level Encryption <p> The simplest and cheapest solution is for your application to encrypt ePHI when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is read from your database . - ( 1 ) It does n't  cost any more , ( 2 ) it works with any MySQL database , ( 3 ) your data is encrypted at rest , and ( 4 ) your data is protected from hackers who may have broken into the server . <p> How do you do it ? - The simplest way is to use MySQLs built-in commands AESENCRYPT and AESDECRYPT. - You provide the key-phrase and MySQL takes care of the encryption and decryption of your data . - Keep the key phrase away from your database and you have good protection for your data . - You could achieve similar results ( albeit with more work ) using PGP or openssl , for example . <p> What is the down side ? - Well , you ca n't use MySQL to search or sort data that is encrypted in this way because , to MySQL , it is all just a big encrypted blob of text . - Additionally , it requires your web developers to actively implement encryption and decryption for sensitive data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps not so much work ; however , if your application is already written , it could be painful . <p> What do we recommend ? <p> It dependslike most things : <p> If you are writing your application from scratch or have no tolerance for downtime , consider cell-level encryption . <p> If you can tolerate some downtime in the case of a server reboot and/or do not wish to implement encryption at the application level , consider a solution such as zNcrypt. 
@@22227249 @2227249/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> Do you need a VPN for Secure Email in a Wireless Hotspot ? <p> Published : January 28th , 2014 <p> LuxSci has been approached by many people asking for VPN- ( Virtual Private Network ) - services. - When we ask them why , they indicate that they use wireless hotspots ( like at Starbucks and other public places ) that are insecure and untrusted and they want to be sure that their email is secure and encrypted there. * <p> Note that even if the hotspot is password protected and " secure " , that does not mean that it is " trusted " . - The hot stop administrators or other users of that hotspot could still try to intercept your Internet traffic . - So , just because it is a " secure " hotspot with the little lock next to it and a password that you must enter , do not assume you are safe at all . <p> This is a very legitimate concern. - Wireless hotspots are serious danger zones ; we have seen many cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web sites and had their login usernames and passwords stolen in such places. - This can lead to identity theft , the leaking of sensitive company or personal information , and other serious problems. - Anyone using public wireless hotspots or other untrusted networks for email and other activities that involve personal information need to take care that the information sent to and from their computers is protected. - If the transmission of your sensitive information is protected , then you have nothing to worry about and hotspots can be great places to work . <h> So , why is a VPN- a good solution ? <p> A- virtual private network creates a secure tunnel between your computer and the location of the network , which is typically your office or a VPN-service provider or LuxSci. - When the VPN is enabled , all Internet traffic travels through it first to get out to the Internet ( though some VPNs only transport traffic that is destined for a specific provider or location ) . - This means that this secure tunnel secures your email , chat , web browsing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet ( or between yourself and your provider ) , from malicious users of the local hotspot . <p> So , if you have a VPN , you can turn it on and know you are safe from people in the hotspot anyway . <h> There are some downsides to VPN use <p> Typically , a VPN costs money. - Sometimes you have to have special software installed on your computer and the license to use that software will cost you or the VPN- provider money ( other solutions , like LuxScis VPN service , use the VPN software that is built into modern operating systems ) . - There are open source VPN solutions ( like OpenVPN ) , but they can be complex to setup and get working correctly . <p> Additionally , a VPN- only protects your communications between your computer and the VPN- itself. - So , in the case where the VPN- is in your office , your data travels from your computer to the office over the secure VPN. - Any information that then goes on and out to the Internet at large is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is otherwise secured . <h> Use of SSL is a good alternative to the use of a Virtual Private Network <p> If your concern is in securing access to your email ( POP , SMTP , IMAP , and/or WebMail ) , then use of a VPN is not the only solution. - An email service that provides " Secure Email " will give you the option of connecting to your email over SSL ( How Does Secure Socket Later ( SSL- or TLS ) Work ? ) . <p> When you use SSL- to connect to your email or WebMail server , then all communications from your computer all the way to your email server are encrypted and protected from eavesdropping. - In fact , once you setup your email program ( i.e. Outlook or Thunderbird ) to use an " SSL-enabled " connection , it will always be secure no matter from where you are connecting . <p> All modern email clients and web browsers support SSL very well and it is usually just the matter to " checking a box " to turn it on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The advantages of SSL- over VPN- are : <p> You do not have to remember to enable SSL ( like you do for the VPN ) . - Once configured , you are always using SSL and are thus secure even if you are in a hurry and would have forgotten to enable your VPN <p> SSL- protects your communications all the way to the email servers ; a VPN only protects you for part of the trip. - Of course , if the VPN is next to the email server , this is a moot point . <p> SSL- is generally much cheaper than using a VPN <p> Most web sites that you use that deal in sensitive information will allow you to login securely over SSL so that your web sessions are secured and can not be eavesdropped upon . <p> Use of SSL can be less secure than a VPN : <p> Man in the middle : If you are going through an unknown and untrusted network , there could be a system there that tries to interpose itself between you and your email / WebMail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is happening , you will get a warning about your severs SSL certificate not being trusted . - if you ignore that warning , or click it away without thinking , then your communications are secure but readable by that third party system . - This is a serious consideration whenever using an untrusted network and a good reason to pay attention to warnings ! - The- possibility- of this kind of man in the middle attack on a VPN connection is very- much smaller . <p> Of course , if you need other types of communication which are not SSL-enabled to be secure , or if you need access to information behind a company firewall , then a VPN- will be invaluable for you. - Otherwise , SSL-enabled connections provide as good security and protect against forgetfulness . <p> The best solution is to use a VPN plus SSL for maximal safety and privacy . <h> What does LuxSci provide ? <p> LuxSci does provide VPN services to it servers , as well as SSL for its users POP , IMAP , SMTP , and WebMail connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augment the security of SSL . <p> Furthermore , all new LuxSci accounts have SSL use enforced by default . - This means that , unless you take steps to change your account security settings , all connections by yourself or your users are required to use SSL there is no option of connecting insecurely. - So , the possibility of setting up your services insecurely " by accident " or " by laziness " and then having your personal information stolen at a wireless hotspot or other untrusted network is greatly reduced right from the beginning . <h> Where can you get VPN- services ? <p> If you need a VPN- and your office does n't  offer it , you can check out <h> 7 Responses to " Do you need a VPN for Secure Email in a Wireless Hotspot ? " <p> There is no guarentee that the authentication is happening over a secure ( SSL ) connection . The connection could be insecure and any usernames or passwords that you send could be eavesdropped upon . <p> One very nice feature is that , while you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these protocols , the iPhone configures itself for a secure connection by default you actually have to do extra work to disable the SSL/TLS security options . This is notable , especially since it is common to be checking your email in an untrusted wireless hotspot where use of SSL ( or a VPN ) is essential . <p> is less of a problem than eavesdropping near the sender and recipient ( i.e. in their workplace or local wireless hotspot ) . - So , one must take care that messages are sent securely and received securely. - This <p> I 've found its best to use an OpenVPN based VPN , many hotspots block GRE which is required for a PPTP connection to be maintained , whereas OpenVPN can be configured to just use TCP ( on port 443 HTTP over SSL for example ) . This has the best of both worlds , easy connection , and very very secure data . 
@@22227250 @2227250/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> How do you know if someone has read your email message ? <p> Has your recipient actually read that email that you sent to him or her ? <p> Has anyone else been reading the email messages that you sent or which are saved in your online email folders ? <p> We are often asked how customers can verify if an email that has been sent has actually been read or if they can detect if messages have been covertly read ( e.g. by the NSA ) . - The quick answer is that : <p> With respect to your recipients reading your emails , you generally can not ever know unless you plan on it ahead of time or use a system that includes read tracking as a feature . <p> With respect to your ISP or the government reading emails , you can not ever know . - All you can do is implement encrptions mechanisms to prevent them from reading the messages altogether . <p> In this article , we will discuss what measures you can take and how effective they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest and most generally available methods are the least reliable . <h> Detecting if your ISP or the Government is Reading your Email <p> This is a hot topic with all of the surveillance by the NSA and other government bodies and ISPs that has come to light lately . - Many customers has asked if it is possible to tell if their email has been accessed or read by someone at the ISP or if the ISP has given the email to government agencies . <p> The answer is you cant tell . - Why ? <p> When you get down to it , email messages are simply files on disk or in a database . - Anyone with access to the raw files or databases can read the raw email message content without leaving any digital fingerprints that you can see when looking at your messages yourself . <p> Any high enough level system administrator at your email service provider will have access to the raw content of your email messages . - These people can technically read this raw content and/or give it to other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indicate who has accessed what when , but usually this data is not granular enough to indicate access to specific files and these logs are only available to these high level system administrators and not to customers like yourself . <p> So , you cant know if your raw email data has been accessed or read or distributed . <p> What can you do to protect your email ? <p> As you cant detect if your messages have been read inappropriately , the question then turns to ensuring that either ( a ) you have sufficient trust in your service provider , or ( b ) even if the raw messages are read , that does not divulge the true message content . <p> Privacy <p> Trust in your email provider comes down to privacy policies and controls . - For example , under HIPAA ( the legal framework for health care privacy ) , organizations establish contractual relationships with their email providers where these providers ensure the privacy of their sensitive email data . - E.g. that it will only be accessed by administrators as needed for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service issue ) and they will not disclose any of that information to others in any inappropriate ways . <p> Read your providers privacy policy and see if it is sufficient for your needs . <p> Encryption <p> A good privacy policy does not prevent access by some individuals . - It also usually does not prevent access due to legitimate governmental requests . - So , if these are a concern , you need to go further . - And email encryption is probably the best option . - If the content of your email is encrypted while stored on disk , then even raw access to these messages does not expose their actual content unless the person has the decryption information . <p> If you keep the password to your encryption keys to yourself , and there is no copy of that at your email provider , then those encrypted messages are much more safe than otherwise . - If you encryption keys are also not located with your provider , then they are even more safe . - E.g. using PGP or S/MIME with keys stored only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your provider , where they could provide more convenience with less absolute security ) provides an excellent means of protecting your email data from ISP and governmental view . <h> Recipient Read Receipts <p> The most basic way to determine if your recipient has read your email message is to use a " Read Receipt " . - Most email programs and WebMail systems support the concept of a " Read Receipt " . - These work as follows : <p> The sender chooses to add a " Read Receipt Request " to the email message ( this adds a special extra " **27;737;TOOLONG " to the email header of the message ) . - This is done through a button or checkbox or preference in your email sending program . <p> When the recipient opens the message for the first time , the recipients email program/system sees this request and works together with the recipient to determine if a receipt should be sent back to the sender or not . <p> If a receipt is sent back , the sender gets sent a short email message indicating that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple and very unreliable , because : <p> The sender must actively choose to ask for a read receipt , though usually there are preferences that allow requests to be sent with every message , so that no manual action must be performed . <p> The recipients system must support read receipts . - Some do not and those will never send you back a receipt . <p> Systems that do support them generally allow the recipient to choose if receipts should be sent " always " , " never " or " ask each time " . - E.g. the system may never send receipts or the recipient may choose to not send you one . <p> With read receipts , you only know if a recipient has read you message if you get a receipt back . - But , not getting a receipt does n't  mean that the message has not been read ! <p> LuxSci WebMail supports use of Read Receipts for sending and receipt of email and allows the sender to choose when they are requested and the LuxSci- recipient- to choose if/when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Message Tracking <p> When someone opens an email message that contains images and other content , the readers email program will usually download these images and such from the Internet to display them . <p> Of course , downloading an image from some web site generates a trail and if someone is looking at that trail , they can see that someone downloaded the file and when ( and what IP address was used , and other things ) . - Finally , if the address used for that image is unique to the email message opened , then opening the message and downloading that image is tantamount to letting the sender know that it was read ( by someone ) . <p> These specialized images ( called " web bugs " ) are unique to each message and tied into a system to detect their usage and log it . - - These are much more reliable than read receipts because : <p> The recipient does not generally have the ability to tell if the sender is tracking if the message was read . <p> The recipient does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such , these are often used by spammers and legitimate bulk mailers - to detect if their email messages are being opened and thus if the addresses used are " good " or not , how effective their messages are , etc . <p> However , web bugs are not completely reliable because : <p> Plain Text Preview : Email systems ( like LuxSci WebMail ) that allow you to view a plain text preview of messages before fully opening them do not trigger web bugs in preview mode ( you can preview and delete with no one being the wiser ) . <p> Suppressed Images : Email systems ( like LuxSci WebMail ) that allow you to suppress the display of images in email messages will not trigger web bugs even if you open the full message . <p> Good Filtering : Good email- filtering systems- ( like LuxScis- Premium Email Filtering ) can detect images that are coded to be web bugs and selectively suppress them so that opening the message does not trigger the bugs , but you can still see all the normal non-unique images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs , it does not currently support the ability for senders to use web bugs for tracking except via its Spotlight Mailer email marketing service . <h> Guaranteed Read Receipts <p> Short of unreliable read receipts and using special software to track with web bugs ( which is also not 100% reliable ) , what can you do to know for sure if someone has read your email message ? <p> Generally , if you send a message to someone and they are free to use their own system/program to open that message , then you can never be sure if a message has been read . - The only way to be sure is to control the recipients access to the message content so that you can detect if/when it is opened . <p> One good example of a system that permits guaranteed read receipts is LuxScis SecureLine Escrow system . - With our end-to-end email encryption system : <p> The LuxSci user sends an email to anyone on the Internet . <p> The user chooses for a " Read Receipt " to be sent . <p> The message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other mechanism ) . <p> The recipient gets an email notification of the waiting secure email message . - This notice does not contain your message content . <p> The recipient clicks on a link in that notice and logs into the " Escrow Portal " where your secure message is waiting . <p> The message is opened and shown to the recipient . <p> The Escrow system sees your Read Receipt request and automatically sends you back an emailed confirmation that the message has been read . - This is also tracked in the database , so you can view in online reports who has read your messages and when . <p> SecureLine Escrow ensures that your message is sent securely , that you can get a reliable read receipt , and that you can go back and analyze reports of sent messages and see what happened to them . <p> Other closed email systems , where the access to the message content is controlled by the system itself , may have similar reliable receipt and tracking mechanisms .

Incomplete Forms <p> An incomplete form submission occurs when the end user does not fill out all of the fields that you think should be required . - Imagine a " Contact Form " that a customer submits and says " I need help " but neglects to fill in any information about who s/he is. - The user is probably waiting for help , not realizing that fact , and you are left unable to assist . - The result is a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the end user fills out the fields that you believe are required . - Here are two of them in increasing level of " difficulty " . <p> This will cause the web browser itself to ensure that " something " is entered in that field before the form can be submitted via a form " submit " button . - ( Note that if you submit the form yourself using JavaScript , then this validation will be skipped ) . - Some browsers may also draw the field differently to indicate that it is required . - As of this writing , this method works great in FireFox , Chrome , Opera , and Internet Explorer v10+. - It works somewhat in Safari and not at all in older versions of Internet Explorer . - For best effect , you may way to combine it with JavaScript-based form validation . <p> JavaScript form validation <p> JavaScript form validation allows the web form designer to write a little program that will be run when the end user presses your forms submit button . - This program can then inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are filled in that should be . - If they are missing , you can stop the submission and alert the user and maybe even highlight and send the focus to the problem field . <p> JavaScript form validation is highly effective and used everywhere . - Any good web site developer can assist you with setting up validation for your forms and there are myriads of pre-written JavaScript libraries that you can download for free to simplify the process . <p> Note however , that because JavaScript runs in the web browser it can be disabled and/or altered . - So , just because a form that has JavaScript validation is submitted does not mean that the data actually passed your validation ! - It is quite simple for someone with malicious intent to bypass your validation and submit whatever s/he wants to you . - For forms where you must ensure that this does not happen ( e.g. perhaps in an product ordering scenario ) , you should also always perform validation in your server-side scripts. where the end user has no control . - For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validation is not necessary . <p> Note if you do have required fields , please let the end user know which ones these are ! - E.g. by making them red , or by starring them and indicating what a star means , etc. - Different sites have different ways of doing this . <h> 2 . Invalid Input <p> So , your example end user requesting help entered only " joe " for his/her email address . - That does n't  help if you have all kinds of " Joes " in your customer base . - How- aggravating you still can not help the customer . - Ifonly Joe or is it Josephine ? had been forced to actually enter his/her complete email address ! <p> There are also many ways to combat invalid form input . - These parallel the ways to combat missing form input : <p> HTML5 Form Input Types <p> HTML5 which is now supported in most browsers has some new " input " field types specifically for validating the user input . - I.e. instead of using <p> &lt;input type= " text " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " email " name= " emailaddress " required&gt; <p> This forces entering something and that something must be a single , properly formatted email address . - " joe " wo n't cut it . - There are many of these color , date , datetime , email , month , number , range , search , tel , url , time , week , etc. - Unfortunately , while these work well in the browsers that support them , some ( like- our favorite Micro-child Internet Explorer ) still do not . - The bright side is that if you do use them then browsers that do not support them will treat them like " text " type inputs automatically . - You should use them in conjunction with JavaScript validation . <p> JavaScript validation <p> The same discussion applies here as for using JavaScript to ensure that form fields are not empty . - JavaScript can check any data formatting or requirements that you may have and provide instant feedback to your users . - It is used everywhere and is highly recommended . - However , as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not submit improper data only server side validation can ensure that if needed . <h> 3 . Form Spam <p> You would not believe ( or maybe you would if you have an old-school web form ) how many " form bots " are constantly scanning the Internet for new web site forms . - When they find a form , they fill it- in and submit it- to you . however , they fill it- in with " spam " text and links to web sites that they want you to visit so that they can either sell things to you or infect you with malware. - This is- analogous- to email spam , but targeted at your forms ; they assume some real person has to look at all these form posts and so maybe some unsuspecting person will be taken in by their spam . - Mostly , it just creates an annoying blizzard of unwanted email . <p> Here is a good example , LuxScis blog is protected from form spam . - We removed the protection for 24 hours to see what would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) - Instead , all we got were 100s of spam comments trying to get us to look at other peoples web sites or buy the usual pills , etc. - Turned that back on real fast . my INBOX was becoming unusable . <p> Combating web form spam can be done in several ways . <p> CAPTCHA Force the user to read some image and type in the code . - The assumption is that no automated program will be able to do this . - This assumption is actually wrong . - However , the majority of them are not programmed to do this and so using CAPTCHA input does knock out almost all form spam . - However , it is annoying to end users and you do n't  want to annoy end users if you can help it ! <p> JavaScript Most web form bots are not sophisticated enough to simulate a real person using a real browser. - They mostly do not run the JavaScript that your form uses they just fill out the fields and submit them directly to your server . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be performed somehow so that the server can verify that those JavaScript actions were done and correct then you can block form bots that do not do that without CAPTCHA. - This works wonderfully well in blocking most automated form bots ; however , it does require that the end user actually have JavaScript enabled in his/her web browser ( most people do ) . <p> In- general , you can download scripts that provide CAPTCHA or JavaScript-based protection for most web forms . <h> 4 . Form Insecurity <p> The topic of web form security is deep and wide . - For more detailed overview , see Secure Web Pages and Web Forms : What you Need to Know . - In short , if you are collecting sensitive data of any kind , you should be aware of the entire pathway that the form and data take and ensure that it is all secured from- eavesdropping , interference , and breach . <p> Filling out the form . - Your form itself should be downloaded from a secure server over SSL. - Yes , the form itself may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not loaded over a secure connection , then it is possible - for a hacker to have your end user fill out a look-a-like form and submit that data to him instead of you . - With SSL , your users can gain assurance that they are really connecting to your trusted web site- and that he page has not been modified to present them with malicious content as it was transmitted from the server to them . <p> Submitting the form . When the form is submitted and the data is sent to the server , thus must be done over SSL or else that data can be easily eavesdropped upon . - Make sure that your form processor is on a secure address starting with " https : // " . <p> What happens next ? - Once the data is submitted , it could be emailed to you , saved in a database , or other action . - Ensure that this step is secure too ! - Emailed data is not secure unless special steps are taken ; stored files may not be secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data has made it to the server that it is safe ! <p> We recommend using a service like LuxSci SecureForm- in conjunction with a web form on an SSL-encrypted web page to ensure your form data privacy . - This type of service can ensure ( without any software to install or complex changes to your form ) : <p> Secure collection of the data <p> Secure transmission of the data to you over secure email or secure FTP <p> Secure storage of the data in MySQL or an online file storage location <p> Secure searchable , downloadable , online access to submitted form data <p> Auditing , tracking , and more <h> 5 . Stale Forms <p> Sometimes it happens that customers are seeing old versions of your forms even though you have uploaded newer and better forms . - This is not good ! <p> What is usually happening is that the user has visited your site before and when s/he goes to your form page , the old version which is saved in his/her web browser is displayed instead of your new version . - Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where they can be saved and reused for a certain period of time before changes are sought . <p> If the end user were to press the " refresh " button on the browser , that would force it to get the new page but you ca n't force the end user to do that can you ? <p> Yes , you can . - You can add a little text to the HEAD area of your web form source that forces the web browser to never remember the contents of the form and to thus re-load it every time . <p> &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV= " Pragma " CONTENT= " no-cache " &gt; <p> &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV= " Expires " CONTENT= " -1 ? &gt; <p> Once you have these between the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; of your web form source , you can update your web form at will and be confident that future visitors will always see the latest , greatest version of your form . <h> 6 . Connectivity/Server Issues <p> It is not uncommon for a user to spend time filling out a form , hit " submit " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least not know how to get it back ) . - This causes frustration and sometimes the loss of a customer or possible sales lead . - The solution could be really simple : <p> The users network or ISP is having some issue , or <p> Your web site is down for maintenance for a few minutes <p> Some random issue is happening on the Internet . <p> However , the end user does n't  care . - Whatever the cause , it is taken to be your fault . - Best to avoid this situation altogether . <p> This can be done using AJAX by : <p> Perform all the needed JavaScript validation <p> Make an AJAX request to the server to make sure it is reachable and alive <p> If that request succeeds , then post the form data and continue <p> If the AJAX request fails , alert the user and have them re-try in a minute <p> The result is that most connectivity issues and maintenance situations can be detected in this way and the user can be nicely notified without losing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of proactive feedback and are happy to wait a minute and try again .

Read Receipts and Web Bugs <p> Published : May 10th , 2011 <p> Customers often ask how they can know if a message has been read by a specific recipient . - Typically , this is done by requesting a " Read Receipt " when sending the message ; however , read receipts are not reliable . - Spammers use techniques such as HTML " web bug " tracking to see if you have read an email message and thus if your email address is valid and ripe for more spamming ; this is also not reliable . LuxScis SecureLine Escrow service includes a 100% reliable Read Receipt function that can be used when it is essential to know if someone has read a message . It also allows for message retraction ( removing further access to an email message ) . <p> This article goes over these various methods of determining if a message has been read , shows how each works , and discusses the pros and cons of each . <h> Read Receipts <p> Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sender . - Most email programs , like Outlook , Thunderbird , and LuxSci WebMail , allow Read Receipts to be added to email messages , and allow senders to choose if they are sent " never " , " on demand " , or " always " . <p> Sending : Read Receipts are implemented by adding a special " Header " to the headers area of the outbound email message ( See : - Viewing the Message Source / Full Headers of an Email ) . - For example , if somebody@luxsci.net sent an email message and wanted a Read Receipt , the following " **27;812;TOOLONG " header would be added : <p> **27;841;TOOLONG : somebody@luxsci.net <p> Receipt : When the recipient of the message first opens the message , the recipients email program may see this header and send a special " Delivery Notification " email message back to the address- somebody@luxsci.net . Then- somebody@luxsci.net gets this notification , s/he knows that the message has been read . <p> Not Reliable : Read Receipts are not a reliable way to know if a message has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recipients email program might not support responding to Read Receipt requests . - In this case , receipts would never be sent . <p> Refusal : Even if the email program does support Read Receipts , the programs generally allow the recipient to choose if they should be responded to . - I.e. recipients could choose to respond " never " , " always " , or " decide each time " . - The default is usually to prompt the recipient and allow them to decide yes or no for each receipt . <p> So , if you are using a Read Receipt to confirm delivery , you will usually only get a receipt if the recipient wants you to . - Sending Read Receipt requests is- not reliable for confirming the read status of a message in general , especially if the recipient is trying to deny that the message was even received ! <h> Web Bugs <p> So , how can you tell if someone has opened and read a message without a Read Receipt request and without letting the recipient know that you are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened , any referenced external objects such as images are usually downloaded from the Internet and displayed . - For example , if someone sends you an email message with a link to display a picture of somebody , and that picture is not attached to the message , but hosted somewhere ( like on Facebook ) , then your email program will download that image and display it to you . <p> The trick is for the sender to include some unique tracking code in the link to that picture . - Then the picture is downloaded , the web server where it was stored records that download , complete with the date , time , tracking code , and your computers IP address . - By looking at those web server log files , the sender can confirm if you have downloaded the image and thus if you have read the message . <p> Typically , but not always , the tracking code is attached to some small- innocuous- image ( like a small invisible image ) . - These small tracking images are collectively known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Not Reliable : Web bugs are not a reliable way to know if a message has been read . - Why ? <p> No HTML : If the recipient opens the message in an email program with HTML support turned off , no images or other objects will be downloaded. - For example , LuxSci WebMail shows recipients a plain text preview of their messages there is no way to track opening the plain text preview of a message using a web bug . <p> Images Off : If the recipient has turned display of external images off in their email program , then the web bugs would never be downloaded. - This is an optional feature in some programs like Thunderbird and LuxSci WebMail . <p> Web Bug Extraction : Some email filters will auto-detect images that look like web bugs ( i.e. images that look like they have tracking codes on then ) and will automatically remove them by replacing them with transparent images . - In this case , the web bugs would not be downloaded , but other images would show up fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spammers do n't  really care that this is not 100% reliable . - It is " good enough " to identify a large number of valid recipients and thus allows them to narrow down their lists and send these people more spam . - See- Protecting Yourself from Email " Web Bugs " . <h> Reliable Read Receipts <p> So , how can you know , 100% of the time , if your recipient has read your message or not ? <p> Really , the only way to do this is to have control over the recipients ability to read the message . - A common way to do this is to : <p> Save the message on a web site over which you have control <p> Send the recipient a notice that a message is waiting for him on that web site and provide him/her with the means to access it . <p> When the recipient connects and uses his access credentials successfully to open the message , you record that fact <p> In this way , you know if and when the message was retrieved . - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what IP address(es) , and you could remove access to it ( i.e. retract it ) at any time . - These Reliable Read Receipt and Retraction features are included in LuxScis SecureLine Escrow service . <p> Other email systems may also provide reliable ways of Read access tracking ; in every case it depends on : <p> The system being configured to support it , - and <p> Having full control over the system that the recipient uses to access the message <p> If you do not have access to your control your recipients email system , then you should consider using a message pickup system with tracking included , such as SecureLine Escrow.

DKIM merely allows the senders to digitally sign the messages they send so that you can verify that the sender really owns the sending domain and has permission to send from it . - This provides legitimacy and transparency and mitigates the ability of spammers to send spam using forged / stolen email addresses ( like yours ) . - However , it does not stop a spammer from buying his/her own domain name , setting up DKIM on it , and sending email using that now-legitimate sending address . <p> DKIM will not stop SPAM , but it will force spammers to use their own email addresses , instead of forged ones . - It will stop them from stealing your email address to send email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " phishing " attacks much harder ( attacks where you get a forged email from your bank , for example , asking you to do something compromising ) . <h> 2. - DKIM can be forged since DKIM details are published in DNS <p> DKIM signatures can not be forged . <p> Your unique DKIM key pair consists of two parts a " private " key and a " public " key . - The private key is kept only on the servers of your email service provider and is used to sign messages . The public part is published in your DNS ( so anyone can see it ) and used to verify the signatures . - The public key can not in any way be used to generate valid signatures or to determine what the secure private key is. - For more information on " asymmetric encryption , " see Section 4 of The Case for Email Security . <h> 3 . DKIM encrypts your email <p> DKIM does not provide any email encryption of any kind . - DKIM merely examines the message content ( body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. the subject , date , sender , and others ) , and makes a digital signature or fingerprint of that data . - It then adds the signature / fingerprint to the message headers so that the recipient can verify that : <p> The message was sent by someone with permission to send email for this domain ( per DKIM ) <p> The message content and those selected headers have not been altered in any way since sending . <p> DKIM signatures provide protection from : message modification and message replay , and to a small degree , identify theft , false messages , and repudiation . - They do not protect at all against eavesdropping , invasion of privacy , and unencrypted backups and data at rest . - For these you need to use some form of actual- email encryption. <h> 4 . An invalid DKIM message signature means that the message was forged <p> Once you set up or enable use of DKIM in your inbound email filters , you will start seeing messages arrive with no DKIM signatures and invalid DKIM signatures . - It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegitimate . - Besides forged email , messages could arrive without a DKIM signature ( even if one is supposed to exist , per the domains DNS settings ) because : <p> Most common . - The message is arriving from a valid third party system used by the sender which is not yet enabled with DKIM. - Thus , the messages are not signed even though DNS says they should be . - A good example might be credit card receipts coming from a third party merchant services provider which appear to be from your vendor , but which are not signed as they should be . - Are they forged ? Maybe not . - If the sender has vendors or servers that cant send signed messages , then their DNS should indicate that use of DKIM by their domain is " not required " . - Not everyone sets this up properly . And things can change after DKIM is setup . <p> DKIM Signature headers could be stripped out by some email filtering or processing system that you are using . <p> The sender may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DKIM signature could exist on the message but your systems indicate that this signature is " invalid " . - This does not always mean that the message was forged or maliciously modified . - It could mean : <p> The message was modified by inbound email filtering software , breaking the DKIM signature . - This usually happens if you are checking DKIM after the message has passed through some other filters that may do things such as : <p> The message was modified by the sender after the signature was added . - This is not very common . <p> So , before your unilaterally discard messages with missing or invalid DKIM , take care that you will not lose email from some legitimate senders and that your filters are not " messing with " your DKIM analysis in some cases . <h> 5 . Because DKIM digitally signs your email , this is the same as a PGP or S/MIME digital signature that proves who sent the message <p> DKIM is an electronic digital signature on a message , and like PGP and S/MIME digital signatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can let you know if the message was sent again ( as the date can not usually be changed without invalidating the signature ) . - However , DKIM does not provide identity verification like PGP and S/MIME . <p> With public key cryptography systems like PGP and S/MIME , each individual sender has his/her own unique key . - The recipient of such a signed message can thus verify exactly who signed and sent the message , as presumably no one else possesses the senders private signing key . <p> With DKIM , there is only one signing key for your entire domain . - A valid signature only proves that someone with access to that key sent the message . - Usually , this means someone with access to your email providers servers . - E.g. any individual in your organization or some server administrator at your email server provider , or some malicious software that has hijacked one of your users email programs and is using it to send out messages though your email service provider ( where they are being DKIM-signed ) . - This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( forgery ) , falsely sent messages , and the ability for the sender to deny that s/he sent a message . <h> 6. - Setting up DKIM with your email service provider protects all email sent by your domain <p> If you want to use DKIM for signing your domains outbound email to help ensure that it can not be forged , you must be sure that DKIM is enabled on all systems that send email with addresses in your domain . - Sometimes this is harder that it sounds . - Of course , your email service provider should be able to set this up for you , but do n't  forget : <p> All vendors . - Many vendors can - send you or your customers messages from your domain ( e.g. receipts , notifications of blog or forum posts , password reset emails , etc. , etc ) . - Take inventory of all vendors that send email from your domain and enable DKIM on all that you can . <p> When you configure DKIM in your DNS , you can specify if DKIM is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Unless you can be sure that your email provider and all vendors are signing your messages , then you have to set this to " optional " . - However , if it is " optional " then you lose protection against spammers sending forged email purporting to be from your domain . - All you have left is the assurance for your recipients that signed messages have not been modified and are likely from you . - Setting up DKIM " half way " does not really provide the forgery protection that you may want . <h> 7 . DKIM can be enabled with the click of a button <p> Enabling or configuring your inbound email filtering to use DKIM signatures as a criteria can , generally , be enabled with the click of a button ( e.g. in- Premium Email Filtering ) . <p> However , setting up your email services to use DKIM usually takes a little more effort . - This process involves : <p> Enabling DKIM for your domain with your email provider , so that messages are signed with your new key <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - We auto-generate the DKIM keys , auto-enable their use by our servers , and add the new DNS records for you , if you manage your DNS through us ( or tell you what to add if you do n't  ) .

Message Escrow <p> With SecureLine Message Escrow , your message is encrypted and stored in a secure database at LuxSci. - A simple non-PHI notification message is sent to your recipient . - The recipient clicks on a link in this notice , verifies his/her identity at our free secure web portal , and then can access your message . <p> This is very secure and works with any recipients email address ; however , it requires a little extra work on the recipients part going to a portal to access the secure message . <p> 4 . SMTP TLS <p> With SMTP TLS , the secure message is sent just like any other regular message ; however , it is encrypted using TLS as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For how this works , see : SMTP TLS : All About Secure Email Delivery over TLS . <p> SMTP TLS works with any recipient whose servers support TLS for inbound email . Some , like Gmail , do . Others , like Yahoo and AOL , do not . <p> SMTP TLS is very user friendly , as the secure email message arrives in the recipients INBOX and looks and works like any other email message . - Its easy . <p> We are going to focus on the Escrow and TLS methods in the remainder of this article . <h> Ok , So What About Replies ? <p> When your recipient replies to your message , here is what could happen : <p> 1 . Message Escrow <p> When a recipient view a secure email in the Message Escrow portal , the recipient has the option of replying to this message . - That reply is automatically secured . <p> However , the recipient could choose to reply from his/her email program by replying to the escrow notification message itself ( people will do anything ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their email system supports TLS or other email security measures . - You can assume in the general case that this will be insecure . <p> 2 . SMTP TLS <p> When a recipient replies to an email sent to them using SMTP TLS , they use their regular email system to send that message . - Like the previous example , this- may or may not be secure , depending on if their email system supports TLS or other email security measures . - You can assume in the general case that this will be insecure . <p> So , unless you are sending messages to recipients using only Escrow , many replies will come back insecurely . <h> So if its Insecure , is it non-Compliant ? <p> This is where the questions arise if some replies are insecure , does this mean that the system is non-Compliant ? <p> The short answer is : No . <p> Why ? Because HIPAA requires that you be sure that PHI that you transmit be properly secured . - When your patient/recipient/etc. replies to your message , it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that person is transmitting PHI about themselves , it is up to them if they wish it to be secured or not , or if they trust their email service . <p> If that person is not a covered entity or business associate of one , then the HIPAA regulations do not apply to messages sent by them so they can not be violating HIPAA by replying insecurely . <p> If that person is a covered entity or business associate of one , then HIPAA does apply and that person should be using a secure email system to reply and the burden is on them ( and not you ) to ensure that there is no breach . <p> So , for example , if you use TLS and send an email to a patient who uses Gmail , that message will arrive and look like any other message and the reply may or may not use TLS on its way back to you ( Gmail will generally use TLS , but you can not count on it as there is no promise from Gmail that this will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message you sent was properly secured , and either <p> The reply is by someone who is not subject to HIPAA and so the content does n't  need to be encrypted , or <p> The reply is by someone who is subject to HIPAA and they should not be using Gmail and are in violation of themselves if they are sending PHI that is not about themselves . <h> Should SMTP TLS be Used ? <p> HIPAA is notorious for being technology neutral . - It tells you what to do but not how to do it . - As a result , what is minimally required and what is best are sometimes very different things. - Because of that , customers have a wide range of expectations and desires in terms of how they would like things to work . <p> At LuxSci , HIPAA-compliant email accounts have use of SMTP TLS enabled so it is used preferentially whenever it is available . This is for maximum usability. - Customers have the ability to completely turn off use of SMTP TLS as the sole method of secure email delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. people in their own organization ) . - It is up to the customer which methods they think best for their organization to use . <h> Recommended Best Practices <p> The best practices for best security are often at odds with the simplest and most user friendly experience . - This is often true in security and usually true for HIPAA. - The more flexibility you have and the more it works like regular email , the more room for error . - E.g. see Opt-In Email Encryption is too Risky with HIPAA Omnibus . <p> LuxSci would recommend the following to HIPAA customers as it strikes a good balance between security and usability : <p> Disable use of " SMTP TLS whenever possible " . <p> Enable use of " SMTP TLS " for delivery to email addresses hosted at LuxSci ( This ensures that Escrow is used for general recipients , but that regular TLS is used for " internal messages " ) <p> Upgrade to " Message Center " so that recipients using Escrow can see a history of all messages received and sent through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escrow " you have a new secure message " notification to request recipients to not reply directly to it but to instead reply through the secure portal . - ( Requires Private Labeling )

If a HIPAA-aspiring entity is n't fully educated about the finer details of the compliance process , they could end up paying very large amounts of money for Google services and still be non-compliant . Here we discuss some misconceptions about Google services as they apply to HIPAA to help you avoid the pitfalls of non-compliance . <h> Free Gmail is not HIPAA Compliant <p> Let 's state it for the record : there is no possibility of HIPAA compliance with free Gmail accounts . Google only offers the possibility of HIPAA compliance for paid Google Apps customers with their own domain name . <p> As of now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not especially cheap either . - And this price does not include any of the optional features that Google offers to its business customers , such as email archival , filtering and encryption . <h> Email Encryption is NOT included <p> Paid Google Apps accounts do not come with any kind of email encryption. - Google supports- forced TLS outbound to email providers that support- encryption- and Google allows opportunistic TLS inbound and outbound , but this does not at all ensure that your communications are secured in general or that your email messages are HIPAA compliant . - What you need is a mechanism that will : <p> Ensure that messages you send to anyone are encrypted during transport ( at a minimum ) <p> Allow correspondents at non-compliant hosts to send secure messages to you <p> There is no such mechanism with a paid Google Apps account . If you sign up for Google Apps , request and sign their BAA , then start sending emails out , you could very quickly be in violation of HIPAA and in breach . <p> Their Business Associate Agreement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needful things in a reasonable time frame to ensure the privacy and security of the data that they hold . - All the rest is your responsibility , which also means not sending ePHI-laden email to people unless you take extra steps for extra costs to ensure the messages are secure . - Also ( and they do n't  tell you this ) , Google provides no guidance in what you should or should not do for compliance . <p> Google does not offer any email encryption service . - Period . - All email encryption services that work with Google Apps are provided by third-party companies . - Even " Google Apps Message Encryption " ( a.k.a . GAME ) is an encryption add-on provided by ZixCorp . GAME itself costs about $35/year/user and has a 100-user minimum that can make it quite expensive for smaller organizations . - GAME- provides a simple mechanism akin to LuxScis SecureLine Escrow service- that allows sending secure messages to anyone by requiring them to pick up these messages from a secure web portal . - It also provides a means , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . - It does not include generalized forced-TLS , PGP , or S/MIME options , like LuxSci SecureLine does . <h> Not All Google Services are Covered by their BAA <p> The Google Apps Business Associate Agreement currently only promises HIPAA compliance for email , calendar , drive , and apps vault . - Any other services are not compliant , and any use of these services that exposes the data in a non-complaint way is not covered . <p> What this means is that if you do n't  buy an add-on to send email securely , use of email is actually non-compliant. - While email stored on Googles servers may be technically HIPAA compliant , you sending email without encryption is considered your choice , and thus your own action has breached security no concern of Googles. - In your BAA with Google , you agree to take " appropriate safeguards designed to prevent against unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI . " - That is all they say on the subject in their BAA ; essentially , you 're on your own do to the right things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite stance . - We make sure that the things you do with email , contacts , and calendars are secure and compliant , and that you 're fully informed of what is and is not within the scope of HIPAA compliance . - Our compliance accounts favor an opt-out model rather than an opt-in one , as we fully believe that opt-in encryption ( that is , forcing the customer to choose when to encrypt a message ) is far too dangerous under HIPAA Omnibus . - Google , Microsoft , and other providers put the onus on the customer and all end users to always make the correct decision about when and what to send securely . <p> We believe that is a recipe for disaster . Google services are not fully compliant even after signing their BAA. - Did you know that you have to purchase and setup additional services ? - Did you know that finding information on their Encryption Services is almost as difficult as trying to order it ? - What about calendars ? - Under what circumstances is that data compliant ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unused on their servers , but what about when its synced to some third-party app on a mobile device ? - Is that secure ? Are the emailed alerts and notifications of appointments compliant ? - Such alerts can easily contain ePHI , but are their calendar notice emails encrypted with their optional ( and expensive ) email encryption add-on ? - What if you do n't  have that particular add on ? - What other uses of their services are not properly encrypted ? - Who can you ask to clarify how these services work ? <p> These are all things you need to think about if you 're considering Google services for HIPAA compliance . <p> Basic and premium refer to LuxSci Basic and Premium shared and dedicated environments . <h> What does this all mean ? <p> On a per-user basis , Google Apps is more expensive than LuxSci much more expensive in many cases , and especially as the number of users increases . <p> Google includes a huge chunk of disk space with each $5 user because most users never use anywhere near this amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user ( e.g. IMAP and mobile user ) might use 1 or 2 GB of disk space , with only a few outliers using 5GB or more . - But Google makes up for this by charging $5/user ( whereas LuxSci only charges $1/user ) . - So , once you start adding users , the cost of a Google account quickly swells . <p> LuxSci gives a reasonable amount of space ( 15-30G ) for your whole account and allows you to pay for more space as needed , so you can save by paying for what you actually need . - We do n't  shoehorn the cost of the disk space into the per-user price . <p> LuxScis SecureLine encryption service includes more features than Googles Email Encryption service and is easier to use . <p> LuxScis services are designed to help you meet and maintain your compliance , and our BAA was carefully constructed to encompass everything that your compliance will entail . We lock down your accounts and ensure that you have the services and settings that you need . - We also document what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - No ambiguity , no room for error . <h> 10/2014 Update <p> We recently checked in on Google Apps and HIPAA just to see if the landscape had changed since we first assembled the above information over a year ago . - What we found was disappointing <p> Google Apps says it supports HIPAA compliance , but there is no mention of encryption anywhere , unless you explicitly search for " Google Message- Encryption " - <p> Googles published link to its " Security White Paper " is now dead and returns a 404 page not found error . <p> The link to " Google Apps Security Site " now just takes you to a home page for their enterprise solution , which does not mention anything about security <p> So not much has changed in a year , except that their site has become more inconsistent and it appears that it is harder to find the information needed to be compliant . - One may presume that without the help of someone who has done the research , setup these kinds of accounts , and vetted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one would be at very high risk of doing things in a non-compliant way . <h> 6/2017 Update . <p> Google still does not offer their own encryption solution . - In fact , the only significant changes we see revolve around increases in prices for G Suite services due to service bundling.

If your SPF record must- be more complicated than that due to all of the possible organizations that may be sending email for you , then you must either not use SPF , or leave some legitimate sending servers off the list . <p> In cases where you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be configured to be " weak " if SPF matches , then the message is probably legitimate ( e.g. " weak " is denoted by using the " Soft Fail " code " all " in the SPF DNS configuration ) . - If the weak SPF check fails because it comes from an unauthorized server , then it might or might not be legitimate . <p> A large number of providers ( e.g. gmail.com , bankofamerica.com , luxsci.com and others ) have their SPF records set up as " weak " for this reason and others , see below . <p> Forwarded messages are problematic <p> When a message is forwarded , the " From address " does not change but the sending server does change . <p> E.g. if you receive a message from Bank of America and then forward it to your friend , it is now your email server sending that message that purports to be from bankofamerica.com . <p> If - bankofamerica.coms SPF records were setup as strict ( e.g. " strict " is denoted by using the " Hard Fail " code " -all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends email server would look at that message forwarded from you as " forged " and mark it as Spam/Fraud . In most cases , that is not desirable . - While there is a technology that allows forwarding to get around this ( SRS Sender Rewriting Scheme ) , it is not widely or universally used . <p> For this reason as well , most domain owners set up- their SPF records as " weak " ( indicating that if the SPF check fails , the message could still be legitimate ) . <p> Inter-domain Forgery <p> SPF checks only the domain name and the server . <p> If there are two different people in the same organization , Fred@domain.com and Jane@domain.com either of them can send email legitimately from their @domain.com address using the servers they are authorized to use for domain.com email . <p> However , if Fred@domain.com uses his account to send a message forged to be from Jane@domain.com SPF will check out as " OK " even if SPF is set as strict . <p> SPF does not protect against inter-domain forgery at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a generalization to inter-domain forgery . - If two people are using the same email provider , they will often- have the same SPF records as email providers usually have everyone use a standard SPF record indicating that messages coming from any of the providers servers are OK. - In this case , it may be- possible for any user of that email provider to send a forged message purporting to be from another user in an unrelated domain and have the SPF check pass . <p> It may be possible to " narrow " the scope of your SPF records to only those servers at your email provider that could actually be used by your account for sending . - However , unless you have dedicated servers with them which isolate all of your sending to machines only accessible to folks in your own account , your SPF record must authorize servers shared with other , unrelated accounts over which you have no control . <p> SPF does not really protect against Spam <p> This is not a limitation of SPF , but worth noting anyway just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you identify if a message is forged or not . - Most Spammers are savvy. - They use their own legitimate domain names and create valid SPF ( and DKIM and DMARC ) records so that their email messages look more legitimate . <p> In truth this does not make them look less spammy ; it just says that the messages are not forged . <p> Of course , if the spammer is trying to get by your filters by forging the sender address so that the sender is " you " or someone you know , then SPF can absolutely help . <h> How Attackers Subvert SPF <p> So , in the war of escalation where an attacker is trying to get a forged email message into your INBOX , what tricks do they use to get around sender identity validation by SPF ? <p> As you can imagine , the protections afforded by SPF are minimal . - Most domains setup SPF weakly so that messages that fail SPF are not automatically flagged as invalid . - From an attackers perspective , it all comes down to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Can they pick an address to construct an email that you will trust that will make it past SPF ? <p> If the sender address does not support SPF at all the attacker is " all set " . <p> If the attacker can send you a message from one of the servers authorized by the SPF for the domain , then the message will look legitimate . - E.g. If the attacker signs up with the same email provider as that used by the forged domain , then s/he can send an email from those same servers authorized by SPF as " good " for the forged domain . - This makes the attackers email look " Good " even if the forged domains SPF records are " strict " . <p> If the forged domains SPF records are weak and the attacker ca n't use an authorized server to make the message look valid , then it does n't  really matter as SPF Failure wont make their message look forged . <p> If the attacker has a choice of addresses to forger to achieve his/her ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meets one of these 3 options . <h> How to Fix SPF ? <p> Ok so SPF by itself is clearly useful but no real protection against fraud . What do you do ? <p> A responsible domain owner who wants to protect his/her domain from forgeries and identify forged inbound email , takes additional steps which we shall discuss in future articles . - These include use of DKIM , DMARC , and other message signature and isolation techniques .

In certain circumstances , the message may go " missing " due to other factors , but for our purposes here we will assume a successful delivery . <p> The key point here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message is communicated between different computers using the SMTP protocol . - However , step 2 requires lots of information from your email provider to establish security and to prove you have permission to send the message . - In step 4 , no authentication is needed , no special security is ( usually ) needed , and communication is always on the standard SMTP port 25 . Also , the number of messages that you can send in a specific time frame is typically not limited . <h> The Unlimited Sending Trick <p> So , here is what you need to do to send unlimited , unauthenticated , insecure email messages to addresses in a specific single domain . <p> Server : Determine the inbound email servers for the recipients domain . - Technically speaking , these are the MX Records located in the DNS for that domain ( you can use this online tool to look these up for any domain ) . - Simply pick one of these servers and use it as the " SMTP Server " in your device/software configuration <p> Port : Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ password will be required ; your program/device should have the option to allow SMTP without login authentication . <p> With this setup , your email program/device will behave like an actual email server . In other words , it will bypass steps 1-3 from the section above and deliver email directly to the recipients inbound server . - By skipping step 2 , you are essentially circumventing the requirements of your email provider or ISP that were causing the sending issue in the first place . <h> What 's the Catch ? <p> You may be thinking that this looks a little too easy . In fact , because the SMTP email delivery protocol was developed long before security and spam became real concerns , spammers often use this exact method to deliver spam messages directly to their recipients . - As a result , email providers have developed ways to defend against improper or unwanted email while at the same time allowing legitimate email flow to continue unabated . Therefore , the real trick becomes making sure your email looks legitimate so that it gets through the recipient servers defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery issues that may arise when trying to sidestep the normal outbound email process , and the solutions to them ( if any ) . <p> Sending is blocked : - ISPs often block outbound email connections on port 25 to servers other than their own . - This is to stop spammers from using the method described above to send spam through their servers . - If your ISP is blocking port 25 , then you need to either get special permission from your ISP to use port 25 , use a different ISP , or find some other way to get your email program/device to send email . The trick discussed in this post will not work over any other port except 25 . <p> For SPF : You need to update your domains DNS to add the IP address of your program/device to the allowed list for SPF. - If your IP address changes frequently , then this is not an option and SPF may block you from getting your email delivered . <p> For DKIM : You need your program or device to add a DKIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support this ) . - If you have DKIM protection , you may not be able to send messages directly in this server-direct - manner without them looking fraudulent . <p> For Either : If you can get your recipient to " white list " your from address in his/her email filters , this may opt your messages out of their SPF/DKIM checks and let them through to their inbox anyway . <p> Filtered : Messages sent directly from your program/device which do not pass though your regular outbound email service will look different to the recipient servers ( beyond differences in DKIM and SPF ) . - This may result in the message being flagged as spam or filtered in some other way . If this is happening , you 'll need to request that your recipient add your From address to his/her allow list ( or add the IP address of your program/device to the allow list if that is possible ) . <p> Rate Limited : - Inbound email servers are not all-together ignorant ; they do track who is sending them messages , how many , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have different methods to rate limit inbound email to prevent too much email from coming in at once and to restrict spammers , viruses , and email bombs from creating serious issues . - If you send many messages at once or many messages in an hour or day , you may find some of your messages rejected due to rate limiting . - In such cases , it would be up to you to wait and re-send the message later . - If you find this happening to you , we recommend that you contact the recipients email provider and discuss with them your specific mailing requirements and find a solution to get your email though without rate limiting rejections . <p> TLS Required : Some recipient email servers may only accept inbound email from you if that message arrives over a TLS-secured email channel . In such a case , your direct deliveries will be rejected or will bounce . - If this is happening , then you will need to use a program/device that supports TLS ( many should ) or find some way to send though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like LuxSci does ) . <p> Encryption Needed / HIPAA . If the messages that you send need to be encrypted from sender to recipient due to regulations such as HIPAA , then you must at a minimum use TLS for the connection . - You should never use this direct-sending method without TLS to get your messages through , as that would be considered willful- negligence- in skirting compliance requirements on your part and could bring heavy penalties on you . - In general , you must use a compliant email system and ensure that every message is sent properly . <h> Any other solutions ? <p> If the direct delivery trick does n't  work , there may be other solutions . - These involve getting a paid email service account with a reputable provider . - For example , a LuxSci High Volume account would allow : <p> Sending as much email as you need <p> TLS support <p> DKIM support <p> SPF support <p> HIPAA-compliant sending ( with Premium High Volume ) <p> Alternate ports for sending in case port 25 is blocked by your ISP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sending . - You could have authentication by your IP address ( though without alternate ports , HIPAA-compliance , DKIM , and SPF ) using LuxSci Outbound Message Filtering- service ( though our partnership with McAfee ) .

For this reason , many organizations use both technologies . <p> If you are using both technologies and you have a good amount of control over where your domains messages are coming from , then you can step up your game by using DMARC - Domain-based Message Authentication , Reporting and Conformance. - <h> DMARC : A Simple Explanation <p> When using SPF and DKIM , email filters see if messages pass or fail SPF and DKIM and use the DNS-published " strictness " settings to help them determine " what do do next " . - The result of failing SPF and/or DKIM is thus a function of how a particular filter is implemented and leads to varied and inconsistent results . <p> A DMARC policy allows a sender to indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM , and tells a receiver what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes " such as junk or reject the message . DMARC removes guesswork from the receiver 's handling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to potentially fraudulent &amp; harmful messages . DMARC also provides a way for the email receiver to report back to the sender about messages that pass and/or fail DMARC evaluation . <p> ( Note that in the following discussion we omit some of the finer , nuanced options and configuration possibilities available with DMARC for the sake of clarity . ) <p> In practical terms , with a DMARC policy published in DNS : <p> The message must pass either SPF or DKIM but does not need to pass both . <p> This resolves the deficiencies of SPF ( forwarding ) and DKIM ( inadvertent message modification ) by allowing compensation via the other mechanism <p> Sender policies can specify exactly what to do with messages that do not pass SPF and DKIM : do nothing , quarantine them , or reject them . - There is no longer any implementation-specific ambiguity on what filters should do , when . <h> Setting up DMARC <p> With DMARC ( as with all anti-fraud solutions for email ) , it is up to the owner of a domain ( e.g. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for DMARC to be used- by the recipients . - If they do not do this , then there is no way to use DMARC . <p> DMARC- is set up by adding special entries to the published- DNS settings for the domain . - You can use a tool , such as this DMARC Record Assistant , to create create the DMARC DNS record for your domain . <p> We are not going to spend time on the details of the configuration or setup here ; instead we will look at the actual utility of DMARC- and where its use can actually make it easier for- attackers to forge email . <h> DMARC " The Good Parts <p> Once DMARC- has been set up , it really does help reduce generic fraudulent email from a domain . - E.g. simple forged spam and basic phishing attacks are curtailed more effectively than via use of SPF and DKIM alone , though the DKIM " glue " that combines them into a more comprehensive check with a consistent , well-defined failure state ( e.g. reject or quarantine ) . <p> DMARC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up weak SPF and DKIM records ( e.g. ones that say that SOF and DKIM " do n't  have to pass " ) . - DMARC allows them to allow that one of these validation schemes may fail while still requiring that the other one passes for the message to be considered legitimate . - This is great progress . <p> Use of DMARC is recommended for every domain owner - and for every email filtering system , where you have control over all of the sources of messages " from your domain name " . <p> An interesting side effect , however , is that DMARC use can make a domain more susceptible for determined forged email ! <h> DMARC " Its Limitations <p> This is a surprise , if you think about it . - Combining DKIM and SPF into a unified , complementary policy set that allows each to compensate for the others weakness is an amazing idea and does a great job in general . - However , a side effect of this technique , in terms of its susceptibility to determined fraud , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. NOT BOTH . - In fact , there is no way to use DMARC to require that BOTH must pass . <p> Wait what is the problem ? <p> Since DMARC is happy if either SPF or DKIM passes , then an attacker needs to find a way to generate an email that passes only one , and not both validation checks . - Note that this is only worse than separate use of SPF and DKIM if your SPF and DKIM rules are both " strict " ( if it does n't  pass " drop it " ) ; in most other cases its the same or better than using both technologies separately . <p> Looking at our previous analyses of SPF and DKIM , an attacker could generate a " Good Looking " forged email that passes DMARC if : <p> They can send from a server IP that is allowed under the forged sender domains SPF policy . - This can be done by using the same email provider ( or approved vendor ) as the sender . <p> They- can send you a message from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain and if that server does not care who initiated the message but will sign any messages going through it with the proper DKIM keys , then the message will look legitimate . - E.g. If the attacker signs up with the same email provider as that used by the forged domain and that provider 's servers do not restrict DKIM key usage , then s/he can send an email from those same servers are the legitimate account and have his/her messages properly signed . <p> The attacker can compromise any of the senders workstations , email servers , or vendors email servers . <p> So it requires a determined attacker with some knowledge of the senders infrastructure and some ingenuity to get past DMARC . <p> Oh wait there is another way they can easily get past DMARC : <p> Even if the senders domain has DMARC , SPF , and DKIM DNS records , if the recipients SPAM filters do not pay attention to DMARC ( or the others ) , then these settings will be " all for nought " and the forged message will still appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of the anti-fraud settings of the sender domain and of the capabilities of the recipients systems . - The weaker the filters the easier the attackers job can be . <h> Ok So What Else Can We Do ? <p> Various standard technologies take better and better stabs at email fraud protection , but none of them are fool proof : SPF and DKIM are implemented inconsistently , and DMARC is not well supported across email filters at this point . - DMARC records are also not published for a majority of domains . - And many that do publish them , e.g. Bank of America at the time of this writing , have " no nothing " records that are designed to just test the waters and gain telemetry on what messages sent by them are would fail DMARC . <p> Beyond using these technologies , to the extent that they are available to you , and being vigilant which is what most people do there are some final techniques that can be used to further the lock down identities of message senders . <p> In our next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see what some of these are .

Use a secure connection <p> When connecting to your email services over the web ( e.g. from Internet explorer , FireFox , Safari , Chrome , etc ) , be sure the connection is secure . - You can tell it is if the address in your browser address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just " http : // " . - You will also see a closed lock there and , even better , the bar may be green . <p> The little " s " means that the connection is secured over SSL the current Internet standard for protecting communications with web sites . See : How does SSL work ? <p> SSL keeps folks from eavesdropping on your email as you read it and from capturing your username and password as your login . <p> 2 . Choose a good , unique password <p> Make sure the password to your email is strong and not easily guessed . - Many malicious folks will try lots of common passwords and dictionary words to get in. make sure yours is not among those . - E.g. do n't  use " Password1 ? use " IL0ve Meye DoG ! ! " ( well do n't  use that one now as its published on the Internet ) . <p> By all means , do not use the same password for multiple sites . - E.g. using the same password for Bank of America and Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place , malicious individuals often see if that password can get into other accounts that you may have . - Do n't  make it that easy for them . <p> Ya , its annoying , but you really need to change your passwords once in awhile . - If a password is stolen and you do n't  even know it this will help prevent that from biting you . Stolen passwords are often not used right away ; they can be sat on for a long time and used later " when no one is looking " . <p> 5 . Steer clear of big free email vendors <p> The big free or cheap email vendors ( e.g. gmail , yahoo , aol , etc. ) are used by so many people that they are huge targets for hackers. - An extremely large amount of of time is spent finding ways ways to extract passwords , user data , and other information about you from these places . - Using them puts you at risk as soon as the next vulnerability is found . <p> Smaller , specialized email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes and adjust to Internet conditions nimbly , and can be a good choice for better privacy and security especially if the company itself has a strong privacy and security focus . <p> 6 . Use excellent email filtering <p> So many threats come in via email blocking them before they can affect your computer or trick you into clicking on some link is vital . - Ensure that the system in use has virus and malicious email scanning and is well configured . If you have options its usually well worth it to get the best filtering package available . - The minor cost of this is insurance against the large cost of a real issue . <p> 7 . Two Factor Authentication <p> If you have to do something besides enter your password to login to your email , then you are probably using two factor authentication. - This could be as simple as entering a code texted to your phone or as complicated as using a fingerprint reader key fob. - Whatever it is , it is better than needing just your password and it protects you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide two factor authentication options today and this is becoming more and more standard . <p> Just be sure you use it . as this is usually just an " option " and not enabled unless you set it up . <p> 8 . Avoid email providers with weak password reset options <p> If it is easy to reset your password , it may be easy to steal your password . - E.g. if a password reset can be easily socially engineered by calling Support , or if it can be requested via visiting the web site without a lot of verification , then your password is at risk and your accounts security is weak . - This has been the cause of a large number of issues in recent times including those affecting Apple computer last year ( e.g. this one and others ) . <p> Choose a company with strict policies on how Support will respond to password reset requests , that allow automated requests to use multiple factors for validating your identity , and which allow you to disable password reset requests or to refer them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the request yourself ( e.g. if you are an organization and not an individual ) . <p> 9 .

So , when a message is- occasionally- delayed , it seems like something must be wrong . - Sometimes there is a problem . - Sometimes the delay is the result of normal email flow . <h> The multi-server delivery path <p> When an email message is sent , it is given to an email server for processing and delivery . - That email server may forward it on to another email server , and so on , until it ultimately arrives in the recipients mail box . <p> Generally messages will pass though at least two email servers ( the senders and the recipients ) . - In some cases , when the sender and recipient are on the same machine and it is setup in a certain way , the email may be delivered on arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rarely happens for general email messages . <p> In most cases , the senders and recipients email systems may each pass the message though multiple servers for various reasons , resulting in the message traversing many servers ( a.k.a " hops " ) in its delivery path . <h> Reliable delivery <p> Email is designed to be extremely reliable messages should always make it to their destinations , if at all possible . <p> Each server in the delivery path that accepts the email message is responsible for ensuring that the message makes it to the next server . - If nothing goes wrong , the hand off can take place very quickly ( in less than a second in many cases ) . - However , many times , things do happen such as : <p> DNS or network issues prevent the server from being able to determine what server is supposed to be next . <p> Communications with the next server are temporarily failing due to network issues or Internet congestion . <p> The server itself is very busy at the moment . <p> The next server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Additional processing of the message needs to take place before it can be relayed to the next server . <p> Each of these things can result in the message being delayed in reaching the next server . <p> If the server itself is busy or needs to perform further actions on a message , it may defer ( or queue ) processing of the message for a short time until it has available capacity. - This often happens if there is a " spike " where many messages are arriving at a server in a short time , pushing its ability to process them all . - In cases like this , servers respond by delaying some messages until they can catch up . <p> If the next server can not be determined or reached or is not accepting email temporarily , then the message must be queued and delivery re-tried later . <h> Queue processing delays <p> When messages are temporarily deferred for later re-try or processing , they are often " queued " . - This means that they are dumped into a special location for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodically and process the messages waiting there to get them going. - However , <p> It is up to the mail server administrators to manage how often the queue is checked and processed . - This interval can be low ( like once/minute ) or slower ( like once every 5-10 minutes , every hour , or worse ) . <p> If the queues are getting full ( e.g. lots and lots of messages are there ) , it may take a long time to process them all . <p> Even if a message is quickly re-tried , it will not be delivered until the next server is available and reachable . <p> Generally , messages are kept in mail queues and retried over and over for up to 5 days ; however , some systems ( such as public providers like AOL , Hotmail , Yahoo , Gmail , bulk mailers , etc. ) may have much shorter grace periods for successful delivery . <h> Size delays : <p> Some other common reasons for apparent delays include : <p> Large Messages : Messages size can affect delivery times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very busy connections . - It may take some time to upload a large message to the server , resulting in an apparent delay . - For example , if you have a 50MB email message to send and a 512 Kbps DSL line , it will take over 13 minutes to upload the message . Additionally , large messages will slow down processing and delivery at every stage in the process . <p> Many Recipients : Messages addressed to large numbers of recipients take much more work to process , resulting in additional apparent delays . <h> " Sender Offline " delays : <p> Often when customers ask about message delays and we look into the cause , it appears that for example the message was sent last night but did not arrive until the next morning . - What has often occurred in these cases is that the sender composed and sent the message when offline Their Internet connection was down , they already unplugged , etc. - The " Date " stamp on the message is when they " sent " it ( and it was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the senders computer until the next day when the sender went back online and opened his/her email program . <p> In this case , the apparent delay is the senders " fault " for not being online when sending . <h> Occasional- delays are n't  uncommon <p> When multiple servers must each process the message , must be able to communicate with each other , and must have the capacity to manage the processing requirements , delays can and do occur . - In fact , the more servers in the path , the more likely a delay is to happen . <p> It is typical to see- occasional- delays of up to 1-3 minutes in email delivery due to random issues like server processing loads and network traffic spiking here and there on the Internet . <p> Delays of tens of minutes to hours are most often the result server maintenance or outage issues , or mail queues not being properly or promptly processed . <h> Where was the delay ? <p> We are commonly asked to look at a message that was received to determine where/why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure this out . <p> The " Date " header is added by the sending email program ( i.e. Outlook ) and may be blatantly- inaccurate , for example if the sender computers clock is off . - Also , the " Date " is added when the message is sent , not when the message leaves the senders " Outbox " . - So , if the sender is offline for some reason , or the message is otherwise sitting in the Outbox , the message may look " delayed " . In this example , - the delay is merely in getting the message off of the senders computer . <p> The " Received " header lines are added by the mail servers that process the message . - One Received header line is added each time a mail server accepts the message for processing . - They are added from the " bottom up " so the last added Received line is at the top and the first is at the bottom . <p> You can detect where the delays happened by looking at these header lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps ( once you correct for differences in time zones ) . <p> In this contrived example , we see that : <p> The message was sent at 8:10:10 pm Eastern Time <p> The message was delayed in the senders Outbox for 7 minutes , 55 seconds , based on the first " Received " line , - It also may just have taken a long time for the message to be uploaded to the server , i.e. if the message was big and the connection slow . <p> For some reason , this mail server delayed the message for about 11 minutes before it made it to the recipients server , where it was accepted and delivered immediately . <p> One could then ask the IT staff running example server " abc.luxsci.com " to look into their logs for information as to why the message was delayed for 11 minutes , if this delay is significant to you .

" - However , you can not trust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . - Fortunately , you do not have to trust it blindly ; DKIM allows you to verify it . - Here is what happens on the recipients side : <p> Receipt : The recipients inbound email server receives the message <p> Get the Signature : The encrypted DKIM fingerprint is detected and extracted- from the message headers <p> Get the Key : The senders purported domain is known ; the recipients server looks in DNS to get the sender domains public DKIM encryption key <p> Decryption : The fingerprint is decrypted using the public key . <p> Fingerprint Check : The recipient then uses the message body and the same headers as the sender to make another fingerprint . - If the fingerprints match then the message has not been altered since it was sent . <p> So , this buys you sender identity verification by : <p> We know that the message was not modified since it was sent so the name and the address of the sender ( among other things ) is the same as it was when it was sent . <p> We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending email for- the senders domain as that server used the DKIM private key for that domain . <p> So , through encryption , we have a way to verify that the message was sent by a server authorized to send email fro the senders domain and thus we have a " solid " reason to believe the senders identity . - Furthermore , this validation does not rely on server IP addresses at all , and thus does not share the weaknesses of SPF . <h> Setting up DKIM <p> With DKIM- ( as with all anti-fraud solutions for email ) , it is up to the owner of a domain ( e.g. the owner of bankofamerica.com ) to setup the DNS settings required for DKIM to be checked by the recipients . - If they do not do this , then there is no way to verify DKIM and any DKIM signatures on messages will be ignored . <p> DKIM- is set up by adding special entries to the published- DNS settings for the domain . - You can use a tool , such as this DKIM Generator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what you should enter in to DNS. - Your email provider may have their own tools that assist with this process as the private key needs to be installed on their mail servers and use of DKIM has to be enabled ; we recommend asking your email provider for assistance . <p> We are not going to spend time on the details of the configuration or setup here ; instead we will look at the actual utility of DKIM- and where it falls on its face and how attackers can get around it . <h> DKIM The Good Parts <p> Once DKIM- has been set up and is used by your sending mail servers , it does an amazing job with anti-fraud. generally much better than SPF. - It also helps ensure that messages have not been modified at all since they were sent so we can be sure of who sent the message and of what they said ; SPF does not provide any kind of assurance that messages were not modified . <p> Use of DKIM- is highly recommended for every domain owner - and for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see next , its not time to throw a party celebrating the end of fraudulent email . <h> DKIM Its Limitations <p> Domain Keys Identified Mail has sone significant limitations in the battle against fraud : <p> It can be hard to identify and set up all authorized servers <p> For proper use of DKIM , all servers that send email for your domain must be able to use DKIM and have keys for your domain . - This can be difficult if you have vendors or partners that send email - for you using your domain or if you otherwise can not be sure that all messages sent will be signed .. - In such cases , if you can not get them to use DKIM , you should have them send email for you using a different domain or a subdomain , so that your main domain can be fully DKIM-enabled and its DNS can tell everyone that DKIM signatures must be present on all messages . - E.g. you want to be " strict " with DKIM usage in a way that is hard to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then DKIM allows you to be soft indicating that signatures may or may not be present . - In such cases ( like with SPF ) , the absence of a DKIM signature does not make a message invalid ; the presence of a valid signature just makes the message certainly valid . - If your DKIM setup is " soft " , - forgery is simple . <p> Inter-domain Forgery <p> DKIM- checks only the domain name and the server . <p> If there are two different people in the same organization , Fred@domain.com and Jane@domain.com either of them can send email legitimately from their @domain.com address using the servers they are authorized to use for domain.com email . <p> However , if Fred@domain.com uses his account to send a message forged to be from Jane@domain.com DKIM- will check out as " OK " even if DKIM- is set as strict . <p> DKIM- does not protect against inter-domain forgery at all . <p> Note : using separate DKIM selectors and keys for each unique sender would resolve this problem ( and the next one ) ; but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servers- Forgery ? <p> This is a generalization to inter-domain forgery . - If Fred@badguy.com and Jane@goodguy.com were using the same email service provider and the same servers , Janes goodguy.com domain is setup with DKIM , and the email providers servers are also setup to sign messages from @goodguy.com with appropriate DKIM signatures , what happens when Feed@badguy.com logs in to his account and sends a message pretending to be from Jane ? <p> The answer depends on the email provider ! <p> The provider could prevent Fred from sending email purporting to be from anyone except- himself . - This would solve the problem right away but is very restrictive and many providers do not do this . <p> The provider could associate DKIM keys to specific users or accounts ( this is what LuxSci does ) so Freds messages would never be signed by valid the " goodguy.com " DKIM keys , no matter what . - This also solves the problem . <p> However , if the providers servers are not restrictive in one of these ( or a similar way ) , then Freds forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look DKIM-valid . <p> Legitimate Message Modification <p> DKIM is very sensitive to message modification ; DKIM signature checks will come back " invalid " if even 1 character has been changed . - This is generally good , but it is possible that some filtering systems read and " re-write " messages in transit where the " real " message content is unchanged but certain ( MIME ) " metadata " is replaced with new data ( e.g. the unique strings that separate message parts ) . - This breaks DKIM and it can happen more frequently that you might expect . <p> Good spam filters check DKIM before modifying messages ; but if you have multiple filtering systems scanning messages , then the DKIM checks of later filters may be broken by the actions of earlier filters . <p> DKIM does not really protect against Spam <p> This is not a limitation of DKIM , but worth noting anyway . - All DKIM- does is help you identify if a message is forged or not ( and if it has been altered or not ) . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain names and create valid DKIM- ( and DPF- and DMARC ) records so that their email messages look more legitimate . <p> In truth this does not make them look less spammy ; it just says that the messages are not forged . <p> Of course , if the spammer is trying to get by your filters by forging the sender address so that the sender is " you " or someone you know , then DKIM- can absolutely help . <h> How Attackers Subvert- DKIM <p> So , in the war of escalation where an attacker is trying to get a forged email message into your INBOX , what tricks do they use to get around sender identity validation by DKIM ?

This is especially important for customers who need to be HIPAA compliant , as email transport encryption over TLS is sufficient for HIPAA compliant communications to end users , so long as the TLS is configured to be sufficiently strong . <p> While it is possible to tell who supports TLS , its is somewhat technical to do yourself . So , we have assembled a table with many of the popular free / public email domains in use across the Internet and indicate which currently ( as of January 14th , 2015 ) support SMTP TLS for inbound email . <p> The results are surprising . A majority of domains these days do support TLS , and with Microsofts recent TLS implementation on its email domains ( **32;934;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inbound deliveryoutbound may or may not be supported ) for all of the most popular free email providers ( e.g. aol.com , gmail.com yahoo.com , hotmail.com ) . One thing to be wary of just because they support TLS inbound does not ensure that TLS encryption will sometimes or always be used when messages are delivered to them . Use of TLS also depends on the sending servers both supporting it and actively choosing to use it . A company like LuxSci will do this automatically when it is available ( opportunistic TLS ) and can enforce use of TLS ( e.g. will never send without it to domains that support it ) to ensure compliance . <p> You can also use this table to estimate how many folks in your mailing lists are at free providers who support or do not support TLS . You can also use LuxScis TLS Checker tool to check TLS support for any domain that you like . The following tables were last updated 9/11/2015 . <p> These lists are not absolute guarantees of TLS support as it could be turned off or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be absolutely sure whether a domain offers TLS support for inbound and outbound email transmissions , please check with the company providing or hosting the domains email services . <p> Note that our tests below check not just for TLS/SSL " support " but check that the inbound servers for these domains support TLS v1.0+ and NIST-recommended ciphers , allowing solid levels of TLS encryption . <p> As evidenced below , the email address provided by your ISP company with your residential or business internet/cable TV/phone services , is generally not configured to support TLS . <p> Internet Service Provider Company Domain <p> Supports Inbound TLS ? <p> comcast.net <p> YES <p> cox.net <p> no <p> earthlink.net <p> no <p> mindspring.com <p> no <p> rogers.blackberry.net <p> no <p> rr.com <p> no <p> sbcglobal.net <p> YES <p> sprint.blackberry.net <p> no <p> verizon.net <p> YES <h> TLS Support for email addresses in custom personal/business domains <p> What about custom personal or business domains at popular hosting companies like GoDaddy etc. ? This is the natural next question to ask , because the above lists only cover email addresses in domains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . But what about TLS support for " mypersonaldomain.com " or " **25;968;TOOLONG " ? That depends upon the email infrastructure of the hosting company managing email services for that custom domain . <p> We have observed TLS support for personal/business domains hosted at various popular hosting companies as listed below . This is by no means a guarantee as it is solely based on the fact that at some point in the past , a message was transmitted from LuxSci to the hosting companys mail servers using TLS . To be absolutely sure , however , please check with the hosting provider company themselves . <h> One Response to " Who does not support SMTP TLS for Secure Inbound Email Delivery ?

Why ? <p> Compliance / Emergencies : Customers with compliance needs , such as HIPAA , need to have emergency access to data and that can mean appealing to LuxSci to access data to which the customer has otherwise lost access . - Having the keys in this case , is very important . <p> Privacy : On the other end of the spectrum , some customers want to do as much as possible to ensure that no one , not even LuxSci staff , can access their email data . <p> Both considerations are extremely valid in their own context . - The answer is that " it depends " . - For security and flexibility , LuxSci presents customers a variety of email encryption options that span the complete range from " completely unencrypted " to " LuxSci has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer to choose where in that spectrum they fall often balancing ease of use with security needs . <p> In the following sections , we will consider to what degree LuxSci can assist customers in accessing email ( and WebAides ) data , based on what encryption options the customer has chosen . - We also discuss where and how your trust of LuxSci comes into play . Understanding if and when LuxSci can access encrypted data is different from understanding- when messages are encrypted at rest. - <h> Accessing Encrypted WebAides Data <p> LuxScis WebAides provide collaboration functionality and include such things as shared files , calendars , contacts , and more . - The " File " , " Internal Blog " and " Password Library " WebAides allow encryption of the individual entries . - The content of other WebAides , e.g. calendars , - is stored in a secured database , but is not specifically encrypted . <p> If you choose to encrypt your WebAide entries ( Password WebAide entries are always encrypted ) , then a PGP certificate is used . - Separate certificates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own personal PGP certificates , if they have them , or allow LuxSci to generate these for them . - LuxSci holds the public and private keys for these PGP certificates ; the customer hold the passwords needed to use the secret keys to open the entries . <p> In order to save new entries or open existing encrypted entries , the customer must enter their personal PGP passwords. - These can be temporarily cached in secure cookies in the customers web browser , but they are not saved on LuxScis servers . - The exception is if the customer explicitly requests that the passwords to their personal PGP keys be securely saved in LuxScis system so that these passwords can be recovered in case of loss . <p> We call this " Escrowing " the password ; such passwords are encrypted with a special encryption key that only senior LuxSci staff can unlock . <p> So , what does this mean ? <p> Escrowed Passwords : If you Escrow your PGP password with LuxSci , then we can technically unlock your encrypted WebAides entries ; we can recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can thus ensure access to encrypted data in case of emergency or loss . <p> Not Escrowed : If you do not choose to have LuxSci save a copy of your password , then LuxSci staff can not unlock any of your data . - If you lose your PGP password , then your data is forever lost . <p> Trust : As the WebAides encryption and decryption is performed on LuxScis servers , there is always a level of trust that ( a ) our system is not compromised , and ( b ) we are not capturing passwords " anyway " . - There is no way to be 100% assured that LuxSci can not ever access your encrypted WebAides data . - This implicit trust is true of almost all online encryption services . <h> Regular Email Data <p> Regular email data is stored in email folders on the server in an unencrypted format . - LuxSci has full access to these raw email messages . - This applies to email for all users who do not have LuxScis SecureLine email encryption service . <h> Email Messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission of email messages between email servers . - Messages transmitted using TLS are unencrypted once they arrive and before they are sent . - So , unless some additional layer of encryption is used in addition to TLS ( e.g. , one of those described below ) these messages are the same as " Regular Email Data " when stored on the server . <h> Email Messages Sent using SecureLine Escrow <p> SecureLine Escrow is a simple way to send a secure email message to anyone with an email address . - The messages are encrypted and stored in a secure database . - The recipient clicks through from a notification email to our secure web portal to access the message which is decrypted and presented to recipient . <p> SecureLine Escrow has two distinct modes of operation : <p> Standard <p> In the standard mode , the decryption password for every message is included only in the notification email sent to the recipient . - Without the recipients notification email message , no one can decrypt these saved secure messages . - If the recipients notification message is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forever inaccessible . <p> Trust : There is a level of trust involved here that LuxSci is indeed not saving these per-message encryption passwords anywhere . <p> Message Center <p> Customers with Private Labeling can enable a feature called " Message Center " which allows the Escrow message pickup portal to act like an online secure email " INBOX " each recipient can easily access all of his/her received secure messages once logged in. - This is great for usability and convenience . - However , when Message Center is enabled , LuxSci can technically access and recover the content of the saved encrypted messages . <p> Message Center is in this way more user friendly and less secure than the standard mode of Escrow. - However , it also provides for a level of data recovery and emergency access not possible using the standard mode . <h> Email Message sent using PGP or S/MIME <p> SecureLine also supports public key email encryption using PGP and S/MIME. - In these cases , the messages are always encrypted and are unlocked by the recipient upon entering the password to his/her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches to this , with varying levels of security : <p> Auto-Decrypt <p> Customers who save their PGP or S/MIME certificate and password with LuxSci can choose to have their received messages auto-decrypted and turned into normal email messages . - These messages are then stored unencrypted in LuxSci and are very easily accessed from any email program and WebMail . <p> Clearly , these messages are accessible by LuxSci just like " normal email " . <p> PGP and S/MIME with Password Escrow <p> Customers who do not auto-decrypt messages may still have their PGP or S/MIME passwords Escrowed with LuxSci so that we can recover them if lost . - In these cases , LuxSci technically has access to your keys and passwords and can thus recover or access encrypted message data saved on LuxScis servers . <p> No Password Escrow <p> Using PGP or S/MIME with your certificates saved in LuxSci but without your passwords saved , allows you to use LuxSci WebMail to send and open secure messages - you simply need to enter the password to your PGP and/or S/MIME certificate as needed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by or recovered by LuxSci ( as we have the certificate key , but not the password ) and if you lose your password , then all encrypted messages are forever inaccessible . <p> Trust : This involves a level of trust that LuxSci is not capturing your passwords when you enter them in WebMail for temporary use . <p> PGP and S/MIME only from your Email Program <p> In this last scenario , your PGP or S/MIME certificates are stored only in your email program and NOT on LuxSci. - All encryption and decryption takes place on your computer and not on LuxScis servers . - As a result , LuxSci does n't  have your keys and never sees your passwords and thus LuxSci can never access your encrypted email data and no trust is required . - You just need to setup your email clients to use S/MIME ( for example ) and start sending . <p> The downside of this scenario is that you can only easily communicate with others using S/MIME ( for example ) and you have to get their keys from them and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible to ensuring that you do not lose your passwords. - For more information , see The Case for Email Security . <p> This is by far the most secure thing you can do , but the least user friendly and most cumbersome . <h> What is usually done ? <p> Customers with LuxSci SecureLine are configured for maximum usability to : <p> Use SMTP TLS whenever possible , <p> If SMTP TLS is not possible , then Standard Mode Escrow is used for secure messages . <p> Customers wishing to enhance security can : <p> Disable SMTP TLS or restrict its use for particular recipients or recipient domains . <p> Sent email messages are usually saved to your sent email folder by appending the message using IMAP without any special encryption. -

Encoded Email Message Size What 's the Difference ? <p> Published : January 21st , 2009 <p> We are often asked about why our email message size limits are based on the " encoded message size " and not the " raw message size " . - - To answer this question , let 's first understand what the difference is between these two concepts . <h> Raw Message Size <p> An email message is generally composed of : <p> The message content <p> Some file attachments <p> " Metadata " who its going to , who its from , what the subject is , etc . <p> The raw message size is the sum of the file sizes of all of the attachments , plus the size of your message content . <p> Consider a paragraph of about 150 words with 2 attached files that are each 1 megabyte ( MB ) in size. - The " raw size " would be 2 MB plus the size needed for the 150 words ( which is probably around 0.001- MB ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the size of the resulting email message with all of the attachments added and encoded using MIME. - This encoded size is the actual size of the message as it travels over the Internet and is always larger than the raw size because of the MIME overhead and because binary attachments are generally encoded using base64 encoding. - Base64-encoded files are usually about 137%- the size of the original files. - In the example above , the encoded message would probably be in the neighborhood of 2.6MB in size . <p> Additionally , the encoded message contains all of the metadata about the message and this information grows as the message travels from the sender to the recipient . <p> Why ? Because each email server adds information to the metadata ( the header of the message ) that indicates what servers were passed through and documents anything that the server did to the message ( such as scanning it for viruses or spam ) . <h> So , what encoded size can you expect your messages to be ? <p> So , overall , you can expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the size of the original files. - The size of small encoded messages relative to their raw counterparts can vary widely but will fall far short of any realistic size limits . <h> Then why do servers limit messages based on encoded size ? <p> The encoded size is the size that email servers see when transporting email messages across the Internet , so this is the natural size for the server to place limits on. - For the server to place limits on the " raw size " instead , the email servers would first have to accept and decode every large message they come across ( or at least ones within a certain size range ) to determine if the raw size is acceptable . While a limit on raw sizes may be conceptually easier for the end user , it is so much processing for email servers that it is not worth the small gain in usability by using a raw limit. - In fact , its easier to just make the encoded limit larger so that larger raw messages can make it through ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 200MB on its servers because folks are sending larger and larger messages these days. - LuxScis WebMail system limits the size of sent messages to 70MB raw size. - It uses the raw size because when you are sending messages , WebMail actually knows the raw size already , so this is conceptually easier for the user. - The limit is well below 100MB so that once these messages are encoded , they will still have an encoded size of less than 100MB , the encoded-message limit across LuxScis systems . <p> message size that can be sent from these portals has been raised from 20 Megabytes to 50 Megabytes ( raw size ) and the maximum number of attachments on one of these secure messages has been raised from 3 to 20

TLS is one of the standard ways that computers on the Internet transmit information over an encrypted channel . In general , when one computer connects to another computer and uses TLS , the following happens : <p> Computer A connects to Computer B ( no security ) <p> Computer B says " Hello " ( no security ) <p> Computer A says " Let 's talk securely over TLS " ( no security ) <p> Computer A and B agree on how to do this ( secure ) <p> The rest of the conversation is encrypted ( secure ) <p> In particular : <p> The meat of the conversation is encrypted <p> Computer A can verify the identity of Computer B ( by examining its SSL certificate , which is required for this dialog ) <p> Other information can not be injected into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is used for many different reasons on the Internet and helps make the Internet a more secure place , when used . One of the popular uses of TLS is with SMTP- for transmitting email messages between servers in a secure manner. - See also : <h> TLS with SMTP <p> The mechanism and language ( i.e. protocol ) by which one email server transmits email message(s) to another email server is called SMTP ( Simple Mail Transport Protocol ) . For a long time now , email servers have had the option of using TLS to transparently encrypt the message transmission from one server to the other . <p> Use of TLS with SMTP , when available , ensures that the message contents are secured during transmission between the servers . <p> Not all servers support TLS ! <p> Use of TLS requires that the server administrators : <p> purchase of one or more SSL certificates <p> configure the email servers to use them ( and keep these configurations updated ) <p> For these reasons , many email providers , especially free or public ones , have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few years , however , the trend has been to add TLS everywhere .

It does nothing for protecting the security of the message before it is sent or after it arrives at its destination . - For that , other encryption mechanisms may be used , such as PGP , S/MIME , or storage in a secure portal . <p> However , transmission security is all that is required of many organizations ( i.e. banks and HIPAA/health care ) when sending to customers .

Or , you and your recipients can go the extra mile and setup PGP or S/MIME for use . <p> Aggressively . - In some compliance situations like HIPAA , it can be argued that it is up to the sender to send messages securely if needed . - E.g. while doctors need to be sure that ePHI is sent securely to patients ; patients themselves are not beholden to HIPAA and can send their information insecurely to anyone they want . - So , if the patients reply is insecure " that could be Ok " . - If the recipeint is another organization that falls under the HIPAA umbrella , then it is up to them to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - For these reasons , and because use of TLS for email security is so " easy " , many just do not worry about the security of the email replies . <p> However , this should be a " Rick Factor " that you consider in any internal security audit . - Is the risk of insecure replies worth the possible data exposure in your organizations practices . <h> What about TLS at LuxSci ? <p> Inbound TLS <p> LuxSci inbound email servers support TLS for encrypted inbound email delivery from any sending email provider that also supports that . <p> For selected organizations , e.g. Bank of America , LuxSci also locks down its servers so that it only accepts email from them if its is delivered over TLS . <p> Outbound Opportunistic TLS . <p> LuxSci outbound email servers will always use TLS with any server that claims to support it- and with whom we can talk TLS v1.0+ using a strong cipher. - If the TLS connection to such a server server fails ( due to misconfiguration or no security protocols in common ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TLS encryption is automatic for all LuxSci customers , even those without SecureLine . <p> Support strong encryption , up to AES 256 and better <p> LuxSci servers will use the strongest encryption supported by the recipients email server that is also considered strong . LuxSci servers will never employ an encryption cipher that uses less than 128 bits ( they will failed to deliver rather than deliver via an excessively weak encryption cipher ) and they will never use SSL v2 or SSL v3 . <p> Forced TLS <p> LuxSci servers use " Forced TLS " with recipient servers that support TLS if email is being sent to those servers from any SecureLine account using TLS-Only delivery services ( outbound email or forwarding ) . This ensures that messages will never be delivered to such servers , even in the case that they stop supporting TLS suddenly . <p> Forced TLS is also in place for all LuxSci customers sending to certain Banks- and organizations that have requested that we globally enforce TLS to their servers . <h> Does LuxSci have any other Special TLS Features ? <p> Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " try TLS first " and deliver that way. - Only if TLS is not available would the messages fall back and use more secure options like PGP , S/MIME , or Escrow. - This makes email security easy , seamless , and automatic when communicating internally or with others who support TLS . <p> TLS Only Forwarding : Account administrators can restrict any server side email forwarding settings in their accounts from allowing forwarding to any email addresses which do not support TLS for email delivery . <p> When TLS delivery is enabled for SecureLine accounts , messages will never be insecurely sent to domains that purport to be TLS-enabled . I.e. TLS delivery is enforced and no longer " opportunistic " . - The system monitors these domains and updates their TLS-compliance status daily . <p> Double Encryption : Messages sent using SecureLine and PGP or S/MIME will still use Opportunistic TLS whenever possible for message delivery . - In these cases , messages are often " double encrypted " . - Encrypted first with PGP or S/MIME , and then that secure message may be encrypted again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike many organizations , LuxScis TLS support for SMTP and other servers only supports those protocol levels ( e.g. TLS v1.0+ ) and ciphers that are recommended by NIST for government communications and which are required for HIPAA. - So , all communications with LuxSci servers will be over a compliant implementation of TLS . <p> For customers whose security or compliance needs allow TLS to be a sufficient form of email encryption , it enables seamless security and " use of email as usual " security . - SecureLine with Forced TLS enables clients to take advantage of this level of security whenever possible , while automatically falling back to other methods when TLS is not available . <p> Of course , use of Forced TLS as the sole method of encryption is optional ; if your compliance needs are stronger , you can disable TLS-Only delivery or restrict it so tat it is used only with specific recipients . <p> email capturing , etc. ) can only be forwarded only to recipients whose email servers support TLS for SMTP transport encryption .

" doctor@secure.doctor.com " and " doctor@doctor.com " for the secure , and regular email , respectively . <p> The first method , separate users , is not really applicable for mutual consent . - This is because messages sent through the regular email user are not considered HIPAA-compliant and should never contain ePHI. - You might not have email archival on your insecure users , and there would be no special log indicating that a particular message was chosen to be sent insecurely . <p> The second option , explicit opt out , is recommended because : <p> The message is sent by a HIPAA-compliant user <p> The message will be archived if you have archival for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis if it can be sent insecurely <p> The fact that it is sent insecurely is logged along with the sender , recipient , subject , etc. - This log is kept indefinitely . <p> Then message is treated like every other ePHI-laden email , just unencrypted . <p> It is desirable to opt out for each insecure email that may contain ePHI , just like it is desirable to opt out of sending securely for messages that do not contain ePHI as this simple requirement of choice on the senders part greatly helps prevent <p> When using HIPAA encryption opt out at LuxSci , the system is essentially asking you to confirm that the message in question does not contain ePHI at all . - This is appropriate when using it to differentiatePHI-laden vs normal email . - When using it for mutual consent unencrypted email , you follow the same procedure so that as far as the system is concerned , it does not contain ePHI that must be encrypted.

While the divide between each era is certainly blurry , those born after the mid 90s tend to have different attitudes to life and the workplace compared to those who came before them . <p> Understanding Generation Z , their habits and their values is crucial for any business that wants to fully embrace the next wave of talent . Its important to remember that their different views and practices will also have a range of security ramification . From their desire to constantly stay connected down to their privacy attitudes , the way that the new generation functions means that companies need to adapt in order to stay secure . <h> Who Are Generation Z ? <p> One of the defining factors of Generation Z is that they have been using the internet from a very young age . Sure , most Millenials grew up with it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now . The age of dial-up internet and AOL is completely different to the ever-present world of smartphones and social media . <p> Generation Z are generally the children of Generation X , and were born somewhere between 1995-2014 , depending on who you ask . They embrace social media and being connected , but in a different way to Millenials . In some ways , they are more aware of privacy issues , preferring less-public apps such as Snapchat over Facebook , and they are generally more aware of their privacy settings . Despite this , there are still a range of security concerns that come along with Generation Z entering the workplace . <h> BYOD Is Unavoidable <p> The bring your own device trend certainly is n't anything new , but Generation Zs approach will have an impact on how BYOD policies are managed . Many businesses regard BYOD policies as essential in the modern workplace , because employees tend to be more efficient with their own devices . <p> Gen Z are so accustomed to their devices that BYOD practices are even less negotiable than for older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a role in the workplace and they need to come up with effective policies to securely manage them securely . <p> It is important to follow best practices to ensure that employee devices are as secure as possible . A positive step is to embrace the security services of companies such as Duo . Duos Trusted Devices gives an organization greater insight into the devices that are using a their network , allowing them to block untrusted devices from accessing their apps and enabling them to enforce strong access point policies . <h> Give Them the Apps They Want <p> Alongside their phones , Generation Z want to bring their apps into the workplace as well . They are accustomed to the features and sharing capacity of the latest offerings from the App Store and Google Play , but many of these lack the security features or control that are necessary for them to be effectively managed in the workplace . <p> If you want your employees to use specific apps for your business instead of the ones that they prefer , you need to entice them with relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group chats that allow sharing . Offering secure chat and email with these features is important if you want them to switch over . <p> If your business apps fail to provide the features that your employees demand , you will likely find that they use their preferred apps in secret , meaning that your organization will have no control over what your employees are doing . This presents huge security risks to your data . Because of this , it is important that you incentivize them to use approved and secure applications instead . <h> Use LuxScis MobileSync to Boost Security and Help with Compliance <p> With Generation Z preferring to use smartphones over desktops , businesses need to make sure that they are putting as much effort into securing them as they do for traditional IT infrastructure . At LuxSci , we offer our own MobileSync service , which provides users with fast and secure email synchronization from their LuxSci account to just about any device . It is secured with TLS and is also HIPAA compliant . <p> MobileSync gives users 2-way push email as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as calendars , tasks , notes and contacts . Whenever there is new information , be it an email or a change to the calendar , MobileSync immediately recognizes it and synchronizes itself . <p> One of the most important security features that comes with MobileSync is the Remote Wipe capability . If your phone is stolen or lost , you can use it to erase all of the data that was on your device . This prevents it from falling into the wrong hands and exposing a businesss secrets . <h> Are Your Employees Using Secure Connections ? <p> Generation Z is incredibly mobile and ready to work from anywhere . Whether it is the comfort of their home , a coffee shop down the road or Bangkok airport , their integration with technology allows them to get things done from anywhere with Wi-Fi or a data connection . <p> While this is great from a productivity standpoint , it brings in additional risks . If they are working from anywhere , how do you know that they are using a secure access point ? How do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company data ? <p> These risks can be reduced with technologies such as VPN , or by restricting network access in certain situations . If an employee accesses your network from a connection that is n't trusted , you can restrict their privileges and abilities to access certain parts of the network . This enables them to work on the go without resulting in significant security compromises . <h> Your Organization Needs a Clear Social Media Policy <p> As a generation that is glued to its phones and addicted to selfies , Generation Zs arrival in the workplace should give companies the impetus to form a well-rounded social media policy . This is important both for legal and security reasons . <p> There are both personal and professional grounds for using social media in the workplace , which make complete bans difficult to enforce . Unfortunately , social media use brings many risks , but these can be limited by effective policies . <p> Some of these risks include employees broadcasting negative opinions about the workplace , or even distributing offensive material . This can cause huge legal headaches for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to attacks and fraud , which can have significant negative effects as well . <p> A good social media policy can help to reduce issues . At a minimum , it should have rules for what content is deemed acceptable and what will be done if this is breached . It should also focus on employee education to limit the chance of something negative happening . The policy should also delegate who is responsible to speak on behalf of the company to make sure that external communications can be handled effectively . <p> Businesses can also engage in social media monitoring to stay clued-in to what is happening with their brand , both internally and externally . Social media monitoring services are for more than just marketing " they can be used to ensure that your employees are n't  breaching your social media policy as well . <h> Texting Is Bad for Your Security and Even Worse for HIPAA Compliance <p> Generation Z communicate with their phones in a variety of different ways " videos , picture messages , audio recordings , the odd phone call and by text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , they pose significant security risks when they are used . <p> This is because there is no guarantee that the messages are encrypted in transit , and the messages can also be saved long term , meaning that they are vulnerable for extensive periods of time . SMS messages can also be read by unauthorized individuals . This can be done by accessing the individuals phone , or by intercepting the message during transit . <p> Because of this , text messages are strictly controlled under HIPAA . It is illegal to use them to send health information unless a consent form has been filed . Using them otherwise can result in hefty fines . <p> Other messaging services such as Apples iMessage are not compliant by themselves . If an organization wants to use iMessage , it needs a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement with Apple to send health information over their services . <p> LuxSci offer our SecureText and SecureChat services to give businesses HIPAA compliant means of communicating . They both use 256-bit AES encryption over TLS , making them excellent for secure and effective communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the Workplace <p> With Baby Boomers on their way out and into retirement , Generation Z will be picking up the slack . Businesses do n't  have the option to simply ignore their needs and habits " soon they will make up far too much of the workforce . <p> To take advantage of their skills and minimize the associated risks , organizations need to be willing to adapt to Generation Z. This includes recognizing their desire to constantly stay connected and providing them secure means to do so . It is best to develop policies that embrace these changes rather than banning them . <p> Excluding apps that work for Generation Z will only result in them being used without permission . This puts security out of a companys control . It is much better to listen to what this generation needs and work with them , rather than enforce outdated policies that do n't  match the technology or their needs . Having a thorough understanding of Generation Z will soon be crucial to a businesss success .

Account Firewalls- protecting access to specific accounts , domains , and users from traffic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may further limit access to services based on account security policies , service licenses , etc . <h> Introducing Account Firewalls <p> Every LuxSci customer can now control access to the services provided by their accounts , independent of the access controls of all other accounts . <p> Specify rules at the user , domain , and account levels <p> For ultimate flexibility , firewall rules can be created to apply to : <p> Only a specific user , <p> All users in a domain , or <p> All users in an account <p> The user-level rules take precedence over the domain-wide rules , which take precedence over the account-wide rules . <p> Allow and Deny usage by IP and CIDR block : <p> You can configure allow and deny rules for specific IP addresses and for ranges of IP addresses designated by CIDR blocks ( e.g. 1.2.3.4/24 is a range of 256 IP addresses ) . <p> " Allow " rules will take priority over " Deny " rules , but you can create " Deny All " rules that will effectively deny all access except from certain explicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Control access for all services or by selected services . - Services that you can control access to include : <p> LuxScis Web Interface ( e.g. WebMail ) <p> Secure POP , Insecure POP <p> Secure IMAP , Insecure IMAP <p> Secure SMTP , Insecure SMTP <p> Secure FTP , Insecure FTP <p> Using these rules , you could , for example , block access to insecure POP , IMAP , and SMTP completely and allow access to the secure versions of these protocols from only specific IP ranges . <h> Grant Access to Other Services Via Web Interface Authentication <p> Let 's say that you have restricted access to everything so that only your office IP addresses can login to your account . - How does this help your remote or roaming users ? You cant know what IP address they will be coming from ahead of time , and you do n't  want to have to manually allow them and change your firewall all of the time . <p> The solution ? Use the optional " Web Interface Login Grants Access " feature of the firewall. - With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Web Interface to have his/her current IP addresses added to his/her personal firewall , allowing access to all services from that IP. - You can configure how long this temporary " allow list " access remains ( from 1 day to 90 days ) . <p> If you enable two-factor authentication for the Web Interface logins , restrict WebMail access by Country or Region , use OpenID , or use our good password guessing restrictions for WebMail , then this truly and effectively blocks password guessing on your user accounts and provides a very solid layer of user access security . <h> Login Failure Alerts <p> LuxSci provides emailed login failure ( and success ) alerts to customers so that they can be informed quickly if someone is trying to gain access to their accounts . - While logins that are blocked by your custom user , domain , or account firewall rules will still be logged as login failures in your audit trails , these block logins will not be emailed to you in your alerts . <p> Why ? Because if they are blocked by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or guess your password so pushing notices of these failures to you would be just annoying . - Instead , if you see people scanning your account , you can go and explicitly block their IPs to both ( a ) stop their guessing attacks , and ( b ) stop yourself from getting further alerts about them . <p> Note that LuxSci does place automatic blocks on IPs that are apparently performing password guessing attacks on our servers . - However , it is always possible to guess slowly enough to fall " under the radar " of automated systems . - Account Firewalls allow you to manage these attacks yourself when you are alerted to them and decide that they are malicious and not just inadvertent. 
@@22227310 @2227310/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> We at LuxSci are always being asked questions about various email programs and their usage. - With HIPAA compliance becoming more and more important , we get a lot of inquiries regarding secure email . One of the most frequently asked questions is how to install S/MIME security certificates in various email programs that our servers support . Sometimes finding instructions on installing security certificates in various email clients is difficult , even with the help of search engines . To make your search easier , we have complied instructions for several of the the major email clients : <p> S/MIME for Outlook 2003 <p> S/MIME for Outlook 2007 <p> S/MIME for Mail.app <p> S/MIME for Entourage <p> S/MIME for Thunderbird <p> PGP for Thunderbird via the Enigmail Add-on . <p> These instructions have been put together by our Support staff and assume that you are using S/MIME certificates . S/MIME is natively supported by most major email clients . We also include instructions for setting up PGP with Thunderbird , as its Enigmail add-on makes PGP use simple . We hope that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an S/MIME certificate issued by a 3rd party provider , like LuxScis SecureLine Email Encryption Service , you may need to also import the " Certificate Authority " certificate for that provider , so that your email program recognizes it as a valid provider. - We include instructions for importing Certificate Authority certificates as well . If you get your S/MIME certificate from a very widely used 3rd party , like Thawte Personal Email Certificates , you may not need to import the Certificate Authority certificate , as it will be built into your computer . <h> S/MIME in Microsoft Outlook 2003 <p> Installing your personal S/MIME certificate in Outlook 2003 . <p> When using Outlook you will need to export your certificates with a . pfx extension this is the kind of file that generally contains both the public and private S/MIME key ; it is password-protected . <p> Go to " Tools " &gt; " Options " <p> Select " Security " at the top of the window . <p> Now select " Import/Export " under " Digital IDs ( Certificates ) " at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then press " Open " <p> In the " Password " field type in the certificates password .

How to Dig Yourself Out <p> How much is your time worth ? - What could you do with a hundred or more extra hours per year ? - Imagine 3 more full work weeks added to each year for every employee in your organization ! <p> Email is an amazing and essential part of our lives and businesses . - However , for many people , it can become a very large time sink . Emails popping in every few minutes , distractions breaking our focus , huge libraries of old messages to review and dig though , the email stream just keeps coming , and we just keep reacting to it day after day , even on vacation . - This all goes to the detriment of getting real work done . <p> In this article , I discuss a number of items that can easily give you back 30 minutes or more each day of productive time . - Thats 2+ hours per week or 100+ hours per year . - The more serious your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be had . <p> Email overflow can be a problem , but used wisely , you can take control and make email work for you . <h> - 1 . Employ an Excellent Spam Filter <p> The fewer email messages that you receive , the less time you spend reading email and the fewer interruptions break your focused work . - Invest in a really good spam filter one that eliminates most spam messages and has few false positives ( marking messages as spam that are not really spam ) . - The time savings far offsets the cost . <p> Here are a few additional recommendations when configuring your spam filter <p> White list the Internet IP addresses of the servers that your company uses to send email ( SMTP and WebMail ) . - This prevents inter-company email from ever being treated as Spam <p> Do not white list your company domain name on the surface , the would also make inter-company email be treated as not spam ( and it does ) , but it opens the door to lots of real spam as spammers often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your domain , and white listing that domain just let 's them all right in . <p> Have the Spam messages saved to a separate location do n't  just " tag " it as spam and have it delivered to your INBOX , as that does nothing to help with the time sink and- aggravation- involved . <h> 2 . Do n't  Stare at your INBOX <p> Unless it is your job to monitor an email INBOX for updates and alerts in real time , do n't  stare at your INBOX or check your email every time that your email program alerts you of a new message . <p> Every time you check your email , your brain has to do a context switch from whatever you were working on , to pay attention to email . - When you are done , you have to context switch back . - No matter how much you think you can " multitask " , studies have shown that this kind of context switching significantly slows us down on all things that we are working on . - The longer you can focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get done and in less time . <p> Some alternatives : <p> Turn off your email when you need to focus on something important , or <p> Have your emil program check your email much less frequently , e.g. every 15 minutes instead of every minute . - At least in this case , you can have 15 minutes to work and then a few minutes to see what happened - less context switching more efficient . <p> Do n't  feel like you have to read every message that comes in when it comes in. - If you are not in charge of a critical email box , then things can wait a few minutes or more . - If something is really important , you are probably likely to get called or texted or notified by some other means . <p> Oh do n't  forget , do n't  have your phone set to beep at you every time a new email arrives either ! <h> 3 . Keep Email Subjects as Descriptive as Possible <p> Institute a policy amongst your coworkers where by every email has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find messages in your email folders and to tell at a glance what a message is about . - As a result , you save time by not needing to search as much and by not needing to read through messages to see what they are really about . - This kind of time savings really adds up . <h> 4 . Change Email Subjects when the Content of the Message Changes <p> Does this sound familiar ? <p> You and a coworker are writing back and forth via email . <p> You keep responding by replying to each others email messages <p> The content of these messages slowly changes over time going from a discussion about a meeting to a discussion about a coworker to a discussion about plans for the weekend <p> The " Subject " of all of these messages is the same the original subject of the original email . <p> Now , you need to go back and find something later and you have 10 or more messages all with the same subject . you have to search or read through these to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a policy whereby when the content of the email messages , you always change the subject of the message to match . - It may take a little getting used to , but it will make email much more efficient , both while you are having the conversation and later when you need to look back and these messages to find something . <h> 5 . Keep your INBOX Small <p> This one is like pulling teeth for some people . - Try to keep your email INBOX as small as possible . - Ideally , keep only the most important 10-20 email messages in there , those relating to things that you need to work on today or in the immediate future . <p> Why ? <p> The larger your INBOX is the more time you spend reading and re-reading the list of messages if they are just sitting there taking up space , why keep re-reading ? - If you are not even bothering to review them , why leave them there ? <p> A small inbox has a distinctly positive psychological impact . - Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a clean Inbox , you can feel like things are getting done . - With an ever growing Inbox , you may feel like you have an impossible task ahead of you managing all these messages . - That task never goes away . <h> How do I keep my Inbox Small ? <p> Here are several tips and tricks for managing your email Inbox size : <p> - File it . - If the message is worth keeping , but you do not need it now , file it into another email folder . - You can have 100s of folders ( like the file folders on your desk ) . - Use these to organize your email message history so that you can find your messages quickly later . - These messages should not just sit in your Inbox staring you in the face . If you do n't  need it soon file it . <p> Defer It . If the messages are related to something that needs to be done at a specific time in the future ( e.g. you need them in a week for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not until then ) , you can " Defer " these messages . - Deferring messages makes them " go away " and " come back " to your INBOX after some interval or at a set date and time . Some email providers offer email deferral as a feature if yours does , take advantage of it . <p> Can You Live Without It ? - If you can live without an email message delete it . - There is no reason to keep your entire email history hanging around , especially in your Inbox. - If you later find that you actually do need that message , you can still retrieve it if you have an email archival system keeping permanent copies of all email messages ( which is good insurance for any organization ) . - If you do n't  think its likely you will need the message again delete it . <p> Track long term tasks outside of your Inbox . An Inbox is good for tracking things that need to be done " soon " . - It is not an efficient place to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them all and to- prioritize- them . - If you find yourself in this situation , you should use external task management systems and transfer your emails to them for tracking . - For developers , Atlassian JIRA is an awesome tool for this . - For smaller sets of tasks , any task management system will work . - Transfer the email content to your task management system , then file or delete the email . <h> 6 . Use your Inbox more Efficiently <p> So , you are keeping your Inbox relatively small , you can still improve your Inbox usage efficiency still further by : <p> Tag and Color Code : If your provider supports it , you can color code and tag the messages in your Inbox so that you can see at a glance ( without reading ) what tasks or categories or priorities they relate to . <p> Touch Each Message Once : If a message is a task avoid working on it part way and coming back later and finishing it . - This causes lost of extra context switching in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message and generally makes the task take much longer than if you " just do it " all at once . If you look at a message and decide to do it later , use tags , color codes , and annotations ( below ) to help you track when and what should be done and thus to move on and stop thinking about the issue . <p> Annotate : If your provider supports it , annotate email messages with notes and comments so that when you come back to them later , you can quickly see what the gist is , what work you may have already done , and remember what your previous thoughts were . - Annotations jump start your work and allow you to keep a- journal- of work done . <h> 7 . Prioritize your Work <p> If your Inbox is your To Do List , then you should prioritize what you want to get done each day : <p> Pick up to 6 things that you want to get done during the day . <p> Tag/Color code them so that you can identify them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For tasks that will take a long time , plan ahead how much time you intend to spend on the task . <p> Leave time unplanned so that you can handle other things that arise and things that take longer than expected . <p> If your Inbox has a large number of tasks , the tendency is to pick and choose what you feel like doing . - This often results in easier tasks being done first and the harder and more important things being deferred until later when we end up being more tired or having less time . - By spending a little time prioritizing and then sticking to it , you save time and get the most important things done .

Quick Keys to Access Anything , Anywhere <p> Invariably , there are things that individual users like to access frequently and on-demand and such access would be best done without interrupting whatever else they may be doing on the site . - This is simple using Widgets and Quick Keys : you create a Widget containing the information that you want to access frequently ( e.g. you INBOX , your notes , you calendar , etc. ) . - Then you assign a quick key to it . - From then on , you can press the quick key on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see and interact with that information on the fly and dismiss it when done , returning to where you left off . <h> 2 . Viewing Multiple INBOXes at the Same Time <p> LuxSci staff do this all the time . - We have some users who share email folders with other users . - E.g. a " sales " inbox that is shared with the members of the sales team . - Our sales team can then , in LuxSci WebMail , see all of their personal email folders and the shared INBOX ( and other folders ) shared with them by the " Sales " user . <p> The sales staff can easily <p> Check for new messages in any folder <p> Drag and drop messages from one folder into any other folder even if that target folder is one that is shared with them by a different user . <p> Forward , Reply , and Manage the folder <p> Folders shared " read-write " with you behave just like your own folders you can perform all of the same operations on them and the messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so many passwords and we have to update them periodically . - Besides that , we have to allow groups of staff members to be able to access and manage selected passwords , while restricting access from other staff members . <p> Providing central online encrypted storage of our passwords and other information related to each one ( e.g. links , usernames , attachments , notes ) <p> Providing one password database that can be shared among all users that need it so there is only one place to look up things and make changes . <p> Providing fine grained access control on a per-password basis so we can control exactly what users or groups or users can access that data . <p> Providing access audit trails . <p> The Password WebAide makes it quick and simple for us to manage corporate passwords , access controls , and personal password databases all in one place the same place we are already logged in to for email . <h> 4 . Email Management <p> We use a number of particularly cool features for managing our email , beyond shared email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a desktop email program , you can select multiple messages with control and shift and you can drag and drop these into any email folder to move them there . <p> Defer Messages for Later <p> If you like to keep your INBOX clean , you can do that by " hiding " email messages that you do not need now . - Select them and use the " Defer " command . - This will hide them for a specific amount of time or until a specified date/time when they will be brought back into view . - In the interim , you can always find them in your " Deferred " email folder . - See : Deferred Email : Get those messages out of my sight , i 'll look at them later ! <p> Annotate Messages <p> When I am not ready to deal with an email now but I have some thoughts to jot down about it for myself ( or maybe for someone else who will be handing it ) , I like the " annotation " feature . - I can add some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is then visible to anyone looking at it in WebMail or IMAP or from a mobile device . - See : Please Note : Message Annotation for your Email . <p> Tag and Color Code Messages <p> For organizing and prioritizing the messages in my own INBOX and for sorting and delegating messages in shared folders , I find tagging extremely useful . - It allows you to have multiple text tags added to a messages that are visible in the webmail and in supporting IMAP programs . These messages can also be color coded for fast visual processing and prioritization. - See : Tag , you 're it ! Productivity through tagging and color coding . <p> Move or Delete messages in Bulk <p> It happens you have a folder with lots of messages that you would like to get rid of or move to another folder . but those are only some of the messages . - With LuxSci , you can perform a simple or advanced search to match the messages in question . - Then you can use " Message &gt; Delete All " command and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages in the folder no matter how many there are . - Or , chose " Message &gt; Move " and then - " All Search Results " to move all matching messages in the folder to a new or existing email folder . <p> Use the Luxsci File Manager to securely upload and download files from your web site for FTP space without needing an FTP program <p> Use email folder properties to have messages auto-delete from them after a certain period of time or have the folders auto-archive themselves into dated archives . - Great for folders that get a continuous stream of messages . <p> Use LuxSci Custom Firewalls for fine grained access control over who can access what services in your account from where .

<p> VPN Access to your premium environment LuxSci services creates a secured tunnel ( using IPSec ) where all traffic travelling from your computer to LuxScis servers is encrypted in transit no matter what kind of traffic it is or what protocol it is for . - This means : <p> All traffic to/from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use SSL or TLS , then you have 2 layers of encryption the SSL and TLS inside the IPSec VPN . <p> With this in mind , here are a number of ways that VPN Access can improve security and privacy : <h> No Eavesdropping or Man-in-the-Middle- on your SSL connections <p> With SSL it is possible for your connections to be eavesdropped on if <p> Administrative Monitoring : Your administrator has setup software or hardware to monitor your SSL-encrypted network traffic and has installed an SSL certificate or certificate authority on your computer so that their " man in the middle " scanner appears trusted and does not generate SSL warnings . - If this is happening you can only tell by examining the SSL certificate , and sometimes even that is subtle . - In these cases , your administrator or network can examine all of your communications , including passwords , usernames and other private data . <p> Malicious Monitoring : If a malicious party is trying to scan your SSL connections in a similar way , you may get an SSL warning about an untrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed " or if your users are non-technical and " proceed anyway not knowing better " then the identity protection feature of SSL is ignored and your connection is completely open to the malicious party . - Similarly , if the connection appears trusted but no longer has the green " Lux Scientiae , Incorporated " address bar , one might fail notice that you are no longer connected directly to LuxSci , but to some unknown intermediate party . <p> By using VPN Access , your successful VPN connection insures that you are connected directly and securely to LuxScis infrastructure . - Any traffic passing through this VPN connection is then immune to monitoring of this kind. - E.g. you are protected from active administrative snooping and from lack of vigilance or user inexperience . - Eliminating user error as a source of insecurity is always a good thing ! <h> Actively Restrict Access to Your Accounts <p> Besides protecting the privacy and security of your own connections ; protecting your accounts from direct access by unauthorized people is also extremely important . - LuxSci has a wide array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With VPN Access , you can take these restrictions one step further . - Using your accounts custom firewalls , you can restrict any access to any of your account services ( like WebMail , POP , IMAP , SMTP , FTP , etc. ) so that access is only granted to users who are already VPNed in. - E.g. it would be impossible for a malicious party to guess your password or gain access to any of your accounts without being also connected to the VPN as their connections would be rejected summarily . <p> Restricting access to people connecting via the VPN also solves the problem of wanting to restrict access by IP but where your users IP addresses are varied or changing . <p> Note that MobileSync- ( Exchange ActiveSync for mobile device access to email and calendar/contact/tasks data ) is exempted from VPN access restrictions of custom firewalls , due to the limitations of many mobile devices . <p> SSL and TLS by themselves do not help with unauthorized account access . - They secure the connections but do not restrict who can make such connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Other Benefits of VPN Access <p> There are a number of other significant benefits of using VPN Access to your LuxSci account . - These include : <p> Ports Blocked ? - If you are having trouble accessing services because your ISP or network is blocking ports , like the SMTP port of 25 , you can eliminate those blocks by sending all your traffic through the VPN ( assuming they permit the VPN connections ) <p> Hide Your IP : When connecting over the VPN , our servers only see your internal , private VPN-assigned IP Address we do not see the actual IP address assigned by your ISP ( though this can be obtained from our VPN logs ) . - As a result , when you send email via SMTP , your ISPs IP will not show up in the email headers and you will not have issues with being blocked because of its poor reputation . - This is typically solved by scrubbing your email using LuxSci Anonymous SMTP , but that is not even needed if you are using the VPN. enabling faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Secure Remote MySQL Access . If you would like to or need to manage your LuxSci-hosted MySQL database from your desktop and need this to be " secure " , you have 2 choices with LuxSci use " stunnel " to setup an SSL-secured connection from your computer to LuxSci , or use the VPN. - MySQL connections coming through the VPN do no need an additional SSL layer to be considered secure , so you can use any MySQL database management program over the VPN for secure access without any additional setup needed . - This is the recommended method for secure remote MySQL database management . <p> Other insecure services . If you need to connect to other services insecurely , e.g. because you have some program that does not support SSL , you can do that over the VPN to have security anyway , provided that your account is not restricted to SSL-enabled connections . <h> About LuxSci VPN Access Service <p> You can also use other L2TP/IPSec VPN clients ( e.g. Windows native , iPhone , IPad , Android , etc. ) ; however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the information to configure them , but you are on your own with setup . - The Cisco VPN Clients are fully supported . <p> Costs $5/month per VPN user licenses . <p> Existing customers can add VPN access using the " Upgrade " tool in their account . - New customers can add it to their orders by choosing " VPN Secure Access " under the list of " more services " in the order wizard . - VPN service is available for Premium Shared and Premium Dedicated/VM customers .

Your patients are clamoring to speak with you or to set up and confirm appointments via text messages . Consequently , you feel pressured to use a questionable practice -- text messaging -- to relay healthcare information . <p> Text messaging is fast becoming the new normal for everyday communication due to its speed and convenience . Patients now want to use texting for their healthcare needs , as well . You , however , may have doubts about the suitability of text messaging in a healthcare setting , and , more important , its legality compared to more conventional modes of communication . <p> In most instances , sending electronic Protected Health Information ( ePHI ) by text message is a clear violation of HIPAA guidelines . If a breach of ePHI were to occur as a result , the healthcare facility involved could face fines of up to $50,000 per message . If your office were audited , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> At LuxSci , we want all your communications to be secure . Our SecureText service represents a unique solution to concerns about HIPAA-compliant text messaging . SecureText enables the sending of completely secure messages , including attachments . <p> All you have to do is remember " phonenumer@secure.text " to send SecureText messages to anyone from LuxSci WebMail , your favorite email program , or LuxSci 's REST API . <h> Perhaps you were wondering ... ? <p> The sender composes an email message in LuxSci WebMail or the sender 's favorite email program ( for example , Outlook , Thunderbird , or iPhone Mail ) and sends the message to a special email address based on the recipient 's cell phone number ( for instance , " 2114367789@secure.text " for a hypothetical recipient in the USA whose cellular number is " 211-436-7789 . " The address is slightly different , but equally easy , for recipients in different countries ) . <p> After the sender hits send , the recipient receives a text message on his/her phone indicating that a secure message is waiting . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which opens up a Web browser on the recipient 's phone : <p> If the recipient has recently viewed another SecureText message , then the new message immediately loads and displays . <p> If the recipient has previously viewed a SecureText message , but that was a while ago , the recipient will first need to enter the password that s/he set up to protect access to these secure messages . <p> If this is the recipient 's first SecureText message , then the recipient sets up a password for future access and enters an email address for password recovery . The recipient then gains access to view the message and is prepared to access future messages . <p> Once the recipient views the SecureText message , s/he can view or download files and securely reply to the message . <p> With regular text messages , there 's no expectation that the message is secure or private or protected from unauthorized access . Sending protected health information ( ePHI ) over a regular text message is a violation of HIPAA unless special safeguards are in place and the patient has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare workers is almost always against HIPAA . See : To Text or Not To Text : Texting under HIPAA . <p> SecureText protects the sensitive data during transmission , provides for authentication of the recipient , provides audit trails of message access , enables message expiration and forced message deletion , and comes with a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement from LuxSci . SecureText allows you to send your secure messages over text without the need for a special app and within HIPAA requirements . <p> You can send SecureText messages to anyone , in any country that has a cell phone with text messaging service . However , your recipient 's phone will need access to the Internet ( for example , by cellular data or WiFi ) and a built-in Web browser to open the message . <p> Yes . SecureText messages ( and secure email messages ) can be sent via LuxSci 's REST API . You sign up for a business email account with LuxSci to gain access to the system ( create a 1-user @luxsci.net account if you do not need to host your email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ API interface , subscribe to a level of texting credits to support your volume , setup Private Labeling to customize your messages and the SecureText portal , and get your own dedicated SecureText phone number from which your texts will originate . <p> Yes . None of the usual limitations of texting exist with SecureText . You can send long messages , HTML-formatted messages , and files in your SecureText messages . The total size of each SecureText message should be less than 70 MB . <p> Yes . If the sender requests a read receipt , then s/he will always receive one when the recipient opens the message . Additionally , senders can see reports of all messages sent ; these reports include message access histories . <p> The SecureText service is part of SecureLine and thus requires a SecureLine license . That is $3.00/user/month . Additionally , sending each SecureText message requires the use of texting credits to pay for the underlying texting service . For messages sent within the USA and Canada , each message generally uses 1 credit . Texting credits can be purchased on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or subscribed to on a recurring monthly " use it or lose it " basis for $10 for each block of 250 credits/month . <p> Pay-as-you-go accounts can send up to 250 SecureText messages each day . <p> Recurring accounts have a daily SecureText sending limit equal to their monthly subscriptionup to 1,000 credits/day . I.e. , if you get 1500 credits/month , then you can use up to 1000 credits/day . <p> Recurring accounts with Private Labeling can obtain a free dedicated sending phone number ( a 10-digit US long code phone number ) from LuxSci . Once that phone number has been added , these accounts have a daily SecureText sending limit equal to their monthly subscription up to 75,000 credits/day . <p> To send more messages in a day or to send faster than 1/second without queuing , a Short Code phone number will be needed .

@@22227318 @2227318/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> How Secure are Password-Protected Files ? <p> Published : February 14th , 2009 <p> We recently discussed email security for accountants and mentioned that the use of password-protected files is not usually a very good solution for meeting data privacy needs. - After writing this and getting some feed back , we thought that the issue of password-protected files really deserves some further discussion. - Many people are under the assumption that if they use the " password protection " features of whatever software they are using , that their data is safe and secure. - However , this is not necessarily the case. - Why ? <p> Using password-protected files to secure data is fast and easy and built into many applications. - Why not use it ? - Certainly , password protecting files is much better than not doing so. - However , there are several things that determine how secure these " protected " files really are . <p> First , let 's assume that the file has fallen into the malicious hands of someone ( a hacker ) trying to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accessible to unauthorized people in the first place , encryption does n't  even come into the picture. - The hacker needs to figure out how to access the protected data. - How can s/he do this ? <h> Unlocking password-protected files ? <p> How can someone access the content of a password -protected file ? - Well , that depends : <p> If the file is not encrypted , but not openable in the normal program that is used to read it ( i.e. like Microsoft Word ) , then the hacker just needs to remove the block on opening the file by editing the file . <p> If the file is encrypted , but with a weak/poor form of security , the hacker may be able to use well known techniques to break into the security in a relatively short amount of time , no matter what password is used . <p> If the file is encrypted with strong encryption , such as AES , the hacker needs to guess the password used . <p> Case 1 used to be prevalent many years ago when password-protection was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader programs would detect and cause them to ask for a password before letting the file be viewed. - In these cases , the raw data was not actually encrypted , and the security relied upon the assumption that ( a ) the user cant/wont look at the raw file and see what the data actually is and ( b ) the user cant/wont be able to figure out how to edit the raw file to remove the " do n't  open me " instructions. - Of course , both of these assumptions are invalid. - - No mainstream program released in the last few years with password protection is so insecure as to use these kind of assumptions. - So , unless you are using old legacy software , you do n't  really have to worry about this extreme form of password-protected insecurity . <p> " ( When ) you use the Password to Modify feature , the feature is functioning as intended even when a user with malicious intent bypasses the feature The behavior occurs because the feature was never designed to protect your document or file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is not exactly password protection from viewing , but password protection from editing. - But the point is the same : even widely used software from companies like Microsoft sometimes does not have any kind of real inherent security in places where a naive user would assume it does . <p> Case 2is prevalent even today. - This involves using old encryption methods that have long ago proven to be easily broken. - For example , Word and Excel 95 , 97 , and 2000 files with password protection can be opened by a hacker withing 10 seconds because the encryption methods used contain known problems. - For versions 2002 and 2003 , the default encryption methods were made to be compatible with version 2000 and are thus susceptible to the same kind of easy access by any hacker. - Versions 2002 and 2003 can use 128-bit RC4 for better ( though not super ) encryption ; however , you need to manually enable this . <p> Many people still use versions of Microsoft Office older than 2007 , and password-protected files generated by these versions are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use are also using old vulnerable encryption methods that render them completely insecure . <p> Case 3 is what you want if you need to use password-protected files. - In this scenario , the file is actually encrypted using a highly secure encryption algorithm such as 128- or 256-bit AES. - The only way to access the original data is to know or guess the password used. - Microsoft Office 2007 uses 128-bit AES encryption for password protection and places those encrypted documents squarely in this case. - Encrypted ZIP files ( via WinZIP ) use 128- or 256-bit AES encryption as well . <p> Adobe Acrobat v8 uses 128-bit AES encryption ; it is implemented in a way that is stronger and takes longer to break than that in v9. - This is the best version , currently , to use for encryption . <p> WinZIP and PkZIP use 128-bit or 256-bit AES encryption. - These are both good as long as you have a good password. - Note , however , that the file names inside a password-protected ZIP file are visible to anyone without needing to decrypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put your password-protected ZIP file inside of another password-protected ZIP file . <p> Office 2007 products ( Word , Excel , Powerpoint , One Note ) use 128-bit AES Encryption. - This is good as log as you have a good password . <p> Office 2002 and 2003 products can use 128-bit RC4 , but are not configured to by default. - This is bad do n't  use password encryption in these versions ! <p> Older versions of Office ( as well as the default configurations of Office 2002 and 2003 ) use an older encryption scheme that is completely broken . Never use password encryption in these versions . <h> Breaking Strong Encryption <p> Password-protected files using strong encryption can only be accessed by knowing or guessing the passwords. - If you are careful and use a very good password ( i.e. one that can not be easily guessed ) , then this form of password protection is indeed very secure . <p> However , it is exceedingly common for people , especially those with no security training , to use very simple passwords on such files. - I.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peoples names , or simple variations on these themes. - - - Such passwords can be " guessed " easily by simply trying all words in the dictionary , all names , and all commonly used variations on all of these. - For English , this means a few million possibilities ( plus or minus dictionaries vary ) . - Computers are so fast that checking a few million possible passwords against an encrypted file can be done very quickly. - So , any file protected with a password that falls into the category of " easily guessed/cracked " can be reliably opened in short order. - It is not the strength of the encryption that is the problem , it is the strength of the key the password . <p> In fact , the demand for opening password-protected Office and PDF files is so great that there are many commercial programs available that can do this for you for a few dollars. - These are " password recovery " programs , but are equally useful to people trying to gain unauthorized access to such files. - They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files with poorly chosen passwords. - For example , a quick Google search found : <p> With all of these utilities readily available , it is within anyones reach to open common password-protected files . <h> Other Problems with Password-Protected Files <p> Unauthorized access to the content of a file is not the only potential problem. - Anyone who can get access to the file content and its password can also alter the file content and re-protect it with the same password in a way that is , for all intents and purposes , undetectable. - So , you have have an encrypted file that holds important information that has been broken into and changed and you would not know it. - Use of regular password-protected files as " vaults " where the data stored therein is assumed safe and immutable is not a really good decision . <h> So , What Can Be Done ? <p> If you need to use encrypted files , you should : <p> Make sure that the files are encrypted using strong encryption <p> Use good passwords ones with uppercase and lowercase characters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be assembled into a common dictionary . <p> If you are using password protection for sending files to multiple people , do not use the same password for everyone ! - Use a different password for each of your corespondents. - - This ensures that the loose lips of one person does not compromise the security of someone else . <p> We have time and again seen or heard of organizations that use really poor passwords , like a dictionary word , and use that same password for all encrypted documents. - This is often done to make things easy for the staff or users , but effectively renders the attempt at encryption laughable . <h> Digital Signatures <p> To protect the content of the file against unauthorized change , you will have to use a digital signature , like that available in PGP and S/MIME. - The digital signature allows you to verify ( a ) when the content was signed , ( b ) who signed it , and ( c ) if it has been altered at all since then . <h> Mitigate Brute Force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the password to an encrypted file is the ability of the hacker to try as many passwords as s/he likes as fast as possible. - If this is not an option , then " guessing " the password becomes , essentially , impossible even if the password in use is poor . <h> How Can This be Accomplished ? <p> If the encrypted file is stored in a server with access only available via a web site where you have to enter the password , then : <p> No one has access to the raw encrypted file and thus can not use any of the available password cracking tools against the file itself . <p> The web site can lock out access after a few password failures. - For example , after 5 incorrect passwords , the hacker would not be permitted to try again for a few minutes from the same location. - This makes automated testing of large numbers of possible passwords impossible . <p> As a case in point , LuxScis SecureLine Escrow service allows LuxSci users to email files to anyone on the Internet who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the files using strong encryption and stores them on a secure server. - It will never email the encrypted files themselves , keeping them invulnerable to direct attacks. - It uses a long random password and makes access only available via a secure ( over SSL ) web site which automatically locks out access after several failed password guesses. - - This kind of communication is uniformly more secure that emailing password-protected files . <p> Of course , communications security assumes that the sender or recipient is using a computer that is not compromised. - But , that is the subject of a future article . <p> file , you must be sure that ( a ) you use a strong password for that file , and ( b ) that the password-protection in use is actually good ; i.e. old versions of Microsoft Office have useless password protection. - If the password is weak 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

Annotations are pre-pended to your messages by default -- so you see all of the annotations first , starting with the most recent , followed by the message itself .

@@22227328 @2227328/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> One of the most common complaints of Windows/PC users is that their computers always start to get slower after time . While some minor slowing down is unavoidable due to wear on parts and heat , the vast majority of it can be fixed by regularly doing some basic maintenance. - Let 's go over some of the basic ways to keep your Windows computer running like a charm . <h> 1 . Start by Rebooting <p> The first thing you should always do when cleaning your computer is to close all programs and reboot . Once your computer boots back up you should be ready to start . - Do not run any programs while cleaning your computer . <p> Rebooting is important because it cleans out any temporary files that your computer programs have made while running . - These files normally get removed automatically when you close the program that opens them , but sometimes for various reasons these programs do not shut down properly and the files remain . These temporary files start to build up over time and can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause a slow down of the computer . <h> 2 . Remove Temporary Files <p> Let 's remove those pesky temporary files . Well call them " Temp Files " for short . The easiest way to delete Temp Files from your computer is to go to the folder ( directory ) they are stored in and delete them manually . To do this you 'll want to go to Start , then click on Run . <p> If you do n't  see the RUN command on the START menu ( it would be on the right side ) then you may need to add it . This can be done by right-clicking on the START button and clicking- - PROPERTIES . You should be on the Start Menu tab of the properties . Click on the Customize button . You 'll now see a bunch of options , scroll down until you see Run Command . Check the box next to it and click OK . You will now see the RUN command on the START menu . <p> Once there , type " %tmp% " in the Run line , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ File directory in a new window .. <p> Once in Temp File directory window is open , you 'll need to select all the files and delete them . This can be done by clicking on any file in the folder and then typing CTRL-A . Holding down the CTRL key and the A key at the same time will cause all the files to be highlighted ( selected ) . You can then hit the Delete key on your keyboard to delete them all . In some cases not all of the files and directories will be able to be deleted . This is because some Temp Files are in use by your computer at this time and you cant delete a file that is actively being used . That 's fine , just skip that file or files and delete the rest . Once that is done , you can close that window . <h> 3 . Empty the Trash <p> Now that we 've deleted all of your Temp Files we should clear your Recycle Bin . In most cases your Recycle Bin is where all the files you delete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer until your clear them out of the Recycle Bin . To do this , go to your computers desktop and find the Recycle Bin icon . Right click on it and choose Empty Recycle Bin . This will clear out all those files we just deleted ( and any others that may also be sitting there taking up space ) . <h> 4 . Find and Remove Malware and Viruses <p> The- next thing you can do to improve your computers performance is to run an Anti-Malware program . There are plenty of them out there and some even offer a free basic version such as the program - MalwareBytes . These programs will remove any malware on your computer that could be slowing your computer down . Its also good to run these once in awhile so that you remove any malware that could be spying on you from your computer ( Ideally , you could get a paid version and have it always running and periodically scanning ) . Todays biggest threats are n't  viruses ; its the malware that hides on your system and collects information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run an anti-virus scan on your computer . Most major anti-virus companies offer trial versions of their anti-virus programs . There are also free basic version from some vendors . Examples are McAfees trial version anti-virus and AVGs and Avasts free versions . While most anti-virus programs do slow your computer down slightly , they are worth it as they keep viruses from slowing your computer down even more and causing worse problems like data corruption . They can also prevent you from having to re-install many programs due to a virus infection . <h> Choice of Anti-virus and Malware Protection Software <p> Another way to increase the performance of your system may be to consider your choice of anti-virus and malware software . Some anti-virus and malware software may use a large amount of resources even when not performing a scan . Two that are- particularly- lightweight ( i.e. good for performance ) are AVG anti-virus and Kapersky . Be sure to consider all of your options and test out different trial versions to see which one provides the best balance of features and system performance . <h> Choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider when malware and anti-virus programs update and- perform scans . Scans and updates can cause a lot of disk access which can greatly decrease the performance of your computer . In extreme cases your computer may even become unusable until the scan is complete . When choosing a time for your computer to perform scans , try picking a time you wont be using the computer . It may even be best to pick a time early in the morning once a week . For example 2AM on a Saturday morning . Just be sure to leave your computer running overnight every Friday . <h> 6 . Reboot again ! <p> Once you 've done all this , give your computer another reboot . In Windows systems , rebooting is never a bad thing because it helps clear out many Temp Files and also empties out your active memory , which can contain programs that have not shut down properly . Programs that appear closed but are still running in memory can also cause your computer to slow down as less memory is available for use by the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take is called Disk Defragmentation . Also referred to " defragging " your disk , it re-arranges the way files are stored on your physical disk drive so that they can be loaded faster . - This can be done via the Disk Defragmenter program within Windows . You can get to this program in most versions of Windows by going to Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools . There you 'll see the program Disk Defragmenter . Just follow the on screen instructions to run the program . <p> You should prepare ahead of time to run this process as it can take many hours to complete and is usually best run overnight when you are not using your computer . - The larger the hard drive , the longer defragging your disk will take . We could give a long detailed explanation of what disk defragging does , but all you really need to know is that it makes it easier for the computer to find the individual bits of the computer programs on your hard drives . The more fragmented ( thus the term defrag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 8 .

Lastly , Stop Programs from Auto-Starting that Shouldnt <p> Many programs that you install on your computer automatically start themselves every time you boot your computer . - The more of these that start , the slower your computer boots and the slower it runs ( due to all of these things competing for resources ) . <p> You - can combat this two ways : <p> Remove/uninstall programs that are not needed .

@@22227341 @2227341/ <h> eBook HIPAA-compliant Email Basics <h> Safeguarding your healthcare practice and protecting patient privacy <h> HIPAA-compliant Email <p> It 's unfortunate that hackers can exploit online communication on a hunt for sensitive information . However , with advanced cybersecurity , you can protect your private email information from hacking vulnerabilities . At LuxSci , we specialize in email encryption to ensure communication security . Not only are our email services encrypted , but they 're also HIPAA- ( Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ) compliant for those of you in the medical and Healthcare fields . Medical records hold some of your and your patients ' most sensitive information : Social Security numbers , insurance IDs , addresses , credit cards , medical records and scheduling , and more . LuxSci provides the leading software in HIPAA-compliant email , which guarantees the privacy of all ePHI ( electronic patient health information ) sent within your organization , as well as to patients and other appropriate , outside recipients . HIPAA makes it your legal responsibility to secure your patients ' ePHI , and it 's our responsibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelm and confuse when you 're trying to find a user-friendly platform . LuxSci is here to make this easy for you . We provide HIPAA-compliant email with form and Web abilities , as well as HIPAA-compliant email hosting services . We also help back up your data and offer extensive auditing . Most important , we offer forced encryption that always comes with a verified seal that links to us and allows your recipients to know you properly protected their information . <p> Yes . LuxSci 's HIPAA-compliant email services do not require you or your recipients to install any special software . LuxSci works with any modern desktop or mobile Web browser , with all modern email programs ( such as Outlook and Mac Mail ) , and with mobile email programs as well . <p> If some messages do not include ePHI , you can choose to opt out of using encryption for them . LuxSci does not support opt-in encryption ( where you manually specify which messages need encryption ) , because it 's too risky for HIPAA compliance . <p> If only some people need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ( or more ) domains . For example , users who must be fully compliant can have addresses in " secure.yourdomain.com . " Users who do not need HIPAA-compliant email can have addresses in " yourdomain.com " and can send and receive without any encryption at all . ( We call this per-domain HIPAA compliance . ) Users can have addresses in both domains , if needed . <p> When you send an email message through WebMail , from either your mobile device or your email program , that message transmits securely to LuxSci 's servers using TLS . Once the message arrives , LuxSci encrypts the message for each of your recipients and then delivers the encrypted message to the recipient 's email servers . Based on your account preferences , who the recipients are , where their email host is , and settings in your account , the encryption used can take the form of : SMTP TLS , Secure Message Pick Up ( Escrow ) , PGP , or S/MIME . <p> It depends . Messages sent using SMTP TLS do not require anything special to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messages sent using Escrow ( Secure Message Pick Up ) do require the recipients to authenticate themselves to our secure web site in order to access their secure messages . You can do this either ( a ) by using a username/password for a free account to access any received message , or ( b ) by providing an answer to a custom question designated by the message sender . See : SecureLine Escrow and SMTP TLS . <p> Yes , you can use any of these devices with LuxSci HIPAA compliant email . You can even use the encryption opt-out features from these email programs and Exchange ActiveSync for real-time , compliant synchronization of email , calendars , tasks , contacts , and notes . LuxSci does not provide a dedicated mobile app since secure email integrates with any mobile email app that supports IMAP , POP , SMTP , or ActiveSync . <p> Yes , you can move your email hosting to LuxSci so that you can use your existing domain . You can smarthost your outbound email from your existing email server to use LuxSci 's outbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure.yourdomain.com " ) so that only LuxSci hosts your secure email .

Provisioning can be delayed due to issues validating orders . <h> How HIPAA-Compliant Email at LuxSci Works <p> HIPAA Compliance requires that the transfer of any sensitive or confidential patient health information ( ePHI ) over the Internet is done securely . Our SecureLine email encryption system is designed to do just that . SecureLine seamlessly integrates the following modes of secure email communication to ensure that you can securely communicate with anyone , no matter what kind of email system they are using . <p> SecureLine Escrow - SecureLine Escrow requires that a recipient actively verify his or her identity before he or she can access a message at a secure web portal . Escrow provides secure email delivery , authentication , and auditing to anyone with an email address <p> SecureLine PKI - SecureLine PKI uses certificates ( PGP &amp; S/MIME ) to internally encrypt email messages before sending them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this method to be useful . <h> Required Legal Forms <h> SecureLine Meets Your Compliance Needs <p> When you sign up for our HIPAA-compliant Email , SecureLine will ensure that all email messages sent via SMTP or through our WebMail interface are sent securely to any recipient , while remaining flexible enough to allow exceptions where appropriate for usability . The chart below shows how SecureLine can be adjusted to fit the scope of your compliance . <p> Account-wide lockdown with opt-out enabled . All users are required to send securely , but certain users are permitted to opt-out on an individual message basis . All opt-outs are logged . <p> Everyone <p> Occasionally for all users <p> All users have logins to two separate domains one for secure sending ( typically a subdomain ) , and one for non-ePHI sending . The secure domain is completely locked down to prohibit non-ePHI sending . <p> Some Users <p> Never <p> Majority of users have logins in a non-HIPAA domain , while the few that send ePHI have logins in a different HIPAA-secure domain ( typically a subdomain ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Some Users <p> Occasionally <p> Majority of users have logins in a non-HIPAA domain , while the few that send ePHI have logins in a different HIPAA-secure domain ( typically a subdomain ) .

Once we have your signed BAA and ARA , LuxSci gives your account a final review to make sure everything is in order . At this point your account is considered HIPAA-compliant . <p> Users are locked down to certain security settings based on whether they will be sending ePHI or not : <h> HIPAA-compliant Email Features <p> LuxSci 's HIPAA-compliant email was specifically designed to satisfy all HIPAA rules and security requirements . With the implementation and utilization of the following features , and after review and lock down by LuxSci Support , we will confirm your account as being HIPAA compliant in terms of our HIPAA Business Associate Agreement . <p> LuxSci provides a Business Associate Agreement compatible with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in maintaining the Privacy of Protected Health Information ( PHI ) for you as you seek to be HIPAA-compliant . A document like this is required by HIPAA of any vendor that you use . <p> HIPAA Compliance Seal / Trust Mark <p> Once your account is certified by LuxSci as meeting its HIPAA Security Requirements , you can use a LuxSci HIPAA Compliance Seal on your web site or in your HTML Email Signatures , Taglines , or Disclaimers . <p> A sample HIPAA Seal looks like this ( click on it to see an example certification page ) : <p> Accounts with Mixed HIPAA and non-HIPAA Domains <p> HIPAA accounts can be either globally secure , so all users are compliant and encryption and security are fully-enforced for all messages , or they can be secured on a per-domain basis . In the per-domain case , only users in specified " HIPAA Domains " are required to send all email securely ; users in other domains can send insecure email messages but can not deal with ePHI at all . All users in these accounts share certain basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSL and TLS for server access , etc . <p> Use of per-domain HIPAA allows organizations to easily manage their compliant and non-compliant domains in a single account and also permits limited collaboration and sharing between non-HIPAA and HIPAA user logins . <p> Customers can select account-wide or per-domain HIPAA accounts during the ordering process . <p> ePHI Safeguarded <p> As required by the HITECH amendment to HIPAA , LuxSci follows the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rules with respect to all ePHI in your HIPAA-enabled accounts . This means that LuxSci actively ensures that the privacy of all electronic health information is safeguarded while it is stored on our servers , passing through our servers , or on our backups . It also means that LuxSci staff comply with all HIPAA Security and Privacy requirements : <p> Physical safeguards and data access control for ePHI <p> Staff training and administrative policies <p> Facility access control and security for ePHI <p> Contingency plans , backups plans , and disaster recovery for ePHI <p> Workstation security and usage lock down with respect to ePHI <p> I.e. LuxSci staff themselves obey all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face when dealing with ePHI . <p> Secure Mobile Email , Calendar , Contact , Task , and Notes Access <p> Mobile Sync is an optional service that enables you to synchronize email , calendars , contacts , tasks , and notes on your mobile devices automatically and in real time . Mobile Sync is HIPAA-compliant and provides " Remote Wipe " , so you can delete ePHI from your mobile device should it become lost or stolen -- preventing possible HIPAA breaches . <p> Even without Mobile Sync , LuxSci 's IMAP , POP , and SMTP services can be used to securely send and receive email on most mobile devices . <p> Email Archival <p> LuxSci can offer you an archival solution that is comprehensive , cost-effective , and compliant with most current federal regulations including : <p> In addition to enforced use of SSL and TLS for all connections to our servers , all users automatically send and receive email securely using our SecureLine end-to-end encryption service .

Those recipients can easily reply back securely or use our SecureSend portal to register for free and initiate secure messages to your SecureLine users . <p> To provide a user-friendly environment , certain work-arounds are possible , such as the use of TLS transmission for certain recipients instead of end-to-end encryption . See Restrictions to HIPAA Accounts at LuxSci . <p> Message Integrity Controls <p> LuxSci 's SecureLine and enforced connection encryption ( SSL &amp; TLS ) ensures that the messages can not be modified while in transit . Message integrity is assured . Additionally , LuxSci 's SecureLine permits the addition of digital signatures to encrypted messages to further ensure the message integrity and prove the identity of the sender . <p> Unique User Identification &amp; Authentication <p> LuxSci requires that user names and passwords be entered for access to any of its services . The system recognizes users based on their login information , and controls access based on their identity . HIPAA-compliant accounts are required to utilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters and numbers or symbols . The password must have " high entropy " and not be easily guessable . Automatic auditing of password changes and password resets is required and performed for HIPAA accounts . <p> Emergency Access to Email <p> LuxSci provides a facility for securely archiving copies of all inbound and/or outbound messages for backup and auditing purposes . Administrators thus have secure access to copies of all message content for emergency or other reasons . LuxSci also provides other optional features such as Message Continuity that is used to ensure access to email messages in the event of LuxSci server or data center failure . <p> Automatic System Logoff <p> HIPAA compliant accounts have a 20 minute default idle period to web-based interfaces ( WebMail ) . The system will automatically log users off after 20 minutes of inactivity ; this can be increased to 3 hours by account administrators . Other services such as POP , IMAP , SMTP , Mobile Sync , and Secure FTP also have automatic idle timeouts . <p> Access Audit Controls <p> LuxSci provides comprehensive security auditing for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resets , and lookups by LuxSci staff ; user access to services such as WebMail , Email Sending ( SMTP ) , POP , IMAP , Mobile Sync , and more ; changes to any of the specific " Maximal Security " settings , as well as changes to the " Maximal Security " lock down status . These reports enable verification of user , administrator , and LuxSci Support staff activity on access and security specific changes to the account . <p> Data Backups &amp; Data Disposal <p> LuxSci automatically makes backup copies of all data on our servers , including all customer ePHI . Daily backup copies are kept on-site for 2 days and Weekly backup copies are kept off-site for 4 weeks . All data is transmitted securely to the backup servers and stored there in a HIPAA-compliant way . After 4 weeks , all backup copies are destroyed . Accounts can ask for data to be restored from backup for free once/month . LuxSci 's Email Archival provides permanent , immutable email storage on servers in multiple geographic locations , updated in real-time , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup and restore statement for additional information . <p> Though disabled by default , administrators can choose to allow users the option to opt out of SecureLine encryption for a particular message . However , the user must explicitly agree that the message they are sending does not contain any ePHI . All messages sent without SecureLine encryption are logged for auditing purposes , and copies of them can be sent to an auditor email address for review . <p> Opt Out is available both in WebMail and for messages sent via email programs using our SecureLine Outlook Plugin or via adding opt out content to the email subject line . <p> Optional VPN Access for Enhanced Security <p> LuxSci can provide a Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) connection to further secure access to our email , web , and database servers . <h> Welcome to LuxSci ! <p> *for non-dedicated-server orders placed between 9am and 10pm Eastern Time , USA .

@@22227342 @2227342/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> Is a FAX document HIPAA-Secure ? <p> Many organizations , especially in the healthcare industry , have an urgent need to send important and sensitive information , like protected health information ( what constitutes PHI ? ) , to organizations via FAX ( facsimile ) . <p> Why ? - Because this is how it has always been done , and everyone is " set up " to be able to handle FAXes quickly and efficiently . <p> However , with HIPAA security regulations ever-present , our clients are concerned that their use of FAX is compliant , similar to making sure that their email and web sites meet HIPAA security standards . <p> Beyond compliance issues , a FAX is not really useful you essentially get a printout or an image and not an electronic document that can be efficiently used . - This is not good for productivity or for meeting other standards . <h> Can data sent via FAX be " secure enough " for HIPAA ? <p> You might think that the answer is simple " no " , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line. - Why ? - Because anyone with physical access to the phone lines and some technical expertise can eavesdrop on phone calls and FAXes and thus obtain any protected health information by fax . - It is acknowledged that sending email messages containing PHI insecurely is prohibited , so it follows that FAXing might also be " not a good idea " . <p> But , it turns out that " no " is too simple an answer and not practical or accurate . <h> How does HIPAA actually apply to FAXes ? <p> SAFEGUARDS PRINCIPLE : Individually identifiable health information should be protected with reasonable administrative , technical , and physical safeguards to ensure its confidentiality , integrity , and availability and to prevent unauthorized or inappropriate access , use , or disclosure . <p> HIPAA is interesting in that it lays out many requirements , rules , and principles , but they are all flexible and do not prescribe any specific practices or actions that must be taken. - This permits organizations to " adequately " protect the privacy of PHI as appropriate to their circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and administrative safeguards that are easy to apply. - Using end-to-end email encryption and good security policies is not difficult and is considered " low hanging fruit " on the path to meeting all of the HIPAA requirements. - Since securing email is relatively easy , it becomes essentially mandatory under the Safeguards Principle it is reasonable to take the straight-forward step of using email encryption to protect personal health information ( PHI ) , especially with the significant insecurities of Internet use in general . <h> With FAXes , the situation is very different . <p> There is no easy way to secure a " regular " FAX transmission between between two parties unless they are both setup with special encrypting fax machines- or other special services . Few organizations have such tools . They are expensive , and to be useful , everyone must have compatible machines . <p> People are familiar with communication of protected health information ( PHI ) on an as needed basis verbally over the insecure phone . <p> Use of these same insecure phone lines to send a FAX is not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations have a strong business need to communicate using FAX . <p> Since speaking over insecure phone lines , when needed , - is " OK " as far as HIPAA goes , how can a FAX be less secure ? <p> FAXes are often left on the FAX machine for some period of time after they arrive. - This makes the sensitive information available to anyone walking by the machine . <p> FAX machines often save copies of received FAXes internally. - This makes it possible for anyone with access to the FAX machine to print out additional copies of the sensitive material . <p> FAX machines generally print out the transmitted messages on paper. - This paper , if not destroyed , could be placed in an insecure location . <p> If the fax machine actually transmits the fax digitally anywhere ( e.g. fax-to-email ) , then that digital transmission must be properly encrypted for HIPAA. - Most fax machines do not support that ; and most small offices do not bother to set this up securely even if it is possible for them . <h> What should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do n't  send any FAXes <p> This is probably not realistic for most organizations ; however , it will guarantee that you are HIPAA compliant . - It is , increasingly , the way to go these days with it being easier and easier to send information over secure email or through other secure electronic means . Eliminating the paper trail and the insecure FAXes can be an important step in cleaning up your HIPAA risk analysis . <h> Option #2 : Use sensible policies <p> If you decide its worth the risk to send FAXes over insecure phone lines , you should utilize sensible policies to mitigate the insecurities of the facsimile and help ensure that you are abiding by the Safeguards Principle in a reasonable manner. - Some suggested policies include : <p> Do not send PHI over FAX unless it can not be sent over other , more secure , channels. - I.e. delivery by hand , secure email , etc . <p> For any new recipient , verify the FAX number with a test send of a facsimile before sending the actual protected health information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAX was sent to the wrong place . - This would be a HIPAA breach . <p> Configure your FAX machines to never save copies of sent or received FAXes <p> Make sure that PHI FAXes never remain on the FAX machine after receipt , and that they are promptly delivered to the intended recipient . <p> Develop policies on the storage , copying , and disposal of PHI FAXes . <p> Locate your FAX machines in a secured room where only staff who are authorized to use ePHI that may be transmitted trough that machine can use access it . <p> Use a dedicated FAX machine for ePHI and keep it well separate and secured , compared to any other FAX machines in use . <p> Development of policies along these lines will help to mitigate security issues associated with FAXing. - These guidelines are common in institutions having to abide by HIPAA especially if they are not aware of better solutions . <h> Option #3 : Send the FAX data via " Email " <p> If you search the internet for " Secure FAX " services , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these vendors never actually describe security at all they just get your attention with the " Secure " keyword. - Some of them offer FAX services and instruct you to follow the steps described in Option #2 to make FAXes " secure " . - The few that actually offer a truly secure FAX service do something like this : <p> You login and upload the materials to be " FAXed " ( i.e. possibly after first scanning and saving it on your computer ) . <p> You enter an email address and possibly a FAX number of the recipient . <p> The pages that you are " FAXing " are encrypted and saved in a database at your FAX service provider . <p> The " FAX " recipient gets an email or FAX notifying them that they have a " FAX " and that they need to go to a web site to " pick it up " . <p> The recipient goes to the web site and downloads the " FAX " over a secure ( SSL ) web connection . <p> This transmission of information is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the server is secured . <p> The temporary storage is secured . <p> The transmission from the server to the recipient is secured . <p> An audit trail may be available to track the process , for improved compliance . <p> Authentication of the sender and/or recipient may be present , for improved compliance . <p> This is obviously a more secure method of transmitting PHI than a classical FAX. - However , the use of " FAX " in this process is really a misnomer. - Except for some services which " FAX " the recipient a notice instead of an email notification , no actual FAXing is involved . Secure FAX services offer nothing more than a " drop off and pick up " process. - However , for most purposes , that is the solution . not the FAXing in and of itself . <p> LuxSci offers just this kind of drop off and pick up service as part of its SecureLine- email encryption service you can securely and compliantly transfer files to any organization using any email address. - Its easy to send and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a " FAX " per-se , but it delivers the same result . <h> What is the right choice for you ? <p> As with everything HIPAA the choice is yours to : <p> Abandon FAXes if you do n't  need them frequently . <p> Use FAXes with good policies if you have the demand , your staff cant easily make electronic copies of the data , and/or if your recipients do not have email access .

Its only when things go wrong that it tends to enter their peripherals . This often leads to inadequate budgeting or heavy cutbacks . Unfortunately , restricting security funds can result in incidents that cost companies many times more than what they would have spent on security measures . <p> Because of this , security can be seen as an investment that often has a high ROI , as long as it is applied strategically and intelligently . Although no amount of money and infrastructure can make your systems 100% secure , the right measures can still help to boost a companys bottom line . <p> A well thought-out security plan is a balancing act between the costs of implementation and the potential damage of a breach . Sure , your company could invest in complex security measures , but is it justified by the risks you face ? <p> In some situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . Other businesses may be able to justify a lower level of security , particularly if they operate at a smaller scale and do n't  handle sensitive data . Security needs will vary depending on industry and the individual business model , according to both the relevant regulations and the risk profile . <h> How Much Will Security Incidents Cost You ? <p> Balancing the cost of security measures against the cost of cyber incidents can be incredibly difficult . This is due to the complexity of analyzing and quantifying risks , as well as issues with calculating the total costs of an incident . How can you quantify the damage to your brand reputation after a serious data breach ? <p> To figure out just how much you should spend on your security , it is best to have an understanding of how much money you face losing each year due to cyber incidents . This can be calculated by multiplying the average cost per incident by the estimated number of occurrences each year . <p> Finding the cost per incident is a challenge because there are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of the breach , as well as the type of data that has been compromised . The costs can include compliance penalties , legal fees , downtime , damage to a brands reputation and also remediation . <p> The total cost can vary depending on the scale of your business , your industry and also your business model . Estimates range widely , with a Kaspersky Lab study stating that the average loss for SMEs is $38,000 . A survey between the UK Government and PwC put the cost at between $112,000 and $466,200 for SMEs , while the Ponemon Intitutes 2016 Cost of Data Breach Study put costs at between $145 and $158 per stolen record . This was up to $355 for records that contained healthcare information . <p> Cybercrime is expected to continue growing over the next several years . Juniper Research estimates that it will have global costs of $2.1 trillion by 2019 . Finance , healthcare and government are among the sectors with the highest incident rate , although companies in other areas face mounting threats as well . <h> How Much Should You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cyber security budgets are intended to boost the bottom line . While some security measures may reduce the risks that your business faces , they may also cost too much to justify . <p> There are several methods to help you calculate an adequate security budget , however there are large variations in the individual needs of each business and its risk profile . The Gordon-Loeb model posits that a companys security investment should be no more than 37% of expected losses from a cyber incident . <p> A study from Gartner estimates that businesses currently spend about 5% of their IT budget on security . This figure is quickly rising as business services continue to move online , with organizations increasing their information security funding by 24% in 2016 . <p> A Ponemon report showed that the average US company with 1,000 or more employees is spending $15 million each year against cybercrime . It needs to be noted that these figures also include the costs of recovery from attacks , rather than just the money the businesses are putting into their security . Smaller businesses will obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Investing in the Right Kind of Security <p> Where the money is spent is far more important than the dollar value of your security spending . A poor security plan will not be able to keep your business safe , no matter how much of your budget you throw at it . Each business will have different needs , so it is important to do a thorough analysis of the risks your company faces . <p> This analysis can be used to come up with a comprehensive security plan , with adequate protections in place to justify your unique risks . To maximize your security investments , it is important not to engage in security for securitys sake , but to take measures that work towards reducing the threat level . <p> One of the biggest decisions will be whether to take care of your security in-house or to outsource it to professional firms . Smaller companies may find it more cost-effective to outsource much of their security need , while larger companies may also find benefits in using specialists . Using cloud services may be another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If your business needs a complete security overhaul , the first step should be a thorough audit . From here , you can evaluate what is necessary for an effective security program . A Ponemon study on larger businesses revealed that the technologies with the highest return on investment included security intelligence systems , encryption , firewalls , risk and compliance tools , automated policy management tools , as well as data loss prevention tools . <p> Additional factors that helped to save money included IT governance , employee education , having expert security professionals and using security metrics effectively . Although cyber insurance may not be a security measure , it is definitely a worthwhile consideration that could help your business recover from worst-case scenarios . <h> Make Sure Your Security Measures Are Current <p> The threat landscape in the online world is constantly changing and your organization needs to evolve alongside it . Even if you implement comprehensive security practices , they can quickly become ineffective if you neglect maintenance , updates and upgrades . <p> It is best to have your security plan headed by professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use their skills and expertise to keep your systems secure by running the latest software , looking for vulnerabilities , monitoring for attacks and running patches when necessary . <p> Keeping your systems secure is n't a one-off endeavor , but a continuous and dynamic process . While it may seem complex and expensive , the overall goal is to save your business money by employing the right skills and technologies to reduce the risk of cyber incidents . <p> Cyber security is a lot like staying healthy " its much cheaper to prevent illnesses through living well than to cure them . Some people assume they wo n't get sick and some companies assume they wont be the next victim . This attitude does n't  help , because when it does happen , the effects are devastating . <p> Keep your company healthy and invest in the appropriate preventative measures .

@@22227352 @2227352/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> This article is Part 4 of our series on Internet Programming . See the Introduction and Part 1 , Introduction to HTML . This article covers logical comparisons , making decisions with if , comparing text , while and for loops , and debugging hints . /RAW RAW <h> 4.1 Making Comparisons <p> In the last session when we used the " = " operator it was for assignment to store a value in a variable . It did not ask the question as to whether the variable already has that value . Asking questions about the contents of variables or the results of calculations is called making a comparison . Perl has lots of operators specially designed for allowing you to make comparisons you will recognize many of them : <p> $x == $y <p> Is $x numerically EQUAL to $y ? We need the double == here to differentiate from the singe = which would mean store the value of $y in $x . <p> $x ! = $y <p> Is $x numerically NOT EQUAL to $y ? <p> $x &lt; $y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &lt;= $y <p> Is $x numerically LESS THAN or EQUAL to $y ? <p> $x &gt; $y <p> Is $x numerically GREATER THAN $y ? <p> $x &gt;= $y <p> Is $x numerically GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO $y ? <p> question1 &amp;&amp; question2 <p> Are the answers to BOTH question1 AND question2 true ? <p> question1 question2 <p> Is the answer to EITHER question1 OR question2 true ? <p> ! question1 <p> Is the answer to question1 NOT true ( i.e. is it false ) ? <p> In the above table , the variables $x and $y can be ANY variable , number or expression that evaluates to a number ; question1 and question2 can be any expression containing one of the above comparison operators . For example , to see if the average of 2 numbers , $x and $y , is less than 25 , you could use <p> ( $x + $y ) /2 &lt; 25 <p> This evaluates to TRUE if it is the case and FALSE if it is not the case . Now , in Perl , false means " zero " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you print this <p> print ( ( $x + $y ) /2 &lt; 25 ) ; <p> It will not print the words true of false , but some number indicative of the truth or falsity . Just like there is an order of operations when performing mathematical operations like addition and multiplication , the order of operations extends to comparisons . The order of operations for all the symbols that you know so far is : <p> If you want to calculate something that requires violating the order of operations , then you have to use parenthesis . I.e. say you want to be sure that $x or $y is greater than zero and $x or $y is less than ten . You could write <p> $x &gt; 0 $y &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; $x &lt; 10 $y &lt; 10 <p> However , because AND has higher priority than OR , this expression is true if 1. $x &gt; 0 , OR 2. $y &gt; 0 AND $x &lt; 10 , OR 3. $y &lt; 10 , which is NOT what we intended . To get what we intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operations : <p> ( $x &gt; 0 $y &gt; 0 ) &amp;&amp; ( $x &lt; 10 $y &lt; 10 ) <h> 4.2 Using Comparisons to Make Decisions <p> Comparisons by themselves are not very useful unless we can act on the results ! Like most programming languages , Perl comes with a way of performing different actions based on the results of a condition . That is the if statement . An if statement takes the form : <p> if ( condition ) statements ; <p> Inside the parenthesis , you place one of the comparisons we just learned about or join multiple comparisons together with the operators for OR and AND . Inside the curly brackets , you can place one or more Perl statements of any type . A simple example of how this might work is the following : <p> The elsif is read " Else , IF " or " Otherwise , If " . If the condition in the first statement is false , then the condition in the next statement is tested . It it is false , we hit the else line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " If all those previous conditions failed , then do this " . You can have as many elsif statements as you want in a row ( or none ) following the first if . You do n't  have to have anelse statement at the end , but if you do , you can only have one of them . We could have implemented our earlier example with an else : <p> If one of the blocks of statements in the if .. elsifelse are executed , then you may wonder what happens when the last statement in the block is over . At that time , the program continues with the next line after the if .. elsifelse statements . In both cases above , no matter what the user enters , he gets some single message as to how close his guess was , then he ( or she ) gets told to " Try Again " . <p> Debugging Help : <p> Be sure to use curly brackets , and that if you have a left curly bracket , that you include the right curly bracket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though they look alike if you are far from the screen . <p> " Else If " is the statement " elsif " and NOT " elseif " . You can say " else if " but you should n't as there is a subtle difference making the former method better . <p> Case matters : Use all lower case letters for if , elsif , and else . <p> If you do n't  know if you program executed a particular block of Perl statements inside your if , add some extra print statements in there to see . You can always delete them or comment them out later once everything works perfectly . <h> 4.3 Comparing Text <p> Perl allows you to compare text as well as numbers . It has several special operators for comparing text . Some of these are <p> $x eq $y <p> Is $x lexically EQUAL to $y ? <p> $x ne $y <p> Is $x lexically NOT EQUAL to $y ? <p> A lexical ( text ) comparison looks at the individual characters in the text and does not think about numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are numerically equal , but lexically not equal because the second string ( piece of text ) has an extra zero . These operators have the same priority ( in terms of the order of operations ) as the numerical " == " and " ! = " operators described above . <p> Perl will not complain if you try to compare numbers and strings or strings and strings using the numerical comparison operators . It will just convert your string into a number first and then do the comparison . It does this by looking for numbers at the beginning of the string . So , " 55 " and " 55slkdfjh " will both get treated as " 55 " . But " sddkjh55 " will be treated as ZERO since there are no numbers at the beginning . And , " fifty-five " is also treated as " zero " by numerical comparisons ( and mathematical operators ) . So be CAREFUL : <p> In this example the user can answer " Yes " or " yes " or " YES " and it would still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have no way yet to force the user to answer yes or no . To do this we need some kind of loop where we can go back and ask again if they did n't enter a valid answer ... <h> 4.4 Loop the Loop <p> Finally , we can discuss one of the most powerful parts of programming ... making a loop . A loop is a way to specify that some action or actions should be repeated until some condition is met . In Perl , the simplest loop is the while loop , which has the following syntax : <p> while ( condition ) statements ; <p> This looks a lot like the if statement in that IF the condition is true , the statements inside the curly brackets will be executed . It differs from an if in that once the statements are done being executed , the condition is evaluated again . If it is still true , then the statements are executed again , etc. until the statement is false . You can see that if you are not careful to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop could run forever -- an infinite loop . You should avoid infinite loops ! Here is an example of an infinite loop : <p> $x = 1 ; while ( $x == 1 ) print " $x is One ! n " ; <p> Since we never change the value of $x inside the loop , the condition will ALWAYS be true , and this will print " $x is One ! n " until you stop it by pressing Control-C or by turning off your computer or something ! A more realistic example allows you to count from 1 to 10 : <p> $x = 1 ; while ( $x &lt; 11 ) print " $xn " ; $x = $x + 1 ; <p> In this example , we increment $x in each iteration of the loop , so it eventually is no longer less than eleven and the loop ends , having printed the numbers one through ten . <p> Going back to asking the user if he want 's to continue , we can now do this right ... <p> As you can imagine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time : <p> Initialize a variable , i.e. $x = 1 ; <p> Test a condition , i.e. $x &lt; 11 ; <p> Perform some statements <p> Prepare for the next iteration , i.e. $x = $x + 1 ; <p> Perl has another kind of loop called the for loop that simplifies the description of these common actions , its syntax is : <p> for ( initialization ; condition ; final statement ) statements ; <p> Where the 4 standard parts of a loop fit right in , i.e. <p> for ( $x = 1 ; $x &lt; 11 ; $x = $x + 1 ) print " $xn " ; <p> The " $x = 1 ; " is performed first and only once ; the " $x &lt; 11 ; " is checked before each iteration and must be true for the iteration to take place ; " $x = $x + 1 " is performed after each iteration , before the condition is checked . <p> Here is a nice example that computes the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , press Control-C to stop your program <p> If you mean to use == to compare if two things are equal , be sure that you do n't accidently use = . This will perform an assignment , changing the value of your variable and NOT perform any comparison at all . You wo n't get an error , but you will almost certainly get the wrong answer ! <p> Use print statements to help debut -- put them inside your loops so you can watch the loops execute and view how the contents of your variables are changing . <p> Ending Your Loops : When writing loops , it is often very useful exit a loop early , or to go on to the next iteration early . The Perl command " last " exits the current loop and Perl continues execution at the next statement after the loop . The command " next " causes Perl to consider this the last statement in the loop . For for loops , the " preparation " statement is executed and then the condition is tested to see if the loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately proceeds to testing the condition . <p> Related to ending loops is a command for ending your Perl program . If you use the command " exit " , Perl will end your program altogether . <h> 4.5 Your Homework <p> Write a script that asks the user a multiple choice question , reads the user 's input , and then tells him if he is right or wrong . If it was wrong , ask the question again and again until the person gets it right . <p> Write a program that calculates the average of a series of numbers entered by the user . You should use a loop to ask the user for a number ( or to type something like " exit " to stop entering numbers and exit the loop ) . For each number entered , update the a variable containing the sum of all numbers , and a variable containing the total number of numbers entered . Then , when the loop is over , you can divide these two to compute and display the average/ Note - but what if they did not enter ANY numbers ... ?

" <h> 1 . " Opt In " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Electronic Protected Health Information ( ePHI ) and email do n't  mix unless you have a HIPAA-compliant email provider who has signed a Business Associate Agreement with your organization . However , in our experience , most HIPAA-compliant email security is Opt In. - With Opt In email , messages are sent insecurely unless the sender , explicitly- designates that one- needs encryption- ( e.g. checking a box or entering a word such as " secure " in the message subject ) . <p> These Opt In systems are popular because ( a ) messages are HIPAA-compliant when encryption is chosen , and ( b ) when not sending ePHI , it is " email as usual . " - People are not required to change or think about it they just use email as they always have . <p> This is the fatal flaw with Opt In systems . - If the sender simply " forgets " ( or does n't  think , or maybe ca n't be bothered ) to enable encryption , then the ePHI-laden message is sent insecurely in breach of HIPAA. - This happens all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to a person to choose for every message whether encryption is needed , it is guaranteed that sometimes the wrong choice will be made or the person will forget to choose ePHI will go out insecurely in breach of HIPAA. - Its human nature . <p> Even data loss prevention systems , which automatically encrypt when a message has specific words , phrases , or patterns , - are imperfect and can not be relied on to catch all messages with ePHI . <p> The risk of using Opt In encryption is simply too great . - It is much better to either encrypt everything that is sent from an email address that sends or receives ePHI ( e.g. have one email addresses for sensitive material and another separate one for regular correspondence ) or to employ an Opt Out mechanism. - With Opt Out , all messages go securely unless the sender explicitly indicates that the message does not contain ePHI . <p> When it is up to the sender to explicitly choose if a message is allowed to be insecure , it is very much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The senders are automatically accountable for the security , or lack thereof , of messages sent . <p> Opt Out encryption prevents breaches through inaction and creates accountability on the part of the sender . <h> 2 . Sending Text Messages <p> Medical professionals ( e.g. doctors , nurses , psychologists , therapists , dentists , etc. ) frequently text each other and even text patients ( e.g. for scheduling appointments ) . - Texting is- easy and patients like to communicate via text . - However , many of these text messages ( even scheduling ones ) contain ePHI . Sending them using your regular phone texting system is in violation of HIPAA. - This has to stop . <p> It would seem that many people do not yet realize that texting falls under the same HIPAA security rules as does email and that sending regular texts can not be compliant ( For details , see : Can text messaging be HIPAA-compliant ? ) . - Continuing to send ePHI over text constitutes willful neglect of HIPAA and can result in the largest of fines . <p> Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to use a- HIPAA-compliant SecureChat application for your mobile devices . - This must provide , among other things , strong encryption , audit trails , archival , and a Business Associate Agreement . <h> 3 . Email and Text Appointment Notifications <p> If your office sends email or text messages that indicate a patient has an doctors appointment , this is almost always ePHI. - Appointment confirmations are ePHI because they indicate that a particular person ( i.e. this is " identifiable " via the patients email address , name , or phone number ) has an appointment with a specific health care provider ( i.e. gives information about the " future provisioning of health care " ) . <h> 4 . Insecure Web Intake Forms <p> Every day we find medical web sites that have web forms for " getting more information " for general intake and for other purposes . - These form pages are not often encrypted and the form submissions themselves are not processed in a compliant manner . They are often- insecurely emailed to an administrative assistant for processing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. identifiable medical information about an individual ) , then your web site is required to handle that information with care commensurate with HIPAA standards . <p> Check out your web site and see what forms you have there , what they collect , and how the information is handled . - You may need to update your site to secure your form pages with TLS and to incorporate a secure form processing solution to properly deliver that sensitive data to you . - Without this , every form submission may be in breach . <h> 5 . Sharing a Login <p> Sharing logins and email addresses is easy and cheap . Everyone just knows the shared login and password and logs into the same system . - HIPAA , however , requires unique logins for everyone in an organization . HIPAA also requires auditing to indicate- when people do what ( e.g. who logged in when ? ) . - When you are sharing a login , you lose accountability and that can be a direct- violation of your HIPAA requirements . <p> Are you sharing logins ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its worth it . - In many cases , there are ways to achieve the same results and still have- unique logins for everyone . <h> 6 . No Risk Assessments or Training ? <p> This is the situation- in many smaller organizations : <p> Employees are not trained- on HIPAA , how to do their jobs in a compliant way , and how to deal with and report breaches . <p> Yearly Risk Assessments are not performed , - resulting in- no action being- taken- to mitigate the risk of breach . <p> These requirements apply even if you are the only person in your business ( e.g. a sole practitioner ) . - In this case , you are the the " HIPAA Compliance Officer " , you must be sure that you are trained on HIPAA , and you must perform your Risk Analysis , and you must be sure that all ePHI under your purview is safe . <p> If you are neglecting these basics and something goes wrong , your HIPAA fines will be much larger due to apparent " willful neglect " . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed Risk Assessment to see where you stand. - Then start mitigating your risks , training your employees , putting policies into place , and working continuously to minimize the possibility of data leakage . - HIPAA-compliance is an- ongoing process as the security landscape and your business processes and vendors change over time . <h> 7 . I Took Care of HIPAA Last Year <p> Smaller companies , especially , tend to make a push to become " HIPAA compliant " and then " forget it , " assuming that they are " all set . " - They have limited resources and would rather devote as little time and thought to HIPAA as possible ; that is completely understandable from a business point of view . However , HIPAA mandates yearly reviews of your policies and risk. - You need to be updating your and your employees training and your organizations policies yearly . There are even some things that you may need to be doing on a quarterly basis. - Keep a calendar and make sure that you are devoting the appropriate time and resources to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have To ? <p> While this may seem very intimidating , especially if you have limited resources , getting started and addressing your HIPAA requirements and the concerns presented here will pay off in the long run. - Low hanging fruit is easily and cheaply dealt with. - Simply knowing where you are at risk , in many cases , goes a long way towards enabling you to mitigate that risk through changes in behavior , vendor , or policy. - The fact that you are working on it , know where you stand , and are taking steps to improve ( however fast or slowly based on the resources at hand and the degree of risk ) can also goes a long way toward turning breaches due to " willful negligence " - to much less expensive fines if something goes wrong . <p> Finally , there are many companies whose focus is on helping you meet your HIPAA compliance requirements. - From performing a Risk Analysis , to writing internal policy documents , to outsourcing your email , web , and text messaging services. - Getting help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workload , reduces the burden of knowledge and expertise on you , and ensures that your needs are taken care of by specialists .

In order to read the messages , you would need to download them from the archives and load them into an email program that can decrypt the PGP or S/MIME encryption . <h> Other Considerations <p> Can I use SecureLine Escrow instead of PGP or S/MIME for my sent email ? <p> Yes , you can do this by following the same steps as above with the exception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - This will send the messages via Escrow ( where all messages are individually PGP-encrypted and saved in a secured database ) . - If you choose to do this , we recommend : <p> Update your preferences so that messages saved in escrow do not expire for a long time .. e.g. 1 year or 10 years . - The default is 30 days , after which the messages are deleted . <p> Configure SecureLine to use " SecureLine SecureSend Login " for message authentication instead of " Question and Answer " as it will give you a more consistent and more easily managed login to accessing these messages ( this is the default setting for accounts ) . <p> Use Premium Private Labeling with Message Center so that you can view and access any or all of the messages saved for you in Escrow from the SecureSend web portal . - Without this , you can not actually open any Escrow message without the corresponding " notification " email ( as that contains the passphrase to decrypt that single message ) . - This is slightly less secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cases where messages might be saved insecurely ? <p> If you save a message as a " Draft " ( or have auto-save Drafts enabled ) , then these " Draft " copies will be saved insecurely to your online " Drafts " folder . - We recommend disabling auto-saving of drafts if you are concerned about that . <p> Your email program may also auto-save drafts , check its particular settings in that regard . <p> When messages are received by LuxScis servers and processed for encryption , it is possible that very short lived unencrypted temporary files may be created ( in a space that is never backed up for good reason ) . - The only way to avoid this is to have the messages pre-encrypted in your email program , as discussed above . <p> When you open an encrypted message in LuxSci WebMail the decrypted version of that message will be temporarily cached in a secured database so that WebMail can efficiently allow you to view it . - The only way to avoid this is to only use an email program to download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - What about your backups ? <p> LuxScis backups are snapshots of you email folder contents . - If a message is encrypted in your folder , then it is encrypted in all of our backups . <p> Can LuxSci operations staff access these encrypted messages ? <p> LuxSci operations staff do have access to the raw contents of your email folders and even to your PGP and S/MIME keys if you have them uploaded in your LuxSci profile for use in WebMail. - However : <p> It is not possible for them to decrypt your PGP or S/MIME encrypted messages unless you give them the password to your certificate or unless you have that escrowed with us for safe keeping ( e.g. in case you forget it ) . <p> It is not possible for them to decrypt SecureLine Escrow messages unless either ( a ) you provide them with the emailed notice that there is a message waiting in Escrow , or unless the " Message Center " of Premium Private Labeling is enabled which makes it easier for the end users to access their Escrow messages ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about any kind of access , even that of LuxSci staff , you should : <p> Use PGP or S/MIME in your email program and not through LuxSci SecureLine , or <p> Use SecureLine with PGP or S/MIME but do not " Escrow " your certificate passwords with us so we cant access any encrypted messages , or

The proposed rule would subject business associates to many of the same standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that apply to covered entities under the Security Rule and to some of the same standards and implementation specifications , and to the same penalties , that apply to covered entities under the Privacy Rule . Additionally , business associates would also be required to obtain satisfactory assurances in the form of a business associate agreement from subcontractors of any protected health information in their possession . If the business associate learns of a pattern of activity or practice of a subcontractor that constitutes a material breach or violation of the contract , the business associate would be required to make reasonable attempts to repair the breach or correct the violation . If unsuccessful , the business associate would be required to terminate the contract , if feasible . In addition , a business associate would be required to furnish any information the Secretary requires to investigate whether the business associate is in compliance with the regulations . In the absence of reliable data to the contrary , we assume that business associates ' compliance with their contracts range from the minimal compliance to avoid contract termination to being fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates depends on the terms of the contract between the covered entity and business associate , and the degree to which a business associate established privacy policies and adopted security measures that comport with the HIPAA Rules . For business associates that have already taken HIPAA-compliant measures to protect the privacy and security of the protected health information in their possession , the proposed rules with their increased penalties would impose limited burden . We assume that business associates in compliance with their contracts would have already designated personnel to be responsible for formulating the organization 's privacy and security policies , performed a risk analysis , and invested in hardware and software to prevent and monitor for internal and external breaches of protected health information . We expect that most business associates make a good-faith effort to follow the terms of their contracts and comply with current security and privacy standards . For those business associates that have not already adopted HIPAA-compliant privacy and security standards for protected health information , the risk of criminal and/or civil monetary penalties may spur them to increase their efforts to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the consequences of failing to meet the privacy and security standards were limited to a business loss in the form of a terminated contract . In the context of the business associate 's overall business , the risk of losing the contract may not be a sufficient incentive to warrant investing in added security or establishing privacy policies potentially at significant expense . There may be other more benign reasons such as ignorance of potential threats or lack of knowledgeable personnel on staff . Regardless of the reason , to avoid the risk of the far more serious penalties in this proposed rule , we expect that business associates and subcontractors that have been lax in their complying with the privacy and security standards may now take steps to enhance their security procedures and strengthen their policies for protecting the privacy of the protected health information under their control . 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

I read the " How Can You Tell if an Email Was Transmitted Using TLS Encryption ? " article , and found it very helpful and informative ! I am currently looking into Mail Chimps encryption practices . On their website they advertise " SSL Encryption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , but I 'm wondering : ( 1 ) is it possible to see if an email is SSL-encrypted ( actually SSL , not TLS ) other than by looking at the email headers ? ( 2 ) if an email header does not contain " TLS " or " SSL " , like Hotmails " received " header from the article , does this necessarily mean it was sent unencrypted ? Or is it possible ( or likely ) that hotmail would not record its encryption use ? <p> A majority of companies and hospitals that offer email encryption for HIPAA compliance allow senders to " opt in " to encryption on a message-by-message basis . - E.g. , if the sender " does nothing special " then the email will be sent in the normal/insecure manner of email in general . - If the sender explicitly checks a box or adds some special content to the body or subject of the message , then it will be encrypted and HIPAA compliant . <p> Opt-in encryption is desirable because it is " easy " end users do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bog them down , especially if many of their messages do not contain PHI . - It is " good for usability " and thus easy to sell . <p> However , opt-in encryption is- a very bad idea with the inception of the HIPAA Omnibus rule . - Opt-in encryption imposes a large amount of risk on an organization , which grows exponentially with the size of the- organization . - Organizations are responsible for the mistakes and lapses of their employees ; providing an encryption system where inattention can lead to a breach is something to be very wary of . <p> In the last ten or so years , apps have swept through the world alongside the smartphone boom . Smartphones enabled us to carry miniature computers everywhere we went , so we quickly began to integrate them into our everyday lives . <p> We stopped asking for directions and used the GPS app instead , we checked out the Yelp app when we wanted to find somewhere good to eat , and we kept track of our friends on Facebook from our mobiles . <p> People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has put pressure on many organizations to conduct their services through them . If they do n't  offer an app , they may lose customers to their more tech-savvy competitors . The health industry is no different , so apps have become an essential offering for many organizations . <p> In some industries , developing apps may be relatively straightforward , but those that deal with PHI need to make sure that their app is HIPAA compliant . If your companys app is n't HIPAA compliant , it could result in heavy fines or a breach of patient data , which could seriously harm your businesss finances and its reputation . <p> To make a HIPAA-compliant app , privacy and security need to be consider at each step of development . <p> Technology sure has come a long way . The rise of computers and the internet has meant that we can conduct so much of our lives online . With Wi-Fi or mobile data , you can work on your laptop by the beach , do the weekly shopping on your phone and even find the life partner of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent is voting . <p> It seems like online voting would be a great idea . You could participate in democracy from the comfort of your couch , rather than having to march all the way down to the polling booth . Many believe that it would increase voter turnout as well , resulting in a more engaged democracy . <p> Some countries have dipped their toes in the waters of online voting and Estonia has cannonballed- in , but why do n't  we do it in the US ? While it may seem like a relatively straightforward process , online voting presents a range of technological and security challenges that the US is n't quite ready to deal with . <p> When you consider how important elections are , as well as how willing other nations are to influence elections , it is best to tread cautiously with online voting . After last years attacks on our election , it has become evident just how vulnerable the voting process is . While online voting may certainly be viable in the future , there are several obstacles that we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing the election through the DNC hacks and fake news , we are finally realizing just how open the political process is to manipulation . One aspect that had taken a backseat until recently was how the votes themselves can be tampered with . <p> Over the last month , we have uncovered more and more information about just how severe the hacks were . At this stage , it is confirmed that 39 states had their voter registration databases accessed , although officials assume that attempts were made to break into all 50 . <p> There was at least once incidence of voter data being altered , however it was detected and rectified without any long term damage . Almost 90,000 records were accessed and stolen from Illinois , 90% of which contained details such as drivers license numbers and the last for digits of an individuals Social Security number . <p> Officials are stating that these hacks did n't  influence the results of the election , as no databases were permanently changed . Some have suggested that the only reason the damage was n't worse is because US intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stern warning . <p> Given that another country clearly had the chance to tamper with the voting process , its time to reevaluate our election security . How can we bolster our defenses to prevent further attacks ? First , we need to understand which parts of the system are vulnerable . <p> Protected health information ( PHI ) is heavily regulated under HIPAA , but the exact details can be confusing . The regulations are designed to keep everyones private information safe , but they also put a significant amount of responsibility on businesses . <p> HIPAA regulations apply to just about every aspect of a persons medical information , including their transit , storage and security . Because email is such an important and extensively-used form of communication , HIPAA regulations apply to it as well . <p> Some may think that secure and encrypted email is all you need to keep PHI safe and emails compliant . The reality is that HIPAA email regulations go above and beyond standard secure email . To protect your business , you need to make sure that your email provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep our data safe . Whether its personal or for business , we do n't  want it to be stolen , altered or deleted . From the violation of individual privacy to breaches that cost companies millions to recover from , losing control of data can be damaging in numerous ways . <p> There are many techniques for keeping data safe and any good security policy must combine a range of them . One important piece of the data-security puzzle is full-disk encryption . This encrypts everything on the disk , apart from the master boot record . <p> Encryption allows you to make data unreadable unless someone has the key . With full-disk encryption , the key must be entered when you boot your device in order to access the disk or any of its files .

" - it is a tool that allows you embed one Web page within another Web page . - When you build a form with FormBuilder that form is automatically saved and hosted securely for you and you are provided with the Web site address ( URL ) for that form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert " that hosted form into your WordPress page/post and you are all set . - All FormBuilder features are then also supported : Ink Signatures , file uploads , geolocation , etc . <h> Embedding- a form into WordPress using an iframe <p> Here is your step-by-step guide to embedding your FormBuilder form into WordPress. - This requires some knowledge of HTML , as you need to edit the source view of your post or page . <p> Click on the title of the form that you have built in FormBuilder and which to embed in WordPress . <p> See the " Form Address " provided for you on the Overview tab that you are taken to . - Save that Web site address , we will refer to it as " FORMBUILDERADDRESS " in the following steps . - I.e. it could look similar to LONG ...

( See WordPress and ePHI is that a good idea ? ) . <p> So , what we would recommend here is : <p> Have your WordPress site protected with a TLS certificate ( so your address starts with https : // ) . - This is good to do beyond security , anyway , as it can improve your rankings in Google search . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well vetted , and being updated by the developers . <p> Keep WordPress and your plugins up to date . <p> Consider using a dedicated server for hosting your WordPress site so you would not suffer collateral damage from the security issues of other customers sharing you server .

@@22227373 @2227373/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> The vicious ransomware , Wanacrypt0r 2.0 , may have been halted by the quick actions of a security researcher , but it wont be long before a similar beast comes back with a vengeance . On Friday , the virus tore across the world , affecting more than 75,000 machines in over 74 countries . <p> It affected a range of businesses and organizations , including Fedex , Vodafone Espana , Santander , Portugal Telecom , Telefonica , and the UKs healthcare system , the NHS . Once Wanacrypt0r 2.0 penetrated a system , it locked down files and demanded a ransom payment to have them decrypted . <p> The massive attack has seriously affected operations at a range of companies and has also forced some UK hospitals to divert emergency patients to locations that were unaffected . Although the spread of the attack has been stopped , it does not alleviate the problems for organizations that have already been infected . <p> Microsoft had already released patches for supported versions of their software that closed up the vulnerabilities . Despite this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not run the patch , or were using unsupported versions of Windows . <p> Due to the immense scale of the attack , Microsoft made the rare move to release patches that address the vulnerability in unsupported versions such as Windows XP , Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003 . Organizations need to run these patches if they want to be protected from future forms of the virus , which could turn out to be even more damaging . <h> How Does Wanacrypt0r 2.0 Work ? <p> Wanacrypt0r 2.0 ( also known as WannaCrypt , Wcry , and a range of other similar names ) is a type of ransomware that infiltrates networks , uses a self-replicating payload and then spreads through an SMBv1 exploit known as EternalBlue . This exploit has enabled Wanacrypt0r 2.0 to spread quickly , because it does not require user interaction . It scans IP addresses to find other vulnerable systems which it can infect . <p> Once Wanacrypt0r 2.0 has breached a system , it locks down the files and demands about $300 worth of Bitcoin in exchange for a key to decrypt them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will actually unlock the files , and investigations into the identity of the perpetrators are ongoing . <p> Researchers are n't  yet 100% certain of how the attack infiltrates systems , although spearphishing attacks and network vulnerabilities are likely scenarios . Wanacrypt0r 2.0s means of spreading is highly controversial , because EternalBlue is an exploit that was developed by the NSA and leaked in April by a hacking group known as The Shadow Brokers . This is the largest attack we have seen that uses the NSA tools exposed in the leak . <h> What Systems Are Affected ? <p> The EternalBlue exploit only affects older versions of Windows , however Microsoft had already released a patch that addressed the vulnerability in supported systems . Because of this , only systems that had yet to run these security updates , or that were using unsupported versions such as Windows XP , Windows 8 and Server 2003 have been affected . <p> The rapid spread of this attack shows just how many enterprises are running outdated and vulnerable systems . Scans have revealed that 1.3 million Windows systems are yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates have not seen this ransomware spread through the EternalBlue exploit . <h> How Was the Spread of WanaCrypt0r 2.0 Stopped ? <p> Fortunately , it did n't  take long for a UK-based researcher to figure out a way to stop the rapid spread of the ransomware . The researcher posted a series of tweets under the name Malwaretech , explaining that he registered an obscure domain name contained in the code . This unexpectedly halted the virus , because it activated a hardcoded killswitch . While this killswitch may has stemmed the spread of the virus , it does not help the systems that have already been infected . <h> Can WanaCrypt 2.0 Rise Again ? <p> While this version of the attack was able to be stopped quite quickly and easily , it is trivial for other hackers to rework the code without a killswitch that can halt the attack . If organizations do not run the Microsoft patches , they could easily be struck once again . <p> If your systems were victim to this attack , you may find that you have been locked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can make the $300 Bitcoin payment to the attackers , but there is no guarantee that this will result in the return of your files . In past ransomware attacks , sometimes victims make the payments and never receive the encryption key or hear from the attackers again . <p> There is also the ethical question of whether it is right to give money to criminals , because it only further encourages these types of attacks . Despite this , it is understandable that many companies are willing to pay significant sums of money for the return of valuable data . <p> It is also possible that methods to restore the data without making payments will emerge . This has been seen before in less sophisticated attacks , but it is unlikely in more professional attacks such as Wanacrypt0r 2.0 . Victims are free to wait it out and see whether any workarounds emerge , however the ransom message says that the payment will double after three days and the data will be permanently deleted after seven . <h> How to Stay Safe from Future Attacks that Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how important it is to run up-to-date software . The exploit that enabled the rapid spread of this ransomware only affects older versions of Windows , so those that operate Windows 10 are safe . Microsoft had already released patches for their supported versions around the time of The Shadow Brokers , so those that had already run the updates were also immune . If you use one of these versions and have not yet run the patch , you can download it here . This will prevent hackers from using the EternalBlue exploit to penetrate your systems . <p> If you are running unsupported versions of Windows , it is recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible . Despite the huge levels of risk that come with unsupported versions , there are still many enterprises that are yet to upgrade due to the associated costs and complexities . <p> Fortunately , Microsoft has released patches for Windows XP , Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003 which can prevent the EternalBlue exploit from working . While this may be able to prevent attacks such as Wanacrypt0r 2.0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks . <p> If you can not patch your systems , you need to make sure that outside access to ports 138 , 139 and 445 are blocked . The SMBv1 protocol also needs to be disabled to prevent infection from viruses that work similarly to Wanacrypt0r 2.0 . <p> To protect your files against ransomware , it is recommended that you keep backups in offline storage . This ensures that you have another copy in case you are locked out , meaning that you will not have to pay the ransom to recover your files . <p> Another step you can take to boost your security is to make sure that your staff are adequately trained in social engineering . This is because attacks such as these are frequently delivered via phishing . If your staff know how to recognize and avoid phishing attacks , it can reduce the chances of your systems from becoming infected . <p> The Wanacrypt0r 2.0 attack has been exceptionally widespread and damaging , but it also easily preventable .

This is used to determine your Commission Percentage : <p> Total Monthly Value <p> Commission Percentage <p> $0 $49.99 <p> 5% <p> $50 $499.99 <p> 10% <p> $500 $4999.99 <p> 15% <p> $5000 + <p> 20% <p> Affiliates have the ability to create " Special Offer Codes " . These can be used by the Affiliate to grant some of their Commission Percentage to their referees as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers will receive their normal Commission Percentage minus the granted discount percentage as their effective Commission Percentage for the Customers who used the special offer . <p> Special offer codes can grant up to 10% discount to the new LuxSci customer - even if your Affiliate Commission Percentage is less than 10% . In any case where the customer has a Discount equal or larger than that Affiliate 's Commission Percentage , Affiliate will not receive a commission on that referred customer ( until the Affiliate 's Commission Percentage increases enough ) . <p> Example 1 : You have referred $10,000 in Monthly Value for many LuxSci customers over time . You thus have a 20% Commission Percentage . If one of your referees purchases something for $100 , you would get $20 commission if that item is " Full Commission " or $10 if that item is " Half Commission " . <p> Example 2 : You have referred $10,000 in Monthly Value for many LuxSci customers over time . You thus have a 20% Commission Percentage . You used a Special Offer Code to grant a referee a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 15% effective Commission Percentage for that customer . If that customer purchased something with a retail value of $100 , then the customer pays $95 if the item is Full Commission or $97.50 if it is half commission . You get a commission of 15% of $95 = $14.25 if it is " Full Commission " , or 7.5% of $97.50 = $7.31 if it is " Half Commission " . <p> Example 3 : Affiliate with a 5% Commission Percentage makes a Special Offer code for a customer with a 10% discount . This customer signs up with LuxSci . Affiliate does not get any commission on this referral until the Affiliate 's Commission Percentage becomes 15% or higher . <h> 6 . Methods of Referral <p> Affiliates can receive commissions by referring Customers via Affiliate URLs , Special Offer Codes , by pre-registering the referral opportunity , or by informing LuxSci of the referral . Customers signing up with LuxSci outside of these methods will not generate a referral commission for an Affiliate . <p> 6a . Special Offer Codes : Affiliates may create " Special Offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new LuxSci accounts by visitors who use one of the Affiliate 's valid Special Offer Codes will result in commissions . <p> 6b . Saved Quotes : Affiliates can create custom package configurations on LuxSci 's site and , on the customization page , enter one of their " Special Offer Codes " and then save the configuration as a " Saved Quote " . This produces a link that Affiliates can post on web sites or give to others . Clicking on the link takes the user back to the LuxSci order configuration page with the custom package pre-filled , the special offer code pre-filled , and also sets an Affiliate cookie in the user 's browser . This ensures that the Affiliate will get a commission on the order placed by this user . The user gets exactly what s/he needs and the Affiliate gets the commission . <p> 6c . Signing up by phone : If you or your referee would like to place an order by phone , instead of by using our web site directly , and be sure that your Affiliate account gets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Code " to the sales person on the phone and be sure that they use it when filling out the online order forms for you . Failure to do this may result in the lack of a referral commission . You can also give the sales person a " Saved Quote " link that save a saved special offer code saved in it , or use the " Post Facto " method in these cases . <p> 6d . Affiliate URL : The URL Affiliates promote is " **25;995;TOOLONG " . " CODE " should be replaced by your " Affiliate Code " ( this is given to you in the HTML section of the Affiliate portal ) . This is the " Affiliate URL " . Affiliates can promote any page on the LuxSci web site by modifying their Affiliate URL in a manner described in the Affiliate Portal . Sales resulting from referrals through the " Affiliate URL , " or appropriate modifications thereof , result in commissions . <p> Cookie Placement and Expiration : When someone ( the " visitor " ) clicks on ( or types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is placed on the in the web browser of that person that specifies the " Affiliate Code " of the " Referring Affiliate " . The cookie is set to expire in one year . If the Visitor signs up for a new LuxSci account using the same computer and web browser within 1 year of the time that they last used an " Affiliate URL " ( and if they have not cleared their cookies in the interim ) , LuxSci will detect the cookie and associate the Visitor ( now a " Customer " ) with the Referring Affiliate , so that the Referring Affiliate may get commissions on that Customer . <p> 6e . Opportunities : Affiliates can register their referral opportunities in the LuxSci Affiliate portal . When a customer signs up without a Referral Code or Affiliate Cookie , the LuxSci system compares the customer 's contact information with all registered opportunities and presents the matches to LuxSci . If a match is manually determined to be a good and specific match to your registered opportunity , then the new customer will be automatically linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Opportunities expire 180 days after they have been registered or edited in the Affiliate portal . <p> 6f . Post Facto : If a customer signed up based on your referral but did not use one of the above methods and you can prove that the new account is really based on your referral ( e.g. because the new account says so or because that is documented ) , then LuxSci can associate the new account with your Affiliate account so that you can receive commissions on it . This manual process must be done within 30 days of an account 's sign up with LuxSci . The new customer can not , however , be granted any discounts for being your referral in this situation . <h> 7 . Granting of Commissions <p> Affiliates who refer Customers via one of the methods listed in Section 6 are eligible for commissions on the billing statements for those customers as specified in Sections 2-5 . <p> Commissions on Customer billing statements are only granted to the Affiliate after they have been paid in full by the Customer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individual commissions will not be eligible for payment to the Affiliate until the Customer who generated the commission has been a LuxSci customer for more than 30 days . <p> Referee eligibility : LuxSci reserves the right to revoke commissions for specific referees . Affiliates may not receive commissions for referring their own accounts ( e.g. accounts owned by themselves ) . <p> Exception . LuxSci Affiliate-referred customers that signed up for accounts before March 1st , 2012 , fall under LuxSci 's " old " affiliate program guidelines . The Monthly Value of these referred customers will contribute to the Affiliate 's Total Monthly Value ( e.g. for the determination of the Commission Percentage ) ; however , Affiliate will not receive commissions on these referred customers ( as referral commissions in the old program ended after 1 year and before this improved Affiliate program began on March 1st , 2013 ) . <h> 8 . Payment <p> Payment of commissions can made via check , PayPal , or credit to your LuxSci account ( should you have one ) ; clients can choose their payment method in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Postal Mail once per month . Checks will not be cut unless the credit balance in the Affiliate 's account is greater than or equal to $25 . If the balance is less than $25 , it will roll over to the next month . Payment via check is only available to Affiliates with payment addresses in the United States . <p> Payment via PayPal is available to any Affiliate who specifies a valid PayPal payment email address and is made once per month ; payment will be made if the balance in the Affiliate 's account is greater than $25 . If the balance is less than $25 , it will roll over to the next month . <p> Payment via credit to an active LuxSci account is available to any Affiliate that is also a client of LuxSci and is made once per month ; payment will be made if the balance in the Affiliate 's account is greater that $25 . If the balance is less than $25 , it will roll over to the next month . <h> 9 . Charge Backs and Reversals <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement needs to be canceled , the Affiliate commission for the respective statement will be debited from the Referring Affiliate 's account credit . <p> If the charge back happens after a payment to the Affiliate has been made , it is possible that the balance in the Affiliate 's account could become negative . At the request of LuxSci , the Affiliate is required to remit to LuxSci the amount owed as indicated by the negative balance . Such a balance must be remitted within 15 days of the request or the Affiliate will be considered in default and collection agencies may be contacted . Affiliates are responsible for paying for any resulting collection agency fees . <h> and in our sole discretion , by posting a change notice or a new agreement on this site . Modifications may include , for example , changes in the scope of available referral fees , fee schedules , payment procedures and Program rules . If any modification is unacceptable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Limitation of Liability <p> LuxSci will not be liable for indirect , special or consequential damages , or any loss of revenue paid or payable to you under to this Agreement . <h> 12 . Independent Investigation <p> Affiliates may view complete records of their commissions and referrals by logging into his or her account in the LuxSci Affiliate Portal . <h> 13 . Marketing Materials <p> Affiliates may use graphics , text , and sample promotions provided in the Affiliate Portal to promote LuxSci . Text and graphics that are part of the rest of the LuxSci.com web site or other LuxSci marketing materials may not be used by the Affiliate without the explicit permission of LuxSci. <h> 14 . Improper Marketing <p> Affiliates may not use unsolicited commercial email to promote LuxSci . UCE is defined as mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opted-in ) and with whom the Affiliate has no prior relationship . Any such use may result in the termination of an Affiliate account and forfeiture of any commissions not yet paid . <h> 15 .

@@22227376 @2227376/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> The classical web form is very simple : Customer fills it out and hits submit ; the form submits and is processed ; the data is emailed to the desired recipient . Clean , simple , and easy to implement and secure . Even easier by plugging the form into an existing backend form processor like SecureForm . <p> Time passes and business requirements get more complicated . You need your form data to be handled in increasingly varied and complex ways , automatically . <p> For example : <p> You need an encrypted copy of the data to be stored in your archival system <p> Once archived , the data needs to be re-filled into a PDF and emailed to your sales team for review <p> It also needs to be FTPd securely to your office server to be ingested into your your office CRM system <p> Another example : <p> Your data needs to be submitted and processed as usual <p> Instead of re-directing to a new page when the submission is complete , you need to simply alter the current page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you " ) <p> These examples and complex variations on them can all be readily achieved without much effort by combining the swiss-army-knife features of SecureForm and jQuery . <h> Adding jQuery to your Forms <p> This discussion assumes you are familiar with JavaScript programming and the basics of using jQuery . If you are not , it should be easy to find a web developer who is , as these technologies are ubiquitous on the Internet . <p> Note that the SecureForm " Form Builder " interface is simplified for ease of use and does not readily allow implementation of complex submission pathways as described herein . <p> If you are hosting your own web form on your own web site , you can include jQuery to your page by adding the Google-hosted URL to the HEAD of your web form page : <h> Submitting your form via AJAX <p> Next , you will be configuring your forms to submit the data via AJAX to the SecureForm server . This means that instead of manually submitting the data and then being redirected to a success or error web page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then receive a success or error code back that you can then act upon . There will be no " redirection " of your visitor to a new web page by SecureForm . <p> First , you need to edit your SecureForm configuration to let it know that you will be using AJAX . <p> In the SecureForm configuration area for your form , click on the " Form " menu item in the left menu . Then click on " Edit These Settings " under " Advanced Settings " . Change " Return HTTP Status Codes Only " to " Enabled " . <p> Note that once you do this , your form will no longer redirect to a success page you need to control what happens after your form is submitted using JavaScript . <p> Next , you need to configure your form to call your custom JavaScript function when you wish to submit it . <p> 1 . Add the following to your &lt;form &gt; tag ( so pressing Enter on a text form field does not submit the form in the classical way ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " i 'd " called " myform " ( e.g. " &lt;form id= " myform " &gt; " ) . It also assumes that you know the SecureForm URL to which you should post your forms and replace the example one with your actual one . <p> So far , these changes will cause your form to submit when you press your submit button . But you will not know if it worked or failed as nothing will appear to happen . This is because we have not indicated what to do yet on success ( the " done " function ) or failure . <p> What you do next depends on what complicated logic your forms require and how you want to handle errors . E.g. you could modify your failure function to simply tell your users that the submission failed and ask them to retry . <p> You could also use jQuery to submit the form again to a different SecureForm processing configuration . E.g. if the first one emailed the raw data securely to the archival user and you want a second one that does something completely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can now submit to that second configuration . That configuration should also be configured to return only HTTP status codes :

Any LuxSci customer can use Duo.com to protect their WebMail , as well as their admin access to LuxSci . This all comes at no extra cost . <p> We even use Duos authentication ourselves . Its great for administrative actions both at the server command line and through the web interface . An advanced two-factor authentication system such as Duo.com is excellent for enhancing a systems security . It is a requirement for PCI compliance and can be helpful for HIPAA compliance as well . <p> The new Duo Access service is an innovative way to enforce corporate security policies , helping businesses to drastically cut their risks . Duos Jim Simpson has taken some time out of his schedule to answer some questions for us and discuss the details of their service . <p> What is your name , title , and role at Duo.com ? How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Director of Product Management , and I 've been at Duo 6 years . <p> How and when did Duo.com start ? <p> We have been around since December 2009 , so about 7 years . <p> What is wrong with the typical method of using SMS / text messages for a second factor ? <p> One of the biggest problems is that SMS messages can be intercepted . The simplicity of text messages makes them useful for some types of authentication , but it all depends on the risk profile . At the end of the day , you have to balance risk with ease of use . The decision of whether SMS is secure enough for a given situation is really up to the administrator . <p> Duo.com allows companies to select from many different second factors : SMS , phone , token , mobile app , etc . How do these rank in terms of security ? <p> U2F tokens are the most secure , because they are unphishable . After that would come Duo Push , followed by the other methods . <p> Can you briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a difference for administrators ? <p> Ease of deployment and ease of maintenance are the most critical parts for administrators . - The versatility of Duos granular controls for managing risk between users , devices , and applications is important as well . <p> The need for multiple authentication factors is really a symptom of the security problems involved with passwords . What do you see as the future of passwords and the evolution beyond them ? <p> Authentication technology will continue to evolve to provide stronger attestation that a user - is who they claim to be . It will also get completely out of the way of the user at some stage . - Continuous and passwordless authentication will also come into focus in the next year . <p> At LuxSci , we use our same Duo.com logins to protect access to support-level functionality , to UNIX logins , and to WordPress blogs . What types of devices and applications are integrated with Duo.com ? <p> Duo supports a tremendous number of applications . We recognize that our customers have a diverse product stack , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the cloud . We leverage open protocols to support applications where we do n't  necessarily have a - native integration . You can see all the things we support on our documentation page at http : //duo.com/docs/ . <p> A new service offered by Duo.com is " Duo Access " which allows administrators visibility into the software and configurations of their users desktop and mobile devices . Can you describe how Duo Access works ? <p> Duo Access validates that users are who they say they are . It also ensures that devices match a certain level of security hygiene before it grants access to the applications they need . As - end users access applications , we gain insight into their devices . This allows administrators to set custom security policy on a per-app , per-group , or combined basis , in a way that meets - their overall security profile . <p> Duo Access seems like a significant and unique way to allow corporate security administrators to enforce aspects of device and BYOD security policies . Can you elaborate on this ? What other applications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators the ability to protect their cloud and on-premises - applications , as well as helping to manage the BYOD environment . This gives them the same level of control that they had when everyone worked on site , and used applications inside the building or corporate-issued devices . <p> Compliance laws such as HIPAA put a strong emphasis on access control and logging . How can Duo.com assist companies in meeting their compliance needs ? <p> Duo can be used to meet a variety of compliance requirements . You can read the specifics in - our case studies . <p> Use of Duo.com for two-factor access for up to 10 users is free . This really enables small businesses to upgrade to a strong level of access control at no cost . What does Duo.com pricing look like in general ?

Use of digital signatures requires special software and requires that the end user have this software and the capability to encrypt content . There 's a significant technical and conceptual barrier to the use of digital signatures with website forms . <h> Better than a checkbox ! <p> Many websites ( including LuxSci.com ) use a checkbox to signify agreement . This is technically a legally binding action . However , use of a checkbox is weak , because : <p> It 's hard or impossible to prove exactly who checked the box <p> The checking of a box can technically be forged <p> For these and other reasons , using a checkbox as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places where you need stronger proof of identity ! <p> Case in Point : If someone buys something from you and pays with a credit card , and you do n't have a written signature from them authorizing this , then you have no defense if they " charge back " the money . With their written signature , you can prove who ordered it and stop the charge back . <h> User-friendly and familiar ! <p> An Ink Signature is a box you can put in your Web form where your user can sign his/her name by : <p> Drawing it with a mouse <p> Drawing it with a stylus and a drawing pad <p> Drawing it with a finger or stylus on an iPad , iPhone , or Android-based device . <p> When the writer submits the form , you get this signature as a digital image . <h> Compatibility <p> This old version of Internet Explorer does not support the HTML5 " canvas " object needed for this feature .

Text messaging is a " store and forward " technology ( kind of like email ) that depends on various cellular carriers and their networks . - As such , individual messages are not- guaranteed- to arrive at their destinations . <p> Most cellular carriers provide " email to SMS " gateways that allow email messages sent to certain addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients mobile device . <h> Why are text messages faster than email ? <p> Text messages are generally faster than email messages for several reasons : <p> Text messages are all very short ( 160 characters or less with very little " extra metadata " like email headers ) . - As such , it is very easy for servers to process them . <p> There is very little text message spam and no text viruses . - As a result , the servers processing text messages do not have to perform a lot of extra work scanning messages . <p> Good capacity . The big mobile providers ensure that the servers supporting their text messaging services have- plenty- of capacity to support all of the normal demand and without spamming and other attacks common to email , this demand is much more uniform and predictable . <p> Push delivery . Text messages are " pushed " to the recipients mobile device so that they are notified of the message as soon as it arrives . - In many cases with email , recipients may not be notified of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrives ( depending upon the email system and technology used ) . <h> So , then why are they not always delivered right away ? <p> Generally , all of these considerations results in very fast delivery . - However , there are things that can result in delays in message delivery ( not to mention lost messages ) : <p> Poor sender signal . If the senders cellular device has a " poor signal " , then text message may be delayed in sending , or not sent at all . <p> Recipient phone off . If the recipients phone is off or disconnected from the network , the text message will not be delivered until it is back on and online . - I.e. think of airplane travel <p> Poor recipient signal . If the recipients cellular signal is poor , then the text message might not be able to make it through and it could be delayed until sometime after the signal is better . <p> Message Queued . Just like email , if the text message can not be delivered to the recipients phone , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - When it is retried , how often , and for how long , all depend on the cellular service . - So , even if the recipient loses signal only for a few seconds , that could cause a text message to be undeliverable and queued , and not delivered until some unspecified time in the future . <p> Email to SMS Gateway . When using email to send a text message , the message has to travel through some email servers ( the senders and the SMS email gateway servers of the recipients cellular provider ) for the first leg of the delivery trip . - The use of email itself can cause some delay , as email is not- instantaneous . - Of course , if the senders mail servers are very reliable , then this may not be a significant factor . <p> Emergency ! In the case of some significant emergency ( like a natural disaster ) , everyone may be using cell phones and texting. - This abnormally large usage puts quite a strain on all cellular service providers and can also result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , are text messages good for notifications ? <p> Yes , text messages are a good vehicle for receiving notifications , in general , as long as you have a good signal . - They may be better than email in some cases to differentiate the notices from normal messages , and so that you get alerted right away by the text ( without needing to be alerted right away about all of your other email ) . 
@@22227393 @2227393/ <p> An email server , however , does lots of different things in addition to sending outbound email . It may allow checking of email via POP or IMAP , or checking your address book using LDAP , or other things . So , when your email program connects to the server it has to specify what it wants to do ( i.e. send an email ) . It does this by connecting to a numbered " port " on the server . Port number " 25 " is the Internet standard for " regular outbound email " . <p> However , because port 25 is standard for outbound email , many ISPs , wifi networks , hotels , airports , and other locations that provide Internet access will arbitrarily block any connections to servers ( except perhaps their own ) on port 25 in order to stop spammers from using their services for the sending of spam , viruses , or malware and to prevent their IP addresses from being black listed . <p> So , if you try to configure your email program and can check your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working well until you checked into some hotel , you are probably the victim of dreaded " port 25 blocking " . This can suddenly happen without notice even on your home ISP where everything has been sailing smoothly for years . We see it every day . <h> Avoiding Port 25 Blocking with Alternate Ports <p> Some service providers allow you to use alternate SMTP ports ( e.g. ones other than 25 ) for sending email to get around blocks on using port 25 itself . For example , port 587 is a pretty standard port used for " submission of new email messages for outbound delivery " . <p> The problem with using another " standard port " like 587 is that its can also be blocked by many places that want to clamp down on outbound email traffic ( like corporate firewalls and ISPs ) . <p> To resolve the port problem , LuxSci provides a number of standard and non-standard ports for outbound email sending . These ports have various properties and pros and cons . However , when our customers experience a problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually solves the problem . <p> *While port 80 is open on most firewalls , any that perform HTTP proxying and scanning will not permit SMTP traffic ( i.e. email traffic ) over that port . <h> Why So Many Ports ? <p> We provide 6 different ports because : <p> Some email clients can only connect securely on alternate ports via TLS or SSL . As you can not support both TLS and SSL on the same port ( why ? ) , you need different alternate ports for each type of encryption . <p> We like to offer standard and non-standard versions of the ports <p> We have special ports in the 6000 range for performing outbound email processing , such as anonymization , encryption , and email archival . These ports are generally open on all firewalls and at least one of them is supported by all major email programs . <p> Microsoft Outlook 2010 to connect to LuxSci using Secure IMAP and Secure SMTP ( using SSL ) on an alternate port . - For more assistance , please see the Outlook 2010 section of our email program setup

You have doctors Joe and Emily whose email addresses are **26;1022;TOOLONG and **28;1050;TOOLONG - The migration is not complete or you need to migrate over time for some reason so Joe needs to still get his email at Company X , but Emily is all moved and needs to get her email at LuxSci.com. - This is " Split Domain Routing " some email going one place , some going elsewhere . <h> Why Split Domain Routing is Not Simple <p> To understand how SDR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and understand how email routing and delivery works in the first place . <p> Each domain has " DNS Records " which are published on the Internet and are used to tell the world things such as what Internet address your web site is located at and what email servers receive inbound email for your domain . - See Understanding Domain Name Service ( DNS ) to learn more about this . <p> Part of these DNS records are Mail Exchange ( MX ) records . - These specify the email servers where your inbound email should be delivered . - You can have more than one MX record but generally they are all at the same provider and multiple definitions are used only for redundancy . <p> As all email for all users in your domain is delivered to the servers defined in your MX records without respect for WHO the email is destined for , you can not enable Split Domain Routing via any kind of special DNS settings . - Instead , you have to pick one of the companies and have ALL of your email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of email to some folks needs to happen via special rules at one of your email service providers . <h> A Recipe for Split Domain Routing <p> Let 's take the scenario where my-doctors-on-call.com is migrating from provider X to LuxSci.com and needs SDR to get email for some users at LuxSci.com before the transition is complete . - Clearly , once the migration is complete , the DNS MX records for- my-doctors-on-call.com will be updated to point to LuxScis MX records and SDR will be no longer needed . - However , before that , they need a protracted migration period for business reasons and require SDR . <p> LuxSci.com will setup a " subdomain " called " **26;1080;TOOLONG " on its email system and configure it as a " domain alias " whereby any email that arrives for " **32;1108;TOOLONG " is merely delivered on LuxSci to **28;1142;TOOLONG " . <p> DNS MX records for **26;1172;TOOLONG will be created and these will point to LuxScis inbound email servers . <p> The customer will create email forwarding rules in company X so that any inbound email messages that arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email at LuxSci.com now are forwarded to those users addresses **27;1200;TOOLONG - For example , - the customer would create a rule so that email to **28;1229;TOOLONG is forwarded to **32;1259;TOOLONG <p> As more users are migrated to LuxSci.com and ready to use email there , similar forwarding rules are created . <p> Once everyone is migrated to LuxSci.com , the DNS MX records for- my-doctors-on-call.com itself can be updated so that email is delivered directly to LuxSci.com , the subdomain can be deleted , and the account with provider X can be closed . <p> Here is how this works : <p> All email for- @my-doctors-on-call.com arrives at Company X <p> Email for selected users is forwarded to addresses **27;1293;TOOLONG <p> The DNS MX records direct that email to LuxSci.com . <p> LuxSci.com recognizes these and- delivers- them locally to the respective LuxSci users- @smy-doctors-on-call.com <p> This results in effective Split Domain Routing , where you can control exactly what addresses receive email at which providers . <h> What are the requirements for Split Domain Routing to Work ? <p> You must be able to make MX records for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this but some are so dumbed down that this is not possible . If you have that kind of provider , maybe its time to change . <p> Your current provider must allow you to forward email messages most providers allow this . <p> Your target provider must support subdomains which can work as " aliases " so that email to addresses in the subdomain can be delivered locally to the actual users in the main domain . - LuxSci.com supports this , as do some other providers . <h> Are there any down sides to Split Domain Routing ? <p> Clearly , adding SDR to your system adds complexity and should generally only be used as a temporary measure or in special situations . - Here are some issues that could crop up that you should be aware of when deciding whether to use SDR : <p> Email to users at the target provider have a longer way to go . - They must be delivered to the first provider and then forwarded and delivered to the second provider . - They may pass through multiple spam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , but it could cause delays or delivery issues for some users that are not present for other , non-forwarded - users . <p> Email sent from users at the target company to users still at the old company may be delivered to the wrong place , depending on how the target company routes email ( e.g. do they automatically deliver the email to themselves or do they obey your DNS MX records ) ? - At LuxSci , this is not a problem as LuxSci delivers to your MX records and not locally but it may be an issue with other companies . <h> What are other uses for Split Domain Routing ? <p> There are many more applications for SDR than just migration to a new provider . - These include : <p> Split Environment . <p> If some users require " Exchange " and some require a different kind of service ( like HIPAA complaint email ) , you could use SDR to separate the Exchange users from the HIPAA users at a different provider . - In this case , you would want the email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses forwarded ( over SMTP TLS ) to the exchange provider . <p> Backup Environment . <p> A slight twist to Split Domain Routing is when you forward ALL email for all users to the second provider but also allow these emails to be delivered to your primary provider . - This causes a " fork " in your email flow where all of your email goes to two places . - This can be useful as if the primary provider goes down , you can just login to the secondary provider and get all of your email and send email ( and receive email if you update your MX records ) . <p> Have a shared email account in our basic environment that receives copies of their emails in this way so that if the premium environment were ever offline , they could still access all their email though our geographically separate basic environment .

The Introduction to Programming covers basic programming concepts and teaches the reader to develop " pseudo-code " for various tasks . /RAW <h> 2.1 What is a Program ? <p> So , you have never written a program , do n't  know what a programming language is , and have not a clue where to start ? Great this lesson is just for you ! <p> A program is a sequence of commands that a computer executes in order to perform some actions , be it the calculation of the number of calories in your lunch or the trajectory the space shuttle will follow on its re-entry to Earth from space . The sequence of commands can be as short as just 1 command or as complex as you can imagine ( millions of commands , or more ) . It is the job of the programmer to create and test the commands that will perform some predefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> A programming language is a language in which you can specify the commands in a program . Just like there are innumerable ways to say " Hello " in the spoken languages of the world , there are innumerable ways to make a computer say " Hello " , depending on what programming language you use . Different computer programming languages have different pros and cons to their use . Some are only available on certain operating systems ( i.e. Visual Basic only works on Microsoft Windows ) , some are very complex ( like C++ or Java ) , some are simple ( Basic ) , and some are designed for specific tasks like mathematics ( Fortran ) . It is partially up to the programmer to choose the appropriate language for his or her program . In this class we will be teaching your Perl . We will discuss Perl and its particular pros and cons in the next lesson . <p> So where do you begin ? You can prepare for writing computer programs before you even learn your first programming language ! You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to accomplish some specific task using pseudo-code , plain English statements describing what to do . In this lesson , we will teach you how to write pseudo-code along with many of the basic concepts behind computer programming languages . <h> 2.2 Basic Programming Concepts <p> Statements : A statement is the simplest concept in a programming language . A statement is merely a single command to perform a single well-defined task . For example , " Stop the car " , and " leave the house " are single statements describing single well-defined tasks . Note that even seemingly simple statements can often be broken down into many simpler statements . " Stop the car " could be broken down in to steps such as " Apply the brakes " , " Downshift " , " pull over to the curb " , and " Apply the parking brake " . <p> The number of steps you should supply and the level of detail you should use for describing their performance will be determined in part by the programming language you use in some languages " Stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hundreds or thousands of statements ! It will also be determined by how specific you wish to be in describing how to perform the action versus how much you want to leave up to the people who take your pseudo-code and write a program based upon it . <p> Variables : Statements only get you so far without additional concepts . Variables are perhaps the most ubiquitous entity in any programming language . You can think of a variable as a box in which you can store something a number , a date , someones name , the price of a sweater , the number of people in your immediate family , the current speed at which your car is traveling , etc . The beauty of a variable is that you can store information in it and retrieve information from it any time you want ! <p> Each variable " box " has a name . You refer to the different variables that you are using by their names . You can choose pretty much any name you wish , but it is advised to choose names that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With variables , you can start having more interesting statements and start having the computer perform mathematics . The following is example pseudo-code for calculating the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle . <p> Example 2.2.1 : Pseudo Code For Length of the Hypotenuse <p> 1 . Ask the user for the length of leg 1 of the triangle 2 . Store his answer in variable named " leg1 " 3 . Ask the user for the length of leg 2 of the triangle 4 . Store his answer in variable named " leg2 " 5 . Calculate the sum of the value in " leg1 " squared plus the value in " leg2 " squared ( leg1 ** 2 + leg2 ** 2 ) 6 . Take the square root of the result 7 . Store the result in variable named " hypotenuse " 8 . Tell the user that " The hypotenuse has the length of " 9 . Tell the user the value stored in the variable " hypotenuse " . <p> You see with this first example of pseudo-code how you can specify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without regard to any specific programming language . The assumption made in our example is that actions like " Ask the user for something " and " Calculate something " are simple enough that they require no further details . In truth , it will be your knowledge of the programming languages that the program may be written in , and the people who will be writing the code , that determine the level of detail that you need . For now , just follow your intuition . <p> Logic : One thing that computers do REALLY well is obey the rules of logic . In particular , they are really good at doing calculations and comparisons . For example " 5 is less than 3 " is a false statement , " A Ford Escort is a VW Jetta " is a false statement , and " 2 + 2 = 4 " is a true statement , are all straight-forward logical conclusions . " Yellow is a nice happy color " is not something that can be determined logically unless you have already specified what makes a color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when a variable is involved , allows you to determine the truth or falsity of all kinds of things . This is known as " Boolean logic " as the result is the 2-valued truth or falsity of the statement . <p> Conditionals : Well , since we can determine if comparison is true or false , it would be nice if we could act on this information . This is where a conditional comes in . Consider the example of driving " If the stoplight is red then stop the car " . This uses a little logic ( is the stoplight red or not ? ) or determine whether or not we should stop the car . As you can imagine , we use these types of rules all the time in everyday life without ever realizing it ! They are used all the time in computer programs too . Let 's consider another mathematical example , computing the result of dividing one number into another <p> Example 2.2.2 : Pseudo Code For Dividing 2 Numbers <p> 1 . Ask the user for the first number 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Ask the user for the second number 4 . Store his answer in variable named " Y " 5 . If the contents of " Y " are zero then 5.1 Tell the user that he ca n't divide by zero 5.2 Exit the program 6 . Calculate the X divided by Y. 7 . Store the result in a variable named " Z " 8 . Tell the user the value stored in the variable " Z " . <p> The trick here is that we use a conditional to check to be sure that the user provided us with valid number . Since you can not divide by zero , we have to be sure that we do n't  try and that well inform the user of the error . <p> Conditionals can contain more complicated logical statements and can be chained , for example , if you are driving your car <p> Example 2.2.2 : Driving <p> 1 . If the car is moving and the road turns to the left , then 1.1 Steer to the left until the road is straight again 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road turns to the right , then 2.1 Steer to the right until the road is straight again 3 . Otherwise , keep going straight <p> Obviously , you could make these instructions arbitrarily complicated , but even this much shows us how you can chain " ifs " together so that if the first rule does n't  happen , then you can consider the second , and so on , until all the rules fail when you can perform some default action ( " keep going straight " ) . It also shows you how you can have compound logical statements " the car is moving AND the road turns right " . These are two separate statements that must both be true in order for the rule to take effect . You will often see multiple logical statements joined together with words like " and " and " or " . <h> 2.3 Looping and Functions <p> Looping : Many times in your daily life , you repeatedly do the same action . For example , when washing dishes by hand , you " grab a dirty dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and repeat until there are no more dirty dishes to wash . " This is a kind of " loop " . <p> Loops are essential in many programs , too . There are two general types of loops those where the condition is tested first , and those where the condition is tested last . In our dishes example above , the condition is tested last " repeat until there are no more dirty dishes " in other words , it assumes that there is at least 1 dirty dish since the first thing we do is grab one ! This loop could be re-phrased with the condition first : " while there are dirty dishes , grab a dirty dish , wash it , put it in the drying rack , and repeat " . This accomplishes the same task , but it also works if there are NO dirty dishes . For us humans , it would n't matter if there are no dirty dishes , we are not going to try to grab one ( note the if statement there we do that unconsciously all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to , it WILL try to grab that dirty dish , even if there are none left ! This could cause all sorts of problems so you have to be careful to be logical and take into account all the situations that could occur . <p> Another thing you should be careful of with loops is to make sure that they always end ! If a loop never ends , it is called an " infinite loop " and almost always is not what you intended ! If you run a program and it never stops , chances are good that you have an infinite loop somewhere . <p> In the following example , we are going to the grocery store with a list of items . We need to describe a method for shopping . A list is a kind of variable that is like a box with many numbered compartments each compartment behaves like a normal variable . You can refer to the contents of the compartments in your list ( aka the list elements or items ) by their " compartment number " , i.e. item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shopping list " , etc . <p> Example 2.3.1 : Grocery Shopping <p> 1 . Drive to the grocery store 2 . Exit the car 3 . Go up to the grocery store 4 . If the store is open then 4.1 Enter the store 5 . Otherwise , 5.1 Go home 5.2 Stop the program 6 . Enter the grocery store and go to the area where carts are stored 7 . If there is a free cart , get it 8 . Otherwise , 8.1 wait until someone returns one 8.2 get the newly free cart 9 . Let variable " n " be the number of the item in our shopping list that we are currently looking for 10 . Set " n " equal to 1 11. while " n " refers to one of the items in our list , do 11.1 Look at every item in the store until we find a match for grocery list item " n " . 11.2 If we find the item , add it to our cart 11.3 Otherwise , mark our list that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . ( i.e. let 's look for the next item in the list ) 12 . Proceed to the checkout counters 13 . Let " counter " store the number of the checkout counter we will proceed to . 14 . Let " people " be the number of people currently in line at that counter . Set this to " 99999999 " 15 . Let " items " be the number items in our cart . 16 . Count the number of items in the cart and save it in " items " . 17 . For each checkout counter 17.1 Find out the maximum number of items that you can checkout with at that counter , store in " max " . 17.2 If " max " is less than " items " , go to the next counter 17.3 Find out how many people are currently in line , store in " p " . 17.4 If " p " is less than " people " then 17.4.1 Set " counter " equal to the current counter number 17.4.2 Set " people " equal to " p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 . Check out 20 . Take groceries to the car 21 . Drive home 22 . Stop program <p> This example is a good demonstration of the use of all the pseudo-code features we have so far mentioned . As you can see , many of the parts of this example could be extended with more detail , or simplified by suppressing detail . I.e. what do you do if you could n't find ANY items on your list at the store ? <p> Functions : There are often computations or operations that need to be performed at multiple places in your program . Instead of repeating the statements over and over , it is usually better to extract these statements and place them into a " function " or " subroutine " . These are named sets of statements that perform a specific action , like " calculate the average of a list of numbers " or " drive home " . Then , in your program , you can just refer to the function wherever you need to perform its action , simplifying your work . <p> Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list called " height " with enough items for every person in your class . 2 . For each person in your class 2.1 Calculate Person 's Height A Function 2.2 Store the height in the " height " list in an item labeled by that person 's name . 3 . Make a variable " heighttotal " and initialize it to zero . 4 . For each item in the " height " list 4.1 Add the height to variable " totalheight " 5 . Make a variable " heightaverage " 6 . Set " heightaverage " equal to " heighttotal " divided by the number of people in the class 7 . Display the contents of " heightaverage " Function " Calculate Person 's Height " 1 . Stand the person up straight 2 . If the person 's shoes are on , then 2.1 have them take his/her shoes off 3 . Use a yard stick to measure the height in inches 4 . Record the height and return it <p> This example shows a function that performs some set of actions and returns a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you executed the function , you get back anything that it " returns " , in this case , you will know the persons height . <p> Breaking up your programs into functions that perform repeated tasks is a very good thing as it makes your programs smaller , reduces the number of errors you might make , and makes it easy to update and change your program later . Use functions . <p> You will also notice one new concept that we introduced above . We stored the students heights in an array where the items were labeled by the students names and not some number . You can do this in many programming languages ( especially Perl ) . It is technically called a " hash " , but you can just think of it as labeling a list by a name vs a number ; depending on the situation one way may be simpler or more appropriate than the other . <h> 2.4 Your Homework <p> You are a " pollster " . You have a list of questions each with a list of acceptable answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Calling a " poll taker " . Asking all of the questions in your poll . Getting all the responses . Making sure that the responses are acceptable . Recording all the responses . Of course , you need to figure out and describe in detail a good method for doing this in your pseudo-code ! ( I.e. this could be used to train a new pollster how to give a poll to someone over the phone ) . <p> Your pseudo code should convert your common-sense idea of of how to give a poll into instructions . Try to be clear , concise , and logical . <p> You would be graded on how well you implement your ideas in pseudo code and how clear and logical they are . Your should absolutely avoid writing a narrative description of the poll giving process ! <p> The idea behind pseudo code is that you should be able to hand it to anyone and they should be able to write a computer program based on your code that implements your ideas . Hence , you should limit ambiguity where possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations that may occur . /RAW

The domain authorities , like ICANN , define who owns the domain by what is published in WHOIS. - They discount any contracts between you and the registrar. - Whoever is listed in WHOIS is the domain owner . <p> You no longer have any rights unless you sue the registrar . If you are not listed in WHOIS , then you have no legal rights to the domain. - The only way to assert your rights would be to sue the folks listed in WHOIS- and cite whatever contract you have with them in the suit. - This may be difficult if they are in a foreign location or , worse , out of business . <p> If these legal issues were not enough to convince you of the danger of this privacy vehicle , also consider that : <p> Many companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your domain as a means to verify ownership of the domain and legitimacy of requests regarding it. - Having your contact information in WHOIS allows us and others to contact you in case of any shady or uncertain requests regarding your domain. - The information in WHOIS is assumed to be authoritative and the contact there is the ultimate authority as to what should be happening with the domain. - If your WHOIS information is hidden or masked , then there is no longer a viable " ultimate authority " and that actually weakens the security of your domain and the services that utilize it . <p> Of course , any place where you have your domain registered can technically change your WHOIS records on you , lock you out , and then you are stuck with no access and your only recourse is to sue. - That is not likely to happen registrars want repeat business .

Use Two-Factor Authentication <p> Two-Factor authentication protects your account in the case that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your password ( the first " factor " ) you need something else ( such as access to your phone ) in order to successfully login. - Check with your email provider and enable Two-Factor authentication if they provide it . <p> We recommend using Two-Factor authentication whenever possible , including with social medial sites such as facebook- and especially for your email . <h> 2 . Use different passwords for each site <p> If you use the same password for multiple web sites , then the probability of that password being compromised increases dramatically . - Furthermore , if it is compromised , the attacker then has automatic access to all of the places that you use that password . <p> Make sure that the password used for access to your email is different from all of your other passwords. <h> 3 . Use strong passwords <p> Strong passwords are hard to guess . - These days , it is easy for a computer to try millions or 100s of millions of possible passwords in a very short time . - So , if your password is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as " Appl3 " that could be easily discovered . <p> Instead , pick passwords that are easy to remember and which are comprised of multiple words and numbers or symbols . - E.g. " My son loves pizza pies ! " - This is an easy sentence to remember , contains mixed case and a symbol , and would be exceedingly hard for a computer to guess . <h> 4 . How to remember your passwords <p> The biggest barrier to using different , complex passwords for your various email and other web site logins is tracking and remembering them . <p> This is really not such a big deal anymore as there are a myriad of applications for your computer or phone where you can save all of your passwords , securely , in one place where you can get at them when you need them . <p> We recommend using a secure password storage area that is in the " cloud " and which you can access from any computer , anywhere so you are never without access to your passwords and so you can grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. your spouse or for estate planning ) . <h> 5 . Change your passwords frequently <p> Possibly more of a pain than having multiple passwords is changing them . - However , you never really know if a provider has been hacked and your passwords have been compromised until long after the fact . - In the mean time , your password may be " out there . " <p> It is best to change your password periodically , at least for those accounts that are most important ( e.g. your bank , your email , etc. ) - In this way , you protect yourself against someone using an old password to access your account . <p> Many providers allow you to setup schedules that auto-expire your password , so that you are forced to update it periodically ( such as every 3 or 6 months ) . - This is best , as it does not allow you to " skip it " just because you are being busy or lazy . <h> 6 . Enable alerts on failed and/or successful logins <p> What if someone does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best if there were a kind of " trip wire " that would be sprung so that you could detect this access immediately and take action to limit the damage ? <p> Many providers allow you to enable automatic alerts that will send you an email or text message to any address you like , when there is a successful login or when there are failed login attempts . - If you get an alert and see logins that " were not you , " then you can call the company and take action to lock down your account . <h> 7 . Lock down access to your IP or Geographic Location <p> Many attackers that try to login as you or attack your account are coming from foreign countries or regions distant from where you are usually located . - Many email providers provide options where you can lock down access to your email account so that you can only access it from specific computers ( e.g. from your home or work IP addresses ) or from certain regions ( e.g. Massachusetts or USA ) . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain access to your account . <h> 8 . Send sensitive information securely <p> Sensitive information is being sent over the Internet more and more frequently . - Medical records , tax returns , legal documents , divorce agreements , company roadmaps and product plans all contain very sensitive data . <p> Its good to have an option for " Email Encryption " in your tool box so that you can be sure that such messages are secured on demand and to prevent them from being stored or transmitted insecurely- leaving them vulnerable to capture by attackers . <h> 9 . Use good email filtering to protect you from viruses , malware , and scams <p> The vast majority of email is spam . - A substantial fraction of that spam is designed to attack you in some way to infect your computer , convince you to download malware , or trick you into divulging sensitive information or money . <p> A good spam and virus filter can stop most or all of these malicious messages before they reach your inbox. and before you have to waste your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is not ( and that can be very hard ) . <h> 10 . Use good email filtering to protect you from fraud <p> Fraudulent email messages are those purporting to be from one person ( e.g. a friend , co-worker , or family member ) but which are really from a spammer , attacker , or other malicious individual . - Usually this is just a trick to get you to open and read some spam . - Sometimes , it is a trick to get you to trust the message and take some action from sending someone money to opening a door to giving someone a " forgotten password , " etc . <p> Good filters can detect forged email in many cases and protect you from bring tricked by this kind of fraud . - Look for filtering services that include SPF , DKIM , and DMARC filtering technologies . and be sure these are enabled . <h> 11 . Keep email archives <p> Keeping a separate copy of the messages that you have sent and received is a good practice for both businesses and individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted , you may lose a lot of information that is essential to your day-to-day life , business , health , etc. - By having a separate , immutable archive of these messages , you protect yourself from loss ( and you also protect yourself from you . - Who has not accidentally deleted something important ? ) <p> Hacked email messages can also be altered in some cases . - By having a separate archival system designed to prevent the deletion and modification of your email , you always have a " true copy " of all of your messages . - This is essential in any legal situation . <h> 12 . Choose a good email- provider <p> The security of your email is ultimately in the hands of your email provider ; it is up to you to make a good choice . - Consider : <p> Big companies are big targets <p> What is their security stance ? <p> Will they treat your email with the privacy and confidentiality you need ? <p> Do they have features you can use to lock down security for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Can you call them and expect meaningful and timely help ? <p> Think about your current email situation and your risk maybe its time to shore up your email defenses and turn on some security features that you have not yet used . - Maybe its even time to choose a new provider that can better protect you .

@@22227404 @2227404/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> This article is Part 3 of our series on Introduction to Internet Programming series . See the Introduction and Part 1 , Introduction to HTML . The Introduction to Perl covers the basics of Perl , including how to write and debug simple scripts .. <p> Perl is a computer programming language that is very good at manipulating strings , doing pattern matches , and pretty much just about everything else ! It is a relatively slow language compared to compiled languages like C , however it very easy to get programs up and running very quickly in Perl. /RAW RAW <p> Perl stands for " Practical Extraction and Reporting Language " . The why of this is that it was originally designed for analyzing large text files and reporting on the results . Since then everything you could want in a programming language , many things you do n't  want or need , and the kitchen sink have also been added to Perl . In this and the following lessons , we will talk about the basics of using Perl and cover al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced topics like references , object-oriented programming , sockets , threads , etc . We will cover variables , files , basic syntax , subroutines and functions , CGI extensions and some other basic functions . After this course , you should have sufficient fluency in Perl to write basic programs for making interactive web sites and a good springboard for learning more Perl . <p> How do you RUN a Perl Program ? <p> Just like in HTML , you write your Perl program using a text editor and save it to a text file . The file name should ( but does n't  have to ) end in . pl or . prl so that it is clear that this is a Perl program . Then , how you run it depends on if you are using Windows or UNIX . <p> In UNIX , you must make sure that the program is executable . I.e. you may need to type something like " chmod u+x myprogram.pl " to make your myprogram.pl executable . Then , to run it , just type your script name at the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have Perl installed , you can either 1 . double click on your file , or 2. open a command prompt window , change directory to where you saved your Perl program , and then type perl myprogram.pl to run it ( typing this will also work in UNIX ) . <p> On any operating system , there is a quick way to see if your program has any obvious errors before you even run it . At your command prompt , type " perl -cw myprogram.pl " . The -cw tells Perl to compile your program and tell you any errors or warnings that it can think of , without actually executing your program . If it does n't  say " Ok " , then there are problems you need to fix and messages that should help you detect the problem . <h> Scalar Variables <p> Consider the following example <p> Example 3.2.1 : Hello World <p> # ! /usr/bin/perl # My first program ! print " Hello World ! " ; print " n " ; <p> All Perl programs ( that will run in UNIX or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! /usr/bin/perl " . This is the location on the computer where the Perl interpreter in located ( the program that reads YOUR program and executes it ) . The location of Perl on your computer may differ from this , You can usually type " whereis perl " at the UNIX command line to find our where Perl is on your computer . Put the location you find after the " # ! " symbols as the first line of your program . <p> On lines other than the first line , the " # " symbol means " begin a comment " . Everything from this symbol to the end of the line is ignored by Perl ( just like everything between " &lt; ! -- ... --&gt; " demarks a comment in HTML ) . Use comments liberally when programming Perl this is a requirement ! It helps you and anyone reading your program understand what it is supposed to be doing . <p> The next line is the first " statement " in our program , a print statement . Every statement should end in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays its parameters ( everything after theprint ) to the user . In this case , everything between the double quotes is displayed to the user . For most cases , you should use double quotes around the text that you want to display to the user . <p> The last line is also a print statement , but it prints something special , the n " character " . In Perl , this means " newline " ( like &lt;br&gt; in HTML ) . It is usually nice to put such newlines after each line you print , or else all our lines will run together and it wont look nice . <p> This program introduces a new concept , that of the variable . Here we have a variable named myname . We know it is a variable because it is prefixed with the dollar sign , ( " $ " ) . We can store a value in a variable by using the equals sign . In this case we store the name Erik Kangas in the variable . The name is a piece of text . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in quotation marks , in this case , we use double quotes . <p> You can print multiple things all at once , if you separate them with a comma ( think of this as printing a list of things separated by commas ) . We see that when we use $myname in the print statement , the value stored in that variable is retrieved and printed . So , it is EASY to store and retrieve values with variables , use " = " to store , and use the variable in place of text ( or a number as we will see ) and its value will be retrieved . <p> Perl is also like HTML in that Perl does n't  care much how many spaces or line feeds you use . As long as it can be logically deduced what you mean , you can use as few or as many spaces as you want . If you make a mistake , Perl will tell you when you try to run your program . The exception to this is inside the quotation marks every space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text that you want to use . Inside quotation marks , 2 spaces means 2 spaces , period . <p> We can also store numbers in variables . With numbers , the quotation marks are optional . When printing variables , you can put the variableinside the double quotes and it will still retrieve and store its value ! As you can see , this simplifies your print statements . ( Technically , this is called variable interpolation ) . <h> Let 's Do Math ! <p> Perl , like any programming language , has a great facility for allowing you to perform mathematics ! Mathematics is performed using " operators " . There are a lot of operators , none of them are the following . <p> Exponentiation : Binary " ** " is the exponentiation operator . It binds even more tightly than unary minus , so -2**4 is -(2**4) , not ( -2 ) **4 , i.e. 2 to the power 4 ( the negative of it all ) . <p> Unary Minus : The operator " - " returns -1 times the number it is operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 numbers . <p> Division : Binary " / " divides 2 numbers . <p> Modulus : Binary " % " computes the modulus of two numbers . Given integer operands A andB : If B is positive , then A % B isA minus the largest multiple of B that is not greater than A. If B is negative , then A % B is A minus the smallest multiple of B that is not less than A ( i.e. the result will be less than or equal to zero ) . <p> Addition : Binary " + " adds 2 numbers . <p> Subtraction : Binary " - " subtracts 2 numbers . <p> Concatentaion : Binary " . " concatenates 2 strings ( returns one appended to the end of the other ) . This is not really " math " , but this is a good time to bring this one up <p> These operations follow the same order of operations you are used to from algebra . If you want to make sure that you perform a low priority action ( such as addition ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must use parenthesis . The order of operations is , from highest priority , to lowest : <p> Here we see the use of comments and the need to initialize all of your variables before you try to use them ( if you fail to give a variable a value , it will behave as if it had a value of zero in your math ) . We also see how we can use many of the operators to perform a mathematical calculation , store the result in $x1 and print the result . Also , note that you can perform calculation in the middle of trying to print ! Perl performs all calculations before passing the list of things toprint or any other function you may be using . <p> Here we show the necessity of the use of parenthesis if you need to make sure some calculations happen before others . You also see that you can use the same variable on both sides of the equals sign , i.e.$x = $x + 1 does what you would expect , it results in $x becoming larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we can use the string concatenation operator to make bind strings of text out of little ones . <h> User Input <p> The examples above are great , but they suffer from the central problem that you are " hard-coding " the parameters inside the program itself to calculate something different , you need to change the program . It would be much better if we could ask the user for the parameters , so the programs would be much more generally useful ! That 's what we do here . <p> Example 3.4.1 : A Little More Physics Please <p> # ! /usr/bin/perl # We will ask the user for the parameters , so we better # TELL the user what we are doing and what he needs to type , # that 's only fair ! print " The program calculates the vertical position of a projectilen " ; print " That has an initial Y velocity v0 , and which is in the airn " ; print " for t seconds . Please supply values for these parameters : n " ; print " Enter v0 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = &lt;STDIN&gt; ; ## Read a LINE of input from the user chomp($v0) ; ## Delete the n at the end of the line . print " Enter t : " ; ## Note , no n here .... $t = &lt;STDIN&gt; ; ## Read a LINE of input from the user chomp($t) ; ## Delete the n at the end of the line . $g = 9.8 ; ## Gravitational Accel. 9.8 m/s**2 $dy = $v0 * $t - 0.5 * $g * $t ** 2 ; print " The projectile is a position y=$dyn " ; <p> Wow ! Now we have a real program ! When we run this it will be truly interactive and useful ! There are two new concepts here . Assigning a variable from the symbol " &lt;STDIN&gt; " causes Perl to read a line of input from the user . The entire line , including the " Enter " key ( a n ) is then stored in your variable . So , if the user types in " 55.3Enter " , your string will be " 55.3n " . To eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chomp , which eats all n it finds in your string ( note that chomp changes your string in place and does n't  return your string , so you do n't  want " $x = chmop($x) " that would not do the right thing . Stick with " chomp($x) " . ) . Note : STDIN must be in all caps . <p> Use of input in this way is very good for writing Perl programs that you run from the command line , but will bot be useful later when we start getting our input from the Internet . <h> Details , Details <p> Here we talk about details and things to watch our for . <p> Debugging : At this point , finding errors in your programs consists of just running the program and seeing if it works . Here are some tips : <p> If your program is running and you want to stop it , press Control-C , i.e. press both of these keys at the same time . <p> If you are getting errors , first make sure that you have semi-colons , " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then make sure that if you use quotation marks , that you have quotes on BOTH sides of your string . <p> If Perl is complaining about some particular line , there is also a good chance that the error is actual happening on the previous line . <p> Everything in Perl is case sensitive , unlike in HTML . So , $MyVariable is completely DIFFERENT from $myvariable . Same goes for the functions , there is no function Print , onlyprint . <p> Variable names must begin with a letter and can contain only letters , numbers , and the underscore character ( " " ) . They can be of almost any length . The names ARE case sensitive . You can not have any space between the dollar sign prefix to the variable name and the variable name itself . I.e. " $ x " is incorrect . <p> Quotation marks : So far , we have just used double quotes for all text . You can also use single quotes , i.e. " $x = ' Super Duper ! ' " . The difference is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables inside the quotes will not be retrieved , and " n " will not become a linefeed . Instead , these things will be used as-is . I.e. " print ' $x ' ; " will print the two characters dollar sign andx , and not the contents of $x . If you ARE using double quotes and you want to print a dollar sign or a backslash ( " " ) or other special character , you must prefix the special character with a backslash . So , " $x " is the same as ' $x ' . This allows you to mix substitutions and explicit stuff with " The price of $item is $5.50n " . <h> Your Homework <p> Your homework consists of the writing of 2 simple Perl programs : <p> Write a MadLib with at least 8 blanks to fill in . I.e. Think of a paragraph of text , remove 8 or more of the words ( i.e. a noun , a verb , someones name , etc . ) . Prompt the user for each of these 8 words , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action verb " , " Give me the name of a person " , etc . ) . Store these answers in variables , then print out your paragraph to the user with his answers substituted for the words you removed . The result can be very funny , since the user shouldnt know what the paragraph will say ahead of time ! For an example of this , seeJulius Caesar Madlib yours should be completely different . <p> Write a program the calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle . You should ask the user for the lengths of the legs of the triangle before you make the calculation . You will find the functionsqrt useful . This returns the square root of its argument , i.e. " $r = sqrt($x) ; " assigns the square root of $x to$r , and " print sqrt(9) ; " prints 3.

@@22227406 @2227406/ <h> Introduction to Hashes <p> A Perl " hash " is very similar to a Perl list it is a way to store a lot of data in one named variable . The difference is that where as in lists , the " compartments " where you can store your data are numbered 0 , 1 , 2 , etc. , in hashes the compartments each have their own arbitrary name ! The " name " of the compartment is called a key and the information stored in a compartment is called a value . So using hashes is all about storing and retrieving keys and values . <p> Since you are already familiar with lists from Lesson 5 , it is easiest to show you examples of using a hash and explain how it is different from how you would use a list . <p> Creating a hash : You can create a hash using an assignment just like you would create a list , the differences are : <p> The hash variable is prefixed with a percent sign ( " % " ) instead of the at-sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hash is no longer just a list of values , as in the case of a list . Now it is a list of " key , value " pairs . In the example above , we are creating a hash ( called , creatively enough , " hash " ) which contains 4 keys and 4 values . The keys are " name " , " phone " , " state " , and " country " and the respective values are the items in the list immediately after each key . So , you can create a hash explicitly by assigning a list of the form ( key1 , value1 , key2 , value2 , .... ) to you hash variable . <p> Reading and writing hash elements : Just like when using a list , when you read a value from or write a value to a hash , you use the dollar sign ( " $ " ) as the prefix because you are dealing effectively with a normal simple variable . The only differences between accessing lists and hashes is that you replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , with curly brackets containing the name of the key , i.e. " state " . The quotation marks are not always necessary , but it is good practice to use them so you are not surprised when they are necessary . <p> Hashes are just like lists , but with names instead of numbers for the indices . You are responsible for making up these names . The names are case sensitive so $hashState and$hash " State " refer to the values of two completely different and independent hash keys . Use hash elements just like you would use array elements or normal variables . <h> Hash Functions <p> Just like with lists , there are several functions built into Perl that are designed to aid in your use of hashes . Some of these are : <p> keys@listofkeys = keys(%myhash) ; <p> This function returns a list of all the keys being used in your hash . It does not return any of the values , just the keys . Also , you haveno way of knowing what order it will return the keys in . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the values being stored at each key in your hash . It does not return any of the keys , just the values . Also , you haveno way of knowing what order it will return the values in ( except that it will be in the same other that keys returns the list of keys ) . <p> existsif ( exists $myhash " questionablekey " ) <p> The exists operator is used in conditional statements . It returns " true " if there is such a key in your hash and " false " if your hash has no such key . I.e. " Does this key exist ? " . <p> definedif ( defined $myhash " questionablekey " ) <p> The defined operator is used in conditional statements . It returns " true " if there is such a key in your hash and the value is defined ( i.e. the values is NOT undef ) . It returns " false " otherwise . <p> For example , a common use of the keys and values functions is to iterate over and display everything in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hash and print out all of a hash 's keys and values . Note that you do n't need to use quotes around the name of the hash key if it is stored in a variable , i.e.$hash$key . <p> Also note that there is no concept of an " index " for a hash element , there are only keys and values and it is up to you to define the keys . <h> What Good are Hashes ? <p> At this point you may be asking " what good are hashes ? " and " why not just use lists for everything ? " . Well , you could use lists for everything , but if you have a collection of information that naturally has the form of key/value pairs , a hash is often a better choice : <p> It is easier to store and retrieve the information <p> Using keys rather than numbers makes it easier to read your Perl program and avoid errors . <p> Good examples of the kinds of things that are " just made for hashes " include : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The information stored in an HTML form ( all the fields have names and values ) <p> Any list where it is easier to refer to the elements by a name rather than a number , such as a list of people and email addresses , or a list of companies and year-end earnings , etc . These can all be represented by a pair of lists , but the information can be retrieved more easily using a hash.

Using such a list is a guaranteed way to generate high rates of complaints that your mailings are spam and a good way to get yourself and your server black listed . <p> In short , never send email to a purchased email list . - In fact , use a purchased email list for sending email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing vendors . - Avoid them like the plague as their use will : <p> Generate a very , very low rate of return <p> Generate a very high rate of complaints and bounces <p> Cause your outbound email server to be grey or black listed <p> Be detrimental to the successful deliverability of future marketing email messages that you send <p> Be a poor return on investment . - The vendors that sold you these lists will not help you once they have your money . <p> Cause your account to be terminated by your email marketing provider <p> Tarnish your domains mailing reputation so that delivery is a problem even if you change vendors . <p> Just do n't  do it . <h> How else can I get subscribers ? <p> There are many ways to legitimately and organically grow your subscriber list in a way that is consistent with all applicable laws and that will ensure that your subscribers actually want your messages ( and that is key to getting a positive response from your mailings , is n't it ? ) <p> Add a " subscribe " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your web site where users can subscribe to receive information from you . - Some email marketing tools , like Spotlight Mailer , provide code that you can drop right in to automate this process with minimal work . <p> Once you have such a page , make access to it prominent from everywhere on your web site , from mailings that you do , from your email signature , etc . <p> Have a visible and always accessible sign up box on your website in header , sidebar , or footer area . <p> Include a checkbox to sign up on any website form where you collect user data <p> This allows users to opt into your list when they are actively interacting with you . Be sure not to " pre-check " these so that people are not opted in if they are not paying attention . That is bad form and against certain laws . <p> Use a 2-step double opt-in process to join your lists <p> I.e. you system should send an email confirmation message where subscription is only activated if subscriber clicks on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join and receive you emails . Many email marketing programs , like Spotlight Mailer , can do this automatically . <p> This double opt-in ensures that your mailing list consists of valid email addresses approved by the people receiving that email . It stops people from adding others addresses or invalid addresses to your list both of which can affect your spam and deliverability statistics . <p> Offer incentives for customers to sign up <p> E.g. " 50% off your first purchase when you join our mailing list ! " <p> Putting these kinds of offers out through social media , your web site , and other venues , can drastically increase your mailing list subscription rate . <p> Provide access to valuable resources <p> You can offer access to resources such as case studies , downloadable whitepapers , special offers , and other benefits , in exchange for signing up to join your list . <p> Have different lists for different purposes and provide users an option to choose which lists of yours they wish to join . <h> Do n't  forget to manage your lists appropriately <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimize your deliverability and reputation and to abide with best practices and acceptable use policies . - This includes :

TLS ensures that each message is transmitted from you all the way to your recipient 's email server over an " enforced secured channel " , even though the message itself is not encrypted within the channel . The message emerges from the TLS-secured channel onto the recipient 's email server and is delivered to the recipient 's INBOX like any regular email message . SMTP TLS prevents eavesdropping , ensures transport encryption of messages , and is a sufficient level of encryption for HIPAA . <p> SecureLine users ( WebMail and SMTP ) can disable TLS-Only sending on a per-message basis ( e.g. if you like TLS Only in general , but would like to use Opportunistic TLS + something more secure ( Escrow , PGP , or S/MIME ) for particular messages ) . <p> Retrieve Secure Messages from a Web Portal . With SecureLine Escrow , each recipient receives a simple email notice of a waiting message in his/her INBOX . The recipient clicks on a link in that notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verify his/her identity , and then accesses the message over a secured connection in their Web Browser . Escrow enables sending secure messages to anyone , no matter what mail service they have . <p> PGP and S/MIME Certificates . SecureLine supports use of S/MIME and PGP for message encryption and decryption . If you require message content to be always encrypted and to be sent in full to the recipient , then this is for you . It does require that your recipient be " set up " to use S/MIME or PGP . <p> Escrow is very secure and compatible with any recipient ; however , recipients have to go to our Portal to pick up messages <p> PKI is most secure , but hardest to use as it requires communication of certificates and setup of email software for all recipients using it .

This is why " Question and Answer " authentication can be more secure . <p> ** Escrow with " Message Center " enabled technically allows LuxSci operations staff to unlock saved messages , as the system needs to be able to open any saved messages for the user . Escrow with Message Center off ( the default ) eliminates the possibility of anyone for except the individual recipients themselves to unlock their messages . <p> *** PKI-encrypted messages can never be opened by LuxSci operations staff unless you have " Escrowed " the password to your private key with LuxSci for auto-decryption or password-recovery purposes . <p> Feature <p> TLS <p> Escrow <p> PKI <p> Recipient can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INBOX <p> Secure messages appear just like regular messages to recipient <p> Recipient must retrieve message from a secure web site <p> Recipient must set up security software ahead of time <p> Sender can retract a message after sending <p> Sender can tell if recipient has read a message <p> Sender can get read receipts that always work <h> How Messages Are Encrypted <p> SecureLine selects the encryption method to use separately for each recipient of each message . As a result , a single message to multiple people can employ many different encryption methods .

This could be a PGP or S/MIME public key or an Escrow Question and Answer .

What You Need To Know <p> Published : July 13th , 2010 <p> We are often approached by customers wanting to use their blackberry mobile devices to send and receive email that may contain electronic Protected Health Information ( ePHI ) . - Such customers , when they must abide by the HIPAA and HITECH laws governing medical privacy , must comply with a long set of regulations that covers , among other things , how ePHI may be transmitted over the Internet . <p> This article deals with the security of sending and receiving email on a Blackberry configured for Internet email services ( i.e. it does not apply to those connecting to an Blackberry Enterprise Server and Exchange ) . <h> The Short Answer : Blackberry and ePHI <p> Though extensive communications with Blackberry , AT&amp;T , and other providers ( most of whom were unable to provide answers to any questions pertaining to security or privacy , by the way ) , we have determined , in short , that : <p> Reading Email OK : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email over POP or IMAP on your Blackberry as long as your email provider supports secure , SSL-enabled POP and IMAP connections , and can ensure that the Blackberry will not be permitted to make insecure connections to POP or IMAP services for you. - - LuxScis HIPAA email accounts provide this functionality . <p> Sending Email NOT OK : All email sent from a Blackberry device goes to the Blackberry server and then out over the Internet from there. - There is no way to configure a Blackberry to use your own outbound email ( SMTP ) server. - The Blackberry servers that send the email messages may send them insecurely over the Internet there is no way to ensure transport email encryption for messages sent from a Blackberry device. - Therefore , ePHI-laden email messages should never be sent from a normal Blackberry device . <h> How a Blackberry Configures Itself for Internet Email Services <p> When you setup a Blackberry for reading email from a POP or IMAP account , the Blackberry does not actually give you the choices of POP or IMAP or of security or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server name. - Then , Blackberry tries to auto-detect how you can connect and auto-configures itself . <p> What it does and in what order is not documented anywhere that we could find , but it seems that it may be checking things in the following order , and picking the first thing that works for it : <p> Secure IMAP <p> Secure POP <p> Insecure IMAP <p> Insecure POP <p> The best way to configure your Blackberry and to ensure that only the secure service that you want is chosen ( and stays chosen ) is to turn off the other options , if possible . I.e. if you would like to use Secure IMAP , then turn off POP altogether and turn off insecure IMAP. - The result is that Blackberry can only pick the service that you need , and can not " accidentally " choose something else . <h> LuxSci , Blackberry , and HIPAA <p> HIPAA-compliant email accounts at LuxSci are automatically locked down to require forced secure connections to all services ( POP and IMAP included ) , hence insecure connections are disallowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or POP with secure SMTP in standard non-HIPAA-compliant accounts and have available the ability to enable forced secure connections for all users . <p> You control whether email is sent from your Blackberry . Keep in mind that these email messages will never pass though LuxScis servers and we thus have no control over them. - If you were to send ePHI in an outbound email message from your Blackberry , it is likely that this action would violate the requirements of HIPAA and you , the sender , are solely responsible for that potential violation . <p> LuxSci recommends that if you will be using your Blackberry for reading email that may contain ePHI , that you never use the same device for sending outbound email. - By choosing this safe course , you will never accidentally violate HIPAA and you limit your liability . <h> A Business Associate Agreement with Blackberry ? <p> With the new HITECH provisions of HIPAA , any entity covered by HIPAA that does business with another organization who will have access to or control the flow of ePHI for the HIPAA-covered entity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that business partner. - Among other things , this BAA would require the business partner to themselves meet the administrative , technical , and physical safeguards required by HIPAA and to take responsibility for the security of any ePHI in their possession. - LuxSci provides such agreements to HIPAA accounts . <p> A Blackberry reads email by pulling that message from your email provider ( i.e. LuxSci ) to Blackberrys servers , and then pushing from there to your phone. - Similarly , when you send email , that email is sent from your phone to Blackberrys servers and out to the Internet. - Any ePHI will be unencrypted in the Blackberry servers for some period of time with no record of what may be done with it there ( i.e. backups , access via operations staff , etc. ) . - If your ePHI is traveling through Blackberrys servers regularly , due to your business ( service ) relationship with them , it is arguable that you need to establish a BAA with Blackberry to ensure that they are HIPAA compliant with respect to your data ( Blackberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view of Blackberry , they provide secure transmission of your data and have only " incidental " access to any ePHI , and thus they do n't  really need to be a Business Associate under HIPAA . <p> Who is right ? The law is not yet clear on this point . It will surely be clarified over the coming years , under which conditions business partners or service providers need to be HIPAA compliant and sign BAAs with you. - In the mean time , as a HIPAA-covered entity yourself , you must determine if you wish to take the risk. - Either eliminate the use of Blackberrys for ePHI communications altogether , to be safe. - Or , take the liability of a HIPAA breach due to Blackberrys servers or staff onto your organization if you choose to use them . <p> All other mobile phone devices , like iPhone , Android and Palm , connect directly to your email service provider for the sending and receiving of email ( and offer the option to do this securely ) . - A HIPAA Business Associate Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like there is no need to establish a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement with your ISP just because your secure Internet connections pass through their infrastructure . <h> What is the upshot ? <p> A Blackberry is a popular mobile device. - You can use it with ePHI data and with a LuxSci HIPAA account if you : <p> Only check ( read ) your email <p> Never send any ePHI out from the Blackberry itself <p> Trust that Blackberry themselves will not have any issues that will lead to a HIPAA breach with respect to your email data <p> The alternative is to choose a mobile device that can : <p> Allow both the secure sending and receiving of email <p> Avoid the use of a " middle man " in the processing of your email <p> Additionally , you may be surprised to find that the email services available on many other mobile devices , like the iPhone , - Android and Palm , are much better than those offered with a Blackberry. - Blackberry works well if you are on Exchange with a Blackberry Enterprise Server ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . - Outside of that environment , most other mobile devices offer better email services and email security . <p> Setting this ticket to wake on Thursday to finish contract adjustment and rebilling.

<p> These distribution lists can have up to 25 recipients , or the number of users in your account plus 10 , whichever is larger . - So , a 10 user account could have lists of up to 25 recipients ; a 100 user account 110 recipients . <p> If you need more than this , you can contact Sales- for special arrangements . <p> How many Aliases can I have ?

<p> No , these are configurable only via the WebAide Group user interface . <h> Distribution Lists that Forward Email Conditionally <p> For example , if you want to only have your distribution list forward email if it is from an address in a specific domain or from someone in a list of addresses , or if the subject contains special text . - Here is what you do : <p> Create a new email user with the address that the list should have <p> Create an email alias that has an " unguessable " address ( e.g. " **27;1352;TOOLONG " ) which forwards email to the list of addresses desired ( your distribution list ) . <p> Create a " Custom Email Filter " in the user account that you created in step #1. - That filter can match the criteria that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does match , forward the email to the " hidden " alias that you made in step #2 . <p> This method is advantageous as it is simple , it catches email BCCed to your distribution list address , and it allows you to manage the actual distribution list with the full power of the email alias management tools . <p> You could tweak this recipe in a couple of ways : <p> No separate user : Instead of creating a user dedicated to your mailing list address ( which may cost extra ) , you create an email alias for your mailing list address and forward that email to one of your actual users ( instead of step #1 ) . - Then you do step #3 in that actual users account , but add in the criteria that only messages to your mailing list address are forwarded to the hidden real alias . - This saves you the cost of an extra user , but you will not be able to forward email messages BCCed to the mailing list in this way , as you wo n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No exposed alias : If you are worried about people discovering your " hidden " alias address and sending there- directly- then you can put the list of recipient address directly into your Custom Email Filter ( as it can also forward to a list of addresses ) . This will work well , but will make it more difficult to manage the list of recipients in the future as the Custom Filters Tool does not have the expansive distribution list management features that are included in the Email Alias Manager .

@@22227419 @2227419/ <h> 5.1 Motivation <p> Using " scalar " variables we have been able to store any single datum into a named box strings , numbers , dates , boolean values , etc . These add a great versatility and power that makes programming at all useful . However , there are many instances where you need to store lots of information in lots of variables and the fact that each variable has a different name makes it difficult to simplify your program with loops and other devices . <p> For example , in the homework for lesson 3 , you had to write a MadLib that would ask the user for 8 different words with 8 different prompts . You might have written something like this : <p> And so on until you had asked 8 questions . This works fine , but seems pretty redundant as you are essentially doing the exact same thing eight times in a row , with only the contents of the prompt and the name of the variable are changing . This is where Perls " list " variable type comes in handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartments " where you can store data . Thus a list is a numbered collection of variables of the ( scalar ) type we have been using so far . <h> 5.2 Making a List all at Once <p> Let 's demonstrate the one syntax for making a list in Perl , then explain all the nuances : <p> Here we have made a list to contain the prompts for the eight MadLib entries we need . Starting from the left , the name of the list is prefixed with an at-sign ( " @ " ) . Perl knows that you mean a list and not a regular variable because you have the at-sign there and not the dollar sign . The names of lists follow all the same rules as names for other variables ( with the exception of the prefix ) . One interesting thing to note is that the names of lists are independent of the names for regular ( scalar ) variables , So it you have a list @x and a normal variable $x , then they will be completely different , non-ambiguous and independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the same name for different types of variables as it can lead to confusion on the part of the programmer and inadvertent bugs . <p> This list is formed as a comma-delimited set of items inside parenthesis . The individual items can be strings , numbers , the results from an expression , etc . Since spaces do n't  matter outside quotation marks in Perl , we use them to line up our list elements to make our program more readable not necessary , but nice . <h> 5.3 Storing and Retrieving Individual Items From a List <p> To retrieve a value from a list , we need to know what index in the list the item is located at . Lists created as in the example above start at index ZERO , so the first item is list element zero an the last one is list element seven . To print the value of list element 2 , we would <p> print $list2 ; # Prints the string " Enter a person 's name " <p> This prints the list element at index " 2 " which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a little odd why is there a $ prefix there is we are dealing with a list ? Well , let 's start from the other side . You specify the list element you want by tacking on a suffix to the name of the list of the form " index " , where index can be an integer number , like " 2 " , or a number stored in a variable , like " $index " , or the result of a function call , like " sqrt(4) " . Now , as to why the prefix is suddenly a dollar sign , think about what we are doing we had a list of items and the list uses a prefix @ ; we are getting back a single item ( and not a list ) which is essentially a regular variable ( because that is how it behaves ) . Since each item in your list is a regular variable , you refer to them using the dollar sign ! ( If you used the at sign prefix accidently , you would usually still be OK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you problems in certain circumstances , so use the dollar sign ) <p> So , you can retrieve an element from a list and use it wherever you could use a normal variable . This includes assignment . I.e. <p> If you assign something to an index of a list that has never been used , then the list will automatically make room for it , so " $list1000 = 33.4 ; " is OK , even if our list only had 4 elements in it before ! All the elements from index 4 to 999 are still " undefined " , but available for use . <p> If you try to retrieve an element whose index is n't in the list , or whose value has not yet been set , i.e. $list999 , this is the same as trying to retrieve a value from a regular variable that you have never used . Numerically , the result is treated as ZERO ; lexically , it is treated as an empty string . If you want to see IF the value has not been defined , use the undef keyword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very often you want to find the length of a list ( i.e. the number of variables in it ) , or a scalar ( i.e. the number of characters in it ) . For regular variables ( scalars ) , you can use the length command . For lists , you use a special syntax that returns the index of the last item in the list . So , for @list , $#list is the " index of the last element in the list . This is " 0 " if the list has 1 element , " 5 " if the list has six elements and " -1 " if the list has zero elements . So , the number of items in any list is found by adding one to this number , i.e. " $#list + 1 " : <p> A New Loop : Since one of the most common uses of lists is to iterate over the elements , Perl has a special loop to do just that . It is a version of the for loop : <p> @list = ( " a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d " ) ; for $item ( @list ) print " $itemn " ; <p> This type of for loop iterates over all items in your list , @list , and assignees the value of each item to $item in turn , then executes the statements inside the curly brackets . In this way , you do not need to know the length of the list , keep track of the current position in the list , or use the index notation to read the list 's elements . The disadvantages of this type of loop are : 1 . Assigning or changing the value of the variable $item will not affect the value actually stored in the list itself , as $item only contains a copy of that information , and 2. you do n't know what index in the list you are at , unless you are keeping a separate count , which would defeat much of the benefit of using this form of loop , anyway . We will see more examples of this type of loop below . <h> 5.5 Special Functions for Lists <p> Perl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we shall discuss a few of the more useful and ubiquitous ones . <p> push : The push function allows you to add an element to the end of a list ( to " push " an element onto the end ) . For example , if you have a list of 5 elements and you push a new one on to list , it will become the 6th element ( at index 5 ) , i.e. <p> The syntax of push is that it takes 2 arguments separated by a comma ( actually , this is a list of arguments , but we 'll get back to that in a later lesson ) . The first argument is the list you want to push on to and the second argument is what is pushed . <p> pop : The pop function is the opposite of push . It removes the last item from the list and returns it to you . After you use pop , your list is smaller . If your list is already empty and you usepop , it will return a value of undefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like the pop command , but instead of removing the last element from the list , it removes the first element in the list and shifts all the other elements down one index . It then returns to you that element that was removed . If your list is already empty and you useshift , it will return a value of undefined ( undef ) . <p> join : The join command does not alter a list like those above ; it allows you to make one long string out of all the elements in your list . You give join a list and a delimiter string . join returns to you a string containing all elements of your list , where each element is separated from the next with a copy of your delimiter string . I.e. <p> Clearly , join is very useful when you want to convert a list into a string for display or for storage in a normal variable . However , if you want to be able to convert your string back to a list later , be sure that the delimiter you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is in the list elements ; i.e. see the last print statement above where we join the elements together with a period . In the output , there are more periods than delimiters and it is ambiguous where one item begins and ends . Choose you delimiters wisely . <p> split : The split command is the opposite of the join command . It takes a delimiter and a string and returns to you a list containing all of the pieces of the string between the delimiters . If there are no matching delimiters in the string , then you get a list containing only 1 item -- the original string ! <h> 5.7 Your Homework <p> For today 's homework , you are going to generalize homework assignment #1 from lesson 4 -- the multiple choice question . You must do the following : <p> Have 2 or more multiple choice questions <p> Store the questions in a list . ( I.e. 2 questions will be a list containing 2 strings , the statement of each question ) . Do not include the possible answers here . I.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Christmas celebrated ? " . See Section 5.2 for how to make this list . <p> Store the answers to the questions in another list , where the possible answers that you will display to the user are delimited from each other by some character like " " . So , for the Christmas question , your answer string might be " December 12thDecember 17thDecember 25thDecember 31st " . ( You can use split to convert this into a list for nice printing to the user . See the first example in Section 5.6 ) <p> Store the correct answer to each question in another list . I.e. if we are asking these questions by letter , you might use the strings in #3 and #2 to display something like : <p> On what day in December is Christmas celebrated ? A. December 12th B. December 17th C. December 25th D. December 31st Enter your answer : <p> The answer would be " C " . This would be the value stored in the appropriate item in the answer list . <p> Have your script ask the user each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer lists in a loop , display the question , split and display the possible answers , get the user 's answer and compare with the actual answer . ) <p> Do n't tell the user if he/she got the answer right or wrong , just remember this fact by storing it in another list ( think push ) . <p> After all the questions have been asked and answered , tell the user which ones he/she got right and wrong and tell them what percentage they got correct .

What does this mean ? There is actually something behind this . <p> As many people know , IMAP is a protocol for checking email that resides on a server . It is different from and more robust than the " POP " protocol that is also for checking email but which is typically used just for downloading messages from peoples INBOXes to their local computers . With IMAP , you can have any number of folders and the email stays on the server for easy access from anywhere and so backups are taken care of for you . That is a simplistic description , but the main point is that both POP and IMAP are for checking email only there is no functionality in their specifications for sending email . <p> So , while some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbound via IMAP can be chalked up to them just not knowing the difference between IMAP and SMTP , the other half of their email service that actually does the outbound email sending , some people really do send outbound email via IMAP . <h> How is this done ? <p> Some email servers reserve a special IMAP email folder for outbound email messages often called the " Outbox " or something similar . When a user wants to send an email message " via IMAP " s/he composes it and saves it in this special folder ( using IMAP ) . Then , a special process on the email server looks for and notices a new message in that folder , sends it for the user , and deletes it from the folder . Thus , as far as the user is concerned , s/he sent it via IMAP . <h> How is this useful ? <p> This is useful if the user can not use regular SMTP for some reason . For instance , the user may be behind a firewall of some kind which prohibits him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMAP . With this mechanism , the user would then still be able to send outbound messages by copying them to the server over IMAP instead of SMTP . <h> Does LuxSci support sending email via IMAP ? <p> No . This is a highly non-standard service offered by some companies . However , LuxSci offers a wide array of alternate ports that can be used for sending outbound email messages via SMTP ( regularly , using TLS , or using SSL ) including port 80 . These alternate ports resolve 99% of peoples problems with troublesome firewalls and allow users to " send email as usual " .

How is it possible that he gets any mail at the old place at all now ? I think the money he paid them is a completely ripoff as that is not his working email ! Unfortunately I am the only one of the 3 of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for any thoughts . <p> Hello ! This is actually quote a common scenario . If you do not close down your account with your old email provider , then that provider will usually still accept inbound email addressed to you which arrives at its servers . <p> You would think that by changing your DNS MX records , that no more email would ever arrive there . And indeed , all of your legitimate email did get redirected to the new location . However , spammers are lazy folks who do n't  necessarily care about how email is supposed to work and just want to deliver email messages as fast as possible . It is quite common for them to " permanently " memorize what servers accept email for you and to perpetually send their spam there as long as they keep accepting it . Why ? because this allows them to send email much more quickly not checking if the delivery destination has changed in DNS . <p> As a result , what you see is that you will continue to get spam and only spam at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not your old providers fault you have chosen to keep your account open and , as far as they know , there may be legitimate reasons why you may want to have it open and even allowed to receive email .

E.g. you connect without SSL or TLS , but that is OK since you are connecting from your computer to itself . <p> Your- communications- then go securely from your computer to the remote server over SSL due to the stunnel connection . <p> This works great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remote server uses SSL. - It is trickier if you need to connect to a TLS-only server and your program only supports SSL. - There is no good simple solution for this case except for possibly : <p> Updating your program to one that supports TLS . <p> Contacting the service provider to see if they have any - alternate SSL-supporting ports .

The time seems right to share some of our knowledge and experience with iPhones . <h> About the iPhone , iPod Touch , and iPad <p> The iPhone4 , iPhone 3G , the original iPhone , the iPod Touch , and the iPad can all access Internet email using either POP or IMAP services ; they can also send email messages via SMTP ( They can also use an " Exchange " style account such as that used by MobileSync ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same configuration options and features ; the only differences are the means by which they can connect to the Internet . All can connect to a wireless router or hotspot . The original iPhone can also connect via the slower cellular " Edge " network ( when a wifi connection is not available ) . The iPhone 3G , iPhone4 , and iPad can additionally connect via the faster cellular 3G network . <h> The iPhone and Web-based Email <p> The iPhone includes a very good Safari web browser that can be used to access web-based email services that are compatible with mobile devices. - By this we mean that the interfaces are not too large , heavy , and complex to be usable on an iPhone. - Like LuxScis Xpress Mobile WebMail Portal , such interfaces are fairly simple , concise , narrow , and very user friendly. - Such interfaces often allow you to perform all the actions that you could do using the iPhones email program , and more. - If your email provider ( or corporate firewall ) is not granting you POP or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an excellent fall back . <h> The iPhone Email Program <p> iPhone 's built-in email program , a scaled back version of Apples Mail.app , is quite good and can be configured to securely use almost all of the email services that we offer to our email hosting clients. - I.e. , you can do almost everything with an iPhone that you can do with a regular desktop email program , and it offers comparable security . Using your iPhone email program , you can access your Internet email accounts using IMAP or POP and can send email messages using SMTP . <h> Good Security ! <p> One very nice feature is that , while you have the option to use secure or insecure connections for each of these protocols , the iPhone configures itself for a secure connection by default you actually have to do extra work to disable the SSL/TLS security options. - This is notable , especially since it is common to be checking your email in an untrusted wireless hotspot where use of SSL ( or a VPN ) is essential . <p> Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browser and found that they will use AES 128-bit encryption when making SSL- connections to email servers and web sites. - This is not the absolute best encryption in general use ( that would be 256-bit AES ) , but it does use the excellent AES- technique with key lengths that provide very good security better than you would get using Internet Explorer or Windows XP. - Apple probably did not use the 256-bit AES- technique as a compromise to get better speed at the cost of a little security ( Microsoft does that too ) . <h> Compatible with Server-Side Inbound Email Tools <p> Because the iPhone accesses your email only after it has been delivered to your folders , its use is completely compatible with any kind of server-side service that processes email before it is delivered to you . At LuxSci , this includes : <p> Automatic decryption of PGP- or S/MIME-encrypted email message ( for use with SecureLine ) <p> Auto-responders and message forwarders <p> Making backup copies of inbound email and email stored on the server . <h> Push email with Exchange <p> An " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Push Email " . - I.e. email , calendars , and contacts can be automatically synchronized between your iPhone and your Exchange server . - Additionally , you get updates very fast and all this takes very little battery power . - See also Premium MobileSync for LuxScis Exchange-compatible sync service for the iPhone . <h> Checking Email with POP- and IMAP <p> These are standard services for accessing your email and do not require a more expensive Exchange-style account. - The iPhones email program <p> Permits the use of alternate POP- and IMAP- ports so that you can access your email even if blocked by a firewall . <p> Sets up POP- to " Never " delete messages from the server by default , so that you do not accidently suck all of your email from the server onto your iPhone , where it is no longer accessible to you via WebMail or your normal email program. - We recommend keeping this default unless the iPhone is the only place where you check your email . <p> Use of IMAP- is preferable to POP when you have many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email in folders other than your INBOX from your iPhone , when you would like your sent email messages saved on the server , or when you would like to be able to delete messages from the server using your iPhone . <p> Unfortunately the non-standard " IMAP PUSH " protocol that the iPhone uses is not currently supported by LuxSci , and the iPhone itself does not support the IMAP IDLE standard , either . However , it is easy to configure the iPhone to automatically check your IMAP email every few minutes , or you can check it manually as needed . - If you really need your email fast , you need to use a " Push Email " compatible system like the Exchange-style accounts described above . <h> Sending Email with SMTP <p> The iPhone works great with LuxSci 's SMTP services for securely sending outbound email messages . It even allows for the use of multiple SMTP servers ; and the iPhone can be set to automatically try the alternative SMTP servers if the default server does not respond. - Because the iPhone supports alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LuxScis special outbound email processing services , such as : <p> Restriction of what addresses to which users should be allowed to send email <p> Automatic addition of taglines and signatures to outbound email messages <p> Using alternate ports for sending email in cases where your ISP or firewall is blocking the standard ports <p> Anonymizing outbound email so that your recipients are unable to know the location from which you are sending your email , or even that it is coming from an iPhone . <h> In Conclusion <p> The iPhones email program is very robust and the security very strong . If set up correctly , an iPhone is compatible with LuxSci services even if : <p> All sent and received email needs to be archived <p> All connections need to be secured using SSL or TLS <p> Copies of sent email messages need to be kept on the server <p> Disclaimers need to be added to all outbound email messages <p> AES- encryption is required ( 128-bit or better1 ) <p> You need to be able to send email using alternate ports <p> All of your server-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need end-to-end email encryption using PGP , S/MIME , or Escrow. - This can be done from an iPhone using the automatic encryption-on-send features and automatic decryption-on-receipt features of LuxSci. <h> 2 Responses to " iPhone : The Ultimate Mobile Email Client ? " <p> like all technology it has it 's quirks , as well as some features that you should be aware of when using it to send and receive email . Based upon our experience using iPhones ourselves and in supporting our clients varied use <p> Great overview . Apples Mail really has n't  moved on much since this though . There 's a lot of 3rd party Apps to choose from if Apples Mail does n't  do everything you need . The best iphone email app for me is AltaMail as it supports multiple signatures and prints emails .

Their April 8 release was somewhat lackluster , but the exploits released on April 14 had the infosec world on edge . This latest set of tools includes what was initially thought to be a bunch of zero-day exploits , as well as code that seems to enable access to the SWIFT international banking system . <p> Code-named Lost in Translation , The Shadow Brokers leaks are spread across three main folders , called windows , oddjob and swift . The windows and oddjob folders contain exploits for various Windows products , while swift seems be used to infiltrate the SWIFT system . The code is alleged to have leaked from the NSA , however its authenticity is yet to be confirmed . <p> In the initial hysteria , many in the security industry were assuming that hackers would be able to download the toolkit and quickly take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears with a blog post , stating that the current vulnerabilities had already been patched in March . <h> The Windows Exploits <p> The Shadow Brokers release includes a range of tools that affect many different Windows products . Some of these are old , while others were thought to be zero day exploits that could wreak havoc on several different versions . Most of the initial examinations were conducted on research systems that had n't  been updated with the latest patches , which led to widespread alarm within the industry . <p> While it is easy to criticize the researchers for not testing with the latest patch , in the early hours of the leak , Microsoft had not released any indications that the vulnerabilities had already been addressed . <p> According to the subsequent Microsoft blog post , the following exploits have already been patched : EternalBlue , EmeraldThread , EternalChampion , ErraticGopher , EskimoRoll , EternalRomance , EducatedScholar , EternalSynergy , and EclipsedWing had already been patched . Some of the issues were addressed much earlier , but the last few were taken care of with last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patched , EternalBlue allows hackers to infiltrate both Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 without authentication . They can then install DoublePulsar to inject malicious DLLs . <p> EducatedScholar and EmeraldThread are both SMB exploits , the latter targeting Windows XP and Server 2003 . EternalChampion is an SMBv1 exploit , while EternalSynergy is a SMBv3 remote code execution exploit that works against Windows 8 and Server 2012 if they are n't  patched . <p> ErraticGopher is an SMB exploit that targets Server 2003 and Windows XP , while EskimoRoll is a Kerberos Exploit that targets Windows 2000 , as well as Server 2003 , 2008 and 2008 R2 domain controllers . Eternal Romance is a remote SMBv1 network file server exploit . It can affect Windows XP , 2003 , Vista , 7 , 8 , as well as server 2008 and server 2008R2 . EclipsedWing is an RCE exploit that targets Windows Server 2008 as well as older versions . <p> The other three exploits , EnglishmanDentist , EsteemAudit and ExplodingCan , only affect unsupported versions of Windows such as XP , Vista and Exchange 2007 . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Microsoft will not be patching the vulnerabilities . <p> One of the biggest questions surrounding this is how did Microsoft know about the vulnerabilities ? Sure , they could have just discovered them by chance , but the timing of the patches seems far too coincidental . <p> Some of the more cynical theories include that Microsoft was notified of the exploits by the NSA , or that they may have even paid The Shadow Brokers for the information . If either of these cases are true , it could explain why Microsoft havent named their source , as is normally done in these instances. - <h> Listening In On International Banking <p> The swift folder contains exploits which appear to link the NSA to a number of tools that enable them to access the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecoms ( SWIFT ) international banking network . The SWIFT network is used by banks to securely send information regarding financial transactions across the world . <p> According to Reuters , the leaks indicate that the NSA may have the capability to access the SWIFT network and monitor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a breach of their main network , stating in a press release that there is no evidence of this occurring . This can be taken in several different ways . <p> The first would be that they are telling the truth and their main network has not been breached " this seems unlikely given the leaked evidence . Another possibility is that only the network of a SWIFT client bank has been infiltrated , not the main network . It is also possible that there has been a breach but SWIFT lack the reporting tools to discover it . Another option is that they are just buying time at the moment while they investigate the issue further . <p> Whether the NSA has access to SWIFTs network is yet to be confirmed by either side . If the NSA does have access , they may be using it to monitoring large scale funds transfers , particularly those between terrorist networks . <h> What Are the Repercussions of the Lost in Translation Leaks ? <p> Thankfully , the exploits revealed in the latest leak are n't  as bad as initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hackers could n't run rampant while the developers hurried to get out the update . Despite this , there are still several things we can learn from the latest leaks : <h> Updates Are Essential <p> More than anything else , these leaks are a reminder of just how important it is to be running the latest security updates . Those who have already updated their systems with Microsofts March update should be protected from the latest exploits released by The Shadow Brokers . <p> If you are running a platform that Microsoft no longer supports , it needs to be upgraded as soon as possible . Versions prior to Microsoft 7 are unsupported and have far too many vulnerabilities . <p> Security is a dynamic environment and threat actors are constantly coming up with new ways to infiltrate systems . As soon as developers discover these vulnerabilities , they quickly send out a patch to fix the holes . If you are n't  updating your devices as soon as these patches are made available , you are leaving your system open to attacks . This is why updating systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human and we tend to make mistakes , put things off and forget about them . This is why auto-updating is such an important feature . If you only update manually , it is very easy to get behind and leave your systems vulnerable . Turning on auto-updates across all of your devices will help to boost your security by automatically installing the latest patches . This lessens the amount of time that your systems are vulnerable . <p> Routers and IoT devices are often overlooked when it comes to updates . These are just as critical when it comes to keeping your systems secure . Unfortunately , many of them do n't  auto-update , meaning that they are frequently left vulnerable to the latest attacks . <p> If your router or IoT devices do n't  auto-update , you need to make sure that you manually update them frequently . For enhanced security , you should specifically look at buying devices that can auto-update . Not only will this make your devices less of a target , but it also shows that the manufacturer takes security more seriously . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorly designed security , so it is important to take this into account when making purchases . <h> Keep It in the Cloud <p> Another option to enhance your security could be to migrate to a cloud-based solution . With software-as-a-service , your host company will take care of the updates , which can take some of the pressure off you . Its important to note that cloud hosts do n't  take on all of the security responsibilities " depending on the arrangement , you will probably be responsible for data classification , endpoint security and other aspects . <h> Summing It All Up : Security in the Modern World <p> This leak certainly wont be the last and threat actors wo n't stop trying to breach our systems any time soon . Keeping our systems safe is becoming increasingly challenging , especially as our lives step further and further into the online realm . <p> To minimize the chance of becoming a victim , it is important to be aware of information security and follow best practices . Your systems will never be 100% bulletproof , but taking simple steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of many ways you can reduce the chance of being breached . While security can seem like a hassle , a serious attack can have tremendous affects on your business or personal life . Its much easier to prevent an attack than to pick up the pieces .

You wrote your password(s) down on a post-it note and someone saw it <h> How to Protect Your Passwords <h> 1 . Do not use " Insecure Connections " . <p> You should always use connections encrypted using SSL or TLS , so no one can eavesdrop on you . - This is especially true in public places , like wifi hot spots . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the address in your browsers address bar starts with " https : // " and not " http : " . - The " s " in " https " means " secured using SSL " and means that everything between you and that site is encrypted. - However , if your browser gives you a warning that the site is " not trusted " or that there is some problem with the web sites " certificate " , you should NOT go there and login someone may be trying to intercept your connection to glean your credentials ! <p> Connecting to other services , like email , chat , Facebook or Twitter , should also be made over SSL or TLS connections . - If you want to use a service and they do not support secure connections , either do not use them , or use a username and password that is only for them ( so if it gets discovered , it wont impact anything else you are doing ) . <h> 2 . Do not write your passwords on post it notes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way to get yourself in trouble . - Instead of the " post-it note " method of remembering passwords , it is best ( if you cant just remember them all in your head but really , who can ? ) to store them in a secure database . - I.e. keep all the usernames , passwords , and other pertinent information ( like secret questions and answers ) in a file or database or location that is itself encrypted with one password , the only password your really have to remember ( or maybe it is protected with a fingerprint reader even better ) . - With an encrypted password database , you can access all of your password data anytime , and no one else can get to them , even if they have access to your computer and all of your stuff . <p> LuxSci provides one such solution in its WebAides suite online- Encrypted- Password storage . - Access your passwords securely from anywhere you have an online computer , and rest assured that the passwords are actually backed up and safe from disaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies being hacked or having- malicious- employees is that databases of customer information get stolen . - It is often the case , that companies have your passwords stored in " plain text " along with your username in their databases . - I.e. if your password is " apple123 " , and anyone looks in the database , they would see that clearly and that is bad . <p> Another way to do things is for companies to store only " hashes " of passwords. - A " hash " is a one-way mathematical function for turning " plain text " like " apple123 " into pretty unique gibberish like " **34;1381;TOOLONG " . - They only store the gibberish ( the hash ) in their databases . - In this way , they can still see if your password is correct by passing it through that math function and seeing if the result matches the gibberish. - However , you cant " go backwards " from the gibberish to the original password . - If the database of a company that stores only hashes of passwords is stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly see below ) . <p> If you can , you should choose to work with companies , like LuxSci , that never store plain text passwords anywhere . <h> 4 . Choose good passwords ! <p> This almost goes without saying , but if you do n't  keep saying it , people wont do it . <p> If you choose a simple ( poor ) password like " apple " , it is easily guessed by computer programs that try millions of common words , phrases , and commonly used passwords. - How ? <p> Some systems ( unlike LuxScis ) allow unlimited login attempts in a short period of time , even if they are all failing and all from the same place . - This allows computer programs to quickly try all kinds of different passwords until one is found that works ( the so-called " brute force " approach ) . <p> Also , if the gibberish ( the hash ) of a password is known , while you cant " go backwards " , you can try all kinds of passwords and see if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - If one does , it is the proper password . <p> If your password is simple , it can be quickly guessed by a computer in either of the above situations . - If not , you are probably safe . <h> 5 . Use different passwords for different sites / accounts <p> A big " no no " is to use the same password everywhere . - Why ? - If it gets compromised in one place , then all of your accounts are vulnerable . - The more places you use your password , the more vulnerable it becomes . <p> Of course , the best thing to do is to use a different good password for each account you have . - However , remembering all of these passwords quickly becomes cumbersome , even with a good password database . - It is best if you can have different passwords for each account and create them in a way that makes them ( a ) strong , ( b ) easily remembered , and ( c ) you cant easily guess one if you know another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose companies that support it ! <p> Two Factor Authentication typically requires some kind of verification beyond your username and password in order to gain access to an account . - I.e. if you have Two Factor Authentication enabled at LuxSci , when you login you will have a " token " ( a short number ) sent to either an alternate email address of your choice or to your mobile phone as a text messages . - You have to access this token and enter it into the login page in order to complete the login process . <p> Two Factor Authentication protects your account against your password being stolen as without access to the " second factor " ( i.e. your phone ) , your account is still safe from intrusion . <p> You can also use a good OpenID to provide multi-factor authentication , if your account supports it .

The digital age has seen the paper-clipped note go the way of the dinosaur . Todays software programs may offer electronic notes and comments , but none specifically for email that is also shareable across programs . Until now . LuxSci has a feature in WebMail to add notes to messages that can be viewed by everyone and in most email programs . <p> Except for Thunderbird and a few others , we are not aware of an email client that let 's you make " notes " on email messages and those that do are only visible in program that created them and not by anyone else looking at the message via IMAP or WebMail . We got to thinking of how useful a note would be that is part of the email message and viewable by anyone , in any email program . The LuxSci email note literally " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone or copied/moved to another email folder . Unfortunately , this kind of feature is almost impossible to find in any other email solution . This is mostly because IMAP does not generally support annotation of email . There is an experimental specification of email annotation for IMAP ( RFC5257 ) , but this is rarely implemented by servers and not implemented at all by mainstream mail programs . However , LuxSci has developed a WebMail interface that provides just this kind of universal email annotation feature ( though not by using " IMAP annotate " ) . <h> How does Email Annotation work in LuxSci WebMail ? <p> When using LuxSci WebMail , you can select a message and choose " Message &gt; Add Notes " from the menu , or press the hot key " Shift-N " , or use an " Add Note " command from your custom tool bar . Any of these actions will pop-up a small annotation window , where you can enter notes of arbitrary length in plain text or HTML . When you press the " Submit Annotation " button , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added note is time , date and author stamped and appears as the first thing you see when viewing the email message . Notes are always presented in chronological order , newest to oldest . You can add any number of notes to a message . The notes are added by taking the original message and adding a new " part " to it at the beginning . The updated message is then saved back to the email folder ( with all email tags , received dates , and other things preserved to be the same as the original message ) and the original message is deleted . For all practical purposes , it looks like the original message was edited . <h> What are the advantages of LuxScis Email Annotation ? <p> The notes are a part of the message and stored in the message on the server . <p> The notes are backed up as part of the normal email backup procedures . <p> The notes are visible to anyone viewing the message via POP , IMAP , or WebMail <p> The notes travel with the message if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can add any number of notes to a message . <p> There is tracking information in each note so it is obvious who added each note and when . <p> If multiple people are sharing the same email folder , then any of them can add notes to messages that other users with access to the folder can immediately see . <p> It is easy in LuxSci WebMail to identify messages that have notes vs. those that do not . <h> A Case Study of the Use of LuxSci Email Annotation <p> Many of LuxScis clients take advantage of email notes , email message tagging , and shared email folders in the following ways : <p> The company has an email address such as info@company.com that receives inbound requests of many sorts <p> Multiple people need to monitor the email at info@company.com due to ( a ) different people working on different shifts , and ( b ) different people having different skills or responsibilities with respect to customer support or sales <p> The companys solution is to : <p> Share the INBOX of info@company.com with all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from WebMail while logged in . <p> Manage incoming messages by having users ( a ) tag the message for the person to whom it is assigned , and ( b ) annotate the message with any pertinent details such as an initial phone conversation . <p> Permit some people to also access this shared email via IMAP from an email client like Thunderbird . They can see the message tags and the annotations , respond to messages and adjust tags as in WebMail . The only limitation is adding new annotations ; that must be done in LuxSci WebMail . <p> What we offer is a well-organized collaborative effort by many employees to manage the inbound email of info@company.com . Messages can be handed off and annotated , with the added benefit of activity tracking without the need for an external message tracking system . This also reduces overhead and redundancy which can add time and cost .

<p> In this context , SMTP TLS ( which stands for " Transport Layer Security " ) is a way that email servers , when talking to each other so that one can send transport to the other your email message , can encrypt the complete message content so that it can not be eavesdropped upon. - This means that no one listening to Internet traffic between the sending server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vice versa ) could see what is in the message . <p> Most email servers do not support TLS- email encryption , though more and more are starting to enable it. - Why do n't  they support it ? - Because it requires buying and installing special certificates , configuring the server in a not-out-of-the-box fashion , and it takes more effort by the email servers to process the encryption . <p> Many bank and other organizations with tight security policies actually require that all companies doing business with them always use such encryption to protect email communications between them. - In a sense , it is like building a tunnel between the two companies through which the email flows and into which no outsider can peer . <p> In general , TLS- encryption for email is an extremely good idea as it goes a long way towards protecting people from identity theft , and other kinds of security problems. - If it is coupled with enforced use of TLS- or SSL- ( How do SSL- and TLS- work ? ) when you connect to your email server to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMTP , and/or WebMail ) , then all of- your message data and login credentials are really protected quite well . <h> LuxSci does TLS- automatically <p> Every email server either supports TLS or does not and they advertise this in a way that other servers can easily see/discover . <p> Inbound Email : All of LuxScis email servers ( including all of those used for email filtering ) support TLS- for inbound email so anyone sending an email to a LuxSci user can employ TLS if the sending side supports it and decides to use it. - All banks and other organizations that have strict security policies will automatically use TLS encryption when communicating with any other server that supports it . <p> Outbound Email : All our LuxScis email servers will automatically encrypt email when they are talking to another email server that says it supports TLS. - In fact , if something goes wrong because the recipient servers TLS- is not configured properly ( it happens ) , LuxSci will NOT send the message until the issue is fixed ( or we provide an exemption for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALWAYS- send email securely- to servers that support secure email , and that includes banks and other organizations with strict security policies . <p> What all this means for a LuxSci user is that email traffic to and from other places that support email encryption will always be encrypted no matter what. - This all happens behind the scenes for all LuxSci users there is nothing to configure or order or setup. - It just happens , as it should . <h> Taking things a step further ? <p> So , what else could the high-security organizations ask for ? - We find that they often ask us to " enforce " encryption to their domains. - This means that if , for some reason , their email server becomes misconfigured and no longer says that it supports encryption that LuxSci will refrain from saying " ok , then let 's talk insecurely " as it normally would . <p> For organizations who want LuxSci to refrain from sending any insecure messages to their servers under any conditions , LuxSci can easily enact a global policy for their domains. - All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable this higher level of security enforcement. - Why ? - Because if any of their servers then or in the future fail to support encryption , then some or all email from LuxSci will not make it to them. - This has to be their choice . <h> And another step further ? <p> Of course , TLS- encryption is great , and combined with SSL or TLS- when checking and sending your email from your computer it does wonders for security. - However , it is not the best you can do. - For example : <p> It does n't  protect messages sent to people whose email servers do not support encryption <p> It does not enforce any kind of security on the recipients once the email is delivered to their servers <p> It does not ensure that the messages can not be read by unauthorized people <p> it does not protect the content of the messages when stored on email servers or in backups <p> What can be done ? - You could use an email encryption solution that either : <p> 1 . Encrypts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrypt it to read it. - PGP and S/MIME- are the most common technologies for this , and they are or can be integrated into most email clients , or <p> 2 . The email can be saved in a secure database where the recipient can pick it up securely after verifying his/her identity . <p> LuxScis SecureLine service provides users with both of these options , which can be used as needed for any or all recipients. - LuxSci also makes it easy to lock down your account with maximal security settings like forced use of SSL , strong passwords , etc. <h> 7 Responses to " Enforcing Email Security with TLS when Communicating with Banks " <p> Just because a server supports TLS today , does not mean that it will tomorrow server configurations can change and mistakes can be made.You can , however , be sure that an email will never be sent to someone without TLS see Enforcing Email Security with TLS when Communicating with Banks . <p> a requirement that email be secured at least by TLS encryption from sender to recipient. - This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message content can not be eavesdropped upon. - This check , to see if a <p> SMTP does not encrypt messages ( unless the servers in question support opportunistic TLS encryption ) . - Communications between SMTP servers may send your messages in plain text for any eavesdropper <p> SecureLine accounts that enable " TLS Only " can have their outbound email delivered over an SMTP TLS encrypted channel to recipients whose email services support it. - This mitigates the need for using PGP , S/MIME , or SecureLine Escrow message pickup service for many secure outbound email messages if TLS message transport encryption is " good enough " for your organization ( i.e. it is for HIPAA compliance and it is for most bank-to-bank communications ) . 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

@@22227448 @2227448/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> Kick Your Privacy Up a Notch with Tor <p> Published : May 8th , 2017 <p> Online privacy is becoming more important as our lives increasingly migrate to the internet . With government surveillance intensifying , you may have come across the term Tor as a way to protect yourself . So what exactly is it ? <p> The Onion Router ( TOR ) , is an open source project that aims to provide anonymous communication for its users . The underlying technology was initially developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory in the nineties as a way to protect communications within the intelligence community . Tor has since moved over to the open source community , supported by a range of volunteers , privacy advocacy groups , various US government departments and others . <p> Tor allows web browsing , messaging and chat , as well as access to . onion websites , which are a secretive side of the internet . Unfortunately , Tor can not give a user complete anonymity , particularly from government level surveillance . This is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes into Tor with the traffic that exits . Despite this , it is still a useful tool that can help to enhance privacy in a range of use cases . <h> How Does Tor Work ? <p> Tor helps to anonymize its users by combining encryption with a relay of nodes that help to hide a users path . When traffic travels over Tor , the packets are encrypted in layers . This is where the project gets its onion moniker from . The traffic is sent through three random relays , with each layer only having information for the next destination . Because of this , the IP address of the origin and destination are never visible in the same layer , making it extremely difficult to correlate who is responsible for what traffic . This gives users a high level of privacy . <p> When traffic is spied on , the origin is disguised and it instead looks as though the previous node was the sender . Despite this , the Tor network still has its weaknesses . It can not stop anyone from monitoring the entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are vulnerabilities at these points . Although it can protect against traffic analysis , it can not stop authorities from end-to-end correlation , which can lead to internet activity being linked back to the user . <p> Users need to be careful with how they use Tor , because it is not some magic pill that gives you immediate invisibility from the authorities . If you reveal personal details over the Tor network , these can still be traced back to you . <p> There are also a number of plugins and scripts that can leak your IP address , such as Javascript and Flash . Because of this , it is recommended that most new users start with the Tor browser . Another downside of Tor is that the encryption and relaying of traffic significantly slows down internet speeds . <h> What Is a Darknet ? <p> While darknets might sound evil , the reality is that they are just networks that can only be accessed under authorization or with specialized software . Darknets are difficult for authorities to control , which has led to them becoming a haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , privacy advocates and others . <h> What Are Onion Websites ? <p> Onion websites ( . onion ) are the most commonly used part of darknets . They are hidden services that ca n't be accessed through the regular internet because they do not have actual DNS names . The only way that they can be visited is by sending a request through the Tor network . The addresses are normally hashes made up of a mix of 16 numbers and letters . <p> Tor sites are difficult for authorities to trace , so they can provide protection for both the host and those who are accessing them . While there are many legitimate reasons to use Tor , the anonymous nature of hidden services has also led to them hosting a range of illegal activity , including darknet marketplaces , restricted pornography and other forms of crime . <h> Will Using Tor Make You an NSA Target ? <p> While Tor is an important tool , the anonymity it grants its users has led to it also serving as a hub for crime . Many people assumed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was confirmed by documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2014 . XKeyscore revealed that even searching the internet for tools such as Tor can get you marked for special attention from the NSA . <p> This does n't  mean that you should avoid using Tor , however it does mean that you should be aware of your risk profile , as well as the weaknesses within the Tor system . If you are engaging in a high risk activity , you should look at engaging other tools as well to help improve your anonymity . <h> Will Using Tor Get You Infected with Malware ? <p> The Tor browser is based on Firefox . Although there are some modifications , many of the exploits that affect Firefox will also work against Tor . As far as Tor specific attacks are concerned , the FBI has been known to exploit vulnerabilities to track access to certain . onion websites . <h> Is Tor Just for Criminals ? <p> While Tor may get a bad reputation from its association with the Silk Road and other illegal activities , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tor is simply a tool that can be used in a number of ways , some good and some bad . <p> The more legitimate uses for Tor include journalism and activism , particularly for those living underneath authoritarian regimes . Whistleblowers have also been known to use the service , as well as ordinary citizens who have concerns about their privacy and traffic analysis . Victims of abuse also use the service to link up with support networks , while law enforcement agencies use it to track websites without letting their presence known . <h> Can You Combine Tor with a VPN ? <p> You can combine the technologies in two different ways . The first is to use Tor through your VPN . This hides your use of Tor from your ISP and anyone else that may be snooping in . This can be good if you do n't  want to raise suspicions by using Tor . Despite this , if your VPN keeps logs , then it is possible for the traffic to be correlated with your IP address . This method also leaves you vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the VPN is unencrypted as it enters the Tor network . <p> The other option is more complicated , however it can protect your traffic from malicious exit nodes . It involves encrypting your traffic with your VPN , sending it through the Tor network , then decrypting it through your VPN before it reaches your destination . Because of this , a malicious exit node will only be able to see encrypted traffic , which helps to protect your anonymity . <h> Can You Combine Tor with TLS ? <p> Using TLS for normal web browsing over Tor can help to protect you from malicious exit nodes . If the website you are visiting does n't  have encryption , your data can be exposed between the Tor exit node and the destination server . To prevent yourself from being monitored when you exit the Tor network , make sure that you are only using HTTPS websites . <p> When it comes to using Tors hidden services , TLS is unnecessary . This is because Tor already has end-to-end encryption . If the site owner purchased a certificate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it much easier for the authorities to discover it . <h> Can You Use Tor to Give You Better Privacy on Regular Websites ? <p> Tor is great for enhancing your privacy for regular browsing . It can prevent traffic analysis as well as advertisers gathering data on your activity . Anyone using Tor still needs to be sensible and understand the limitations of the technology as well as how to use it safely . When used properly , low-level users can consider themselves essentially anonymous . Those who are engaging in high risk activities need to be much more aware of the potential points of failure . <h> Tor vs VPNs <p> VPNs are another common privacy tool that are getting more attention these days . A VPN encrypts your traffic from the client to the VPN server , meaning that your ISP and others cant listen in . Unfortunately , the VPN provider themselves may log your data , which could result in you being discovered by the authorities if they are subpoenaed . <p> Tor works in quite a different manner . The data is encrypted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities to determine the origin of the traffic . The key vulnerability is the exit node , but combining a VPN with Tor can help to alleviate this . <h> Should You Use Tor ? <p> Tor is an excellent software project that is great for enhancing your privacy online . There are a wide range of use cases where it can essentially keep you anonymous . The most important thing is to understand the limitations of the technology as well as how to use it properly . If you plan on doing anything high risk , you should ensure that you are well versed in how privacy tools work , otherwise you may find the authorities knocking on your door .

Make sure that your OS and device are not too old to be secure <p> Make sure that your device is relatively recent : an iPhone 4 or better will do the trick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touch 3rd Generation+ , or a recent iPad .

Is that a good idea ? <p> Published : February 12th , 2013 <p> WordPress is an extremely popular content management system for both blogging and creating web sites . - Its popular because it is quick to set up , easy to administer , has a very large supported base of add-ons , and looks good . - As a result , many LuxSci customers use WordPress in one fashion or another for their web sites hosted at LuxSci . <p> As we cater to a large segment of customers who have specific compliance needs , e.g. HIPAA- compliance , - we frequently are asked about using WordPress with ePHI e.g. using WordPress to provide access to protected health information for members of the WordPress site . <p> Can this be compliant ? - Is it a good idea ? <h> What do you need for a HIPAA Compliant WordPress site ? <p> First , you need to host your WordPress site with a hosting provider that provides HIPAA compliance and who will sign your HIPAA Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at places like wordpress.com and GoDaddy are immediately not possible . <p> Next , you need to ensure that your WordPress site meets HIPAA requirements and any requirements of your hosting provider . - This includes : <p> An- SSL certificate and dedicated IP address for your web site so that traffic to/from it can be encrypted in transit . <p> Ensuring that your WordPress site can not be accessed without SSL ( e.g. by using LuxScis feature where you can have SSL-protected content separate from insecure content ) . <p> Ensuring that ePHI is never- publicly- available users must login to access that content . <p> Ensuring that users with access to ePHI are properly granted / revoked access by your HIPAA- administrators . - E.g. it should not be possible for someone to sign-up and get access without explicit review . <p> Ensuring that users have access to only the ePHI they need and should have access . <p> Ensuring that user logins to WordPress will automatically log users off due to inactivity . <p> Log access to ePHI , if possible . <p> Reviewing your procedures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of ePHI-pages insecurely on disk , especially if you are in a shared environment . - Wordpress content is normally stored in a database , but if it is cached insecurely on disk that will weaken security and in a shared environment could provide access to unauthorized persons . <p> There are many more procedural things that you must do and that your provider must do that are described here . <h> So , can these things all be done with WordPress ? <p> Many of these things are doable , however : <p> Not caching ePHI-laden pages . - Some WordPress caching addins cache pages to the database . - Others save pages to disk . - Furthermore , you can sometimes control what pages are cached and which are not . - Being forced to do that on a post-by-post basis , is however , a recipe for accidental breach . - By default , WordPress is probably not caching your site unless that has been pre-configured or setup for you . - This should be reviewed by your WordPress admin . <p> User auditing and access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to logged in users by using plugins like " User Specific Content " . - You do have to specify on a per-post basis exactly who should have access . - You can also use the User Tracker plugin to see what people are viewing and doing when logged in. - These two plugins give you fine grained control over access and auditing . <h> However , is this a good idea ? <p> Ok , so you can get a HIPAA-compliant web host ( like LuxSci.com ) and you can setup WordPress with SSL , lock it down and setup plugins to do the needful auditing and access control . - Great . - Is this a good idea ? <p> While it does allow you to get up and running quickly , we would advise you to be very careful : <p> WordPress has had security issues in the past and is constantly being updated fixing problems , and adding new problems . - A bug in WordPress or any of the plugins that you are using could leave you in non-compliance , or worse , in breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any bugs or problems only you are . - If you do not fully understand the security- implications- of using this or that software , plugin , or setting , then you could be setting yourself up for problems . WordPress ease-of-setup can make you think that you are all set when you are not . <p> If you are using WordPress for a HIPAA-compliant site , we would highly recommend that you have a WordPress expert developer who is familiar with HIPAA review all of your plugins and settings and your policies for assigning users and access . - You might be surprised . <p> WordPress and plugins are updated constantly , you must keep the latest versions installed . If you put your site up and leave it there to rot ( e.g. never update anything ) you will have- problems- at some point . <p> Review who is writing the plugins that you are using . - You have no contract with them and have done no reviews of their code . How do you know that it does what it says and only what it says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of users , consider additional non-Wordpress security measures such as : <p> Locking down access to the site by IP address <p> Using a dedicated server instead of a shared web host <p> Encrypting the MySQL database used by your WordPress instance <p> So , it comes down to " use at your own risk " like any choice of web site content management software that you are using from a third party . - Remember , it may be advantageous to have a custom simple site developed for you rather than rely on WordPress . In this case you would have full control over what is happening and you can choose a developer who knows security and you can have a strong contract with that developer . - The price of that is much less than the price of a HIPAA violation.

As one of the most culturally and economically similar parts of the world , comparing our laws against Europes can provide a good frame of reference . <p> While the US government is focusing on stripping back red tape in a bid to kickstart business , the European Union has gone in the other direction and is stepping up its bureaucracy with the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) . These new laws come into play in May 2018 , so businesses are hard at work to make sure they will be compliant when the date swings around . <p> These two approaches show a clear difference between the two unions , one that can be attributed to cultural values as much as recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Europeans can often have a more collectivist stance . <p> When it comes to data privacy regulation , neither side of the spectrum is without its problems . Lack of regulation can lead to abuse , while too much can cause businesses to stagnate under the heavy weight of compliance . <p> So how do regulations compare on either side of the Atlantic ? In contrasting the two , we need to be mindful that the EU has been working on these rules for years , while the current US system is in a state of flux . With suggestions that the Trump administration will move data privacy regulation back to the FTC , the US rules could see a massive overhaul . <h> So Where Does the US Stand ? <p> US data privacy regulation is made up of a patchwork of different legislation . In addition to the federal laws , there are also separate state regulations that augment how data can be used and processed . <p> There is no overarching umbrella that establishes the rights of data subjects , however different pieces of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is also an expectation for enterprises to self-regulate in many cases . Some of the key data privacy laws include the Privacy Act of 1974 , HIPAA , COPPA , ECPA and the FCC interpretation of the Telecom Act . <h> The Privacy Act of 1974 <p> This act governs how personal information is collected and processed . It prohibits the disclosure of personal information without the subjects consent , unless the data is for specific purposes . These include law enforcement , government agency , administrative , congressional , statistical and archival purposes . <p> The Privacy Act of 1974 allows an individual to access and amend their records , as well as to discover whether they have been disclosed for any purposes . Agencies are mandated to have adequate security and administrative procedures in place to protect these records from unauthorized access . <h> HIPAA <p> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) is a complex piece of legislation that focuses on the health industry . It set out specific requirements for how individual health records can be processed , helping to reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIPAA , Protected Health Information ( PHI ) can only be disclosed when required and authorized by the subject . There are exceptions to this , such as when it is needed for law enforcement purposes . <p> Individuals have the right to correct any inaccurate data , while organizations must take reasonable steps to keep the communication confidential . The HITECH Act of 2009 added further regulations , forcing organizations who have suffered data breaches of more than 500 people to notify the authorities , the media and the affected individuals . <h> COPPA <p> The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act ( COPPA ) focuses on the data collection about children who are less than 13 years old . Among its stipulations , organizations must obtain parental consent before collecting or processing childrens data . Parents must also be able to review this data and reasonable steps must be taken to protect it . <h> ECPA <p> The Electronic Communications Privacy Act ( ECPA ) of 1986 covers email and other electronic communication , however it has been left behind by the growth of technology , making it relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing law enforcement to seek out emails without judicial review . All they have to do is provide a written statement saying that the content is needed for an investigation . <p> Another hole in the legislation is that emails are legally considered abandoned if they have been stored on a third party server for more than six months . This may not have been an issue in the early days of email , but the rise of online email services such as Gmail has led to many users permanently storing their emails on third party servers . <h> The FCC <p> Under the Obama Administration , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) was tasked with developing data privacy policy . It came up with a framework that would have given individuals stronger data privacy rights ( check out last weeks article to learn more ) . This has since been repealed by the Trump administration , with suggestions that data privacy policy will be moved back under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) . <h> How Are the European Laws Different ? <p> Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be moving to the much stricter General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) next year . <h> The Data Protection Directive <p> These laws came into effect in 1995 and focus on data privacy as well as individual rights . There are seven key principles : <p> Notice " subjects should be notified when their data is being collected . <p> Purpose " data should only be used for its original purpose . <p> Consent " data should not be disclosed without the consent of the subject . <p> Security " the data should be kept secure . <p> Disclosure " the subject should be made aware of who is collecting their data . <p> Access " the subject should be able to access their data and make any necessary corrections . <p> Accountability " data collectors should be held accountable if they do n't  abide by the principles . <h> The GDPR <p> In response to changes in technology , the European Union will be bringing in the General Data Protection Regulation on May 25 , 2018 . It aims to take European data requirements further and give more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the EU , making it easier for businesses to become compliant across the whole region . <p> The GDPR is built on principles of data protection by default and privacy by design . It brings individuals a range of rights , including the right to access their personal data , the right to be informed of what is being collected , the right to object to their data being processed , the right to restrict data processing , the right to have personal data removed , the right to have their data rectified and the right to have their data transferred to another service . The UK Information Commissioners Office covers these rights in more detail . <p> The new regulations also state that organizations that process data on a large scale , or that process special kinds of data , will have to appoint a Data Protection Officer . This is an individual who works independently within the company to ensure that the obligations under the GDPR are being met . <p> Under the regulations , data breaches need to be reported to the authorities within 72 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not encrypted . Penalties for non-compliance with GDPR regulations can be up to G20,000,000 or 4% of global annual turnover . <h> Which Regulations Are Best ? <p> This is a difficult question to answer , because it really depends on what ideologies you hold to be most important . The US laws are relatively sparse and can make it easy for businesses to meet the standards . The patchwork approach does present some problems , because there are often gaps in protection for individuals . The complex nature of the interrelated legislation can also make compliance confusing . <p> In comparison , companies in Europe have to meet much higher standards , which can often cost them significant sums of money . Requirements such as employing a Data Protection Officer can be particularly draining on the finances of a smaller company . Although the GDPR is expected to cost businesses in the short term , bringing in a consistent and simplified system across the whole of Europe may reduce compliance costs in the future . <p> The main upside of the European regulation is that it brings significantly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a big issue , while others would place great importance on the additional rights . <p> So which approach is best ? If you think regulations hamper the progress of business , you will probably prefer the US system . If you do n't  trust businesses to act in a responsible manner , you will most likely prefer the protections of EU data law . Its all a matter of perspective . <p> However , historically we have seen that when data security is left up to companies , it is often neglected . This results in a landscape of insecurity and endangers the sensitive data of individuals . A glaring example of this is the US healthcare system . Even with the HIPAA laws , many organizations struggle to achieve an adequate level of security , or they continue to neglect security while focusing on sales . The results of this are obvious , considering all of the breaches that have been in the news over recent years .

If you only want to send email from WebMail , then you do not need SMTP services . <p> If you imagine that the sending of an email message is analogous to the sending of a letter , then computers are " post offices " , and the " Simple Mail Transport Protocol " ( SMTP ) is the " procedure " by which a post office receives a letter or sends it off to another post office closer to the ultimate recipient . <p> SMTP is used by any program that sends an email message to deliver that message to the nearest " post office " for relaying to its destination . <p> For most people , there are really only two significant ways to send email - via a web-based interface or via an " email program " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the use of SMTP is taken care of by the web server running the web-based email package , and as a result you do n't have to worry or think about SMTP at all . <p> In the latter case , where you are using a program on your personal computer ( or mobile device ) to send email , you have to specify a " post office " for these programs to connect to such that they can send messages . These " post offices " are known as " SMTP servers " . <h> SMTP at LuxSci <p> LuxSci provides its email customers with SMTP servers that they can use with their email programs to send email from anywhere in the world ( provided they have an Internet connection ) . Messages up to 100MB in size can be sent or received at LuxSci .

This is easy to do and we have step-by-step instructions that are available to you for configuring most email programs . We also have a strict anti-spam policy . <h> Secure SMTP <p> If you are security-conscious , LuxSci also offers " Secure SMTP " , or SMTP over a secure SSL or TLS connection . This ensures that your username , password , and message contents are encrypted when you connect to our email servers . No one will be eavesdropping on your outgoing email connections ! Account administrators can optionally force all of their users to use only secure connections for SMTP . <p> Additionally , all of LuxSci 's SMTP servers support " SMTP TLS " and will automatically talk to other email servers securely if at all possible . I.e. if we are sending to another server that supports STARTTLS or another server with that support is talking to us , you email message will be automatically encrypted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If your Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) or organization does n't like you to use SMTP servers from other companies , LuxSci offers alternate ports that you can use to connect to our SMTP servers and thus get around your ISP 's overly restrictive policies .

These provisions are in a section of the bill known as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ) . <p> For organizations that are already required to abide by HIPAA ( i.e. the " Covered Entities " of HIPAA ) , HITECH adds the following requirements : <p> Mandatory yearly audits by Health and Human Services to make sure that you are meeting the HIPAA requirements <p> Explicit fines of up to $1.5 million dollars/year for disclosures of protected health information that violate the HIPAA Privacy Rules <p> Business Associate Agreements with vendors and partners who have contact with your organizations protected health information is now mandatory . <p> New mandatory reporting requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information was disclosed , to Health and Human Services , and for large enough disclosures , to the media . <p> For HIPAA Business Associates , HITECH imposes even more serious changes : <p> Business Associates are now responsible for following all HIPAA Privacy and Security regulations with respect to all protected health information that they obtain or generate . <p> Unauthorized use or disclosure by Business Associates of any protected health information leaves the Business Associate equally liable to damages and unfavorable publicity . <h> Organizations with Email and Web Services In House <p> For those with email and web services in house , you must be more vigilant now to ensure that you are abiding by all of the facets of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. - For example , see : <p> You should expect to be audited. - You should expect to pay heavy fines if there are any problems. - Worse , if there are significant issues , you should anticipate negative publicity for your organization. - Moving or keeping things in-house avoids having to place your trust in and rely upon third parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web services , means that you have to trust that your infrastructure conforms to the new HIPAA legislation . Your staff must have the expertise , training and discipline to follow these new guidelines . <h> Outsourcing Email and Web Hosting Services <p> If you are outsourcing your email or web hosting services and there might be protected health information ( PHI ) passing through or stored on those servers , then you as a customer must ensure : <p> That you have a Business Associate Agreement ( BAA ) with your vendor . <p> Your vendor recognizes your account as containing PHI . <p> Your vendor is aware of the HITECH changes to HIPAA and this is reflected in its BAA . <p> Your vendor is actively safeguarding your PHI with all methods needed to follow the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rules . <p> Why is it prudent to take these steps ? <p> Many vendors do not know what are the changes to HIPAA imposed by HITECH. - Really ! We have spoken to many professionals who are surprised that HIPAA is changing and who are now scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The HITECH changes are very significant for Business Associates . In the old scheme , all burden and liability was on the customer ( the Covered Entity ) and most Business Associate agreements just said things like " be sure to use our services in a way that does n't  violate HIPAA " . The Business Associate was under no obligation to follow HIPAA Security and Privacy rules themselves . <p> The principal responsibility for safeguarding PHI still falls on you , the Covered Entity. - If you do not bother to check and are using a vendor that is not updated for HITECH it is your negligence and can result serious penalties if there is any kind of breach . <p> So , now is the time to review your PHI practices and policies. - Check with your vendors and be sure that they are in step with the new legislation and that you have Business Associate Agreements that covers HITECH by February 17 , 2010 deadline . <h> The Burden on the Business Associates <p> The HITECH changes described above place significant new burdens on Business Associates. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties in the event of a HIPAA privacy breach in their systems , so they must : <p> Know what information in your account is PHI . <p> Make sure that information is backed up , transmitted securely , and encrypted if needed . <p> Implement access controls to track who could have accessed that information both from the public interfaces and through their back end systems . <p> Track uses and disclosures of that information . <p> Ensure that all parts of their infrastructure that may be used to store or transmit PHI are covered by the Security and Privacy Rule Requirements . <p> Ensure that all staff that may be accessing your PHI in any way are trained and authorized . <p> Report unauthorized disclosures of PHI to Health and Human Services and possibly the media . <p> Here is a short overview of the vast checklist of action items that must be completed , policies that must be documented , training that must occur , etc . <p> It is important to note that Business Associates need to know what is PHI on their systems so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that this data is protected. - If they leave these services " up to you " and you are doing things that are " not right with HIPAA " , then they have an explicit obligation to stop you or to terminate your account. - If they " just let things slide " or " pay no attention " , then they themselves are being willfully negligent and can face some serious penalties if there is an issue. - If you use a vendor that you know is lax , then you share that liability . And the burden of liability is very significant . <p> What about liability waivers ? If the Business Associate has you sign a waiver where you agree to assume the liability of using their services inappropriately , that does not necessarily protect them from being sued by Health and Human Services or from bad press it does allow them to counter-sue you , however. - It certainly motivates you to make sure that you are following HIPAA . <p> What about vendor accounts with no Business Associate Agreement ? Sure , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement with the vendor , but what if they do n't  and are using the vendors services for PHI anyway ? - If the vendor were to become aware of this , it would be incumbent upon the vendor to either establish a contract and start protecting the PHI , or to terminate the customers services . <h> What does this all mean ? <p> Vendors will probably have to revise their privacy policies and Business Associate Agreements . <p> Vendors may need to impose strict policies and usage restrictions on HIPAA customers so as to ensure that PHI is safeguarded to the maximum amount reasonably possible in their system . <p> Vendor accounts used for HIPAA may be less flexible than previously in terms of how they can be used and configured . <p> Expect to sign liability waivers for services where the Business Associate can not be expected to monitor or control the flow of PHI. - I.e. web site hosting where you are in control of your web site content , or email hosting if you resist encrypting all email messages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do some things that are insecure ( and do not involve PHI ) and some things that are secure ( do involve PHI ) , you should expect to setup separate accounts with separate levels of restriction. - The better you- compartmentalize PHI and regular data , the more reliably you and the Business Associate can safeguard that PHI . <p> If you are interested in how this applies to services from LuxSci , see : <p> Changes to HIPAA as a result of HITECH provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act are going into effect on February 17 , 2010. - These changes seriously impact the requirements on Business Associates and impose significant liability penalties on HIPAA violations. - For a discussion of these and how they relate to email and web services , see : HITECH 2010 : HITECH Impact on Email and Web Outsourcing . <p> Starting on February , 2010 , the HIPAA rules are enhanced by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. - The HITECH section of this act implements significant penalties for breaches of HIPAA and requires that the business partners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Security Rules , and face liability if there are any unauthorized disclosures. - For more information on what HITECH has done to HIPAA , see : HIPAA 2010 : HITECH Impact on Email and Web Outsourcing . <p> Protected Health Information ( ePHI ) . - Such customers , when they must abide by the HIPAA and HITECH laws governing medical privacy , must comply with a long set of regulations that covers , among other

This established net neutrality rules and also reclassified ISPs as carriers under Title II of the Communications Act . This meant that ISPs would be subjected to a new set of regulations . <p> ISPs opposed the reclassification , claiming that they were disadvantaged against companies such as Google and Facebook , who did n't  have to abide by the additional regulations . A common response to this is that people can choose which search engine or social media company they use , however they often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monopolies in many locations . <p> In October 2016 , the FCC passed The Order which set out the rules on how carriers could collect and use customer data . The new framework required individuals to opt in to share any sensitive information , but also enabled them to opt out of sharing most non-sensitive data . They mandated that ISPs must implement adequate data security policies as well , along with many other rules . <p> The framework was originally scheduled to be enacted on March 2 , 2017 , but the change of government paused the roll-out . On March 23 , the Senate voted to repeal these laws , followed by a House vote on the 28th that also voted to undo them . On Monday , Trump signed a resolution to reverse the laws , putting a halt to any further online privacy regulations . <p> Most of the arguments against the privacy framework focused on free market ideals and not burdening businesses with additional regulation . While there may be some merit to these claims , the market for internet access is hardly free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cancellation fees often mean that consumers do n't  have much choice in their ISP . They can not easily hop over to another provider if they do n't  like the service . While many individuals may feel trapped into using the services of huge companies like Google , they can switch over to Bing or another search engine with ease . Nevertheless , it was deemed that these regulations were unfair and the privacy framework was repealed . <h> What Does the Repeal Mean ? <p> Under the Obama Administrations privacy framework , ISPs would have only been able to collect and share your sensitive information if you opted in , while you would have had the option to opt out of most other data processing activities . <p> Without these protections , privacy advocates fear that ISPs will ramp up their data collection and selling practices . There is a lot of uncertainty in place , because the existing FCC policy is confusing and nebulous . Strangely enough , the FCC regulates ISPs through the Telecom Act of 1934 . As this law clearly was n't designed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open to the FCCs interpretation . <p> The privacy framework was brought in when the FCC was headed by a Democrat and the rules were essentially based on their understanding of the Telecom Act . The FCC is currently headed by a Republican , which means that the Act is subject to their interpretation for the time being . In a Washington Post article , the current chairman of the FCC , Ajit Pai , stated that he intends to return the regulation of ISP privacy practices to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) . He claims that the FTC is a more experienced entity for forming and policing privacy regulations . If ISP privacy regulation is moved back to the FTC in the future , it is likely that privacy protections for individuals will remain weaker . <h> What Can ISPs Do Without Your Permission ? <p> Your ISP tracks you . Some of this is for a good reason " the more things they know about the internet habits of their customers , the better they can tune their networks to optimize traffic . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much data is transferred . They cant see what you specifically do on HTTPS-secured websites , but they do know that you have visited them . <p> This information is valuable to advertisers . An ISP also knows your name , physical address and IP address , which can make the data even more useful . They have piles of data concerning your habits and interests , alongside your personal information , which allows advertisers to target you very- precisely . <p> Your ISP is n't able to sell data based on individuals or specific groups , because of laws regarding individual identifiable data . Instead , ISPs admit that they use your data in aggregate for targeted advertising . Many ISPs consider the mere use of their service by an individual as consent ( which like a browse-by agreement , is highly dubious ) , however most do have the option to opt out . This will allow you to avoid ads , but it does n't  necessarily stop them from collecting your data . <p> It is also likely that the repeal will enable ISPs to use supercookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored locally on your device . Supercookies are Unique Identifier Headers that are injected by an ISP at the network level . They allow an ISP to build up user profiles based on their online behavior . These profiles can then be sold to third parties , who use them for advertising . Under the old FCC , users should have been able to opt out of their ISP sharing this data , but it is unknown what will happen now . <h> How Is Your Online Security Affected ? <p> The repealed framework was set to bolster security standards for ISPs . The Order required ISPs to employ data security practices that were adequate for the scope of their activities . It also required them to notify the FCC , the FBI , the Secret Service and the affected customers in the event of a breach . Without these rules in place , it is only natural to assume that data security standards will remain lax . <p> There is also the potential for ISPs to set up SSL-proxies that their customers are forced to use . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , and the lack of encryption would have terrible ramifications for user and business security . Our article on SSL can help to clarify its role in keeping users safe online . <p> Data collection is never good for your online security . The more organizations that collect and store your data , the more chances for your data to be breached and fall into the hands of hackers . Because the repeal seems to open up the gates for ISP related data collection as well as loosen security standards , this significantly heightens everyones- risk . <h> What Can You Do If You Care About Your Privacy ? <p> The first thing that you should do is inquire whether your ISP enables you to opt-out of their targeted advertising . This may not stop them from collecting data on you , but at least its a start . One of the simplest ways that you can stop your ISP from tracking your online activity is by downloading and using TOR browser . It encrypts and randomly bounces your online activity around the world to help conceal what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic to your WebMail and Email , you can use LuxScis VPN access . This will encrypt all of your traffic between your computer and the LuxSci servers , in a way that is safe from SSL proxies . If you would prefer to take things a step further , you can use- a full blown VPN . These encrypt all of the traffic from the VPN client on your computer , so all your ISP can see is that you are using- a VPN . A VPN is a great way to both secure yourself online and stop your ISP from collecting your data . Research your VPN provider carefully before you sign up for one , because many vendors aggressively market their services with affiliate schemes . <h> What Happens Now ? <p> Honestly , no one knows for sure . Now that the FCC privacy framework has been repealed , it is likely that ISPs will see much more limited oversight . This is worrying , because ISPs have a long track record of putting their financial interests ahead of their- customers privacy. - It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " accounts will be exempt from - these consumer-oriented privacy invasion tactics . - There is also the potential that government eavesdropping will expand under this new direction . <p> If you really care about your online privacy and security , you cant rely on the government to protect you . The best thing you can do in the short term is to get a VPN " without the privacy framework in place , you are simply being exposed to too much risk .

<p> There are actually many significant downsides to accepting general customer requests via email ; downsides which can actually cause friction , slow the response process , or result in missed opportunities . - We will cover many of these issues , below . - The solution , is to use targeted specific web-based forms to collect customer requests ; we will also discuss why this is a better approach . <h> The pitfalls of using inbound email for customer requests <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as you use general inbound email for customer requests : <p> Customer Error = Lost Opportunities : If the customer misspells the email address , the email will not make it to you and the customer may or may not get or see the bounce message . - If the customer does get a bounce s/he may be aggravated by the need to resend , even though it was the customers own mistake . - This can result in lost sales as the customer " does n't  bother " or is more annoyed by contacting you than reaching out to others . <p> Missing/Delayed Messages = Lost Opportunities : When receiving email from the Internet at large , there are many , many reasons why email messages can be lost or delayed . - When you have no control over the sending and the delivery of these messages , some will be lost and that can cause you to appear non-responsive to current and potential customers . - This is never good for a companys image . <p> Increasing Spam : When you put your contact email address " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company web site ) for customers to use , it inevitably is found by spambots who will start sending you spam . - At a minimum , this causes more work for your employees and more risk that they will delete a real email by mistake . - At worst , you must implement good spam filters which can result in misclassification of some legitimate messages as spam and result in lost opportunities . <p> Incomplete Requests : Despite their best intentions , customers and sales leads very often do not provide all of the information needed when sending in free-form email requests . - E.g. they may ask for help with something , but omit key contextual information that would enable a technician to actually provide assistance or they may ask for a sales quote and not provide enough detail to make such a quote . - As a result , employees will have to start a back-and-forth email exchange to clarify the request . - This takes time and can cause frustration . - For Sales , every extra back-and-forth - can result in decreased sales conversions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution and increases customer dissatisfaction . <p> Identify Verification : Regular inbound email is very insecure , with no controls in place to ensure that the sender really is who s/he purports to be . - When accepting requests for action via email , you run the risk of performing sensitive actions at the bequest of unauthorized people . - This can result in serious security , privacy , and/or business continuity issues for your actual customer . - While this is not really an issue for Sales and general information requests ; it can be a serious issue for customer support requests . <h> The Solution : Targeted Web Forms <p> The solution to all of the issues with inbound email is to have customers use forms on your web site instead . - You can still accept email from customers that really want that , but you can push most customers to web forms for a better experience and faster result . <p> How do web forms solve the above pitfalls ? <p> Customer Satisfaction : You configure your web form to deliver its contents to you via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer can not make errors specifying the delivery address , as the customer has no control over that . <p> Timely Messages : Your web form is on your web site and delivers directly to your employees ( via email , and/or other mechanisms ) . - As you can be in control of the entire delivery pathway and can set up forms to have redundant delivery mechanisms , you can eliminate the possibility that you will not get customer messages or that they will be delayed . <p> Less Spam : By using web forms , you do not need to publish your internal email addresses on the Internet thus significantly reducing spam . - Additionally , your forms can deliver to dedicated email addresses that only accept email from these forms thus completely eliminating spam or you can receive the form data via means other than email ( e.g. by it being saved to your database , etc. ) . - Additionally , you can protect your web forms from form spam using Captcha or simpler equally effective techniques . <p> Complete Information : A web form allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validate that they have presented it , before the request is submitted . - E.g. , for Support : " what is your account number " , " what is the product that you are using " . - For Sales : request mailing address information , ask what the sales lead is currently using , which specific product(s) are of interest , and which other products the lead may like to also learn about . - The possibilities are endless . - By steering customers to enter required information , your responses can be more accurate and less clarification is needed before presenting a solution . <p> Identify Verification : Web forms can be password protected or placed in a " members " area of your web site . - The identity verification used to access the form can then be extended to the request submitted through the form allowing you to be much more sure who the person submitting the request really is . <p> Clearly , you can many different web forms on your site for different purposes . - This is exactly why many sites have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , or have " quote request " forms instead of asking customers to merely email in any questions that they may have . <h> Using LuxSci SecureForm to Streamline Web Forms <p> Your web forms need to " post " their data somewhere . - E.g. to some server-side program that processed the data , saves it , and sends it on to your employees in the way that you need . - LuxScis SecureForm service provides a powerful easy-to-configure back-end solution that can be attached to any web site forms . - It allows you to get your form data securely , without form spam , and in any format that you need . - E.g.

" - I.e. , if you connect to " port 443 , " then you are usually connecting to a web server over SSL/TLS. - If you are connecting to port 25 , then you are connecting to an outbound email ( SMTP ) service , etc. - The ports used for various services are standardized , so most providers use the same ports for the same services . - Knowing the port number gives a good indication of what your secure connection is for . <p> So , the message data itself is secured . - However , your activity is plainly visible . - As a case in point : if you were visiting a pornography site or a dating site or a terrorist propaganda site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you visited and what you did would not be known ; however , the number of requests you made of the site and how long you browsed it would be known . <p> Similarly , if you were trying to access your personal email from work , then your work network can identify what you are doing and choose to block non-work email activity from the work network . or it may alert your manager to this activity . <h> What can you do about this ? <p> There is no way to be completely anonymous on the Internet. - No matter what you do , an organization with enough resources can track you . If your level of concern does not rise to the level of hiding from nation state organizations , then there are steps you can take which provide some pretty effective protections. - These include : <p> Use a VPN . This will encrypt ALL of your Internet traffic from your computer until it emerges from your VPN providers network . - This hides your location and also hides your traffic from those how might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home or office network , in the coffee shop hot spot you are using , in your ISP , etc . ) <p> Use The Onion Router ( TOR ) . TOR encrypts your traffic and obfuscates the route it takes over the Internet. - This makes it harder to see what your traffic was and very difficult to match up your activity- to where you are actually connecting to . - Use of TOR makes your connections very much slower , but it is very effective at obfuscating your Internet activities against non-nation-state adversaries . - I.e. against common hacking groups and techniques . <p> Of course , if all you are concerned about is the protection of your data and not obfuscating your activities , then SSL and TLS should be sufficient in most cases . - It is certainly sufficient to meet US government compliance laws such as HIPAA and PCI .

Security reasons , of course . We are aware of : <p> Poor Security Questions : very often users have poorly chosen answers to security questions , <p> Hackers : that people often try to use password reset systems to gain unauthorized access to users accounts <p> Lack of Information : users often do not have enough solid information in their profiles to- reliably- verify their- identities <p> By manually processing these requests , we can effectively block password resets in the face of poor identity verification information and subjectively identify " fishy " requests . <p> However , we have come to determine that this manual process , while it provides the best security , is not actually in the best interests of our customers because : <p> Time : Manual identity verification takes time and delays in password resets can be- detrimental- to our customers ability to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our user security questions in the last few years so that the questions and answers are generally of much better quality than they used to be . <p> Mobile Phones : Most people have mobile phones capable of receiving text messages now and these can be used for identity verification . <p> Simulating our Manual Process : We find that we can provide an automated self-service password reset process that- simulates- our manual review and verification process to a very large degree without a significant loss in security . <h> How the New Process Works <p> Customers can now use the " Password Reset " button on the LuxSci WebMail login pages to begin the process of resetting their passwords . <p> Enter your login username <p> Enter a image code ( Captcha ) to ensure an actual person is filling out the form <p> Based on the information available in the your LuxSci Profile , you will be presented with options for verifying your identity <p> Once you identity is verified , you are taken to a password reset page <p> Your password is reset <p> A notice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text message ) addresses informing you of the password reset . <h> Identity Verification <p> Alternate Email : An email can be sent to one of your configured alternate email addresses <p> SMS / Text Message : A verification code can be sent to your cell phone <h> Two Factor Verification <p> By default , any password reset for any user of a LuxSci account requires verification of at least 2 pieces of information , e.g. <p> Answer your Security Question and then Send you an Email <p> Answer your Security Question and then Send you a Text message <p> Send you a Text message and then send you an Email <p> Based on the information available in your Profile , LuxSci allows you to choose all available pairs of options . - E.g. if you have an alternate email address , an SMS address , and a security question , you could choose any of the above 3 options , based on what is available to you . <p> Use of two separate factors ensures that just because someone could discover the answer to your security question , that- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Furthermore , when using an alternate email address or text message phone number , you are required to explicitly enter the address or phone number to be used and that must match the one saved in your profile . - You are given some hints ( e.g. the phone number with all but the last 4 digits obscured ) , but this gives a little more- protection and does not give out your alternate email- addressees- or phone numbers unless the person requesting the password already knows them . <h> Single Factor Verification <p> For customers that are not in high security accounts and who wish to allow password resets using only a single piece of information , their account administrators can enable " single factor " identity verification . - This can be done in the " Advanced- Administration- &gt; Security &gt; Passwords &amp; Login " page . <p> With single factor verification , the end user can reset his/her password after verifying only one of the above pieces of information . - However , if the user does have enough information for use of two factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all administrative users must use two factor instead of single factor verification . <h> Prohibiting Self Service Password Resets <p> For customers who do not want to allow their users to reset their own passwords , they can disable self-service password requests and provide instructions for what their users should do if they have lost their passwords . <p> For all users in a domain : in the " Security &gt; Passwords &amp; Login " page of the domain management area <p> For a specific user in the users configuration page . <h> Further Protections <p> In addition to the identity verification processes described above , LuxSci offers : <p> Notifications : LuxSci sends an email notice to all contact email and text message addresses belonging to a user when the users password is reset in this way . - LuxSci also sends notices to customers when any attempt is made to reset the users passwords even if that attempt is aborted or failed . - This is done via our automated our login failure notification system . - Via these mechanisms , customers can be aware of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account protections , if needed . <p> Rate Limits : Only a few requests for password resets can made per hour for each requestor ( IP Address ) . - Additionally , guessing security question answers and the answers to other identity verification questions is limited to only a few failures per hour . - This effectively limits brute force guessing attacks on the password reset system . <p> Proactive Information Updates : Starting next week , we will be proactively prompting WebMail users to update their contact information periodically to ensure that it is both up-to-date and that there are multiple factors available . <p> Avoiding Weak Two Factor . - As some folks have their alternate email on their cell phone , LuxSci will not permit that combination of 2 factors to be a valid method for identity verification if there is any other , better two factor combination available ( e.g. security question plus text message ) . - The combination of alternate email address and text message is a " weak two factor " as access to ones cell phone may provide access to both of those factors .

I oversee a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals . With so many people involved , having fast , secure text messaging is critical to how we relay doctor 's orders and changes in patient status , and get nursing updates and therapy reports .

You can not get this type of service with other hosting providers , and definitely not if your business must meet HIPAA requirements . <p> Finally , they have a wealth of educational knowledge on their site and blogs , which proves their credibility in online security and HIPAA matters . You know you are in good hands when the CEO knows what ' TLS ' means !

In my twenty years doing business on the Internet I have never received as professional a service from all departments of a company as LuxSci has given me . I 've got just a single account , and still I get the royal treatment . <p> The email and web hosting services they provide are also rock solid . In my two years a customer , I remember only a single , short-lived , service outage . I opened a support ticket as soon as I noticed it , and received a reply within ten minutes--at 4 o'clock in the morning their time . I was provided a full explanation of the situation and was informed that problem was actively being worked on by the engineers . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ones keep their customers in the loop when something does go wrong , as soon as it happens .

I have been a customer for the past 3 years and have been very pleased with your product and feel I am getting my moneys worth ... time for you guys to start looking into the ISP market because the service I get from you is better then any of the ISP 's I have seen to date . Kudos and thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fresno , CA <p> " After using LuxSci for only a few months now , I feel I must let you know that the quality of service is truly outstanding and indeed beyond my expectations . LuxSci has all the features I need . The fully fledged and powerful email composition screen which impresses me most ; I also no longer receive any spam in my INBOX , thanks to your Email Defense . Your customer service is one of the best . I am amazed to see that some of my questions have been answered in less than an hour and that the responses were fully detailed and to my satisfaction . Email runs in your veins , I must say . Though not an inexpensive email service , in my opinion , I must say that with the service I am getting , LuxSci is worth every penny I spend . I intend to keep LuxSci to serve my default email address with my own domain for the rest of my life . Salutations to Dr. Erik Kangas and LuxSci staff . LuxSci truly deserves its meaning --- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emails . " <p> " It seems strange that anyone would rave about a ' simple ' Email Provider ? Seriously , what 's there to do , other than pass along emails and house them on a server ? Well , that 's what I used to think , too ... before I set up my account with LuxSci . <p> The tools offered by this company to handle enterprise and mail order emails are simply fantastic : custom filters that route your email seamlessly , backup/restore services , aliasing and a set of Junk Mail tools that truly makes the SPAM disappear before I even see it . My incoming mail has been reduced from 300 per day to 30 with no ' False Positives ' . No email program has ever come close to this level of accurate SPAM filtering . <p> Perhaps more important is the Customer Service . You 're far more likely to wait a matter of minutes , rather than days for a response to a problem . You 'll never hear from a Robot , and they actually provide REAL answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically condescending , ' Well you need to contact your Email Software Provider ' . These guys know their stuff and are more responsive than a 9-11 call . <p> " I 've had lots of different mail services and I 've got to say that yours is amazing . Spam filtering is terrific . I 've never been happier . I just wanted to let you know that I 'll be spreading the word ! " <p> Rob Rettberg , TheOtherStudio <p> " LuxSci has been a pleasure to work with . The level of support we 've received from them has been top-notch . From the smallest user issue to complex custom work , LuxSci has delivered service far above what I expected . Best of all , uptime with LuxSci has been 100% . " <p> David Cayem , DelphiForums <p> " I email to commend LuxSci 's excellent email and web services , which in my opinion , are similar to a well-built German motor vehicle . Very reliable technology with constant innovations ( but no gimmicks ) and slick WebMail . Moreover , never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are replied to within minutes at all times of day . Keep up the good work ! " <p> Rick Wild <p> " LuxSci is the best hosted email solution I have used . The diligence , customer focus and hard work to maintain a great service is compelling . If you want a great email solution with great support - use LuxSci . " <p> James Hammersley , CEO , Win ! Consulting <p> " Over the course of the last two weeks I have been working with LuxSci to configure secure email for two domains - one for our Homeowners Association and another for our family . I spent a few days researching e-mail providers . I was very fortunate to have found LuxSci . LuxSci provides the absolutely most reliable and secure e-mail service I could find at a very reasonable price and LuxSci 's support is absolutely first class ! They worked with me to add third party SSL certificates for all of our e-mail . Everything works very smoothly and the administrative interfaces are fantastic . I want to thank LuxSci for an excellent job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homeowners Association <p> " We are a networking solutions company that provides services to small and medium sized businesses , many of which need secure and reliable email solutions . We found LuxSci after several hours of web research . Most hosting companies offer email as an afterthought and their support and range of email services reflects that . LuxSci is totally different . The first account we transferred to them was complex , but we had a response to our first technical inquiry in five minutes . Since then , we have switched our own account and several of our clients to LuxSci . They all have different needs and levels of complexity , but LuxSci has handled every request quickly and correctly . None of our accounts have had ANY downtime . As a technical company , we also appreciate the monthly newsletters and constant additions of new features and services . In our fifteen plus years of business , we are usually reluctant to recommend companies without reservations--LuxSci is a notable exception . " <p> Steve Fuller , CS III <p> " LuxSci is an exceptional resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust and reliable . Having suffered through a number of flaky e-mail/web hosting companies over the years , some very large names , LuxSci is a breath of fresh air . I was pleased to find a hosting company that ' gets it ' and provides services that are crucial to my business , but not common in the marketplace - primarily a well run secure POP/IMAP/SMTP service and excellent configurable spam-filtering tools that allow me to view and adjust my quarantine . The support for SPF DNS records is much appreciated as well . I recommend them to my friends and clients without hesitation . My sincere thanks and compliments ! " <p> " Thank you very much for getting my service setup so quickly . Within an hour from subscribing to the email-only service , I was up and running . The site was very intuitive and easy to use , so I was able to configure my account rapidly . Also , I want to praise your company for your customer service response . For all of my inquiries/tickets , I got satisfied responses very quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service is very competitively priced . I will recommend you to everyone , especially since I am an IT web consultant working for many fortune 500 companies . Last company I worked with was Sony Pictures and am currently working as a consultant at directv.com . " <p> Bryan Beam of BBInc.tv Inc . <p> " LuxSci has been absolutely critical to my business . Hotmail has gone down , Yahoo has gone down , my ISP 's servers have crashed ... but LuxSci has remained up . This is one of the best services I have ever used . Furthermore , they provide the finest support that I have ever received for any service , ever , for anything that I 've ever purchased . It goes well beyond professional - this is a gold plated service . I 'm impressed . " <p> Nathan Dornbrook , Senior Security Consultant , ThruPoint <p> " I am extremely satisfied with your security features and with the extent of knowledge of your support staff . You provide a solid , reliable service and also manage to continue to add more thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been fortunate ( maybe unfortunate ) to work with a lot of different hosts and I must tell you guys ... I simply have never experienced the level of service you provide , nor the amazing speed with which you handle support issues . I 'm simply amazed at how easily I 've been able to get things set up , and am sitting here just in shock at how quick you guys are . Kudos for you , there are plenty of other hosting companies out there that could take a lesson from you all . " <p> " The Internet and my web site have grown to become essential components of my business . The expertise and support that LuxSci continually delivers is crucial to maintaining the worldwide contact I need to succeed . LuxSci provides peace of mind ! " <p> " Everyone knows that technology is n't perfect and I think that the true test of a service provider is how they react when the unexpected happens . LuxSci has always kept me informed of exactly what is going on and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the good work ! " <p> Dominic Fitzpatrick <p> " I wanted to congratulate you on your service ; the reduction in Spam is incredible , and the speed of delivery is stunning . I am recommending you to all of my friends and associates ! You can quote me on that ! " <p> " Well , I 've been with LuxSci Email hosting for a few months , and true to say I 've found them faultless so far . Was a bit nervous to begin with going with a Foreign provider . What sets them apart for me is their attention to detail . Always keen to ensure the Customer is kept informed at all times . Unlike the experience with my old provider . Really a first class effort , fantastic features and great value too ! " <p> Dave Nunn , United Kingdom <p> " Wanted to thank you for offering a very fine service . For the last 8 years I have been managing my own Exchange Server , server-side virus checking , and Spam control . I have now switched to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at lower cost of operation . In particular I am very pleased with the performance and availability of your servers , and with the effectiveness of the SPAM control that you offer .

C. , Sacramento , California <p> " When the company I work for was searching for a good email system we found our way to LuxSci and were very impressed with how helpful their staff was in assisting us . Shortly after obtaining service , I built a web site for the company . I needed some help uploading the site and once again was so impressed with how helpful everyone I spoke to was . Since then , I have signed up with LuxSci for my personal email and to host 2 additional web sites that I have . There are no delays with LuxSci ; everything is handled efficiently and easily . I am very happy with this service and would recommend LuxSci to my friends and family . " <p> Carol Ray <p> " I just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever used for email . They have real features , not glitz , especially in terms of security and unbelievable support ! That is what I like here ; keep it up ! " <p> Adam Kanis <p> " We are frequently approached to endorse companies offering a wide range of email services at The Real Estate Library . To date , we 've declined , because frankly they did not deliver the expertise needed to support their lofty claims . Not so with LuxSci . If you need sophisticated email services and hosting , you need look no further . Contact LuxSci today , .... we did . " <p> " After working with LuxSci for two years , I 've personally felt that they are one of the most responsive organizations I 've ever had the pleasure of working with ; they have gone above and beyond the call of duty on numerous occasions . I highly recommend them to companies seeking email outsourcing services . " <p> Rick Gates , President &amp; CEO of Net Assets <p> " The excellent service offered by LuxSci is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions , but their technical support is fast , professional , and understanding . In an industry full of improvised and unprofessional providers , LuxSci is a true model to be followed . " <p> Cesar Pinera , Mexico City , Mexico <p> " It is hard to find services that are as flexible and inexpensive as yours , much less one that responds as quickly as you have . It reflects a level of professionalism and pride in one 's work that I 'm sure will be evident in your future service . I am looking forward to working with your company for my client and hopefully others as the need arises . " <p> Alan Mishell , President A-LAN Computing Solutions , Inc . <p> " LuxSci excels in its quality of service , its professionalism , and its caring and responsive customer support ! I get offers from friends and business associates all the time to move my web and email services to other providers , many of which would be free , but I would NEVER leave LuxSci ! I tell everybody that I know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're getting . It 's almost " too good to be true " , but I honestly feel you guys are just simply put ... DIFFERENT . " <p> Brenda K. Burton , President of MedExtend , Inc . <p> " IMAP is the best kept secret in Email . It is the quickest and most efficient way to manage your Email ; you decide what messages will be retrieved to your machine , whereas with POP you will be forced to wait through lengthy mail downloads to get to the messages you know are important . The IMAP methodology is helpful for power users who might desire multiple mailboxes ( for example , some messages they might want kept on their home machine , whereas others belong on their work machine ) . LuxSci goes the extra mile in delivering a secure line of communication with their servers . If people knew that their interaction with most other mail service providers was exposing their mailbox password to anybody who happens to be eavesdropping on their network connection , I suspect many would be thinking twice about using anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a very few mail hosting companies who offer just that plus the option of a functionally robust browser interface . " <p> Steve Boriotti of Security Appraisers <p> " We are particularly pleased with the close personal contact and fast response we get with LuxSci .

" <p> Erik Peterson , Yanntek , Inc . <p> " LuxSci consulted and developed a distributed database to support a web portal for one of our largest clients . It was an extremely complicated project involving database design and sophisticated scripting to integrate web forms with the back-end database .

" <p> Thaddeus Badowski , Webmaster of Pathways Gallery <p> " LuxSci provides reliable backups , efficient spam-filtering , and first-rate customer service . Although the last anti-spam service I used was offering IMAP accounts , customer service was only provided through an e-mail list , and I could n't get information about basic issues like storage and backup . LuxSci even re-wrote some of the code for the WebMail to provide better compatibility with my Mac OSX web browser .

I was able to upgrade bandwidth and disk space without having to call someone or wait 2-3 business days for my changes to take effect . I 've tried free web hosts and expensive web hosts ( over $250 a month ) that still do n't allow instant upgrades and changes to users accounts . I 've never had comparable service to LuxSci either !

This article describes the ins and outs of email , explains these terms , and helps you figure out what services and features you need from your personal or business email service provider . <p> Every email provider supplies you with three fundamental services : <p> A way to send email <p> A way to receive email <p> A way to store received email , at least temporarily <p> The difference between email providers , and their cost , comes down to the support they offer , versatility , security , and extent of each of these services . In the next sections , we discuss each of these concepts in detail and consider many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . First , we will define a few concepts central to email the types of programs ( a.k.a " email clients " ) used for email . <p> Email Clients . <p> Email clients are computer programs that run on your computer , laptop , tablet , or smartphone which enable you to perform actions such as composing and sending email messages , retrieving your new email messages , and looking at your old email messages . Examples of popular email clients include : Mozilla Thunderbird , Microsoft Outlook , Mac Mail , Entourage , and iPhone Mail ( read more about these ) . <p> Email clients are characterized by being installed on a computer of device in that you have or have access to , and requiring you to configure them with details of your email provider so that they can connect to your provider to send and receive your email . <p> WebMail . <p> WebMail ( a.k.a. " web-based email " or " browser-based email " ) is like an email client in that it allows you to compose and send email messages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email activities . However , unlike an email client , WebMail is a web browser-based program that runs in part in your computers web browser and in part on your email providers web servers and which is accessible via any computer connected to the Internet which has a compatible web browser , such as a recent version of Internet Explorer , Firefox , Opera , Safari , Chrome , etc . <p> WebMail is notably different from an email client in that you do not have to configure it or install any special software to use it , beyond a good web browser. - You simply " login " , and it works. - However , WebMail often permits customization through preferences and settings that you can manipulate to make it work and behave to your specifications . <h> Sending Email : SMTP <p> Any email message that you send is passed along from your computer through any number of intermediate email servers to the server on which the recipient of your message receives his or her email . All of these email servers talk to each other via a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Simple Mail Transport Protocol. - Thus , your outgoing email server ( i.e. the server through which you send email messages ) is also known as your SMTP server . <p> Every email provider has one or more SMTP servers for your use . Some providers allow you to connect to these servers directly so that you can send email using your Email Client ; other providers do not permit you to connect to their SMTP servers directly , requiring you to send all email via their WebMail applications ( which use the SMTP servers behind the scenes ) . <p> Why would an email service provider not want clients to connect directly to its SMTP servers ? Using an Email Client , you may be able to easily send lots of email messages , whereas with WebMail it is difficult to send many messages in a short period of time . - Allowing you to send lots of email messages in a short time exposes your email provider to the risk that you may 1 . load down his servers with excessive amounts of email , and 2. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have strict limits on sending through their SMTP servers and other providers have special services for customers needing to send large quantities of email . <p> If your email provider does provide you with access to its SMTP servers , it may or may not support " SMTP Relaying " . Support for " SMTP Relaying " means that your provider allows you to use its SMTP server to send email to people whose email is not managed by your provider . For example , if you are using the SMTP servers of LuxSci to send email to bob@luxsci.net , this would not require SMTP Relaying because LuxScis servers handle Bobs email , and thus they HAVE to let you connect to them to send him email ( or else Bob would unfortunately never receive any email ) . - However , if you are using LuxScis servers to send email to bob@hotmail.com , this would require SMTP Relaying because LuxSci does not manage the email for addresses at hotmail.com . <p> What 's wrong with SMTP Relaying ? Nothing , as long as your email provider restricts who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  , then anyone could send email through their servers to anyone else , making these servers ideal tools for hackers desiring to send SPAM ( such a wide open server is called an " Open Relay " and is almost always a guaranteed to be on email blacklists ) . For this reason , most email providers require you to Authenticate yourself when using their SMTP servers for sending email . This often means that you need to send your correct username and password to their server before it will allow you to send your email . This process is commonly called SMTP Authentication . Some email providers go a step further and also provide you with Secure SMTP . Secure SMTP ( along with other secure services described below ) encrypts the communication between your computer and the server using TLS or SSL such that no one can eavesdrop and detect your username , password , or message contents the communication channel is secure . <p> What is right for you ? If you wish to use an email client for sending and reading your email , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . If you are very security-conscious , you should ask if they support Secure SMTP. - LuxSci provides both SMTP Relaying ( with authentication ) , Secure SMTP , and additional email encryption options . <h> Receiving Email : POP , IMAP , WebMail <p> If someone sends you an email message , how do you obtain it and read it ? There are three basic ways to do this which differ in usefulness depending on your needs . <p> WebMail . WebMail applications have several advantages : <p> Read It Anywhere They allow you to read ( and send ) email from any computer that is connected to the Internet and that has a modern web browser . <p> No Special Software Beyond a modern web browser , which comes with most computers , no special software is required to use WebMail , and no time needs to be spent configuring software . <p> Backed-up &amp; Safe Your email service provider is responsible for backing up your email messages . Your email is stored on your service providers servers , so if your personal computer crashes , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WebMail include : <p> Internet Required You can not view any of your email unless you are connected to the Internet . The speed by which you can manage your email is related to your Internet connection speed it can be slow or fast ! <p> Disk Space Since your email messages are stored on your email providers servers , they take up his disk space . Your email provider may limit the amount of disk space you can use , or charge you a premium for additional disk space . If you exceed your allotted disk space , you could be charged a fine or your services could be suspended ! Most free email services are very strict about disabling your account if you exceed your quota . These days , disk space is not much of an issue unless you are an email hoarder . <p> Features Your providers WebMail program may not provide you with as many features as you would have if you used an Email Client for reading your email . The features provided by different providers WebMail clients vary greatly make sure yours provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include : sending attachments , viewing attachments online , viewing messages written in particular languages , address books , personalities , spell checking , read receipts , SPAM filtering , autoresponders , email aliases , drag and drop , uploading and downloading many files at once , etc. , etc . <p> A good email provider will supply you with WebMail services and one or both of IMAP or POP ( see below ) and possibly also ActiveSync for use with Email Clients and mobile devices . <p> IMAP is a protocol , i.e. a language used by an Email Client program to talk to your email providers servers . It stands for Internet Mail Access Protocol . IMAP is one of the two most popular protocols that can be used by Email Clients to allow you to access your email messages . IMAP allows you to keep some or all of your email messages stored on your service providers servers , thus sharing many of the pros and cons of WebMail . Your service provider may offer- Secure IMAP ( a.k.a . IMAPS ) which makes sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the server can not be eavesdropped upon . Secure IMAP connections are encrypted via the same technology that encrypts secure WebMail SSL ( or TLS ) . - IMAP does not generally permit sending of email messages , you would still use SMTP for that . <p> Use of IMAP provides the following advantages : <p> Read It Anywhere Read email from any computer that is connected to the Internet and which has an Email Client supporting IMAP installed . <p> Backed up &amp; Safe You email service provider is responsible for backing up your email messages . Your email is stored on your service providers servers , so if your personal computer crashes , none of this email is affected ! <p> Features You can use any modern Email Client which provides you with all of the email management features that you require . <p> Download Most Email Clients allow you to download some or all of your email messages from the server to your local computer for viewing while you are not connected to the Internet , or for archiving without taking up disk space on your providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download and display only the headers of the messages in your email folders , thus requiring little bandwidth until you need to actually view the body of a message . <p> Server Side many operations such as sorting messages , searching , and moving messages between folders can be done by the server without requiring you to download the messages involved , thus requiring little bandwidth and making them very fast . <p> WebMail Compatible All of the email that you keep on the server ( even if it is sorted into multiple folders ) can be viewed by either WebMail or an Email Client using IMAP . This is great for people who travel . <p> The disadvantages of IMAP include : <p> Internet Required You can not view any of your email unless you are connected to the Internet ( unless the email client supports an Offline mode for viewing messages , and you have enabled this ) . The speed by which you can view your email is related to your Internet connection speed it can be slow or fast ! <p> Disk Space Since your email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up his disk space . Your email provider may limit the amount of disk space you can use . If you exceed the allotted disk space , you could be charged a fine or your services could be suspended ! <p> Software You must obtain , install and configure your Email Client software on each computer that will be used for checking your email via IMAP . <p> POP is also a protocol . It stands for Post Office Protocol . Sometimes you will see it written as POP3 which implies Version 3 of the Post Office Protocol . POP is the other of the two most popular protocols that can be used by Email Clients to access your email messages . POP enables you to automatically download your messages from your Inbox on the email server to your local computer ( and usually to then remove them from the Inbox on the server ) . This is intrinsically different from IMAP and WebMail , where the email always stays on the email server . Your service provider may also offer Secure POP ( a.k.a . POPS ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Email Client and the servers can not be eavesdropped upon . <p> Use of POP provides the following advantages : <p> Disk Space Because POP usually downloads all messages to your local computer and automatically deletes them from your email providers server , you minimize the amount of disk space that you use on the servers , possibly lowering the cost of your account . <p> Speed Once your email messages are downloaded on your local computer , you can read them very easily and quickly , even if your computer is no longer connected to the Internet . <p> The disadvantages of POP include : <p> Not Anywhere Since your email is downloaded to your local computer , you can not view this email from any other machine . If you travel or go home from work , you lose access to your downloaded email ( unless you copy it to a disk and take it with you ! ) <p> Software Required You must obtain , install and configure your Email Client software on each computer that will be used for checking your email via POP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local computer , you take all responsibility for ensuring that you have backups of your email messages in the event that something goes wrong with your computer . <p> Multiple devices People commonly access their email using a number of devices a work computer , a home computer , a laptop , a smartphone , a tablet , etc. - If you use POP , it is likely that email will be downloaded to one of these devices and then no longer be visible on the other ones . - Even if you try to configure POP to " keep email on the server " this is slow and inefficient and it is likely that at some point you will make a mistake and all that email will be downloaded to one of your devices anyway ; this happens all the time . <p> Email providers like to offer POP email boxes because you download all the email from their servers , minimizing the impact of your email usage on their servers . They dislike providing IMAP services , as IMAP users can leave gigabytes of email on their servers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers . Email providers offering IMAP services are usually more expensive than those that do not for exactly these reasons and these are good reasons ! <p> ActiveSync ( or " Exchange ActiveSync " ) is a protocol developed by Microsoft for synchronizing mobile devices with its Exchange email and collaboration system . - However , it is really just a protocol like POP and IMAP and it enables mobile devices to securely read email , send email , synchronize email folders , contacts , calendars , task lists , and get updates in real time ( through " push " notifications from your service providers servers to your mobile devices ) . - As of this writing , Exchange ActiveSync is available natively on most mobile devices and also in Outlook 2013 for Windows . - ActivesSync is generally better than POP , IMAP , and SMTP for mobile use as it is designed for the mobile environment , supports fast " push " updates , and can be easier on your mobile device batteries . - For email , it behaves much like using SMTP plus IMAP ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your contacts , calendars , ans tasks , so you can always access them " on the go " . - LuxScis ActiveSync option is called MobileSync . <h> Compare Features <p> WebMail <p> IMAP/ActiveSync <p> POP <p> Access Email From Anywhere ? <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> No <p> Large Server Disk Usage <p> Yes , Unless you use POP as well <p> Yes <p> Minimal <p> Dependence on Internet Connectivity <p> Strong <p> Very Strong <p> Moderate <p> Special Software Needed ? <p> No <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Data Backup Responsibility <p> Service Providers <p> Service Providers <p> Yours <p> Security <p> Depends on Provider <p> Depends on Provider <p> Depends on Provider <p> What is right for you ? If you wish to use an email client for sending and reading your email , your email provider must provide you with POP and/or IMAP services . If you wish to access your email from multiple computers ( i.e. when traveling ) , then WebMail and/or IMAP services are essential . WebMail is always a plus as it generally works in conjunction with IMAP and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet been downloaded by your Email Client . If you are looking for the least expensive solution , use WebMail in conjunction with POP . IMAP adds a lot of flexibility and power , but also requires that you purchase more disk space with your email provider and have a reliable and speedy Internet connection . If you are very security-conscious , you should ask for Secure versions of any of the services that you need . <h> Important Email Concepts / Definitions <p> Security &amp; Privacy <p> Email is an inherently insecure communication medium . Learn why this is so and what you can do about it in this article " The Case For Email Security " . <p> SPAM . <p> Sending a message , especially an advertisement , to more than a few recipients , can by itself be considered spamming unless the individuals have specifically requested to be added to a mailing list on that topic . This includes commercial advertisements and informational messages sent to recipients via electronic mail . Email is a person-to-person medium , not a broadcast medium . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commercial Email ( UCE ) , such as the Can-Spam Act. - Most email providers and Internet service providers have strict policies against the use of their services for such purposes . Sending of unsolicited email is very bad Net-Etiquette . <p> What is the problem with SPAM ? - Unlike postal mail , email is virtually cost free to the sender , so advertisers have no problem sending unlimited quantities of email in the hope that some small percentage will result in sales , or responses . The result is that an ever growing proportion of email is SPAM current projections indicate that in several years , more than 90% of email will be SPAM , greatly diminishing the use of email as an effective means of communication . <p> Sending SPAM , unsolicited commercial email ( UCE ) or any unsolicited email to multiple people is considered an abuse of your email providers services and may subject your account to immediate cancellation . <p> What about that list of 100,000 opt-in email addresses I purchased ? Any opt-in email list is going to have people on it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of proof is upon you , the sender , not on them ! So if you sent 100,000 emails and %0.1 of the people complain , you just got 100 complaints ! That 's enough to get your account terminated with almost any email provider ! The only safe way to use opt-in email lists is to create the lists yourself via your own web site not by buying it from anyone , no matter how " reputable " , and certainly NOT by scanning or spidering the Internet and grabbing peoples email addresses from their web pages ! <p> Also , it is generally accepted that " opt in " means " opted in specifically to receive your content " . - Thus , it is not possible to buy a list of people who have opted into your mailings , as they would have no specific information about your mailings when they purportedly opted in . <p> To help with the proliferation of Internet SPAM , most email providers offer SPAM Filtering software . This is software built into your providers servers that can detect a large proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detected SPAM emails can then be deleted , stored in alternate email folders , bounced back to the sender , or simply marked as potential SPAM . - Be careful with such software as , incorrectly configured , it can result in the loss of important non-SPAM email ( i.e. false positives ) .. e.g. disappearing email . <p> Email Aliases and Email Boxes/Users <p> Both email aliases and email boxes ( i.e. users ) are email addresses , like bob@luxsci.net , to which email can be sent . - An email box is the address of an actual user on the email providers server and usually corresponds to the address that the user uses to login to the email services . - E.g. if bob@luxsci.net is an email box , then bob@luxsci.net is an actual username on the luxsci.net servers and " bob@luxsci.net " can be used as a login to the IMAP , POP , WebMail , and possibly other services . - An alias , however , is not an actual user , but rather merely a rule that indicates what to do with email addressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that fred@luxsci.net is an email alias . We then also have to say where email to fred@luxsci.net- should go . One possibility is that we configure the email alias such that email for fred@luxsci.net- is automatically forwarded to bob@luxsci.net . In this case any email sent to eitherbob@luxsci.net or fred@luxsci.net gets deposited in bob@luxsci.nets email box . <p> Thus , email aliases allow one , to receive email sent to lots of different email addresses in the same email box or to forward email sent to specific addresses to multiple recipients as a distribution list . <p> One special kind of email alias is called a Catch-All Alias . If you have a catch-all alias for your domain then all email addressed to addresses in the domain that do n't  correspond to email boxes or other email aliases will be delivered to the recipient(s) of the catch-all alias . These are often used to make sure that you get any email sent to any address at your domain ( e.g. to catch email to misspelled recipient addresses ) . However , using a catch-all alias subjects you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught by the catch-all alias ! - For this reason , we recommend against the use of catch-all aliases . <p> Email Personalities . <p> Your Email Personality is applied to the email messages that you send . It consists of who the message is " From " and to whom replies to the message should be sent to . Most simply , your email personality consists of your Name and Email Address ; however , you may wish to use " multiple personalities " one for your " Sales " department email , one for your " Support " email , one for your " Personal " email , one for your " Academic " email , etc . Each personality might use a different email address and name . <p> Some WebMail interfaces allow you to configure multiple personalities and choose the personality of your outgoing email message when you are composing the message . This is very convenient , especially if you would like to manage all of your email in one place ( e.g. you wear " multiple hats " in your business , or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any WebMail program that allows you to specify arbitrary personalities will include information in your email messages indicating from whom they were actually sent , allowing them to be tracked back to you this protects your email provider from possible use of this service for illegal purposes . So , be careful to use only personalities that you rightfully own or to which you are authorized . <p> Personalities may also allow you to configure " Signature " content to be added to the end of your email messages . - This is often used to provide your contact information , advertisements , and/or a legal disclaimer on your messages . <p> Autoresponder . <p> Also known as an " out-of-office response " , an " away message " , or a " vacation message " , an autoresponder automatically sends an email message back to the senders of messages that you receive . You can usually customize these automatic responses to have any fixed subject and body that you desire . Autoresponders are often used to inform senders that you are , for some reason , not checking your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing , that the email arrived in your email box , or of other important information . <p> Email Archival . <p> Due to government regulation and business needs , email archival is becoming more and more common. - With email archival , copies of all messages sent and received by all users are made and saved in a location where you can access them , search them , and download them later. - Email archival services usually ensure that the storage is immutable , meaning that the messages can not be deleted or edited , and is redundant , so that the messages are stored in multiple location for safety . <p> Email archival is recommended for any business or organization that uses email for important communications as it provides an infallible backup and insurance policy that you can always go back and find that critical email message when needed . <p> Private Labeling . <p> Some email providers support skinning , branding , or private labeling their Web-based interfaces so that you can make their interface look like it belongs to your company. - This is good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that web portal , or for providing a more corporate atmosphere , when your staff is using the interface. - " Co-branding " is like private labeling , except that the providers name is not hidden. - I.e. you could have co-branded WebMail that is " Your Company Mail powered by Your Provider " . - Fully private labeled services do not mention the providers name anywhere , not even in the addresses used to access the service . <p> Smarthosting <p> If you have your own email servers but require that your outbound email be channeled through some other company for filtering , encryption , archival , or some other reason , then you may configure your existing email server so that it sends all email though that companys email server instead of trying to deliver that email directly to its recipients . - This is known as " smarthosting " and the companys email server that is receiving all of your email is known as the " smart host " . <p> Shared vs Dedicated or Virtual Machine <p> Shared email accounts are generally inexpensive as you share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - However , if you have a larger account ( in terms of people , or usage requirements ) you may find that the cost of a shared account does not scale well and a " dedicated server " or " virtual server " will provide a better price point . - Or , you may find that a dedicated server provides additional security and privacy that you find important . Dedicated solutions put your entire account on a - server that is not shared with anyone else and the pricing is usually much more liberal you are paying more for the server than for small increments in services or users . - See :

Repeating the attack might allow an attacker to decrypt multiple bytes of a secret ( for example Session-Cookie , Password ) that is repeatedly sent . <p> S/MIME is not vulnerable as POODLE requires many different and similar secured messages to be sent and requires that the attacker be a man-in-the-middle who can alter the data stream . This is not possible with S/MIME . <p> Heartbleed <p> The Heartbleed attack ( reference ) allowed attackers to access SSL private keys ( very bad ) . It used a flaw in the real-time negotiation of SSL between client and server to do this . <p> S/MIME is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indeed , no server involved that is positioned to divulge S/MIME private keys in this way to an attacker . <p> The BEAST <p> The BEAST attack on TLS/SSL ( reference ) requires that the attacker can choose plain text to be encrypted and can compare the encrypted plain text to the encrypted text ( e.g. by attacking from the clients web browser during the session ) . - It also requires the attacker to be able to analyze the stream of encrypted tcp/ip packets and how they relate to each other . <p> S/MIME is not vulnerable to this attack because the message is already encrypted and an attacker can not participate in the encryption process . <p> CRIME <p> The CRIME attack- ( reference ) - can be used to discover session tokens or other secret information based on the compressed size of HTTP requests that use DEFLATE or gzip. - CRIME is a brute force attack that requires analysis of many copies of different encrypted data streams where there is similar information at the beginning ( e.g. web session cookies ) . <p> S/MIME does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used ) , but it is not vulnerable to this attack as there is only one encrypted content block .

Over the past few years , large scale breaches have become more common and increasingly severe . Last year in June , a hacker named thedarkoverlord was selling 650,000 US healthcare records as part of a long-running crime spree . The collection was listed on a deep web marketplace called the Real Deal for over $700,000 worth of Bitcoin . <p> A cancer treatment provider called 21st Century Oncology had 2.2 million patients records compromised in late 2015 . The stolen data included patient names , the names of their doctors , social security numbers , insurance information , diagnoses and treatments . The company was required to notify all of the affected patients and they have also offered free credit protection for one year as partial compensation. - <p> This is just the tip of the iceberg . According to Bitglass , 113 million Americans were affected by healthcare data breaches in 2015 . This is almost 10 times more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one in three patients would be the victim of a breach in 2016 . This trend is likely to continue or even intensify over the coming years . <h> The Rise of Medical Record Theft <p> There were over 230 healthcare breaches that impacted more than 500 people in 2015 , according to the US Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights . The same organization stated that between 27.8 million and 67.7 million people have had their medical records stolen since they started keeping data in 2009 . <p> For a variety of reasons , the medical sector has been the biggest target for hackers since 2012 . According to the Identity Theft Resource Center , it accounted for 42.5% of all breaches in 2014 . Incidents of medical identity theft have risen alongside these breaches . A Ponemon Institute Study showed that there was a 21.7% rise in medical identity theft in 2014 , bringing the total number of incidents to 2.3 million over the previous five years . <p> Part of this growth can be attributed to the recent digitization of medical files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals and other organizations have been moving towards electronic health records for ease of access . The downside of this is that it centralizes the records in databases , many of which are poorly secured . This has made them a prime target for hackers . <p> It may seem logical to go after the companies with the most data , but huge enterprises have much larger budgets and greater pools of human resources . Small companies are often much easier targets , because they cant employ the same level of security as their larger counterparts . <p> The US Office for Civil Rights ( OCR ) has also begun investigating smaller breaches . Prior to August 2016 , they only looked into breaches when the data of more than 500 individuals was exposed . These investigations could lead to small businesses being fined and receiving other penalties that they could previously avoid. - <h> Why Do Criminals Want Medical Records ? <p> Why do hackers care about the rash someone had in 2007 , or the results of a blood test from last year ? No , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Medical records are extremely valuable for a wide range of purposes . <h> They Contain an Extensive Amount of Data <p> Medical records contain lots of information . Normally they include a persons full name , address , contact information , social security number , insurance details , the name of treating physicians , diagnoses , prescriptions , treatments and more . When this information is used for fraud and other scams , criminals can make significant sums of money . This return on investment has led them to sell for around $60 each , according to NBC News . <h> The Value of Credit Card Data Has Fallen <p> For a long time , stealing credit card numbers was the go-to scam for online criminals . In recent years the value of credit card numbers has fallen and hackers have found more lucrative options instead . In 2008 , a Symantec report revealed that credit card numbers were being sold for anywhere between 40- and $20 . Cards from Europe or smaller companies were valued at the higher end of the scale due to their scarcity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In deep web marketplaces , " information " is commonly sold per line . According to a 2015 Trend Micro report , prices have fallen from $4 per line in 2014 to just $1 per line . This is mainly due to an oversupply in the market . Full credit reports with high FICO scores can go for $25 each , while scanned documents such as licenses , bills and passports can go for between $10 and $35 . Log-in credentials for bank accounts can sell between $200 and $500 . <p> Overall , the demand for credit card information is shrinking because it is more limited in use than other personal identifiable information . Credit card companies generally foot the bill for any fraud , which has caused them to bump up their security measures . Chip and pin technology has helped to reduce thefts , while active monitoring means that companies quickly detect any fraud . Log-in credentials for bank accounts are worth much more because thieves can steal a larger amount before the bank notices . Medical records are also more versatile than credit card numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare data falls into the wrong hands , it can be used for a variety of sinister purposes . A scammer can use the information to open bank accounts , apply for credit cards or loans , collect rebates or even file tax returns . They can also use the information to fill prescriptions , commit insurance fraud or for medical identity theft . <p> This data can also be used for harassment or even blackmail . If a famous persons medical records are stolen , criminals could use the information to extort significant sums of money . Likewise , they could threaten a CEO that they will reveal a hidden diagnosis to the board unless they pay up . <h> Your Healthcare Data Ca n't Be Changed <p> If your credit card data gets stolen it can be a pain to deal with , but once you cancel the card , the thieves cant steal any more money . With medical records and the personal information within them , much of it does n't  change . Few people are willing to change their name , address or sex if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical history . <p> The permanence of medical records and personal information means that it can be exploited for a much longer period of time . Criminals can use it to commit medical identity theft and other fraud for years , resulting in a much greater return on investment than stolen credit cards . This can cause huge headaches for victims , who often spend years of their life and thousands in legal fees trying to clear up the matter . According to the Ponemon Institutes Fifth Annual Study on Medical Identity Theft , 65% of medical identity theft victims said that they spent an average of $13,500 and more than 200 hours of their time to recover from the incident . <p> The thief " s fraudulent activities can even lead to false information recorded on a medical file " this is potentially deadly and incredibly hard to fix . Ann Patterson , the senior vice president of the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance ( MIFA ) , said that around 20% of medical identity theft victims received the wrong diagnosis or delayed treatment because of fraud . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data breach could lead a company to ruin . According to the Ponemon Institute , the average cost is $2.1 million . In the event of a breach , companies will have to notify those who were affected . They may also face government penalties and even potential lawsuits from the victims . A serious breach can also leave a brands reputation in ruins , severely affecting its future income . <p> The Anthem hack was one of the biggest breaches of all time . It affected close to 80 million people and could cost the company over $100 million to clean up . Sure , Anthem is a billion dollar company , but a breach of comparable magnitude can be enough to sink many businesses . <p> Medical records are versatile and valuable , making them a huge target for hackers . If healthcare organizations want to keep safe , they need to ensure that they have sound security processes protecting their sensitive data . Without the right security in place , all it takes is one bored hacker to affect millions of patients and completely destroy a companys future .

This was slower to open and positioning and sizing could be inconsistent . The new composer opens inside your current window by default as an internal window . If you would like to get back to opening in a separate window , we have a preference for that . Open the composer , click on the " Magic Wand " icon at the top and choose " Composition Settings " . In the " General Preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose email messages ? " to " In a separate ( pop-up ) window " and press " Save Changes " . <p> You can attach files by dragging and dropping them from your computer into the composer window . If you are using the HTML editing mode ( as opposed to plain text ) , be sure that the composer changes to save " Drop files here " when you drag over it . It wont if you try to drop into the HTML body of the message ( though if you are dropping an image , that may embed the image directly into the HTML ) . Dropping over the message header area ( where you have the Recipients , Subject , etc. ) will avoid this.If you are using an old web browser ( E.g. Internet explorer 8 or 9 ) that does not support file drag and drop into the browser , then you can attach a file by clicking on the " paperclip " icon at the top of the composer window . We also recommend upgrading your web browser to Internet Explorer v10+ or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attachments can be selected from your WebAide Documents by using the Magic Wand and choosing " Add Attachments From Documents WebAides " . <p> Remove attachments ? <p> Click on the " X " icon next to the attachment name at the bottom of the composer to remove it . <p> Preview the attachments or see the full attachment file names ? <p> You could not do this in the old composer ! In the new composer , you can click on the attachment name at the bottom of the composer window to open that attachment in a new window so that you can preview what it looks like . You can also mouse over the attachment name to view the full name ( long names are truncated in the user interface to save space ; the full file name is shown in a tool tip ) . <p> Add Cc or Bcc recipients ? <p> Click on the " Cc " or " Bcc " link on the top right of the composer area to hide/show these address input fields <p> Remove recipients ? <p> Click on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the message . Also , if you press the " backspace " ( or delete , depending on your computer ) key while at the beginning of the To , Cc , or Bcc input fields , that will delete the last recipient added to that field . <p> See more details about each recipient ? <p> Use your mouse to hover over a recipient . The tool tip will show you things such as the recipients name , full email address , and SecureLine encryption details ( See below ) . What is actually shown depends on the context , the particular recipient , the information available , and your preferences . <p> Search my address book for contacts ? <p> Click on the " Address Book " icon at the top of the composer ( or click on the " Magic Wand " and choose " Search for Recipients " . Additionally , the auto-complete feature that gives suggestions as you type addresses into the Recipients ( To ) , Cc , and Bcc areas has been enhanced and is much more useful . <p> Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " disk " icon at the top of the composer ( or click on the " Magic Wand " and choose " Save as Draft " ) . The new email compose also auto-saved drafts just like the old one did ( if that email composition preference is enabled see your " Magic Wand Composition Settings " page to check ) . <p> Change the " importance " of a message ? <p> Click on the " gear " icon to change the message importance between High , Low , and Normal <p> " Requesting a Read Receipt " and " Saving a Copy in Sent Email " can be toggled in the menu that the " gear " icon brings up . <p> Select or manage templates ? <p> Click on " Magic Wand " and choose " Templates " to bring up the usual options for selecting and managing your email templates . <h> Using Email Encryption <p> The interface for SecureLine Email Encryption in the new composer is designed to hide the information you do n't  need to see until you ask for it . It seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are used to seeing . <p> Click on the lock icon at the top of the composer to turn encryption on and off . Hover over the icon an a tool tip will tell you the current state of encryption . If the lock is green and closed , then encryption is enabled . If it is yellow and open , then encryption is disabled.If clicking on that encryption icon " does nothing " ( e.g. you ca n't turn encryption off ) , then your accounts security settings do not currently permit you to opt out of email encryption . See your account administration for assistance . <p> How do I know if each recipient is " all set " for encryption ? <p> SecureLine determines how each recipient will be encrypted to " on the fly " based on who the recipient is , what their mail servers support , your account and user settings , and your address books . When you enter a recipient and are done ( e.g. by pressing enter , a comma , or by leaving the input field to click somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble " . When SecureLine is deciding what to do with that recipient , a spinner is shown to the recipients left . If SecureLine is " all set " and can encrypt for the recipient , a green closed lock is shown next to the recipient . If more information is needed ( e.g. a SecureLine Question and Answer ) , then a red line is drawn around the recipients bubble and a warning sign is shown next to the recipient.if you hover your mouse over the recipient , a tool tip will show you the details of what kind of encryption will be used and/or what is needed still . <p> If you are using questions and answers to authenticate for your SecureLine Escrow recipients , then you can click on the recipient bubble to view / edit the question , answer , and the time after which the Escrow message will expire from access . Enter the new details and press " Ok " to save them , or " Cancel " to quit those chages without saving . <p> How to use Escrow ( or PGP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once encryption is enabled , click on the gear icon and choose " Escrow Instead of TLS Only " to toggle if use of " TLS Only " for email encryption will be enabled for this message . This option is not present if TLS Only is generally off for you based on your user or account security settings .

" <p> The big guys with large IT staff took this in stride and , in most cases , got on top of things by implementing policies and procedures that are more or less compliant . and by continuing to evolve these practices . <p> For the smaller and medium-sized organizations , time , money , and expertise are less plentiful ( though some may argue that expertise is not very plentiful anywhere ) . - Here we have seen some of the following philosophies predominating : <p> I do n't  really care about the details of HIPAA compliance for security were probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will attack us . <p> Let 's just buy something and forget about it I do n't  want to spend the time to learn what I am expected to do . - Someone should just take care of that for me . <p> We do n't  think its worthwhile to spend all this money to be fully compliant . - It will be cheaper to pay the cost of a breach if it ever happens which it probably wo n't . <p> Only 11 of their 7000 employees were tasked with information security ( and that includes 3 security analysts and 8 managers ) . <p> Sony did Risk Assessments to identify vulnerabilities ; however , it failed to do anything about them . <p> In 2007 , Sonys Information Security Director was quoted saying that it is a valid business decision to accept the risk of a security breach and that he would not invest $10 million to avoid a possible $1 million loss . - His estimation of the real cost of a breach was clearly very far off . <p> Sonys employees used terribly poor passwords <p> Does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit the same kind of attitude : head in the sand ; not worth the time and money ; it does n't  matter , it wo n't affect us ; if it does , it wont be a big deal . <p> The security community agrees if anything good has come out of the Sony Hack , and other issues this year , it is an increased awareness that these kinds of attacks can and do occur and that the impact can be devastating . - That , coupled with increasing attacks on small and medium organizations , places everyone at higher risk than most people previously considered . <p> And what is worse for those under the umbrella of HIPAA ? - The fines imposed by Health and Human Services for a breach can be very , very high . - If even a fraction of the information stolen from Sony Pictures had been ePHI and Sony had to abide by HIPAA , it is hard to imagine the sheer size of the fine it boggles the mind . <h> A Shift in Perspective for HIPAA Compliance <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain or fear . - This years security history surely should go a long way to revising opinions as to where money and attention should be allocated and to what degree organizations will actively and continuously update their security and legitimately maintain their compliance . <p> As first steps towards improvement , I would recommend : <p> Make sure you actually perform risk assessments and actually take steps to remediate problems based on the threat they pose . <p> Use an outside assessment agency to determine your risk and compliance level , especially if your team does not have the skill set to do this themselves . - Even if they do , fresh eyes with different tools will often find things that you miss as would external attackers . <p> Outsourcing services **28;1504;TOOLONG providers can go a long way to : <p> reducing your own internal compliance and IT overhead <p> reducing your risk profile <p> saving you money in the short and long term <p> Educate your staff <p> HIPAA training is a requirement of HIPAA <p> Employees should be familiar with and use things like strong passwords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been identified as Risks for your organization . - E.g.

<p> A message sent without SecureLine encryption is not necessarily delivered insecurely to the recipient . - LuxSci uses " Opportunistic TLS " for all messages sent from all users to maximize the privacy and security of your email messages . - This means that , even without SecureLine , SMTP TLS will be used to encrypt the message as it passes from our servers to your recipients servers so long as the recipients servers also support TLS ( e.g. Gmails servers do , AOLs servers do not , etc. ) . - You can use our TLS Support Checker to see if a recipients servers support this type of encryption. - Use of SecureLine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver the message ( and you have administrative control over the types of encryption that can be used ) . <p> Users who wish to send an email without SecureLine from an email program must add some special text to their email message subject . - For example , the subject : <p> Here is a copy of our newsletter . nophi <p> A message using the subject line above would be sent to the recipient without SecureLine encryption and with the text " nophi " removed so that the recipient does n't  see it . <p> Administrators who enable use of SecureLine Opt Out for their SMTP users choose a " keyword " and a " separator " for their users to employ when requesting that messages be sent without SecureLine. - In the example above , the keyword was " nophi " and the separator was the symbol " " . - Customers can choose any case insensitive keyword that they desire ( e.g. " insecure " , " nophi " , etc. ) and can also choose from a variety of separators ( e.g. " " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " / " , " " , etc . ) . <p> When the system receives a message that : <p> Contains exactly one instance of the separator <p> Contains the keyword at the beginning of the left or right side of the subject line <p> Then : <p> The message is treated as a " SecureLine Opt Out " and the original subject and recipients and other metadata are logged for viewing in the " SecureLine Opt Out " reports . <p> The separator and the side of the subject with the keyword in it are removed from the subject ( so the recipient does not see it ) . <p> The message is sent without SecureLine . <p> This gives the sender the following choices : <p> Opt out on a per-message basis <p> If the sender does not explicitly opt out , the message will be sent securely by default <p> All opt outs are logged ( and copies sent to an auditor email address if so configured ) <p> Note that the system is smart and if it detects a subject that does not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , it will block sending until you update the subject so that it clearly does or does not indicate opt out . - E.g. misspellings of the keyword , extra separators , etc. , are detected . <h> Control over Who can Opt Out of SecureLine Encryption <p> Another- enhancement- of the Opt Out process is the fine- grained- ability- to control exactly who is allowed to opt out of encryption. - Previously , if it was enabled , then everyone could do it . - However , in many cases , only select people need the ability to opt out , or only select people need to be restricted to never opting out . - For security reasons , it is best to limit opt out to only those who require it . <p> The SecureLine- Encryption- configuration areas now permit administrators to specify exactly who can use opt out : <p> Anyone ( the default ) <p> Only specific users ( you select the users who can from your list of users ) . <h> Configuring SecureLine Opt Out <p> SecureLine Opt Out and other SecureLine features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per-user basis . - See our SecureLine Administrative Overview video to see how to configure settings on an account-wide basis . <h> Examples of Subject Text-Based Opt Outs <p> The following are several examples of subject lines that result in opting out of the use of SecureLine Encryption , assuming the separator is " " and the keyword is " nophi " . In each case , the recipient would see a subject of only " Here is the quote you requested " . <p> nophi Here is the quote you requested <p> Keyword on the left side of the subject . Spaces after the keyword are valid . <p> - - NoPHI Here is the quote you requested <p> Keyword is case insensitive . Spaces before the keyword are valid . <p> nophi - its just a sales quote .

Additionally , many of the IP addresses in use by these systems are already " polluted " from previous abusive use by spammers. - When you set up a new cloud server , you could be easily assigned a " bad IP " . - Even if you do not inherit a bad IP reputation from the previous user(s) of your new IP , your server is still in the general set of IP addresses of the cloud and thus considered a possible spam source . <p> We have investigated several services that claim to offer " Cloud-Based Outbound Email " and have found that many use cloud servers for things like scanning email messages for spam and viruses , but use- physical- non-cloud servers for the actual sending of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , but it points to the fact that if everyone might be affected , the solution is to NOT send from the cloud ( directly ) , and that many companies just use the word " cloud " for its marketing impact . <h> How Did Cloud Servers get a Bad Email- Reputation ? <p> The " utility computing " model of the cloud is to blame . In the interest of making these servers and services as cheap as possible and to be able to charge for " by the hour with no setup fee " , there are generally few bundled services included some of which are 1 ) zero customer support , 2 ) little pre-sales work , and 3 ) minimal , if any , validation of new customers . All that time would increase prices . - In short , you signup with a name and credit card and get going almost immediately . - All you have to do is agree to " terms and conditions " by checking a box ( how much do spammers care about that ? ) <p> Spammers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive service to setup servers for sending spam or performing other abusive actions . - They do not care if they get shutdown fairly quickly because : <p> they are using stolen credentials and payment information <p> it is so easy to setup a basic cloud server , that there is not much time lost , and <p> even if they get shut down " fairly quickly " , they have still done their damage , sent some of their spam , etc . <p> Once they get shut down , they go to another public cloud server provider somewhere else under another stolen identity and do it again . - They can even automate this signup process by using the available APIs to these services . <p> The above scenario contributes to the pollution of the reputation of IP addresses and the public cloud servers in general . <p> With physical dedicated and managed servers , you typically interact with a Sales staff , sign a real contract , and undergo some level of validation ( even if that happens behind the scenes ) . - This serves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these services and therefore keeps these IP address spaces much cleaner . - The more validation and attention that is offered by a sales and support staff before signing up their customers , the cleaner the IPs are . - This is why , for example , managed servers at Rackspace have an excellent reputation that generally exceeds that of dedicated servers offered by commodity server providers . <p> If you are sending important email from a cloud server , to avoid the risk of your emails getting blocked by spam filtering services due to poor IP reputation , you should consider smart hosting through LuxScis- High Volume Outbound Email service .

( Be sure that you do not choose the POP option to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Using POP in this way , your Inbox will always be empty or almost empty , so any backups of your Inbox will contain nothing or only a few messages at most assuming of course that your computer is on and actively downloading/deleting messages . <p> If you do use WebMail , IMAP , or MobileSync and delete messages , be sure that you have your WebMail or email program preferences configured to actually erase messages that you delete and not just move them to a Trash folder on the server as that will also be backed up by your email provider . <p> What about Sent email ? <p> Sent email , like all of your email folders , is automatically backed up in each backup snapshot at LuxSci . <p> If you are using WebMail , your only choice is to configure your preferences so that copies of Sent email messages are never saved . <p> If you are using IMAP with your email program , you may be able to have copies your Sent email messages saved to a local folder on your computer instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that saving copies to the server is the default behavior in most IMAP-configured email program . <p> If you are using POP to access your email , then copies of your sent email will always be saved to your local computer instead of to the server , as POP has no way to upload copies to a server-side sent email folder . <p> Note : some providers , such as LuxSci , allow you to configure your account so that a copy of any email message sent ( over SMTP ) is automatically placed in your Sent email folder ( no matter what ) . - This is not on by default at LuxSci , but you might want to check your preferences for this if that is a concern ( see " email &gt; My Email Tools &gt; Outbound Email &gt; Copies of Messages " in your LuxSci account ) . <h> Is there an automatic way to do this ? <p> The best way to be sure that email is automatically and continuously removed from these folders so that they are not backed up is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email every minute or two . - As long as your computer remains on , no further interaction is needed . <p> Most providers do not permit individual users , folders , or accounts to exempt themselves from automatic system backups. - This is also true of LuxSci for shared hosting accounts . - Dedicated server/Virtual server accounts at LuxSci , however can have custom backup schedules , can choose to have backups completely disabled , or can choose to have backups only made to separate disks on the same server ( and nowhere else ) . <h> What if I only want data saved on servers if it is encrypted ? <p> In many cases , it is very useful to have data saved on the server . - Backups , remote access from multiple devices and locations , etc. , play a role in the utility of this practice . However , the extremely security / privacy conscious may want to ensure that any data saved on the server ( and residing in backups ) is encrypted at rest . <h> Where are the other copies stored ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored is completely provider specific . - For LuxSci : <p> Daily Backups : Daily backup snapshots of data , of which 7 are kept by default , are saved on special backup servers in the same physical location as your actual email/web server . - This makes backups very efficient and maximizes the speed that a restore of a large amount of data can be made ( e.g. by copying over very fast local networks ) . <p> Weekly Backups : Weekly backup snapshots of data , of which 4 are kept by default , are saved on special backup servers in a physical location geographically remote from your- - actual email/web server . - Backups in separate physical locations is a good practice to protect against disaster and against configuration/human error . <p> Cache : Customers using the LuxSci Web Interface to view email and WebAides will have copies of that data temporarily saved in special " cache " databases . - These are used to greatly optimize the speed of the WebMail Interface and the fluidity of your access to related items ( e.g. attachments on email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the daily and weekly snapshots so users of WebMail may have copies of recently viewed email messages backed up in these cache database backups . <p> Deleted Users : When a user is deleted , LuxSci typically makes a copy of that users email and web hosting data and saves it for 1-2 weeks in case the data needs to be restored ( it is not unusual for an account administrator to delete a user by mistake ) . - These deleted-user files are also backed up in the daily and weekly backup snapshots . <h> What about dedicated customers ? <p> Customers with dedicated servers can also choose to have their WebMail Interface running on the server ( and thus also their own " cache " database on their server ) . - With this scenario , all access to stored email/web data is done solely from the customers server and any temporary copies of data are saved on that same server . - These customers can then also choose how they want backups done , e.g. <p> No backups , ever <p> Backups . but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all data to their machine ) <p> Any combination or daily and weekly backups required . <h> Can I use a WebAide to auto save/encrypt email and attachments and remove any copies received/sent ? <p> LuxScis WebAide collaboration tools- include tools for file storage and PGP-encrypted file storage . Customers often ask if it is possible to have messages or attachments auto-saved in an encrypted format to these WebAides . <p> There are tools for sending an email attachment to a " Documents WebAide " and or automatically saving all attachments / content from selected inbound email messages to a " Blog " or " Documents " WebAide , but these are not saved with encryption. - To use encryption , you would need to download the email or attachment to your computer first , and then upload it to a new Documents ( or Blog ) WebAide entry and select encryption at that point . <p> If you are a SecureForm user , you can have your posted form data and files automatically saved to a Documents WebAide with encryption. - So , your secure form posts can go directly into WebAides with encryption at rest .

Although it has many great features that make it quick and easy to set up , the complications associated with HIPAA standards can make it difficult to achieve compliance . WordPress has recovered from a checkered past as far as security is concerned , but it is still a third party tool which is not specifically designed to conform to HIPAA standards . <h> A Brief History of WordPress Security Issues <p> Although WordPress has been around since 2003 , its security issues came to the forefront in 2007 . In January , many SEO blogs , as well as those using Adsense were attacked using an exploit . The breadth of the security issues was revealed in May , when a survey by BlogSecurity found that 98% WordPress blogs were exploitable . This was mainly because they were running outdated versions of WordPress . WordPress released a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security issues , including a one click updating process . <p> In 2011 , the TimThumb vulnerability was exposed . The image resizing tool allowed attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on sites . A patch was soon released ; however , other TimThumb attacks continued until 2014 . <p> Despite the one click update feature , a 2013 study by Enable Security showed that 73.2% of websites were still using outdated versions of the software , leading to vulnerabilities . Further research found that many popular plugins were vulnerable due to SQL injection errors . <p> In 2015 an XSS vulnerability was found which- affected a wide variety of commonly used plugins , such as Gravity Forms , Jetpack and Yoast . The vulnerabilities allowed hackers to perform Blind SQL injections , however the issue was quickly addressed in updates . <p> At the start of this year ( 2017 ) , a vulnerability was discovered in the WordPress Rest API . It let unauthenticated users modify website pages if they were running WordPress 4.7 or above . The issue was fixed by WordPress within a week . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start regarding security , things have improved dramatically . The organizations development team is active in looking for vulnerabilities and has a strong track record for fixing issues as soon as they are discovered . As long as a site is using the current version , WordPress itself is relatively secure . <p> Despite WordPresss security , its ubiquitous nature makes it a huge target for attackers . WordPress has a 58.8% market share of CRM software , so hackers are constantly scanning for WordPress installations that have exploits and searching for new ones . When issues are found , attackers can quickly take advantage of them . <h> The Dangers of WordPress Plugins <p> WP White Securitys August 2016 Roundup showed that there were only 2 WordPress core vulnerabilities and one premium theme vulnerability ; however , there were a massive 34 plugin vulnerabilities . This indicates that plugins tend to be the least secure part of a WordPress site . <p> Plugins are developed by third parties , many of whom have lower security and development standards than WordPress itself . Plugins also tend to complicate the WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Brute Force Attacks <p> These are one of the most common attacks that WordPress sites face . WordPress does n't  automatically limit login attempts , so attackers can use bots to try to guess a sites administrative username and password via trial and error . If the site uses a weak password , the hacker can easily infiltrate it and access data . Check out our article on how to form strong passwords to prevent brute force attacks and also use two-factor authentication for administrators . <h> Denial of Service ( DoS ) Attacks <p> DoS attacks are used by hackers to slow down or crash a target site . They send huge amounts of traffic to a site in order to disrupt the hosts services . One of the most common types are Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS ) attacks , which use thousands of IP addresses to flood the target site with traffic . Malicious queries are common on WordPress sites and they can cost companies significant amounts of money in lost business . Secure your site against DoS attacks by making sure you use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credentials . <p> It is also common that scripts scanning for administrative passwords can take a site offline . - This is because the WordPress authentication process is slow and expensive . If many requests are made at once , they can use up all of the available resources on your server rendering your web site inaccessible . <h> The Most Common WordPress Vulnerabilities <p> When vulnerabilities are exploited , they can do immense damage to a website and the business it represents . This is especially true for healthcare organizations that hold valuable medical data . Not only are they a bigger target for hackers , but the potential consequences of a breach can be much greater . Attackers often seek to steal healthcare data , which they use to either blackmail the victim , or sell to the highest bidder on the darknet . This can cost a company millions of dollars in extortion payments or in cleaning up the mess if patient data is released . <p> Other common attacks include setting up phishing pages that are hosted on your site , sending spam , and hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companys and a web sites reputation . The key security issues that need to be looked out for are : <p> File Inclusion Exploits <p> Vulnerable code can be leveraged by attackers to load remote files that give them unauthorized access . File inclusion exploits rely on vulnerabilities in a sites PHP code . They allow hackers to access the wp-config.php file , which is critical in WordPress installations . <p> SQL Injections <p> SQL injections are another popular way for hackers to access WordPress databases . Attackers can create new admin accounts which they can then use to access , alter , or delete data . <p> XSS Attacks <p> WordPress plugins are commonly susceptible to cross-site scripting ( XSS ) attacks . Attackers get victims to load pages with insecure javascript scripts . These are then used to steal data from the users browser , such as any information they have input into forms . - They can also be used to steal user login credentials . <p> Malware <p> WordPress is also vulnerable to several different kinds of malware . The most common include drive-by downloads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are underlying vulnerabilities on your server , an attacker can also install malware on it . <h> Is WordPress a Suitable CMS For HIPAA ? <p> Using WordPress is a great way to get your site up-and-running quickly , but there are many caveats that need to be carefully attended to if you want it to be HIPAA-compliant . When any using third party software , you should be aware of the associated risks that are out of your control . Vulnerabilities in WordPress can interrupt your sites compliance with HIPAA , or even lead to a breach . Even if WordPress is at fault , the responsibility for any security issues still falls on the site owners . <p> WordPress may seem simple to set up and operate , however ensuring that it is both secure and compliant can be much more difficult . Due to the strict nature of HIPAA , it is generally recommended that you use a professional WordPress developer who has experience in HIPAA compliance . It is important that WordPress and all of the plugins are always using the latest versions to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plugins also need to be vetted to make sure that are secure and trustworthy . <p> While WordPress can be compliant with HIPAA , it is worth considering having a custom site developed . This can give an organization more control over their software , which can be tailored directly towards HIPAA-compliant security . <h> How to Secure WordPress <p> The following steps are crucial for keeping your WordPress site secure : <p> 1 . Stay Updated <p> Many of the security issues surrounding WordPress have been caused by sites using outdated versions of the software . Thankfully , the WordPress team responds to vulnerabilities quickly and will often have a patch within a few days of the discovery . Security patches are normally configured to update automatically and it is advised not to disable this feature . Major releases can also be configured to update automatically. - <p> As plugins are more likely to have critical security issues , it is important to have them updated regularly as well . You can do this manually , or you can add code to your themes functions.php file to automatically update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plugins You Can Trust <p> To keep compliant with HIPAA , companies need to ensure that they are only using plugins from trustworthy sources . These need to be vetted so that they are n't  exposing your site to greater risks . <p> 3 . Install Security Plugins <p> Security plugins can be used to monitoring and log actions on your website . They can also be used for malware scanning , file change detection , strong password enforcement , and more . iThemes Security is an excellent option that was developed by WordPress security experts . A security plugin itself is n't enough " the site administrator also needs to learn how to configure and use it effectively in order to monitor and prevent threats . <p> 4 . Use Two Factor Authentication For Admin Accounts <p> As mentioned above , many passwords can be brute forced with relative simplicity . Two factor authentication adds another step in an attempt to thwart attackers . The most common method is to send a code to the admins phone . This makes it significantly more difficult for a hacker to gain access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Careful When Storing Personal Identifiable Information ( PHI ) <p> Unless a WordPress expert is structuring your site , it is best to avoid keeping this sensitive data in the WordPress database . Slight errors can make the data vulnerable , so it is often best to store it elsewhere . If you decide to use the WordPress database , it is important to have backups , encrypt the databases , and to have clear access controls and audit controls or access to this data .. A thorough audit will also be necessary to ensure that you are HIPAA compliant . <p> 6 . Vet Your Site Users <p> You need to make sure that people can not sign up on your site directly . Have your HIPAA administrators vet every user before they are granted access . <p> 7 . Go Dedicated <p> When using a web server that will store and/or transmit , you really need to have a dedicated server . - You can not use a service where your server or service is shared with other organizations there is too much risk to your data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to consider when setting up a HIPAA-complaint web site of any kind . - For more reading , see : <h> Using WordPress.com as a Host <p> While WordPress.com can be used as a host , it is also quite limiting . It takes care of the updates and also vets the plugins , however it is not set up for HIPAA compliance . The number of plugins and themes that can be used is also greatly restricted , making it difficult for companies to customize their site . Many businesses , such as LuxSci , are dedicated to HIPAA compliance ; this makes- them better hosting options for websites that need to meet the HIPAA standards . <h> Is WordPress the Right Choice For Your HIPAA Needs ? <p> As third-party software , WordPress comes with its own risks that need to be considered before its adoption . The numerous hurdles associated with HIPAA can make it exceptionally challenging to configure WordPress in a secure and compliant way . Many companies choose to develop a custom site instead , so they can have everything exactly how they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ePHI : is that a good idea ? <p> Even if you decide that WordPress is n't the right service for keeping your website HIPAA-compliant , that does n't  mean that it ca n't be a useful tool for your business .

" 3 " for " e " , " 1 " for " l " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - - This will result in trying things like " app1e " , " passw0rd " , etc . <p> Perform another dictionary attack using all common first names and last names , possibly with varied capitalization of the first letters . <p> You may be surprised to know that , depending upon the situation and security of the location where the password trying to be guessed is , that the malicious person may be able to try millions of guesses in a very short amount of time. - So , in many situations , trying these seemingly endless possibilities is really possible. - You may remember the case of Barack Obamas Twitter account being compromised last month ; this was due to a hacker running a program that performed similar password guessing tests on one of the Twitter administrators accounts and discovering her ill-chosen password . <p> So , a strong password is one that can not be guessed using an automated program using any of these possibilities and which also can not be guessed by someone who knows you well and tries passwords based upon information related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can remember and even harder to choose many different ones for many different web sites . <h> Why use different passwords for different web sites ? <p> Simply put , if you have different passwords for every web site you have an account , if one of these accounts is compromised or stolen , that information can not be used to login to any of your other accounts. - I.e. using different passwords limits the possible collateral damage caused by a someone getting your password . <p> Using separate passwords is actually extremely important , because the possibility of one of your passwords being compromised or at least known by other people , is very very high. - Why ? <p> Many ( even most ) web sites keep a copy of your password to their site unencrypted and in plain text in their databases . <p> They do this either to facilitate verifying your password when you login ( a poor way to do this , but common ) , or so that they can give your password if you have lost it ( instead of forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use that password for various things within their systems , like performing automated tasks for you. - However , as a result , your password is visible to their system operations staff , and possibly even their support staff. - It is also visible to anyone else with access to their databases , such as a hacker that might break into their systems . <p> So , you should assume that the people who work for each web site know your username and password to that web site. - If they can guess what other web sites you might be logging into , they could maliciously try that password and similar usernames or email addresses to gain access to accounts as you . <p> Not all web sites use login processes secured via SSL <p> If you login to a web site and that login process is not secured via SSL , then your username and password are sent " in the clear " over the Internet to the web site. - This is like writing your username and password on a postcard and sending it in the mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sensitive information. - This is especially dangerous if you are connecting from a wireless hotspot or other location where you do not trust everyone who may be using the local network . <p> You can tell if you logged in using a secure process once you are logged in , if the URL in the browser starts with " https : // " and there may be a little " lock " icon in your browser that indicates a secure connection . <p> If you login to a web site without SSL security , you should assume that some could get your username and password and login there as you , and that they could try to use that information to login to other sites as you too . <h> What common mistakes are made in managing passwords to many sites ? <p> Some mistakes are now obvious : <p> Using the same password for many different sites <p> Using a password that is easily guessable <p> Some mistakes are less obvious : <p> Not changing your passwords for a long time. - The longer the passwords are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your passwords down on post-it notes or other pieces of paper. - Anyone who can see that paper ( on your desk , in your wallet , in your drawer , etc. ) then has your personal password list ! <p> Saving the passwords in a non-encrypted file on your computer . Anyone who can access your computer ( or steal your laptop ) can access that file and get your passwords. - Even if you use a password-protected file , you must be sure that ( a ) you use a strong password for that file , and ( b ) that the password-protection in use is actually good ; i.e. old versions of Microsoft Office have useless password protection. - If the password is weak or the encryption poor , then a malicious person could easily open the " secure " file . <p> When you do change your password , you change it to a password that you previously used. - Never do that , as someone may know your old passwords . <p> When you do change your password , you change it to a password @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as someone may try all common variations on your previous password to guess the new one. - - I.e. , changing your password from " Joe2008 ! " to " Joe2009 ! " is not a very good change . <h> Back to basics what are our goals ? <p> When trying to juggle logins for a plethora of web sites , we need to : <p> Make sure we have a different password for every site , <p> Make sure that the passwords for all of the sites are " strong " . <p> Make sure that we can easily remember all of these passwords . <p> Avoid writing all of these passwords down in an insecure manner . <p> Make it easy to remember your passwords after changing them all . <h> Making strong passwords that are easily remembered <p> This is , on the surface , perhaps the hardest thing to do. - Typically , when someone gives suggestions on how to make a " strong " password , you will hear things like : <p> Use a combination of letters , numbers , and symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper and lower case letters . <p> Make the password as long as possible . <p> Do not use words from the dictionary or personal information in the password <p> Use a long sequence of random characters . <p> All of these tips are valid and play an important role in making good , strong passwords. - However , taken naively , you will end up with very strong passwords that are impossible to remember , like " slkJfH867234i@#$%#%608j " . - You would never guess that one ! - However , you will never remember it either. - Youll have to write it down somewhere or save it in a file and you will have to look it up every time you need it. - Having to look up our passwords all the time will make them too cumbersome , unless the passwords are rarely used . <h> The two-part system for making many strong , easily-remembered passwords . <p> This is not a system that we invented. - It has been around awhile and we have no reference as to its origin. - Anyway , here is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but short password that is not hard to remember , like " J33pers ! " - Well call this your " BASE " . <p> Then , for every web site that you need to have a separate password for , you construct it by taking the BASE and appending a suffix onto it that is specific to the web site in question. - - - This suffix should be very , very easy to remember. - It does not have to be " strong " , but it is good if it is ! - Let 's call this the " SUFFIX " . <p> The new password is " BASE " + " SUFFIX " . <p> For example , well make a strong BASE by taking a short phrase that we can remember and doctoring it up in a way that we can remember , but which makes it strong : <p> Pick some phrase like " i feel great " . - Multi-word phrases are good starting points for strong passwords , because they are memorable but not easily vulnerable to dictionary attacks . <p> This BASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but strong. - It uses letters , numbers , and symbols. - It uses upper and lower case letters. - It is not derived from a word in the dictionary or from personal information. - - You can use this site at Microsoft to check the strength of you password . <p> This BASE by itself is a good password , but since we do n't  want to use the same password everywhere , we need to generate custom passwords for each of our web site accounts by appending a suffix on to this base. - Note , adding more " stuff " onto a password that is already strong only makes it stronger . When making up suffixes , remember to choose suffixes that <p> Can not be guessed based on the name of the site your are going to. - I.e. do n't  use the suffix " amazon " or " amazon.com " for your login to amazon.com ! <p> Can not be guessed using a dictionary attack . <p> So , let 's do some examples to see how it works : <p> For our example login @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire " ( based on a reference to Amazons Kindle ebook reader ) to get a password " I Feel Gr8 ! kindle the fire " <p> For our example login to our Bank , we might use the suffix " i need money ! " to get " I Feel Gr8 ! i need money ! " <p> For our example login to our Blog , perhaps we use the suffix " no comment ! " to get " I Feel Gr8 ! no comment ! " <p> So you see : <p> It is OK to use spaces in your passwords <p> Using phrases with punctuation creates suffixes that are easy to remember and secure against dictionary attacks . <p> The resulting combined passwords are easy to remember , very strong , and very specific to each site . <h> Remembering your password suffixes <p> It is likely that no one will remember all of their suffixes immediately and you will want to protect against forgetting them years later. - You can write down a list of the suffixes , or better yet , make a ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suffixes and sites ( and usernames ) they go with. - Do not include the BASE in this file. - This makes for a cheat sheet that is easy to use and much more secure than your average password list . Without knowing the " BASE " , no one who looks at the cheat sheet actually can use any of the passwords listed. - And , since the BASE itself is a strong password , it will not be easily discovered . <p> If you want to save your BASE in a place for safe keeping , be sure to put it somewhere distinct from your suffix cheat sheet ( like on paper in your safety deposit box or vault ) . <h> Changing your passwords <p> Using the BASE+SUFFIX scheme , when you need to change your passwords ( as you should do regularly ) , all you have to do is change the BASE everywhere. - You can leave all the suffixes the same. - In this way , you get all new strong passwords that are all easy to remember , but only one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our goals ? <p> 1 . Make sure we have a different password for every site <p> The use of the SUFFIX ensures that all sites have different passwords . <p> Using suffixes that are moderately strong and not obvious ( to anyone but you ) based on the site you are trying to log in to , means that even if someone has the password to one of the sites , which as we mentioned above is very likely , and they know that you are using the BASE+SUFFIX method , it will still not be feasible for them to guess your password to other sites. - And , the better your choice of suffix , the greater the security . <p> 2 . Make sure that the passwords for all of the sites are " strong " <p> As the BASE part is strong , the BASE+SUFFIX is even stronger. - So , all of the passwords are distinct and strong . <p> 3 . Make sure that we can easily remember all of these passwords <p> You have one somewhat complex thing to remember , the BASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know. - The suffixes are all made up of phrases that should be memorable and related to each site so the combination is easy to remember , especially after you use it a few times . <p> 4 . Avoid writing all of these passwords down in an insecure manner . <p> While you can write down or save the SUFFIX list independently of the BASE , your backup copy of your passwords and sites should be very , very secure. - Maybe you do n't  need to write them down at all , if you have a good memory . <p> 5 . Make it easy to remember your passwords after changing them all <p> As you can change all password by just making a new BASE , it will be easy to remember all of the new ones , as you will already know the suffixes . <p> So , the BASE+SUFFIX method meets all of our goals ; however it relies on you to : <p> Choose a good strong BASE <p> Make each suffix not guessable based on the web site in question , i.e. strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thought , this is not very hard. - Actually , it can be kind of fun . <h> Help making a strong BASE password <p> Of course , making up your passwords all by yourself is the most secure thing you can do. - However , there are some web sites out there that can get you started : <p> Is your computer compromised ? - If there is a " key logger " installed on your computer either intentionally by someone else , or by the act of a virus , then everything your type is being logged , saved , and viewed by someone. - So , no matter what kind of security you may be using , when you type in that password , it is being saved and sent to someone ! - Be sure that your computer is secured , virus free , phishing software free , and that only you have administrative access. - If anyone else has administrative access to your computer , then you never know what software might be running and watching what you do and type . <p> Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your accounts on web sites. - If you do not do this , than anyone eavesdropping on your Internet traffic can see your username and password. - If you are in a pubilc wireless hot spot , use a VPN or SSL for everything , as eavesdropping is extraordinarily prevalent in such locations . <p> If you tell someone your password , assume that they have written it down , told other people , used it in a computer with a key logger , or had it discovered through eavesdropping. - You never know . <p> If you are typing your password in and someone is watching you , they may be able to discern what you typed ! <h> Centalized online storage for copies of your passwords <p> LuxSci recommends using a secure online repository for storing copies of all of your usernames and passwords . <p> The copies are not stored on your computer or on paper anywhere ( except maybe in a vault ) and this vastly increases your security . <p> You can access the copies from anywhere , over a secure channel , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , no matter where you are located . <p> You can securely store other information along with these passwords for reference , such as : <p> If you work with others and have a shared collection of passwords that are used to access various sites , you can share these online with everyone and even specify who has permission to access which passwords . <p> You should still keep a copy of all of your passwords in a vault somewhere " just in case " . <p> LuxScis Passwords WebAide is a secure online password ( and related information ) storage system that does all of this , including facilitating sharing between users. - It encrypts all password data using your own PGP certificates ( which you can upload or which we can generate for you ) , so all of the data is encrypted while stored and is only decryptable by you when you login and supply your certificate password to open the secure password entries . <p> You should be aware that there are programs out there designed to crack open the saved passwords. - One such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong Master Password , then your encrypted database may be susceptible to being broken into. - For help on choosing a strong password , see : Security Simplified : The Base+Suffix Method for Memorable Strong Passwords . <p> I would just like to point out that some provisions should be made for the few ( but painfully real ) sites that restrict the password : some restrict it to 8 characters , some do not allow non alphanumeric characters , etc . A method for falling back to a weaker but site-compliant password would be good ( such as " the first 4 characters of the BASE + the first 4 characters of the SUFFIX " , with non alphanumeric characters replaced by some allowed character , e.g. , " x " ) . <p> There are many ways to choose strong ( i.e. hard to guess ) passwords that are also easy to remember. - We have discussed this in detail and given one very good method in this article : Security Simplified : The Base+Suffix Method for Memorable Strong Passwords

You buy one and pay once . there is no monthly fee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good one can be had for $100 to $150 . <p> Space .

These drives are most likely to fail right after being purchased , or after a number of years but in truth they can fail at any time . - You can get backup drives with " RAID " ( multiple disks inside that give your protection in case one fails ) , however , these are somewhat more expensive .. and you still have to deal with replacing failed parts over time , even if you do not lose your backups in the process . <p> Using a cloud backups <p> There are many , many services out there offering cloud backups. - The purpose here is not to compare them to each other or examine nuances such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general to using an external drive . <p> Pros <p> Price . Ya a pro of both solutions . - Cloud backup solutions do not have an up-front cost ; they are instead " paid monthly " . - This can run from $2-$5 , or a little more , per computer per month . - This is very cost effective . <p> Proximity . Cloud backups happen well , in the " cloud " somewhere . - That is really some virtual universe , and certainly nowhere near your computer . - So , if your computer fails or your town is hit by a meteorite , your data is still OK and can be recovered once you emerge from your bunker and buy a new laptop . <p> Redundancy .

Here are the steps involved : <p> 1 . Registration of the Domain <p> John goes to some company , such as LuxSci , and finds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by someone else . He then registers it , paying a fee for one or more years . What does this registration actually buy him ? It depends on the company he registered at and for what exactly he signed up ; however , it usually only means that John has now leased the domain name for some period of time . He does n't  actually " own " it , he just has the sole right to use it for some period of time , after which he has the right to renew his lease or let someone else have it . <p> Note that when you register a new domain name say at LuxSci , it will take- up to 24 hours for that domain to become live and functional on the Internet . If you register it elsewhere , it may take longer . <p> - John then contacts some company , such as LuxSci , to order hosting . A hosting company provides the computers on which Johns web site files will reside and/or which will accept email for John at this new domain name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domain gave John a " name " on the Internet ( e.g. johnsample.com ) ; obtaining web or email hosting services gives him an " address " the Internet addresses of the computers owned by the hosting compan(ies) that will be handling Johns web and email needs ( e.g .172.151.2.12 ) . What is missing is a connection between the easy-to-remember name and the actual addresses where the services reside . <p> We like to make the analogy that DNS is like a " phone book " for domain names . It contains entries that indicate which Internet ( Internet Protocol IP ) address corresponds to which domain name ( and vice versa ) . You probably use DNS all the time and do n't  even know it ! Whenever you type an address such as " http : //google.com " into your web browser , the web browser uses DNS to find out the numerical address(es) of the computers that handle Googles web site ; it then uses these addresses to connect to those computers to get the web site files . <p> Thus , anyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or web services needs DNS services as well . These services are usually provided by your web or email hosting company , because they know their computer addresses and should be in a position to update your DNS settings for you if any of their computers addresses need changing . <p> You may be able to manage your DNS settings yourself if , for example , your domain registration company provides this service to you , or if you use a company like easyDNS ( of which LuxSci is a partner and whose services LuxSci offers at a discount to its members ) . <p> 3 . Transfer your domain . <p> If your web hosting company is going to take care of your DNS settings for you , you need to give them control over these settings . This means telling your domain registrar ( Register.com in this example ) what servers your web hosting company is going to be using for your DNS. your web hosting company will tell you what to say . <h> DNS Summary <p> Now , you should have a rough picture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 3 sets of computers involved ! <p> One set belongs to your domain name registrar . They keep track of what domains are registered , who currently " owns " them , and what computers manage the DNS settings for each of these domains . ( This information is stored in a big database called the " WHOIS " database ) . <p> One set belongs to the company that manages the DNS settings for your domain . These computers understand what computer addresses correspond to what domain names . Other computers , like your web browser , can ask them to look up the name for an address , or vice versa . <p> The third set belongs to your web and email hosting company . On these computers , your web site files are stored and your email is delivered . These are almost always different computers than the ones that handle the DNS and WHOIS . <h> Mail Exchange ( MX ) Records <p> An " MX Record " is a DNS entry that indicates what server(s) handle inbound email messages for your domain . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that handle your web site . - They may also be different from the servers on which you email is stored . <p> " MX " stands for " Mail Exchange " . Typically , you will have 2 or more MX records for your domain . One is primary ; the others are secondary and will provide load balancing or failover for increased delivery reliability . - E.g. in case one server is down , the others can still receive your email . <p> MX Record Priority <p> What is up with the MX record priority ? - These are numbers that go along with each MX record . - The " priority " can be any number zero or higher ( e.g. 0 , 10 , 14 , 999 , etc. ) . - The priority is used only to sort the MX records . - The mail server should try the MX record with the smallest numerical priority first , and if it fails to connect to that server , try the next one with the next highest priority . - If multiple records have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random ( or their use should be rotated ) . <p> So , the actual numerical value of the priority does n't  matter at all . - It does n't  matter if its " 10 " or " 15 " or " 100 " . - All that matters is which numbers are bigger than which others and which ones are the same . as this defines the priority of which servers are tried first and which ones are " load balanced " to some degree . <h> Subdomains <p> If John Sample registered " johnsample.com " , then he really can have any number of domain names , as long as they each end in " . johnsample.com " . I.e. " www.johnsample.com " , " blog.johnsample.com " , and " **26;1534;TOOLONG " are all domains that John has a right to setup and use because he has registered " johnsample.com " . These are all called " subdomains " because you can not register them individually , but get them if you register the domain " johnsample.com " . Subdomains are created when entries for them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can configure your DNS settings to use any addresses you wish for web and email for any of your subdomains . Your DNS provider should allow you to do this as a matter of course . <p> If your subdomain is configured to point to another domain or subdomain name , rather than to a computers address , it is known as an " alias " or a " CNAME " . - When a domain or subdomain points directly to a computers numberical " IP Address " , this is known as an " A record " ( Address Record ) . For example <p> blog.johnsample.com -&gt; 172.99.99.2 ( This is an A or " Address " record ) <p> blog.johnsample.com -&gt; wordpress.org ( This is an alias " CNAME " record , where your domain gets the address that wordpress.org has by referencing it by name ) . <h> DNS Propagation : Time-To-Live ( TTL ) <p> The " Time-To-Live " or TTL is an important DNS parameter that you should be aware of when you want to change your DNS settings. - A TTL is roughly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your DNS to take effect all throughout the Internet. - A small TTL setting , such as 20 minutes , will allow all your changes to propagate across the Internet in about 20 minutes or so , a large setting can result in the changes taking days to be noticed . A typical default setting can be 3 to 24 hours ! - Clients for whom LuxSci manages their DNS generally have their TTLs set to 3 hours , unless they request otherwise . Note that the TTL is also the time it will take for changes in the TTL to be effective ! <p> This means that if your TTL is 1 day and you plan to make a change that needs to take effect in 15 minutes , then you should : <p> Change the TTL to 15 minutes <p> Wait 1 day for the change in TTL to propagate across the Internet <p> Any other changes to your DNS after this 1 day wait will then propagate in no more than 15 minutes . <p> Why are DNS Changes not Instantly Available ? <p> The answer reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE available instantly on the actual computers that manage your DNS. - In order to prevent everyone in the world from asking your DNS servers directly for your DNS information , which would bog them down greatly , DNS is set up so that peoples computers ask local DNS servers in their ISPs. - These return the information if known , otherwise , they ask other " upstream " servers until eventually some server asks the main " authoritative " ones at your DNS provider . - All of these intermediate servers keep the information so that they can give it out again quickly without asking the " upstream " servers again. - This information is all remembered as long as your TTL is ( without going into the fine details ) . - For this reason , its takes a time equal to the TTL before all of these servers will refresh their information. - It also means that some people will see your new DNS settings sooner than other people . all based on when their DNS servers need to refresh their saved information . <p> This distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quick and minimizes the work your DNS providers servers have to do . It has the drawback that the other DNS severs have stale information whenever you change your DNS settings . To compensate , you can set your TTL to be small . Effectively , if a DNS server has information that is older than the TTL , the DNS server does n't  trust that the data is accurate and goes to get a fresh copy when asked . This is why the time it can take your DNS changes to propagate across the Internet is approximately the TTL setting you have configured for your domain . <p> Why not always use a very small TTL ? <p> There are two main reasons for that : <p> Speed : The smaller your TTL , the slower your email or web site will be as computers and servers will have to be spending more time looking up and refreshing DNS information . <p> If your TTL is very small ( e.g. sub 5 minutes ) than some improperly configured DNS servers may disregard it and use a larger TTL. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it can happen . <h> DNS Text Records for Anti-Spam Protection <p> Another form of DNS record is the " Text " record ( TXT record ) . - These allow you to have any arbitrary text associated with any domain . - Anyone on the Internet can query your DNS and see what this text says and know that you , the person in charge of your domain , put it there . - How is this useful ? - It can help stop forged and fake email : <p> 1 . SPF ( Sender Policy Framework ) Records <p> With SPF records , you add some special instructions to your DNS that specifies which servers on the Internet are permitted to send email using your domain . - Spam filters can use this when they look at email purporting to be from you to see if it was sent from your servers or not . - If not , the message can be treated as Spam . <h> 7 Responses to " Understanding Domain Name Service ( DNS ) " <p> Domain name services control the publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your web site , your email , and other services. - Any domain that is being used ( as opposed to merely being " parked " for possible later use ) needs DNS services to function. - Please refer to- Understanding Domain Name Service ( DNS ) . <p> domain ( these are the " mail exchange " or MX records for the domain ; see also Understanding Domain Name Service ( DNS ) ) includes an ordered list of SMTP Servers that expect to receive email for this recipient .

S/MIME is like SSL for Email Encryption <p> Published : March 24th , 2015 <p> S/MIME is a popular technology for end-to-end email encryption and is analogous to PGP in the way that it works . - It is commonly available in most modern email programs and in many server-side email and WebMail encryption services like LuxSci SecureLine . <p> Folks are used to thinking about Internet security and encryption in terms of web site security . E.g. the " https : // " that secures our everyday life working in our web browsers is the signal that SSL/TLS is being used to encrypt traffic between ourselves and the web server . - People are even becoming used to the fact that TLS ( with SMTP ) is also commonly used to secure the transport of email messages from server-to-server . <p> These are all good things ! <p> S/MIME ( like PGP ) is different it encrypts the email message before it is sent and the message stays encrypted until the recipient opens it . - It " does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipient its secure the whole way. 1 - But did you know that S/MIME is really just an application of the same SSL/TLS technology that secures your traffic to securing your messages ? <p> 1 S/MIME ( and PGP ) do not secure your message headers ( e.g. the subject , recipients , etc. ) , it only secures the message body and attachments . - So , the added security of SMTP over TLS does serve to protect those things that S/MIME does not protect . <h> How can S/MIME be SSL ? <p> Well , it is not strictly SSL. - But it is conceptually SSL. - If we review how SSL works ( see how in more detail ) from 100 feet away : <p> Way ahead of time : The server is issued a certificate from a " universally trusted authority " for a- web site . <p> You connect to the web site/server and " do the SSL dance " ( your browser talking to the server ) : <p> Get the servers certificate <p> Decide if its valid and you trust it <p> Agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encryption , etc . <p> Agree on an encryption key for this session of secure dialog <p> You then talk to the server over this secure channel using the agreed-upon crypto <p> This works very well and is the fundamental way that traffic on Internet is currently secured . - Many bugs and flaws have been found ( and will be found ) in this and they have been and are fixed as fast as possible ; its the best we have at the moment . <h> So What does this have to do with S/MIME email encryption ? <p> S/MIME works much like the above description of SSL , except there can be no " dialog " between client and server due to the time delay between sending and opening the message . <p> With S/MIME : <p> Way ahead of time : The recipient gets a certificate which can be from a " trusted authority " <p> This certificate is exactly the same as an SSL certificate . - The difference lines in the fact that it is issued for an email address like " joe@domain.com " instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , people are usually less concerned about getting certificates for S/MIME from a universally trusted source but the trust mechanisms are the same as they are for SSL . <p> The public part of the is recipients certificate is somehow communicated to the sender before the emailmessageis sent <p> This is the " hard part . " - It could be sent in another email , be published in DNS , available through the senders email service provider , etc . <p> The sender ( actually his email system ) constructs a secure message using S/MIME <p> The choice of algorithms used here is exactly the same as those used for SSL/TLS . <p> Choose an encryption key for the message <p> Encrypt that encryption key using the recipients S/MIME certificate ( so only the recipient can open it and thus open the meat of the message ) <p> Encrypt the message body and sign it using the chosen crypto . <p> Format all that in an " S/MIME " way so that it becomes- a regular email message and can be recognized by the recipient as S/MIME . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> S/MIME is exactly like SSL/TLS in that : <p> They use the same kinds of certificates ( x.509 ) to identify SSL servers and S/MIME recipients and to handle trust <p> They use the same kinds of cryptographic hashes ( e.g. SHA1 or SHA256 , etc . ) <p> They use the same kinds of symmetric encryption functions - ( e.g. AES256. etc . ) <p> The symmetric encryption key is communicated to the recipient using the same the recipients public S/MIME key in an analogous way to how this happens with SSL/TLS . <p> Both mechanisms can encrypt your email in transit : however , TLS/SSL does a more complete job of this . <p> S/MIME differs from SSL/TLS in that : <p> There is no real-time dialog <p> This is a really important difference for security , as we will see in our next post . <p> The sender and recipient do not get to agree on what cryptographic- algorithms are used as part of the sending process the sender picks ones that will be compatible with the recipients S/MIME key and which the sender thinks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually place more- implicit trust in recipient S/MIME keys than they do in the certificates offered by web sites <p> This is because there is much less of an issue with man-in-the-middle attacks with S/MIME due to the fact that these certificates- are usually communicated out-of-band , before the message is sent . <p> S/MIME secures your messages at rest while they are sitting around in email folders and backups ( but only the bodies and attachments ) . <p> Hold On ! <p> If S/MIME is so much like SSL ( indeed the universal open source " openssl " library is often used for both SSL , TLS , and S/MIME ) , how secure is it ? - Is S/MIME subject to any of the problems we have seen over the past years related to SSL/TLS ? - E.g.

This worked by : <p> Ensuring that all email sent from any user in any domain that requires- compliance- in an account was- encrypted . Email sent from users in other domains in the same account be sent as regular email . <p> Not requiring customers to obtain and manage separate accounts ( one for HIPAA-compliant email on one domain like " info@secure.doctor.com " and one for regular email on another domain like " info@doctor.com " ) <p> Domain-wide compliance permits customers to have one single account which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The customer is required to use only compliant users for ePHI and it is up to the customer to ensure that s/he is using the secure users when needed ( obviously LuxSci can not monitor that ) to ensure that the customer is operating in a compliant way . - This reflects the customers own responsibilities regarding the proper handling of PHI in all other circumstances . <p> Use of separate secure and insecure users does permit the customer- to send PHI securely and to send regular email without PHI ; however , it can be annoying and time consuming to require setup of 2 email accounts and switch between addresses ( generally , with increased security comes decreased usability ) . - There is also a cost associated with duplicate addresses for these differing purposes . <p> Customers have told us that they would ideally like to be able to choose on a per-message basis if encryption is needed after all , who knows better than the customer which messages contain PHI and which do not ? - <p> Now you can ! <h> You Decide if an Email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email encryption enables end users to decide on a message-by-messages basis in WebMail if encryption is needed . - If there is no PHI , the message can be sent without encryption . <h> How It Works <p> If you decide the message does not contain PHI and you want it to be sent without SecureLine encryption , simply uncheck the " Encryption " check box in WebMail . <p> When you press " Send " , you will get a confirmation dialog that will ask you to certify that the message does not contain any PHI and can be sent without encryption . <p> If you press the button to certify that the message contains no PHI , the message will be sent as regular email and this " opting out " of encryption will be logged . <h> Its up to the Account Administrator <p> Allowing end users to decide for themselves if encryption is needed is a risk for account administrators , as they must ensure that their end users are well trained and will make appropriate choices . <p> Allowing these end-user decisions is disabled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account-wide or domain-wide basis ; however , when an administrator in a HIPAA account enables this feature , the administrator must certify that s/he understands the implications and takes responsibility for the end users choices ( and this is logged ) . <p> Administrators who do allow their users to be able to opt out of encryption do have some new tools on their side to help ensure and monitor compliance : <p> Reports : Records of all messages that users have chosen to send without SecureLine encryption are logged and those logs are kept for 10 years . - Administrators can login and access these reports at any time . - Note that only the user , message I 'd , date and time , recipients , and subject of the messages sent in this way are kept in the long term logs . <p> Auditor : Administrators can specify an " auditor " email address that will automatically be sent copies of all messages that users have chosen to send without SecureLine- encryption. - In this way , user choices can be monitored in close to real time if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( We require that all messages going to the auditors be sent over TLS for security ) . <p> Any new or existing account can enable this user encryption " opt out " feature by going to their Account-wide SecureLine or Domain-Wide Outbound SecureLine configuration pages and choosing the new " On- User can opt-out of SecureLine when not needed . " method for " WebMail Encryption " . <h> What about SMTP ? <p> The changes described above apply only to sending email from the LuxSci WebMail interface .

@@22227524 @2227524/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <h> High Volume Bulk Email : Key Ingredients for Good Deliverability <p> Published : October 14th , 2013 <p> How do you ensure your messages make it into your recipients INBOXes ? <p> Deliverability is key to anyone sending newsletters , announcements , notifications , or any other type of bulk email . - As a provider of premium and bulk email services , we constantly advise customers on how they can legitimately avoid having messages marked as spam and ensure that they are not black listed . In this article , we- consolidate- our advice for everyones benefit . - This includes : ensuring you have a good mailing list , - maintaining- your mailing list , email message content , and reputation management techniques like SPF , DKIM , and IP anonymization . <h> Step 1 : A Good , Clean Mailing List is Essential <p> The number one mistake that we see is people wanting to use a poor quality mailing list . <p> LuxSci , like other legitimate bulk mail providers , requires that your mailing list contain only recipients who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you abide by the CAN-SPAM Act . - Doing anything else is likely to get you blacklisted and to have your account terminated for violations of your providers terms of service . <p> What does " explicitly opted to receive email from you " really mean ? <p> The recipient actively and knowingly chose to become a member of your mailing list . <p> E.g. this could be by : <p> Actively checking a check box in a form on your site ( a subscription form or an option when they are placing an order ) . NOTE : these check boxes should not be pre-checked unless they person must also confirm the subscription in some other way . <p> Becoming a customer or business associate of yours , where they have an expectation of getting mailings from you . - You should always provide them an opportunity to not receive your mailings . <p> Signing up in any other way like a physical sign up sheet or card at your- physical- office <p> Sending you an email or text message requesting that they be added to your mailing list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of how the persons address was opted into your list ( in case they complain later ) . - If they complain and you have no idea how they were added then how can you prove that it was an actual " opt-in " ? <p> Poor mailing lists contain recipient email addresses that were : <p> Taken from web site pages ( manually or by automated " spider " processes ) <p> Purchased from a third party . Why ? Even if the people on this list opted in to it they certainly did not intend to opt in to mailings from whoever might buy it ! - Purchased lists are a " big no no " in the industry . <p> Copied from a membership directory where you are just another member . - E.g. it may be OK for a Chamber of- Commerce- to send a bulk mail to its members , but it is NOT OK for one member to send bulk email to the other members . <p> Made by guessing addresses ( e.g. sending to " joe@gmail.com " and " john@gmail.com " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " Spam Trap " addresses e.g. addresses that were created and added ( as bait ) to a web page or other location and never used for anything else . - Any messages actually sent to them must be non-opt in by definition and the address was added to the list - in a " poor " way . <p> Contain many addresses that are invalid and which always bounce . <p> You should do everything you can to ensure that you mailing list is fully opt in and contains no addresses that are " poor " . - If you are unsure about a recipients address , do not use it . Furthermore , if you are violating CAN-SPAM , there are significant penalties : <p> Each separate email in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act is subject to penalties of up to $16,000 ! <h> - Step 2 : Mailing List Maintenance <p> Once you have a good opt-in mailing list and start using it , it is essential that you actively maintain this list and keep it updated . - In addition to adding new opt-in subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no longer functional , or failing to deliver <p> Remove addresses of people who have requested to be opted out of your mailings <p> Remove addresses of people who have " marked your email as Spam " <p> Each of these tasks is very important ; here is why : <p> Removing failing and invalid addresses . <p> Many email providers actively track the number of messages that you send to invalid recipient addresses on their servers . - If you send to " too many " of these ( the threshold varies widely ) , these providers may temporarily or permanently block your messages . - Why ? - Because sending to lots of invalid addresses is characteristic of mailings to purchased lists and to list of addresses that are " made up " or scanned from web sites . - Also , a sender with a good opt-in list would not be sending to invalid addresses <p> Many bulk email providers provide you with an easy way to get reports of what addresses are failing and why . - Use these reports to prune your lists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opt out requests . <p> When a recipient uses your opt out mechanism to remove him/herself from your list , you must ensure that that address never gets any more email from you and that that removal is effective very quickly . - This is required by the CAN SPAM act and by proper net behavior. - Additionally , if you continue to send to people who have requested opt outs , these people are likely to complain to their ISPs and to other- organizations- and you are likely to get black listed . <p> Remove addresses of people who have " marked your email as Spam . " <p> A large number of recipients will not use your " opt out " instructions to remove themselves from your list . - Why ? - Because either ( a ) they are lazy , or ( b ) they assume that use of these instructions will confirm their email address and actually result in your sending them more " unwanted email " . - Instead , they use their email providers " mark as spam " feature to delete your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you . <p> If you can determine what recipients have done this and proactively remove their addresses from your mailing lists ( as if they had oped out ) , your mailings will stop going to recipients who you know do not want them and will annoy fewer people greatly lessening the chance of recipients complaining about the receipt of unwanted email and thus the chance of being blacklisted . <p> Note that recipients will mark messages as spam and complain about them if they do not want them no matter if they are properly opted in or not . - That is the nature of the way people currently interact with email . - Your goal is to ensure that your messages make it to those who want them and also that they DO NOT get to those who do not want them . - Not only does this make your mailings faster and more efficient , it also helps eliminate complaints and improves your mailing reputation . <p> LuxSci has feedback agreements with many major ISPs. - We automatically collect all reports of messages recipients at these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comcast , etc. ) have marked as Spam and provide these reports to you so that you can proactively remove them from your lists . We also use this information to detect senders that generate excessive numbers of complaints . <h> Fixing old or poor mailing lists <p> Customers and prospects often tell us that they either have a " very old ( years old ) mailing list " or a one that is " opt out " instead of " opt in " , or some other mailing list with many " poor " addresses on it . - They usually are seeking advice on how to validate the list . - That is : <p> Find out what addresses are now invalid and remove them , and/or <p> Get permission from the recipients on the list for future mailings <p> The problem is that the current list is already poor and sending any kind of bulk mailing to it for any purpose even to ask if the recipients would like more mailings from you in the future is a violation of most companys terms of service for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - sending bulk unsolicited email . - If you find yourself in possession of such a mailing list , the best thing to do is to either : <p> Discard it altogether , or <p> Validate which addresses are good through some means other than sending them an email . - E.g. by cross referencing with current customer lists or other means , if appropriate . <h> Message Content is King <p> So , now that you have a good mailing list and are ready to maintain it and begin sending bulk email messages , you must consider the content of the messages to be sent . - We very often find email messages that are blocked or denied due only to their content and not due to any kind of blacklisting . <p> Keep the following in mind : <p> Keep the messages concise and use clean and simple HTML if you are using HTML markup <p> Try to avoid using links to third party web site pages in your messages which may have a poor reputation . - Messages are often denied based on the web site address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message content and mailing list quality , there are several additional factors that play into the deliverability of your email . <p> Your email servers IP address reputation . <p> If you are sending from an email server that is known to send lots of spam ( e.g. maybe it is blacklisted already ) , then your recipients may block your messages through no fault of your own . - Poor sending reputations can occur : <p> If you are sending from an email server used by others and where those others are sending Spam or to poor quality mailing lists <p> Using a bulk mailing provider that is very strict about terms of service and about shutting down customers who are not abiding by proper bulk mailing- practices . <p> If your IP at your ISP is on blacklists , then send through a bulk mailing provider that can hide this bad IP from your recipients ( e.g. see LuxSci SMTP Anonymization ) <p> Obtain a dedicated IP address for your sending ( e.g. through a dedicated server ) . <p> Note that getting " many different IP addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a mechanism Spammers use to spread out their bad behavior across many IPs so that the effect of- inevitable- blacklisting is somewhat minimized. - In the past people had used this technique to try to improve deliverability. - Now-a-days , especially with the extreme shortage of IP ( v4 ) addresses in the world , no legitimate mail provider will be able to provide blocks of IP v4 addresses to a single customer for the purpose of bulk mailing , under any conditions . its just not permitted by ICANN. - The best you can do is to have one dedicated IP address per dedicated server that you utilize . <p> SPF . Adding " Sender Policy Framework " DNS records is useful as they allow recipients to verify that the messages you are sending are coming from a server approved to send email for your domain . - Hence , the messages you are sending are not- fraudulent- and perhaps are a little less likely to be Spam . <p> DKIM . DomainKeys Identified Mail , like SPF , helps differentiate legitimate email from fraudulent email and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signatures . LuxScis High Volume- Outbound SMTP supports both DKIM and SPF . <p> Reverse DNS . The IP address the your mail server uses to send outbound email needs to have a " Reverse DNS " . - E.g. if you ask " what server belongs to this IP " there must be an answer and that answer should match the domain name that that server uses to identify itself . - This is the responsibility of your bulk mailing provider ( LuxSci takes care of this- automatically ) but if it is setup incorrectly or missing , you will have significant deliverability issues . <p> Ramping up sending . If you want to send a LOT of email messages ( hundreds of thousands or millions at once ) , it is best to start be sending smaller blasts to subsets of your recipients . - Gradually , over a few weeks , build up to your full mailing size . - Especially if you have a " new clean IP " , recipient mail servers may see a sudden large jump in mail from your IP or mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - By actively ramping up , you effectively " warm " your IP address and get the recipient systems used to seeing email from your organization and for it not be not classified as spam by end users . - So , when you start sending to the complete list , the messages will be more readily accepted . <h> Guaranteed- Deliverability and White Listing Agreements <p> Many potential customers ask if we can " Guarantee " delivery of their messages to the INBOX of recipients at major ISPs like Gmail , Yahoo ! , etc. - This- obviously- would be desirable . - Marketing language on some bulk mailing- companys web sites also seems to indicate that such agreements are possible and that only they can provide them . <p> In general , there is no way to- guarantee- delivery to anyones mailbox and in general the only " agreements " that major ISPs have is to allow senders to get feed back reports of messages marked as spam by their users . - These feed back agreements ( which are sometimes even called " white list agreements " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gmailstates : - While Gmail works hard to deliver all legitimate mail to a users inbox , its possible that some legitimate messages may be marked as spam . Gmail does not accept whitelisting requests from bulk senders , and we cant guarantee that all of your messages will bypass our spam filters . <p> Verizons " WhiteList Form " states that applicants " agree to abide by Verizon Onlines policies and requirements regarding whitelist status and acknowledge that nothing herein guarantees delivery of mail originating from a whitelisted address or domain . " - I.e. it is really an application to a feedback loop and not an actual " white list " . <h> Conclusion <p> If you have read this entire article , you will see that there is no deliverability guarantee- and that ISPs would never want to make such- guarantees- as that would open the door to having their users being forced to receive Spam and other unsolicited email ( no ISP would want that ) . The best you can do to ensure good deliverability is to adhere to as many of the above guidelines as possible :

Here we discuss what these are , what they do for you , and how to add them using LuxSci SecureLine email encryption . <h> What are Digital Signatures ? <p> In short , adding a digital signature to an email message allows : <p> The recipient to know for certain who sent the message ( as the " From " and other standard sender information associated with an email message is easily forged ) . <p> The recipient can know for certain when the message was sent . <p> The recipient can know for certain that the message was not tampered with after being sent <p> While digital signatures themselves do not provide any kind of encryption , they do provide important components to email security resolving issues with message modification , false messages , message replay , and repudiation ( the " i did n't  send that " excuse ) . <p> Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cryptography. - The sender has a " private key " that only s/he has access do . - S/he attaches some content to the message , including a digital fingerprint , and encrypts it using that " private key " . - That content can only be opened using the senders " public key " but anyone can have that . - If you can open the message with the senders public key , then you know that the private key was used to encrypt it and thus who sent it . - Once open , you can compare the digital fingerprint with a new one associated with the message contents to see if they have been altered and you can look at other data saved therein , like a sent time stamp . <p> Use of digital signatures essentially requires either : <p> The sender and recipient to both use the same kind of public key cryptography ( i.e. PGP or S/MIME ) , or <p> The message to be sent and received through a third party web site or application that takes care of the encryption and signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much " easier " but perhaps less secure as it involves trusting the third party . <h> Digital Signatures at LuxSci <p> There are essentially three ways to use Digital Signatures with LuxSci email . <h> SecureLine Escrow <p> This is by far the simplest method . - When a customers sends secure messages using SecureLine Escrow : <p> The message is encrypted and also digitally signed using PGP ( a LuxSci system PGP certificate is used the sender does n't  need to generate his/her own certificate ) . <p> When the recipient picks up the message in the web-based Escrow portal , the digital signature is verified and displayed so the recipient can be sure that ( a ) the message was not modified , ( b ) exactly when it was sent , and ( c ) exactly who sent it . <p> In this case , while the sender of the message is not using his/her own certificate to establish identity , the LuxSci system has already established the users identity though the login process and thus " vouches " for the senders identity . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way unless the senders account or password is stolen . <p> This is not quite as secure as using your own PGP or S/MIME certificate for identity verification , but it eliminates the need to : <p> Generate your own certificate <p> Protect your certificate <p> Send only to recipients who can verify digital signatures using the same technology . <h> SecureLine PGP and S/MIME <p> SecureLine-licensed users can : <p> Have LuxSci auto-generate PGP and/or S/MIME certificates for them <p> Import existing PGP and S/MIME certificates , if some are already in use <p> Add the PGP and/or S/MIME public keys of recipients to address book entries <p> So , when sending secure email messages via LuxSci WebMail or SMTP : <p> LuxSci will automatically use PGP or S/MIME if the sender has a certificate and a certificate for the recipient can be found ( in the senders address book or shared address book or in the recipients LuxSci account if the recipient is a LuxSci SecureLine user as well ) . <p> In addition to encrypting the message using PGP or S/MIME , LuxSci will also digitally sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his/her email system , s/he can decrypt it and verify the digital signature . - This mechanism does require that the recipient is using some technology that supports PGP or S/MIME. - It does not require the LuxSci sender to have any special software involved or to use any special email program . <p> LuxSci SecureLine does not currently support sending messages that are " signed only " messages can be either encrypted only or encrypted and signed ( depending on what certificates are available for the sender and recipient ) . <h> Email Program-Based PGP and S/MIME <p> Any email user or LuxSci or any other email service can configure his/her email program to use PGP or S/MIME for sending of messages . <p> S/MIME is recommended as it comes built into most modern email programs . - Use of PGP usually requires some kind of add on or plug-in , which may cost additional money . <p> You will need to get and install a certificate into your program <p> You will need to set up your email program with the public keys of your recipients if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you are going to do is send- digitally- signed messages , then this is not necessary . <p> Then , when you send a message , you can choose to encrypt and/or sign messages at will . - Once again , this mechanism does require that the recipient is using some technology that supports the same PGP or S/MIME method that you have chosen to use .

@@22227532 @2227532/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> Update January , 2015. - SSL v3 should be turned off . - RC4 is now weak and should not be used anymore , even as a work around to the BEAST attack . - LuxSci recommends to use TLS v1.1+ and NIST-recommended ciphers. - The BEAST is not really considered a significant vector ( even with TLS v1.0 ) compared to other things , anymore . <p> Update April , 2012. openssl v1.0.1 is out and it supports TLS v1.1 and v1.2 which help mitigate this attack . - All web sites hosted by LuxSci now use this updated software and are safe from BEAST . - LuxSci recommends using a web host which supports TLS v1.1 and v1.2 for secure web connections . <p> - <p> SSL v3 and TLS v1 are subject to a serious exploit , according to a recently published attack mechanism ( called BEAST ) . - This sounds foundation-shattering and kind of scary . When people see this , as when we did , the first panicky questions that arise are : <p> What is really affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do to protect myself ? <p> How does the BEAST attack actually work ? <p> After researching this issue , we have digested what we have found and produced this article to answer all of these questions for you . <h> What is really affected by BEAST ? <p> This problem can affect people browsing secure web sites , allowing eavesdroppers to gain full access to your accounts on those web sites under certain conditions . - It does not affect <p> Accounts you may have with secure web sites that you login to , like PayPal , LuxSci , Gmail , Bank of America , Facebook , etc . <h> When could my web site browsing be- compromised ? <p> If you are using a network where someone malicious can view all normal traffic on the network , and where they can also intercept and modify that traffic , then they can try to- compromise- your secure web site browsing . <p> Note that this does not include bad people using the same wifi network or ISP as you , who can eavesdrop on your insecure connections SSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does include situations where , for example : <p> The folks in charge of your local network are malicious . <p> Malicious folks have broken into your local network and have gained control over its servers . <p> You are in a country where all network traffic into and out of it is monitored . <p> People who are not in malicious countries and are using networks that are " trusted " probably do not have to worry too much . - By " trusted " , we mean <p> The administrators as your local ISP ( i.e. Comcast , AOL , Verizon , etc. ) are usually trusted . - We already trust them to a large degree if they wanted to they could compromise- our systems much more easily than using this TLS attack ( i.e. by designing- Trojans- or viruses and introducing them into our systems ) <p> The IT staff running your school or work network are usually trusted . - ( Well , the people at work already " own " everything you do in their network. ) - And , like ISP operations staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to you much more easily than this TLS attack , if they wanted to . <p> The Government do you trust them to not force ISPs to eavesdrop on you ? - Even if they were doing this , depending on the- Government- involved and the situation , most people would have little to worry about . <p> This attack is an issue of organizations that want to eavesdrop on your communications or access your accounts without your knowledge and who either ( a ) already know what web sites you frequent , or ( b ) have access to enough peoples web traffic that they just try to compromise accounts of very popular places like Gmail , PayPal , or certain Banks . <p> If you are not the trusting sort , you see that there is a significant threat potential here that depends on where you are and what you are doing . <h> Under what conditions can I be compromised ? <p> Simply put , if there is an attack made against you , you could be compromised if : <p> You load up any insecure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ http : // and not https : // ) and have JavaScript enabled in your browser . <p> You keep browsing the Internet using the same browser for up to 10 minutes <p> You then visit that secure web site which the attacker desires to be able to access as you . <p> Note that the attacker needs to guess or know about 10 minutes ahead of time what secure web site you are going to visit . - This timeframe of 10 minutes will get shorter and shorter as more computer power is brought to bear in the attacks . <p> As an example , let us assume that the attacker is trying to eavesdrop on everyones Gmail account accesses in order to gain usernames , passwords , and other sensitive data . <p> When you visit an insecure web page ( like http : //google.com ) <p> The attacker beings gathering and processing data for accessing https : //gmail.com <p> You surf around for a while , <p> You visit https : //gmail.com to check your email <p> The attacker is able to use the information gathered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as you . <h> How can I protect myself ? <p> If you are concerned about this attack , you can protect yourself from it by : <p> Closing your browser ( all open windows ) <p> Open your browser and go directly to the desired secure site without connecting to any insecure sites first . <p> This works because the attack requires the same browser session be used for a period of time . - Closing and re-opening your browser negates any preparation work done by the attacker. - Starting in a secure ( https : // ) web browsing session prevents the attacker from even getting started . <p> You can accomplish this without much effort by : <p> Make your " home page " ( the page that opens when you start your web browser ) a secure page . - I.e. https : //luxsci.com. - Then you can use browser-bookmarks to your favorite secure sites to navigate to them from your initial secure page . <p> Put - bookmarks to frequently visited secure web sites on your desktop , so when you click on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure page . <p> Use a VPN ( virtual private network ) . - If you connect your computer to a network you do trust ( like work ) , this sends all your secure and insecure web connections over the VPN bypassing any ability of a malicious person in your local network from viewing or interfering with any of your web browsing . <p> Also , if your attacker does n't  know your browsing habits , then they are unlikely to compromise your browsing of secure sites that are not very , very popular . - I.e. sites like gmail.com , facebook , com , bankofamerica.com , and other ones that very large numbers of people visit are likely targets . - Smaller sites like luxsci.com are not . - However , if the attacker knows where you visit , all bets are off in this respect . <h> How does the BEAST attack actually work ? <p> When you visit an insecure web page , the attacker alters the returned page or returned JavaScript to add malicious JavaScript to the content that you download . <p> This malicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have use of JavaScript enabled ) <p> The JavaScript opens a secure connection to ( for example ) https : //gmail.com <p> The attacker compares the encrypted traffic between your browser and https : //gmail.com with the known data that was sent by the JavaScript. - Using several minutes of computer processing power , the attacker can figure out something called the " Initialization Vector " of your secure session . <p> This information allows them to access the future secure authentication cookies sent to the same web site in the same browser session . <p> These cookies can be " replayed " by the attacker to give them full access to your account as if they were already logged in. - They can see any sensitive data that you have there and perform actions as you . <p> It is important to note that : <p> This attack requires JavaScript in a web browser to work . <p> It requires an insecure web connection be made and for the attacker to be able to modify the content returned to you . <p> The attacker must guess what secure web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to gather and analyze data . <p> You must then connect to and login to that same web site in the same browser session ( i.e. without closing and re-opening your browser or using a different browser ) . <p> The attacker must use that site as you while your logged in session is active ( if you explicitly logout , that would usually also logout the attacker ; let 's hope the attacker has not changed your password on you ! ) . <p> Also : <p> This attack affects SSL v3 and its successor , TLS v1.0 <p> It does not affect web sites using TLS v1.1 or TLS v1.2 for encryption <h> Well , can I just use " TLS v1.1 " or " TLS v1.2 " ? <p> The answer is " Yes , kind of " . <p> Only the Internet Explorer and Opera web browsers support TLS v1.1 and higher . - All other web browsers ( i.e. Google Chrome , FireFox , Safari , and probably most if not all mobile browsers ) do not support these newer security protocols at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are generally disabled by default . - There is also some concern that enabling them can cause issues accessing some regular secure web sites i.e. if you enable it and some sites no longer work , you know what happened . <p> Most web servers do not support TLS v1.1 or TLS v1.2 yet , so even if your browser supports it , your target secure site probably does not i.e. bankofamerica.com does not , luxsci.com does not , mail.google.com does not , etc . According to Opera only 0.25% of web servers support TLS v1.1 or better that is NOT 25% that is one quarter of one percent ! <h> Why do most servers not support the better TLS v1.1+ ? <p> The standard production-quality SSL software libraries , like " openssl " , do not yet include TLS v1.1 support so most web sites can not enable it . - While the newest still-in-development openssl versions do support TLS v1.1 , these are obviously not yet included in the standard operating system install distributions and there are concerns about performance , reliability , and bugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v1.1 and v1.2 support up until now . <p> LuxSci is contacting the various vendors ( like RedHat ) to see if perhaps TLS v1.1 support will be- incorporated- into existing distributions so that everyone out there who depends on these can upgrade easily . <p> The alternatives use some other SSL system or use a very new openssl distribution that has not been well vetted - in the context of peoples servers are both very unattractive as they would require many updates , lots of lots of testing , and probably some downtime to install and push out across an organization . - Use of alternative software would also mean that any future openssl security updates need to be managed either manually or via some new to-be-implemented update mechanisms . - All very unattractive that is why these alternate solutions are not in wide use yet , in deference to the standard auto-updating non-TLS v1.1-supporting versions . <p> Despite this , LuxSci.com is currently investigating adding TLS v1.1 support to its secure web servers as it is the right thing to do and the sooner the better . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like and also see if it supports TLS v1.1 or v1.2 by using this SSLLabs web site . <h> What about the Web Browser updates ? <p> The browser manufacturers are currently- investigating- this issue and the extent to which it makes their users vulnerable. - We would expect them to issue some browser software updates that mitigate this attack to some degree without needing web servers to upgrade to TLS v1.1 . While web server upgrades are , of course , desirable in the long run , they certainly wo n't happen fast . <p> Microsoft considers the threat level of this issue relatively low ; FireFox is looking to develop a " Fix " soon ; other TLS experts are not overly concerned at the moment . <h> The Take Away Message <p> People should always be concerned and aware of security as the landscape changes constantly. - We think that beyond the need to upgrade and to implement software fixes , consider the following : <p> We should actually use SSL and TLSwhenever possible . Insecure sites puts our browser and computer at risk , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our browsing session . - SSL and TLS actually protect us from that threat . <p> When going to secured web sites , it is best to start in a new browsing session or one that has only visited other secure ( https : // ) - sites . <p> Make your home page a secure site and your other secure sites easily-accessed via bookmarks <p> Use a separate web browsers for normal insecure browsing and for access to your secure sites . <p> If/when browser manufacturers push out fixes for this problem , the " threat level " will significantly decrease ( it is low at the moment anyway as there are probably few if any people out there actively using this attack vector yet ) . <p> However , it is very- likely that similar attacks that hijack insecure connections for various reasons will continue to arise in the future . - It would be a good habit to use separate browsers for your secure and insecure browsing , as described above . <h> 5 Responses to " Is SSL/TLS Really Broken by the BEAST attack ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> According to Slashdot , The Google Chrome developers have already developed a " fix " for BEAST that is in the latest version of Chrome and which will likely propagate to everyone using Chrome soon . I presume other browser manufacturers will follow suit soon . <p> That is one possible , though drastic , solution . Securing entire sites would put quite a strain on servers as the overhead of encryption does take quite a toll when lots of people are using a site . <p> This blog is not currently secure , by default . However , you can always browse LuxScis public pages securely by changing the URL from http : // to https : // of course any real solution would no depend on any manual action of the end user . Are you endangering your account probably not unless there is someone who has started using this attack already and is in your local network . <p> Well have to see what direction the net goes in . Currently the major browser vendors are working to fix this issue ( which wo n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , and 8 ) as with most security issues , people who stick with old software leave themselves vulnerable . LuxSci is looking at supporting TLS 1.1 however , even if we do that right away , it wont really help the common man much until support for that is standard and enabled across major browsers . <p> Vulnerability in SSL/TLS Could Allow Information Disclosure Published : Monday , September 26 , 2011 Version : 1.0 General Information Executive Summary Microsoft is aware of detailed information that has been published describing a new method to exploit a vulnerability in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 , affecting the Windows operating system . This vulnerability affects the protocol itself and is not specific to the Windows operating system . This is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows the decryption of encrypted SSL/TLS traffic . This vulnerability primarily impacts HTTPS traffic , since the browser is the primary attack vector , and all web traffic served via HTTPS or mixed content HTTP/HTTPS is affected . We are not aware of a way to exploit this vulnerability in other protocols or components and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reported vulnerability at this time . Considering the attack scenario , this vulnerability is not considered high risk to customers . We are actively working with partners in our Microsoft Active Protections Program ( MAPP ) to provide information that they can use to provide broader protections to customers . Upon completion of this investigation , Microsoft will take the appropriate action to help protect our customers . This may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-cycle security update , depending on customer needs . <p> browsers ( IE , Chrome , Safari , Opera ) have implemented an effective workaround , and because of the way the attack works its pretty hard to implement outside of a browser ( so apt and yum are still pretty much 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

It assumes optimal sending conditions : very small ( 1 KB ) messages , through a very fast network connection , all to the same recipient domain , where there is no blacklisting or greylisting , where SMTP Pipelining is used without SSL , and where the recommended number of concurrent SMTP connections is employed . <p> Spotlight Mailer Maximum Rate <p> The " maximum sending rate " ( msgs/hr ) for Spotlight Mailer is a theoretical maximum rate that messages can be sent from Spotlight Mailer under the same optimal sending conditions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same recipient domain , where there is no blacklisting or greylisting , and where SSL is not used . Spotlight mailer is has an extremely fast connection to the SMTP server , uses SMTP Pipelining , and uses 4 concurrent connections . <p> Actual throughput with Spotlight Mailer will be less based on the other factors which affect sending rate : SSL , Message size , Recipient server and DNS performance , blacklisting and greylisting , and any additional processing being performed ( e.g. anonymization or encryption ) . <p> Expected Rate <p> Under realistic sending conditions , you may find your sending rate to be closer to the listed " Expected " rates , assuming that you also use SMTP Pipelining , 1 recipient per message , no SSL , have moderately small messages , use a good email sending program , and use the recommended number of concurrent SMTP connections . <p> Expected Daily Rate <p> This is an estimate of the number of messages that you could send in 24 hours of sustained sending at approximately the " Expected " hourly rate . <h> Sustained vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending is very important . There are two significant modes of sending : <p> Sustained Rate <p> Sending at a consistent rate for a long period of time . E.g. 20,000 messages/hour for minutes or hours . Sustained rates are relevant when sending an email marketing blast to a large subscriber list . <p> Burst Rate <p> A " burst " refers to sending a bunch of messages in a very short time ; e.g. 25 or 50 messages within a second or two . Burst differs from " sustained " in that when you are not " bursting " you are sending one or a few messages here and there ... infrequent sending . Bursting is relevant for transactional email messages when you are sending them " as needed " but require the ability to send many at once should that need arise , as it will . <p> Sending speed is important for customers who need to send large mailings at a sustained rate . Understanding sending speed helps you determine how long it will take to send that blast to 100,000 subscribers . <h> Factors Affecting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of messages/hour that any server can manage . How fast you can actually send is affected by a number of factors . <p> 1 . Shared vs Dedicated <p> Dedicated servers will generally be faster . On shared servers , you must share the server sending capacity with others and thus you do not have control over the capacity available to you at any particular time . <p> Use an email marketing program ( like LuxSci Spotlight Mailer ) that supports SMTP Pipelining . With this feature , the program opens a single authenticated connection to the server and sends multiple messages in succession over that connection . This is significantly faster than opening a new connection and logging in again for every single message to be sent . <p> SSL is extremely useful for security and for the protection of your username , passwords , and message content . However , when using SSL , your email marketing program and your server must perform work encrypting and decrypting all of your messages . This overhead will slow down your rate of sending . <p> LuxSci Spotlight Mailer does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers behind LuxSci 's firewalls . SSL is not needed in this case . <p> 6 . Concurrent Connections <p> If your program can open 2 connections to our SMTP servers at the same time and send two messages at once , then your sending rate can generally be twice as fast . Depending on how powerful your server is and how slow your network connections are , you can use more and more concurrent connections to achieve higher and higher sending rates . Combined with SMTP Pipelining , an appropriate number of concurrent connections goes a long way to maximizing your throughput potential . <p> The recommended number of concurrent connections for best results in sustained sending are given for each server type on the Pricing page . <p> Note , however , that if you use more concurrent connections that is recommended , then you are likely just over-working your server . That results in your sending rates actually getting slower . Stick to the recommended number of concurrent connections . <p> LuxSci Spotlight Mailer uses 4 concurrent connections for all customers - dedicated or shared . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down each Spotlight Mailer connection , this behaves effectively like 8 concurrent connections . <p> 7 . Network Speed <p> Your messages must be transmitted from your email marketing program to our servers . The speed of your network and the distance between your sending computer and our servers can significantly impact the maximum rate that you can send messages . <p> For example , LuxSci Spotlight Mailer sends from a server right next to your outbound email servers and thus network speed is not a factor . For someone connecting from outside of LuxSci or internationally , the speed can slow down significantly . <p> 8 . Message Size <p> Like network speed , the larger your messages are , the more time it will take to transmit them from your email marketing program to our servers . For example , on a fast network , increasing message size from 1KB to 1MB decreased throughput by 50% . The actual impact of size on you will depend greatly on your network speed and other factors . <p> 9 . Recipient Email Server and DNS Speed <p> In order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to ( a ) look up where to deliver the messages to ( DNS ) , and ( b ) talk to those servers to deliver the messages to them . If the DNS lookup as slow or the recipients are in domains that no longer exist , this step can be slow . If the recipient email serves are overloaded , have a slow network , or are having other issues , then the delivery phase can be slow . Delivering many messages to recipients with these issues will slow down your entire sending process ... as other messages have to wait for these to be sent . <p> You can get around this recipient slowness issue by using our " Anonymous SMTP " ports ( 587 , 6025 , and 6465 ) . In this case your messages are immediately queued on our servers and delivered " later " . This does not speed up the actual time to when the recipients get the messages ( it will in fact slow that down ) ; however , it will speed up the rate that your email marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blacklisting and Greylisting <p> If your email content or sending patterns have gotten your server blacklisted or greylisted , then delivering email messages to recipient servers that are now blocking you or deferring you can slow down your delivery rates . <p> 11 . Recipients per message <p> Most email marketing programs send a separate message to each recipient . This allows them to track opens , views , etc . However , if you send each message to many recipients ( e.g. 100s of recipients ) , then your sending program has significantly fewer messages to deliver to our servers and this process can happen 10s or 100s of times faster than if you sent in the usual one recipient/message pattern . <p> Additionally , if each message contains only recipients in a specific domain , then actual delivery to these recipients will be expedited by this efficiency . E.g. If you are sending to 500 AOL users , instead of sending 500 individual messages , send one message with all 500 AOL users listed as " BCC " recipients . Delivery will be almost 500 times faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using SMTP Anonymization , or if you are using email processing features that come with Premium High Volume ( e.g. content scanning , recipient restrictions , SecureLine email encryption , etc. ) then the messages will be queued and processed and then sent on to their recipients as appropriate . These steps will slow down message delivery . <h> eBook HIPAA-compliant Bulk Emailing Basics <h> A technical guide to bulk emailing 5314 @qwx205314 5324 @qwx205324 5323 @qwx205323 5318 @qwx205318 5319 @qwx205319 5322 @qwx205322 
@@22227542 @2227542/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> You need to send millions of messages to your large opt-in mailing list over the upcoming holiday season . - You need these messages to go out pretty quickly and to not get blocked by your recipient ISPs so that the maximum number of your ( potential ) customers get your marketing messages and thus you can maximize your conversion rates on these messages . <p> This is a common scenario that we see , often from customers who have been using another provider that is excessively expensive , where delivery is sluggish , and/or where their messages are getting blacklisted or grey listed by their recipients systems . <p> Here we will share with you our standard prescription for solving this delivery dilemma once and for all . - There are multiple important factors involved , each of which will contribute to your success . <h> 1 . Use a Dedicated Server <p> When sending out hundreds or thousands to millions of messages in a month , you really want to be using one ( or more ) dedicated servers . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other customers will be sharing these resources with you . <p> The server will have a dedicated IP address that is all yours . <p> Both of these are exceptionally important : <p> No sharing of capacity : <p> By not sharing the server with other customers , you are assured that the entire power of your server is always at your disposal so that your messages can be sent as fast as possible . - In a " shared " system , your actual sending speed can be degraded by the usage of other customers . <p> Dedicated IP <p> The IP address of your server is the address that ISPs see all your email as originating from . - The reputation of this IP address ( e.g. how much " spam " is seen coming from it ) plays a critical role in determining the deliverability of your messages . - By having a dedicated IP address , your servers reputation and delivery power are a function only of your own sent marketing messages . <p> Contrast to a shared environment where a bad apple customer sharing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that address reputation causing your email to be delayed or denied as a result at least until the issue is detected and remediated. - A dedicated IP insulates you from that and dedicated IPs these days really only come via dedicated servers . <h> 2 . Use SPF and DKIM <p> When your recipients mail servers are evaluating your email marketing messages to determine how " spamlike " they are and if they should be let through to their INBOXes or not , many factors are considered . - The first is the reputation of your sending servers IP address ( discussed above ) . - They also look at the content of your message and the words you use to see how much those look like other known spam messages . - You can use tools like those built into Spotlight Mailer to discover these spammy words and revise your message to sound more " respectable " . <p> However , a vast majority of spam on the Internet comes through using forged email addresses as the senders. - As a result , ISPs highly value any way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forged . - If you provide " signatures " in your messages to prove that they are not forged and that they are coming from the authorized servers for messages from your domain , that greatly enhances the legitimacy of your email and thus the deliverability of those messages to your customers INBOXes . <p> A single server can only process so many concurrent connections from you , can only process so many messages at once , has only so much network throughput , and thus will limit how many messages you can get out per second . - You can mitigate this either by ( a ) getting a more powerful server , or ( b ) by using multiple servers . <p> While using a larger server is simpler and works in many situations , use of multiple servers is often recommended for customers with very large sending volumes . - In terms of speed and volume , multiple servers give you more network throughput and disk I/O throughput that you would usually get simply by beefing up a single server and it often comes with a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less expensive that a single server that is 2x as powerful ) . <p> With a multiple-server scenario , you can also scale up and down your capacity as needed by adding and removing servers from your system . - E.g. add more near the holiday rush , and dial back for the rest of the year . - It is usually more difficult to upgrade / downgrade a single system and that also , when possible , usually involves downtime and may change the IP address on which you have carefully built up a great reputation . <h> 4 . Use Multiple Servers for Failover and Reputation <p> There are , however , several additional reasons why multiple servers is preferable to a single powerful server . <p> Failure . - <p> If you have multiple servers and one fails , you can still deliver your timely marketing messages through the others while the failed one is repaired . - <p> Reputation . <p> The more email that comes to an ISP ( like yahoo ) from a single IP address , the more suspect that email can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger number of complaints against your mailings as the number of messages coming from your IP goes up . - Finally , some IPs ( like yahoo ) will throttle messages from your IP when the quantity being delivered reaches some threshold . <p> By splitting your marketing over multiple servers and thus multiple dedicated IPs , you proportionally decrease the amount of email coming from each IP and thus enhancing the reputation and deliverability of email from all of your IPs . You also increase the maximum rate of delivery of messages to ISPs like yahoo that rate limit email delivery ( because your email is not coming from just one location ) . <h> 5 . As in Sports , its important to " Warm Up " <p> If you start a running race without being warmed up , you are likely to hurt yourself and lose . - Its similar with email marketing . <p> If you get a shiny new dedicated server ( or fleet of them ) and then start jamming out email marketing messages as fast as you can , you are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly suffer . - Imagine the scenario from the point of view of your recipients ISPs ( e.g. AOL or gmail or yahoo ) . - They have gotten little or no email from your new IP address in recent history and all of a sudden they are inundated with email . - Chances are , they will think , that machine has been taken over to send spam . the spammer hoping to get out as many messages as possible before being caught . <p> Of course , that is not you you just want to tell your subscribers about your latest deals before they expire . <p> So , what you need to do is " warm up " your IP address(es) . Like stretching , its easy but takes a little time and is well worth it : <p> Ramp up . Over the coarse of a few weeks , gradually increase the volume of email coming from your servers from an initial modest amount ( e.g. 1000s a day ) to close to target amounts ( 10s of thousands or more per day ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . - If your messages are consistent and not very spam like , it will help build your IP reputation . <p> By ramping up like this , you will not catch the IPs " off guard " , they will accept your initial modest email blasts just fine . - They will allow the messages through and then see that people are not really complaining about your email ( e.g. not marking it as spam ) . - As those initial sends go well , they will allow your larger and larger sends as well as the reputation of your IP address builds from " unknown " or " solid " . <p> What about a " pre-warmed IP ? " <p> A pre-warmed IP is when an email marketing provider gives you an IP that " already has a good reputation " so you can " just get going " . <p> How is an IP pre-warmed ? - It is done when some other company uses it for sending their email . If that company does a good job and builds a good reputation and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then you are lucky enough to be assigned that IP maybe you can just start without " warming up " . - Maybe . <p> But even in this scenario , you must be wary : <p> How good is the reputation of that IP ? <p> What were they sending on it ? - If it is really different from what you are sending , will that affect how " warm " it appears to be with respect to my messages ? <p> Even if the reputation was good , what volume were they sending so what volume can I send to not surprise the ISPs ? <p> As you generally will not know the answer to any of these questions , especially #2 , it is always best to " start slow " and warm up the IP yourself , even if it was " pre-warmed " . - This can only be to your benefit ... like stretching .

It should never be used in any context where HIPAA compliance is required . However , Google Apps ( now called G Suite ) can be HIPAA compliant if you sign a HIPAA Business Associate agreement with Google ( see how ) . However , Google does not actually include email encryption with G Suite ; they do not even sell email encryption . <p> If you want to stick with G Suite and not migrate to an email provider that specializes in HIPAA-compliant email , the only solution is to purchase outbound HIPAA-compliant email encryption through a specialized third-party , such as LuxSci , and configure G Suite such that all of your outbound email messages are relayed through LuxSci for encryption before being sent off to their recipients . <p> To use LuxSci or smart host encryption of your your G Suite outbound email , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have set up in G Suite and for the same number of users that you have in G Suite <p> Setup your LuxSci account so that all of your users and domains are created . There needs to be a one-to-one relationship between users in LuxSci and users in G Suite , for tracking , auditing , and authentication purposes . <h> How Does HIPAA Apply to Email ? <p> While you may be accustomed to Google 's email services , using them and staying HIPAA-compliant is not that simple . <p> HIPAA regulations are purposely vague to give businesses flexibility in how they protect patient information . This allows them to use the technology and processes that suit their unique situations . <p> This lack of clarity can make the regulations confusing , but it serves a purpose , because the appropriate protections for one company may be completely different to those of another . There are certain practices that may not be necessary for compliance , but they can make some aspects of the regulation easier to meet . <h> Encryption <p> HIPAA regulations state that PHI should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will vary depending on each company 's size , complexity , software , hardware , technical infrastructure , the risks that it faces and the costs of various security measures . <p> The Department of Health and Human Services states that when PHI is transmitted from one point to another it must be protected in a manner commensurate with the associated risk . Risk analyses should be undertaken , and communications should be encrypted where ever there is a significant risk of unauthorized access . <p> At the very least , emails containing PHI need to be encrypted once they leave the company firewall . While doing this can make some businesses compliant , it is far from the best approach . Many companies find it more beneficial to go beyond the bare-bones expectations of HIPAA and implement National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) compliant encryption instead . <p> NIST guidelines recommend using the TLS protocol to protect PHI and prevent unauthorized access . For complete end-to-end email encryption , S/MIME and OpenPGP enable both encryption and digital signatures , which can authenticate the contents and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial than just complying with the HIPAA minimums . If PHI is accessed in an unauthorized manner , you may be obliged to report it to the relevant parties . If the information is encrypted to NIST standards , it is generally not considered insecure PHI , meaning that it does not need to be reported or the consequences of a breach are significantly diminished . <h> Business Associate Agreement <p> HIPAA 's Privacy Rule includes provisions for how companies can work alongside other businesses . If ePHI will be involved in the collaboration between the two businesses , they must sign a business associate agreement ( BAA ) beforehand . <p> These agreements are contracts that stipulate the terms under which PHI can be processed by the other company , the business associate . They require the business associate to have adequate safeguards in place to protect the PHI , specify how the business associate may use the PHI , stipulate that they must not disclose the information , as well as placing several other conditions . <p> If you use an external email provider to send ePHI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be HIPAA compliant . This agreement will legally bind them to treat the PHI of your customers appropriately . <h> Gmail vs G Suite <p> When asking whether Gmail is HIPAA compliant , we need to be certain of which Google service we are talking about . Gmail is Google 's personal email option that many people have used at some stage of their lives . <p> It is not possible to make Gmail HIPAA compliant , because Google will not sign a BAA for Gmail users . Another issue is Google 's automated processing -- they essentially scan every email and use the data for marketing purposes -- which obviously goes against HIPAA requirements . <p> Google also offer G Suite , formerly known as Google Apps . It is a paid service which is targeted towards businesses rather than individuals . It is possible to be HIPAA-compliant with G Suite , but the process is n't particularly straight-forward or cheap . <p> The minimum monthly G Suite plan currently goes for $5 per user , but it is not automatically configured to be HIPAA-compliant . Once you sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly to meet the regulations . The BAA leaves most of the responsibility up to the users , and the necessary steps towards compliance can be confusing . <p> To make G Suite HIPAA-compliant , you need to make sure that all of your messages are encrypted during transit , and that those using non-compliant hosts can also send secure messages to you . Google does not provide any native email encryption solution . Everyone using G Suite for HIPAA-compliant email must purchase email encryption through a third party and configure G Suite to relay their outbound email through that encryption gateway provider . <p> These factors make G Suite a complicated and expensive option for HIPAA-compliant email . You may find that an email service that is tailored towards HIPAA-compliance is an easier and cheaper option . LuxSci 's Secure Email safeguards your ePHI and offers a number of extra security features . <h> Combining G Suite with Third Party Smart Hosting <p> While it can be inconvenient and expensive to become HIPAA-compliant with G Suite , some users may be too accustomed to the interface to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google email client and also makes it easier to meet the regulations is to use LuxSci 's Smarthost service . This allows you to route your G Suite email through our email servers . <p> Using LuxSci 's Smart Hosting gives you outbound email encryption and other email processing and content scanning features , and a potentially better IP reputation .

Not subscribing also allows you to drag and drop messages into them at any time without impacting Thunderbirds apparent speed . <p> Under " Copies and Folders " , it is a good idea to configure your " Sent " , " Drafts " , and " Templates " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - You can only do this once your IMAP- account is completely set up and Thunderbird has found your folders on the server. - The advantage of keeping these folders on the server is that ( a ) they are available from any IMAP-connected computer , ( b ) they are available in WebMail , and ( c ) everything in these folders will be visible and " in sync " between all the programs you use to access your email. - Be sure to select the folder names for these that match those used by your WebMail provider and any other email programs also using IMAP with your account i.e. there is no universal name for the " Sent Email " folder. - A- particularly useful feature of Thunderbird is that it allows you to choose to which folder your sent messages should be placed , so that you can utilize the same one that WebMail or your other programs use . <p> Unless you really want to use Thunderbirds Junk email filtering , we recommend disabling all " adaptive Junk mail controls " under the " Junk Settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will slow down Thunderbird as it will be required to download the full content of all messages in your folders in order to scan them and determine if they are Junk or not and this will happen all the time. - We notice a dramatic speed improvement when the Junk mail controls are disabled . <h> Local Folders Settings <p> You can edit the location where Thunderbird saves the email stored in your " Local Folders " . - Be sure to put this in a location that is being backed up ! - You could even put it on a TrueCrypt encrypted partition or a thumb drive . <p> You will want to disable " adaptive junk mail " controls on the local folders as well ( unless you are downloading and saving POP email there and like Thunderbirds filters ) . <h> Thunderbird Options <p> Thunderbirds " Options " dialog box offers many very useful settings that can be tweaked to optimize your experience . <p> Tags : Under the " Display " tab , you can edit your " Tags " . - These are " IMAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color code your email messages. - Use of tags and color coding is a significant feature of Thunderbird , one that is not found on many other clients ( like Outlook ) . - This feature really enhances your productivity when using email . We recommend deleting the default tags ( for technical reasons ) and creating any new tags that you want to use , defining their colors here as well. - You can also do this in the message list itself. - If you use tags , you will want to show the " Tag " column in the email message list as well . <p> Formatted Email : If you like to send email formatted as HTML ( Rich Text ) and everyone you know can view such formatted messages because most people can today , then under the " Send Options " of the " Composition / General " tab , choose " Send the message in HTML- anyway " as option of what to do if Thunderbird does n't  know if the recipient can read HTML- messages. - This essentially makes Thunderbird stop asking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or both ? ) when sending formatted messages. - What if some recipient can not view HTML-encoded messages ? - Add him/her to the text-only list in the same options page . <p> Master Passwords : We highly recommend enabling the " Use a master password to encrypt stored passwords " option in Thunderbird under the " Privacy / Passwords " tab. - If you have Thunderbird save the passwords to your IMAP- and SMTP account(s) so that you can login quickly , then anyone sitting down at your computer can open Thunderbird and read your email and send email as you. - With this option enabled , anyone opening Thunderbird will need a special password to cause email to be downloaded or sent. - Additionally , the passwords themselves will be encrypted on disk so that someone else using the same computer can not " discover " them ( even if they have administrative access to your machine ) . - On a related note , the Mozilla FireFox web browser also has the same feature for securely saving the passwords that you use on web sites. - For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thunderbird . <p> Automatic Updates : Under the " Advanced / Update " tab be sure that Thunderbird is configured to automatically check for updates. - This will protect you in the case that problems with Thunderbird are discovered and fixed . <h> Some Recommended Add-Ons ? <p> One of the characteristics of Thunderbird that makes it such a great client is the " add-on " infrastructure , where you can install any one of hundreds of extensions that have been created to add interesting and useful features to Thunderbird. - You can browse the ad-ons here. - Some of the ones we have found that might be particularly useful include : <p> QuickFolders View your favorite folders as tabs so you can switch between them and drag messages to them easily <p> At LuxSci , we do not use any of these universally and do not support them , but have found them useful for various purposes. - To install an add-on , click " Tools &gt; Add-ons " from the Thunderbird menu . Then click on the " Install " button and choose an add-on file that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any others that you have downloaded ) . <h> Other Tips and Tricks <p> Here are some other tips and tricks that you may find useful : <p> Columns : You can change what columns are displayed in your email list by clicking on the little icon to the right of the headings list. - Use this to remove the columns you do n't  care about and to add ones that perhaps you do ( like " Tag " ) <p> Arrangement : You can re-arrange the order of the columns and their sizes by dragging and dropping the columns and the dividers between them . <p> Recycling Email : If you want to re-send an email message , select it and use the " Message &gt;- Edit as New Message " command. - This essentially allows you to treat any messages in any folder like a saved draft . <p> Saved Searches : - You can save your searches as virtual folders so that you can access simplified views of your email folders more quickly in the future . <p> Folder Management : Do not create subfolders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMAP- Folder Path " as Thunderbird will not save these subfolders in the correct place ( it will save them under " folder path/INBOX/subfolder " . <p> If your email provider supports folders that can contain folders , we recommend using nested folders to better organize your email. - This will be cleaner and easier to deal with than having all folders " at the top level " . <p> Signatures : To use an email signature that is formatted in HTML ( rather than being treated as plain text ) , save the HTML- signature content to a file that ends in " . html " . - Then , specify this file as your signature. - Thunderbird determines the content type of the signature based on the file extension . <p> Compact Speed Up : If you " mark your messages as deleted " and then " compact " your folders , as is one common way of managing email , we recommend that you compact by right clicking on the folder to be compacted and choose " Compact " from the pop-up menu. - This will compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose " Compact Folders " from the " File " menu , Thunderbird will try to compact ALL of your folders this can be very slow and can impact Thunderbirds apparent performance . <p> Size Matters : Keep the size of your INBOX- and other frequently viewed folders ( especially any subscribed folders ) small. - This will improve performance overall. - Thunderbird can easily handle very large folders , but small folders are quicker and easier for any email program and for the server as well . <p> Forced use of 256-bit AES- with SSL/TLS : - If you are very security conscious or have a requirement for using only 256-bit AES- encryption when connecting to your email , you can configure Thunderbird so that this is the only encryption mode that it will use. - See : " 256-bit AES Encryption for SSL and TLS : Maximal Security " . <p> We hope that you found our tips and tricks and configuration ideas useful. - Well update this post and publish more ideas in the future .

Do not store the password to the PGP or S/MIME key in your web site anywhere force your web site visitor to enter the password and use cookies to preserve that password from page to page . - This separation of the password from your encrypted data and keys ensures security in the event that your data is compromised . <p> Ensure that any ePHI-containing files are owned and accessible only by your user and are stored outside of your web sites document root ( e.g. so there can be no web link to access them directly ) . <p> This ensures they are not accessible via a web link <p> Proper ownership and restricted permissions further restrict access to the files so just your own account . <p> If you store ePHI in a MySQL database , once again ensure that the password to that database is not stored in your site required the web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the data . - Better yet , encrypt the data using PGP or S/MIME before saving it in the database . <p> What about CMS web sites , like WordPress , that require you to put the database credentials in a plain text file in the web site ? - This is risky and we recommend that customers with these kinds of sites use dedicated servers or using the " Trick " discussed below . <p> Use a MySQL database to log all accesses to any ePHI an audit trail of access is important for HIPAA . <p> Ensure that ePHI is only accessed by individuals who are " logged in " to your site somehow so that you know who they are , they have verified their identity with a password , and so you can track their activity . <p> A trick for maintaining separate user passwords all of which grant access to the same encrypted files , without leaving the password to decrypt those files in your site . <p> This method adds a little complexity to your site design , but increases security and adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ password CP that will be used for encrypting all content ( or which will be used for accessing a database ) <p> For each user of your site , encrypt the CP and save it in a small file . Use that users own web site access password as the password to decrypt their own version of the encrypted CP . <p> Then , when a user logs in to your site successfully , you can use the users submitted password to decrypt the CP. - Then you will have the password that can be used to unlock any of the ePHI files or connect to the database that that user needs . <p> Clearly , this trick can be expanded to give selected access to specific files to specific users and can be extended via cookies , hashes , and other techniques to provide session-length- persistence- of the decryption information needed . <p> If this all sounds " greek " to you , it is very technical . - Running any web site with ePHI and HIPAA requirements will require significant technical skill to implement all of the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , but very bad security blunders . <p> You should seek a developer well versed in these areas to implement your web site . - We recommend against using someone who is learning security as they go along or who has not developed similar sites before that is a recipe for future trouble .

E.g. a web designer could update the front page of the site one day and paste in some ePHI right there for everyone to see . - No one can stop that except for the web designer and your company procedures . <p> So , it is up to the customer to implement their web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our HIPAA- Account Restrictions Agreement . - What LuxSci does do , which is all anyone can do who also gives you the freedom to install your own custom site , is to provide a HIPAA-compliant environment for you to operate in : <p> Providing a Business Associate Agreement <p> Ensuring the servers are secured <p> Ensuring that backups are made and restores can be had and that the backups are HIPAA compliant <p> Ensuring that the tools are available for your to implement security : E.g. SSL , PHP , Databases , Password protection , etc . <p> We bring the environment , you make the site and ensure it is done in a compliant way . - If you are unsure how to implement HIPAA-compliance- in your web site yourself , please find someone who does or find some other way to achieve your goals . - There is no magic switch that anyone can pull to make a web site always compliant ; well , except for turning off the site

This amount is a function of the size of the server ( e.g. a Performance x2 has 30GB of space available ) and can be expanded by purchasing additional disk blocks .

These modifications are first vetted to ensure that they do not hurt your server 's security level . <p> LuxSci provides custom Web site and database management tools ( not cpanel ) for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can edit your iptables firewall and view current and historical reports on CPU , RAM , and Disk usage <p> Enterprise-class servers have their data stored on a private SAN where all disk partitions are always encrypted . Business-class servers can not have their main operating system disk encrypted ; however , if you purchase additional disks and request it , these additional disks can be encrypted and all of your data can be stored on them . See : Enterprise vs Business Class . <h> Dedicated , managed Linux Web hosting <p> Unfortunately , unsecured web servers are intriguing and accessible to determined hackers . So when it comes to managing the large amounts of traffic your site receives , you must make security a top priority . LuxSci 's dedicated web site hosting ensures the protection of your online presence with maximized security and capacity . A dedicated server provides space and resources just for you , as opposed to the watering hole of a traditional shared server . <p> In addition to increased privacy , dedicated web site hosting also offers increased security . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're much less likely to experience collateral damage . Increased reliability arises from the fact that you do n't have to share memory , CPU , network , disk space , or other resources . And , dedicated servers are best for accounts that need hundreds or thousands of users or gigabytes of storage . Does this sound like the type of infrastructure that 's right for your business ? <h> HIPAA-compliant databases <p> Does the nature of your business call for HIPAA compliance ? LuxSci 's dedicated Web hosting servers provide a HIPAA compliant web infrastructure where you can host HIPAA websites . The isolated nature of the dedicated server provides enhanced security and flexibility from hackers . You can use SSL to ensure a secure connection between your website and its visitors . We also offer auditing reports for your web sites and your access to our system . With highly secure firewalls and our Intrusion Protection System , you can rest assured that if there is an issue on your server , we will be alerted . <p> LuxSci 's dedicated HIPAA compliant Web hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web . You have the ability to host and share information on a secure and isolated platform . Be sure to check out our dedicated server package and to look into our helpful HIPAA compliant information to make sure you 're always protected . <h> Your Role in HIPAA Compliance <p> However , as with any HIPAA Web hosting solution where you have the ability to design your web site and upload your own scripts and programs , LuxSci provides a compliant environment and you are responsible for ensuring that the web site itself is designed and implemented in a secure and compliant fashion . E.g. this includes things like use of SSL when appropriate , access auditing and unique identity verification , proper encryption of at-rest PHI , etc . For further information on this , please read : <h> Learn more about TLS in general : <p> As no one uses " SSL v2 " or " SSL v3 " anymore , certificates for securing Internet traffic are all for the " TLS " protocol and so are properly called " TLS certificates , " though the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same general concept . <h> Bringing your own certificate <p> If you would like to purchase your own certificate ( or generate your own self signed one ) : <p> LuxSci will ask you some questions and generate a certificate signing request ( CSR ) for you <p> You will order your certificate from a third party yourself . <p> You will provide us with the resulting signed certificate file and all " intermediate " certificates that may be needed . <p> You are responsible for ensuring that your certificate does not expire from year to year . You must take the initiative to renew your certificate and get us new signed certificates as needed well before your certificate expires . <h> How Many Certificates Do I Need ? <p> You may need multiple TLS certificates , depending on the number of separate domain names that you wish to secure . <h> Web Site Hosting <p> You will need one TLS certificate for each secure web site that you wish to have hosted . This certificate will be for either " domain.com , " " www.domain.com , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Labeling of WebMail <p> If you have Private Labeled WebMail and wish to brand the domain name shown in the browser for TLS connections , then you will need a TLS certificate for that " secure private labeled domain name " . <p> Note that you can use the SAME " secure private labeled domain name " for : <p> Branding of SecureForm can be enabled and then will be automatic with https : //secure.domain.com <p> Branding of SecureLine Escrow is also automatic with https : //secure.domain.com <p> However , if you are using one domain for your web site , you can not also use that same domain for Private Labeling . People generally use a subdomain for Private Labeling ; i.e. , secure.domain.com . <h> Private Labeling of Email <p> If you have Private Labeling and a dedicated email server and wish to have your users use your secure domain for access to secure POP , IMAP , and/or SMTP services , then you will need to pick another domain name , such as " secure-mail.domain.com , " for this and obtain another TLS certificate for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email services is not available to customers using shared email hosting servers . <h> Dedicated Server Customers <p> Dedicated server customers may have their email and web hosting services on the same server .

Having your data stored in a centralized , online location makes it easy to keep track of your files on-the-go from a computer , tablet , or smartphone while minimizing the amount of local disk space required . Of course , that also means that the data itself is no longer physically under your control . <p> Note that were referring here to the current mainstream use of the word " cloud " . For a discussion on what constitutes " cloud computing " , see our previousblog posts . <p> As a rough analogy , cloud storage is a little like putting money in the bank . The bank tells you your money is there , and they may even let you access your account online to check on it , but the money is n't physically in your hands . By trusting the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculated risk that the benefits and convenience of doing so far outweigh the few and unlikely drawbacks . <h> But what if the unlikely happens ? <p> What if someone pretending to be you goes to the bank and tries to withdraw from your account ? Or worse , what happens if the bank computers contract a virus that erases all trace of your funds ? <p> Obviously , these are extreme cases . Banks in particular have stringent security procedures in place to make sure that the person accessing your account is actually authorized to do so . Financial account information is backed up multiple times and in several locations to prevent tampering or data loss . But as unlikely as these scenarios are , they 're not impossible even at the bank , and when speaking of cloud services , issues like this are far more likely . <p> The world knows that the new iPhone 5 has finally arrived , and with it the latest update to Apples iOS operating system iOS6 . The new OS continues to emphasize Apples strong push for their iCloud service ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up . A big selling point is that your iCloud.com email will remain stored in the cloud and then synchronize wirelessly across your iPhone , iPad , and Mac Book . But unlike the more familiar IMAP account , iCloud accounts offer the ability to remote wipe data in the case where one of your synchronized devices is lost or stolen . This can be very useful , but also extremely dangerous if your account is compromised . ( By contrast , LuxScis MobileSync Remote Wipe can clear your devices if they are lost or stolen , but can not clear the centrally stored email , contact , calendar , and task data itself it ca n't be used to delete all of your data ) . <p> There have been several recent cases of iCloud users falling prey to hackers using brute force or social engineering tricks to gain access to their account . One of the more high profile instances can be found here . The end result of this particular instance is that the victim lost a years worth of data including email , pictures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who broke into his iCloud account . <h> So should you avoid storing data in a cloud ? <p> Again , its a question of trust and calculated risk . You can certainly reduce that risk by using secure , smart passwords and taking advantage of two-factor login authentication whenever possible , but when your data is out of your hands , its never a guarantee . The best policy should be to get educated about what you 're using , fully understand the risks , and take the necessary precautions to protect your data in case the unlikely happens . Reliance on the cloud to take care of your data for you may be convenient , but it can come at a high cost . <p> Here are some important things to keep in mind before you decide to toss all your data into a cloud : <p> Does the cloud have a strict privacy policy ? Does it even offer a Service Level Agreement ( SLA ) ? See LuxScis Privacy Policy and SLA <p> For all too many cloud and outsourced providers , security and privacy are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a target they are as well This is why we have see so many issues in the past with Apple , Google , Yahoo , etc. - This is why , if email and other data is of any significant importance , its probably best to ditch free services , get your own domain name , and choose a specialized provider with a mission that matches your needs . - Having your own domain , further , allows you to change providers as needed without changing your- addresses- and other materials . - The worst thing would be to get stuck using some large free provider that you are no longer happy with just because you are using their domain name ( case in point all those old AOL.com accounts ) and cant change addresses because they are in use .

It is too easy to accidentally hit " send " on an email or text message , possibly releasing information that was not fully edited or thought through into the public . <p> Presidential Records Act of 1978 : Anything that is sent over email or instant message needs to be permanently recorded and in the public record as all of a Presidents correspondence must be made public 5 years after s/he leaves office. - Archival of all email sent to/from a Blackberry is certainly possible ; however , it does take an effort to ensure that everything that you send from your mobile device is suitable for the public and the consumption of the media . <p> Who Runs the Service ? The information set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encrypted in transit to and from the blackberry enterprise servers ( BES ) , the messages themselves would still be saved in an insecure and unencrypted form on the server and when they were sent out into the Internet at large. - Any IT- staff with administrative access to these servers could potentially access all of the Presidents mobile communications. - This likely makes yet another set of IT- posts that require " Secret " or " Top Secret " clearance . <p> Insecurities That Crop Up : Blackberry is a widely used phone and is thus , perhaps , easier to hack into than proprietary devices. - Also , there are likely to be more security vulnerabilities found with it and its required infrastructure than a proprietary device , simply due to its widespread use.The National Vulnerability Database shows 14 issues with Blackberries , including ways that attackers can install malware or crash the device. - While I am sure any Blackberry granted to Obama would be patched to fix these , there is a history and thus a potential for other issues in the future.As the incident where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Twitter administrators weak password has shown , you cant make assumptions about security. - Most respected companies fix security issues immediately as them come up and take steps to use best practices to ensure that they do not occur in the first place. - However , where the President of the United States is concerned , any kind of security issue for any amount of time is serious . <p> Instant Messaging : Instant messaging is not allowed in the White House , even though it is common in most government offices . Lawyers believe that , due to the Presidential Records Act and the use of ingrained use of instant messaging for relaxed gossip about issues and spin and for discussions of personal family matters , that instant messaging can not be allowed at all , as that would preserve discussions in the record that should be private . <p> Locking Down the BlackBerry : While you can lock down a Blackberry to use services securely with SSL ( secure enough for secret clearance ) , etc. , unless you have some special modifications to the Blackberry software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , some kinds of software modifications are automatically necessary by the Secret Service so that Obamas phone is always secure and that not he , nor anyone who gets possession of it for a few minutes , can modify any settings . <p> How real are these security issues ? - Probably not as bad as they seem. - The heads of the FBI , the head of the CIA , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are all going to have Blackberries ( although all with an added " super-encryption package " , says Marc Ambinder in his blog ) . - The standard is always higher for the president. - However , I think that the issues involving Presidential Records are the most significant . <p> Connects directly and securely for voice and data to specialized White House servers which also archive all communications . <p> Likely that all communications with White House officials are routed internally over special hardened communications channels . <p> It is likely that this phone supports PGP , S/MIME and/or other end-to-end encryption techniques so that the content can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the BES servers ! <p> So whose job it is to read all of Obamas email archives ? - You know someone at the NSA- is probably already doing that for national security reasons . <p> IT administrators : LuxSci FYI points out that although e-mails sent and received from Obama himself " can be encrypted in transit to and from the BlackBerry enterprise servers ( BES ) , the messages themselves would still be saved in an insecure and unencrypted form on the server and when they were sent out into the Internet at large . " The Secret Service would have to ensure that IT administrators working with Obamas account had proper security clearance . <p> This is the first time Ive seen anything that has reflected some of my long standing thoughts . Its time general public services take these possibilities more seriously too , instead of shirking there responsibilities or hiding and devastating deemed to be costly solutions and companies , because profiteering private companies are controlling the decisions .

This can be done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not send messages to people not using the same PGP or S/MIME system and can not send to recipients using Escrow. - This kind of short unencrypted processing step is common to server-side encryption technologies . <p> While " sent email " storage is clearly storage at rest , most people consider the short duration processing and caching to send and read a single message to be not exactly an " at rest " state as it is an ephemeral process . - Hence , peoples requirements about what needs to be encrypted when " at rest " vary greatly based on the regulations that they need to follow , their own security concerns and policies , the nature of the data , and the degree of trust in the services used . - E.g. unless your security requirements are very strict , the message being in an unencrypted state on the server when sent or opened is usually very acceptable and expected . <h> The down side of at-rest encrypted email <p> Its worth mentioning some of the down sides of having your email encrypted at rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open and read the messages than regular email . <p> You can permanently lose access to encrypted messages if your can not recover the password to your PGP or S/MIME certificate , or if you lose your Escrow notification message ( and are not using Message Center ) . <p> You may not be able to open the secure email messages from your email program or mobile device you may have to login to a web site to access it . <p> If multiple people are sharing an email folder which contains encrypted messages , then they need to share the decryption information and passwords . <h> At-rest encryption for WebAides <p> WebAides are LuxScis collaboration tools used to store contacts , calendar entries , tasks , files , blogs , passwords , and more . - The general data for these WebAides ( e.g. the schedule information in a calendar event ) is stored unencrypted in a secured database . <p> However , all WebAide attachments ( including all files in Documents WebAides ) are stored individually- encrypted at rest using 128-bit AES encryption . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decrypt it . <p> This provides double at rest encryption- ( encryption using PGP , and then further encryption of that PGP-encrypted data using AES ) for your sensitive data , extra access control by encrypting it for specific recipients only , and validation through digital signatures . - As all of the encryption and decryption is done through the LuxSci web interface and that interface can create PGP keys for your users and groups on demand , PGP encryption is very easy nothing to install or buy or setup , beyond requesting a PGP key and giving it a password . <p> Passwords : For password library storage and collaboration ( PGP encryption for passwords is required ) <h> SecureForm at-rest data storage <p> The SecureForm service at LuxSci enables your web and PDF forms to deliver posted data to you in a- versatile- and secure manner . - SecureForm allows you to receive your form data in many ways : email , FTP , MySQL , and WebAides Documents . - Some of these formats support at-rest data encryption : <p> Secure Email : SecureForm can send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and S/MIME all of which result in the data being encrypted at rest . - Avoid TLS-only secure delivery as that will not result in at rest encryption . <p> Documents WebAides : - Your form data and files will automatically be encrypted at rest , like all Documents WebAide attachments . - Additionally , you can choose to- have these files also double encrypted with PGP . <p> FTP : While SecureForm supports FTP and SFTP delivery of form data to your server , those files will not be individually encrypted on your server once it is delivered there . <h> At-rest encryption for- Widgets <p> LuxScis Widgets allow your to make custom dashboards with access to just the right arrangement of tools for your tasks . - Most of these widgets simply access and render other types of data ( e.g. email , WebAides , RSS feeds , etc. ) . - A few widgets store information for you directly as part of the Widget. - Of , these the " Notepad " widget can be used for saving arbitrary information . <p> LuxSci encrypts the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the database , using- native-MySQL AES encryption . <h> Web hosting and at-rest encryption ? <p> Customers that host web and/or FTP sites with LuxSci can have data stored encrypted at rest on these sites ; however , that encryption and decryption is the customers responsibility . - E.g. <p> Upload and download pre-encrypted files using some software on your computers to handle the- encryption- or decryption for you . <p> Create web site pages that automatically encrypt/decrypt files on the server or saved in your hosted databases using openssl , PGP , or some other technology . <p> For web hosting customers with strong web site security/privacy needs , LuxSci recommends use of dedicated servers . <h> What about full-disk encryption ? <p> LuxSci does use disk-level encryption for enterprise-class servers and business-class dedicated server customers who explicitly require it . - Customers often wonder why it is not pervasive and think that full disk encryption would solve the " data encrypted at rest " issue simply and easily . - This is really not the case . <p> Full disk encryption is great for hard drives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily be lost or stolen . - The full disk encryption makes it difficult for someone who gains physical access to that lost or stolen media to access the raw stored data . - That in turn mitigates compliance risk . <p> However , when translating this to an enterprise hosted environment , the situation breaks down . - Were not talking about an easily lost or stolen physical disk anymore . - A live LuxSci servers " hard drive " is some slice of space taken from a vast array of hard drives in a dedicated storage server where the drives are arranged in complex RAID arrangements . The scenarios where disk-level encryption benefits are : <p> Someone breaks into the data center , and through their security , arrives at our data storage arrays ( really big and heavy devices , screwed into many racks ) . - Takes these offline and either tries to plug into them directly there in the site , or tries to carry them away to access them privately all while preserving their- configuration- exactly as it was . <p> Someone at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such access . <p> The media that was previously used to store ePHI is not properly destroyed and falls into the hands of people who should not have access to the data on that media . <p> In reality , the risk of those vectors is very small due to the very strong level or security associated with our premium server environment , and due to the fact that we have a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement with our server vendor , so their staff are being trained , monitored , etc. , to ensure that this kind of thing never happens . <p> So why not do it anyway ? - We do . - Our Enterprise-class servers reside on a private storage area network ( i.e. one dedicated of LuxSci ) which is encrypted. - We also offer encryption of added data storage for customers with Business-class servers ( where the system drive itself can not use disk-level encryption ) . - - Full disk encryption has many downsides , including : <p> Full disk encryption adds another layer of complexity or failure and another thing that could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods be in place for booting or restarting servers so that they can regain access to the encrypted data . - This generally increases downtime associated with any maintenance or other issues or lessens the security of the encryption system in some ways . <p> While it does mitigate the unlikely event of the data storage array being compromised in our HIPAA business associates data center , this only protects against access to the raw disks and it comes with some tangible down sides . <p> Compared to inappropriate raw hardware access , it is very much more likely that any attack would come via customer mistake or by a live server being compromised in some way . - E.g. a customer uploads- inappropriate- files to his/her web site , a server is compromised due to a- vulnerability , - etc. - In each of these cases , the server is already on and any program or process on that server has full access to - the unencrypted data even where the disk is encrypted. - So , " encrypted disks " providing " at-rest encryption " do not protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers or against customer actions . <p> That said , at-rest encryption via encryption of individual files , messages , database entries , etc. does solve the problem as any access to the raw drives OR the live server still yields only these encrypted data items . - Hence , LuxSci focuses on strong per-item encryption rather than relying solely on hard drive encryption , which offers weak protection , by itself , in this context .

Add SPF <p> LuxSci Supports SPF for outbound email messages . - We have a standard SPF record that we provide to all customers . - If you have dedicated servers , we can assist you with defining custom specific SPF records that authorize only the particular servers from which you send email . <h> 2 . Add DKIM <p> LuxSci supports the signing of email messages using DKIM. - Use our DKIM Tool to create DKIM keys for your and obtain the DNS records that need to be added . - If LuxSci manages your DNS for you , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool . <p> Use strict DKIM rules if all of your email is being sent through LuxSci. <h> 3 . Add DMARC <p> Not many spam filters support DMARC yet , but for those that do , you can provide instructions on what do to if both SPF and DKIM fail . - Luxsci can assist you with making these records , or you can use the- DMARC Record Assistant- if you have a good idea of how DMARC works . <h> Protecting Your Inbound Email <h> 1 . Basic Spam Filtering <p> If you have LuxScis Basic Spam Filtering , then SPF and DKIM analysis are automatically enabled and the results contribute to the overall " Spam Score " of messages . - Basic Filtering does not yet include DMARC support . <h> 2 . Premium Email Filtering <p> Premium Email Filtering also already supports SPF and DKIM and will support DMARC in the future . - Premium Email Filtering has a number settings- recommended for identity protection that are not enabled by default : <p> Click Protect <p> This replaces all links in email messages with redirects through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for malicious pages and compared to phishing sites both when the message is filtered and later again when you click on it <p> You can control what happens based on the Riskiness of the link : - Allow click through , warn , deny , log , etc . <p> This is a very good way to protect end users against phishing and malware scams . <p> HTML Shield <p> Removes malicious JavaScript and other HTML components ( flash , iframes , etc ) from email messages to sanitize them and make them safer . <p> Allow lists with SPF validation <p> Add domains to your allow list so that any email from them goes through the filters without issue assuming that the message passes SPF as well . <p> Enforced TLS <p> Only accept email from specific domains when TLS is used . - This blocks spam and forged email being sent from servers and mailers that are not TLS-enabled . <p> Enforced SPF <p> Require SPF checks to pass for messages from specific domains . <p> Enforced DKIM <p> Require DKIM checks to pass for messages from specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down email from a set of domains so that you can much better ensure that the messages are not likely to be forged . <h> 3 . LuxSci WebMail and SecureChat <p> Using LuxSci SecureLine email encryption , you can use a secure web portal for message pickup and/or PGP or S/MIME for encryption and digital signatures . - These methods can ensure email identity . <p> SecureChat <p> Using LuxSci SecureChat for a full-encrypted and identity-verified closed communication system ensures compliance and identity in all communications over SecureChat , automatically . <p> Always display the email addresses of message senders and recipients instead of their names . <p> It is best to know the actual email address that the message is from , rather than just the purported sender name which can be completely arbitrary . - Enable this option to always see the email addresses . <p> Enable email message previews <p> LuxSci WebMail has a feature that will allow you to see a plain text preview of your message content ( 1-25 lines of text , your choice ) without even marking the message as read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get an infection from JavaScript , images , or any other objects in the messages ; Senders will not know that you read the preview even if they have advanced email marketing tracking codes built into the message . Preview content can not be dynamically affected by JavaScript or other technologies . <p> Previews give you a fast , clean , safe way to see what the message is about before you actually open it . <p> Viewing email messages <p> LuxScis WebMail removes script and style tags and many other objects from HTML-encoded messages before rendering them to you in the message display area . - This provides some degree of sanitization and protection . - If you open an HTML attachment " in a new window " , however , no sanitization is performed so that you can see that HTML " as is " . - So just be aware of the difference . <p> Also , while many kinds of tags are removed when you view an HTML message , it is still possible for foreign JavaScript to be active in the message display , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for viewing messages in any Web interface or email program . <p> Copy and paste links <p> If you are ever unsure about a link in an email message , the safest thing to do is to right click on the link and copy it and past it in to a text editor or MS word and see what the link is. - Then , if it looks legitimate , you can past it into a browser window or , even better , navigate - to that site normally without use of the link . <p> Note that in some cases , JavaScript can intercept your right-click action and cause an event to fire such as redirecting you to a malicious web page . - This is not very common but technically possible . <p> Convert to Plain Text <p> LuxSci WebMail allows you to make many different kinds of custom email filters which process messages server-side on delivery . - One useful option for such filters is to convert messages to " plain text " . - E.g. you could save a full copy of all email to 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your INBOX. - The plain text copy will be safe to view and interact with ( like the previews are ) . - IF you need the full message you can go and look at it any time you need . <p> Check DKIM <p> The custom email filters tool also allows you to design rules that affect messages that pass or fail DKIM so , for example , you could choose to discard ones that do not or to tag as " GOOD " messages that do pass . <p> Viewing source and headers <p> LuxSci WebMail makes it easy to view the full source and/or the full headers of any email message if you want to get your hands dirty with some snooping on the raw content of specific email messages .

( LuxSci calls this method " Escrow " ) . - Secure Message Pickup allows one to send a secure message to anyone . <p> Other methods , such as PGP and S/MIME , are also in wide use . - However , these require a lot more setup and collaboration between the sender and recipient . - The above two methods are most commonly used for sending messages to people that you have not otherwise communicated with . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when HIPAA compliance is involved ? <h> TLS vs Pick Up Compared <p> SMTP TLS <p> Secure Message Pick Up <p> Message Content Transmitted Securely to End User ? <p> - <p> - <p> Message Content Encrypted at Rest ? <p> - <p> End Users Identity Verified ? <p> - <p> Simple : Just like regular email ? <p> - <p> Extra work for the recipient ? <p> In both cases , the message is transported to the recipient securely . - In one case , it goes to the recipients email servers via TLS. - In the other , it goes to the recipient over SSL . <p> However , Secure Message Pick Up is more secure as the message contents are encrypted all the time ( at least until the recipient downloads and saves a copy ) and the pick up system can verify the recipients identity before allowing access to the message content . - With SMTP TLS , the message sits in the recipients INBOX unencrypted and accessible to anyone with access to that email folder . <p> SMTP TLS does have the advantage of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email . - They receive the message in their INBOXes and open them without ever needing to know or care that it was encrypted along the way ( they can check , if they want ) . - However , to many people , this extreme simplicity is itself a disadvantage . Lay people cant tell that the message was delivered securely and they may thus be worried about the privacy of the contents . <p> It is really true that SMTP TLS is less secure , as anyone with access to the recipients email folders ( e.g. their email service provider , their spouse , etc. ) can access the message content and those accesses are generally not even logged . <p> People often choose to use SMTP TLS when possible for its convenience ( recipients may be annoyed having to click on a link in order to get their message ) ; or , they choose Secure Message Pickup when added security features are desired . <h> What does HIPAA Say ? <p> HIPAA requires that ePHI be transmitted securely . - It does not require that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea ) . - HIPAA also requires access control and tracking when people in your organization access ePHI . <p> Technically , using only SMTP TLS is Ok ( barely ) under HIPAA when sending to recipients outside of your organization : <p> The message will be transmitted securely <p> Once the message is accepted by the recipients servers , further securing the message can be considered the recipients ( or their organizations ) responsibility . - Meaning : you do not technically have to be overly concerned about access control and logging beyond the fact that you sent the message to the correct address . <p> When sending ePHI- to someone in your organization , you do have to worry about the recipient . <p> Your organization must be using a HIPAA-compliant email service <p> You do have to worry about who can access that email and tracking of user logins and such . <p> TLS is still " OK " as long as your email service provider takes care of the rest . <h> To " TLS " or not to " TLS " <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email servers support it . - But is it " wise " ? - This is the subject of much debate . <p> There are those who use just SMTP TLS whenever they can because that is simplest for the recipient .

You will see these vary by 10s of dollars from one vendor to another . <p> The big cash cow is the transaction fee percentage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on each transaction . - The latter can be improved on in many cases , but not always . - The former is where most banks make gluts of money . <h> Why is the processing percentage rate so high ? <p> First you must understand the companies that are involved : <p> The consumer has a credit card from some credit card company , like Visa <p> The merchant has a contract with someone to process his credit card swipes or online transactions ( the credit card processor ) <p> The credit card company charges a fee , called the " interchange rate " to the merchant when there is a swipe or other transaction . - This is one of the ways that the credit card companies make money . - Second , the credit card processor has to also make money , so they also add one some more charges to the transaction . <p> The merchant ends up losing out on ( at least ) : <p> The interchange percentage that goes to the credit card issuing company ( VISA ) <p> Some additional percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed fee ( e.g. that $0.35 ) that also goes to the credit card processor <p> There is a reason that the total processing percentage rate is so high . - This is due in a large part to the fact that there are hundreds of different types of credit cards out there that consumers may be using . - American Express , Visa Rewards Program X , MasterCard Cash Back Program Y , etc . <p> The credit card processing company wants your contract to be simple , so they want to sell you a contract with a fixed processing rate ( or a few fixed rates one for VISA , one for MasterCard Debit , one for AmEx , etc . ) . <p> In reality , in each of these categories , there are 10s or 100s of different cards and interchange rates . - If your rate is fixed at 5% , then the credit card processing company makes a profit on that 5% minus the actual interchange rate . <p> So , my inflating the percentage that they charge to you so that they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money on most transactions . <p> This is what noone knows that the rates are generally inflated in this way . - Additionally , credit card processing companies are usually larger corporations with a lot of overhead and other programs , and the fees from processing cards funds the overhead and other projects . <p> Also , Visa and MasterCard update their interchange prices every 6 months . - As a result , credit card processing companies will increase your flat percentages on you over time to compensate . - So , your rate will creep up . <h> How to get the Processing Percentage Rate down ? <p> LuxSci could not do this ourselves , it is not our specialty. - What we did , however , is find a new credit card processing company called Credit Card Services ( CCS ) . They got our rate ( and all of their customers rates ) down via two powerful methods . <p> 1 . Interchange Plus Pricing <p> They have changed the pricing model for credit card processing . - Instead of giving the merchant a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merchant the actual " interchange " rate plus a fixed percentage , e.g. 0.30% . <p> So , instead of every transaction costing the merchant 5% , every transaction will - cost a different percentage that is a function of what card the customer used . - However , most or all of these percentages charged will be much less than the merchant was paying before . - So , the average percentage charged to the merchant will go down often significantly . <p> This is how LuxSci is saving so much money and how we will save even more as we continue to grow . <p> 2 . Small with Low Overhead <p> CCS is a small private company without any significant corporate overhead . - The structure is lean and the business model is to offer the same pricing to everyone that they would and could to family and friends . - With low overhead and no corporate shareholders demanding profit maximization , they can provide pricing that is beneficial to the customer and enable customer lockin. - This generates good will , many referrals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be trusted ? <p> LuxScis first questions when entering into discussions with CCS were : <p> How reliable is the service ? - We get a lot of money through credit cards and cant afford a single glitch ! <p> Can the service scale ? <p> How much work will it be to switch ? <p> Obviously , if it was a lot of work , required us to change the way we do things , or maybe might fail it would not be worth the risk and the time for any kind of savings . - You do n't  skimp when it comes to accounts receivable ! <p> It turns out that all the answers were really , surprisingly good . <p> Credit cards are processed through FirstData , one of the biggest credit card processing platforms in the world . - CCS is a partner/reseller of FirstData that has the power to sit its own prices and support its own customers . - LuxSci was actually already using FirstData before we switched to CCS , through some other reseller Citicorp. - Most credit card processing companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FirstData , so this is apparently- completely- normal . - CCS gets to be a small company with big company reliability . <p> Yup since it all goes through FirstData , we could have as many credit card transactions as Starbucks , no problem . <p> Since LuxSci takes all credit cards online , all we had to do was call up our Credit Card gateway , Authorize.net , and ask them to change 2 numbers in their system and we were done ( its easy to begin with and CCS is a partner of Authorize.net , making things even simpler ) . - No software or configuration changes anywhere on our side . <p> For merchants that have point of sale equipment , they do have to " reprogram " these by entering new codes ; however , this is generally pretty easy . - I have heard that CCS can even do this in bulk for larger organizations , so they do n't  have to do it themselves . <h> So , How is it Going ? <p> LuxSci has been using CCS now for about 5 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have also noticed that : <p> Our statements are clearer and simpler <p> Money gets flushed into our bank account more quickly <p> If we have any questions , we can call and talk to someone who knows our account and can help us right away . <p> CCS often gives us ideas on how we can optimize other related areas of our business not necessarily in ways that directly benefit them , but in ways that help us and make us happy to have them on board . <h> CCS is now a LuxSci Partner <p> A significant number of LuxScis customers are businesses accepting credit cards . - In addition to solid email or other solutions that we can provide , credit card processing and profit margin are of course key to their- livelihood . <p> LuxSci has partnered with Credit Card Services so that we can let our customers and friends know about and benefit from their unique solution . - As a result of this partnership , new CCS customers that sign up as a result of LuxSci will get 10% off the fees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you are interested in seeing if CCS can improve your business profit margin , we have an online form that you can fill out . It will send your information securely to CCS using LuxSci SecureForm ; they will review your current processing costs and let you know how much you can save if you switched . - LuxSci itself also- guarantees- that if you take the time to submit your information to them and to through the relatively simple review process , that we will give you $100 if it turns out that they can not improve your- expected processing percentage rate per credit card swipe .

@@22227591 @2227591/ 5313 @qwx205313 5311 @qwx205311 <p> The situation : your organization needs to collect information from clients through from(s) on your web site , but that information is sensitive . So , you need to be absolutely sure that the information is transferred from the users of your web site to you in as secure a fashion as possible . This means that <p> no one but you ( or optionally your authorized staff ) can intercept or read the information , <p> the information is never stored insecurely anywhere <p> the information can not be modified without your knowledge <p> Why would this high level of security and privacy be necessary ? There are many cases where they are essential ; some of these include : <h> The Security Issues Involved <p> The requirement for security begs the question of how and why common mechanisms for collecting information from web forms are not secure . The following are many of the security problems involved with the use of standard web forms : <p> The data sent from your client to the web server is unencrypted ; it is susceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client has no way to ensure that the web site s/he is using is really yours and not one set up to pretend to be yours and to trick the client into revealing up sensitive information <p> If you store the sensitive information on the web server or in a database , this data is also susceptible to <p> Being ready by others with access <p> Unsecured backups viewable by others ( sometimes long after the fact ) <p> Modification <p> These issues are all very serious especially the strong possibility that undesirables could intercept or read the sensitive data sometimes long after it was collected by looking at backups or other archives . <p> It is very important to be able to mitigate all of these issues so that the privacy and security of the data is guaranteed . <h> The PGP or S/MIME + SSL Security Solution <p> The first part of the solution is to use a " secure web site " . This means getting an " SSL Certificate " and installing it in your web server so that your clients can connect to your web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which designates a secure connection ) , versus URLs that start with http : // ( which designates an insecure connection ) . Using a secure web site gives you the following security enhancements : <p> All data sent to and from the web site and your clients is encrypted so that it can not be eavesdropped upon , intercepted , or modified during transmission . This is like a " secure pipe " between the client and your server that no one can penetrate . <p> If your secure SSL Certificate is purchased from a trusted organization , like Thawte or Verisign , then your client can trust that s/he is connecting to your actual web server and not some other server setup by a malicious entity who is trying to use a fake secure connection . Why ? Trusted third parties will verify your identity and right to secure your domain before granting you an SSL certificate in which they vouch for your legitimacy ! This is very important , as anyone can create an untrusted certificate which provides encryption but no measure of assurance that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web browsers will immediately warn you when they encounter such untrusted certificates . <p> So , use of a secure web site protects the sensitive information during the first leg of transit from the client to your server and it also helps the client trust that s/he is connecting to the intended web site . However , we still need to ensure that the data gets from the web server to you in a safe and secure way . <p> The safest way to do this is to use PGP or S/MIME and keep the " private key " on a separate computer from the web server . We will first examine the common case where you want the sensitive data securely emailed to you . <p> In PGP ( and S/MIME , or any " public key " or " asymmetric " cryptography system , more details ) , there are two " keys " a public one and a private one . The beauty of these systems is that anything encrypted with one key can ONLY be decrypted with the other . You can also have password on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used without knowledge of the password . So , here is how this technology will help us : <p> You will create a PGP or S/MIME public and private key pair . <p> You will ensure that the private key has a good password . <p> You will keep the private key in your email program on your personal computer . <p> The public key will be put on your web server . <p> The sensitive data will be encrypted using your public key and then emailed to you . <p> When you get the email , you can decrypt it because you have your private key and you know its password . Most common email programs , such as Thunderbird and Outlook , support use of PGP encryption through the addition of plugins or addons . S/MIME generally integrates without additional software . <p> The security benefit of this scenario can be summarized as follows : <p> Once the data is encrypted with the public key , it can only ever be decrypted by someone in possession of the private key and its password . Thus , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The data is secure during transmission and storage even though it is being sent in a normal email message . <p> If someone were to modify the encrypted content of the message at all , that action would corrupt the message and no one would be able to open it . Thus , the data is safe from tampering . The message can be destroyed , but the original content can not be altered . <p> PGP and S/MIME both ensure that the sensitive information that is emailed to you is secure during the transit from the web server to your email , is safe during any backups on any machines , and can not even be accessed in your email unless the person accessing it has access to both your private key AND its password ( which should be unrelated to any other passwords you have ) . <p> You could also secure your form data by encrypting it and saving it on the web server itself . You could then login though your SSL-secured web site and have your web site decrypt and display the sensitive information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scenario is as follows : <p> The web site contains both the public and private keys , but does n't  know the password to the private key . <p> The web site encrypts the sensitive data it receives with your public key and stores it in a database or file . <p> You access your secure web site and login . <p> You request to view one of the items of encrypted sensitive information . <p> The web site asks you for the password to your private key . <p> You provide the password through a secure web site form . <p> The web site uses that and the private key to decrypt the information and the sends it back to your web browser . <p> This mechanism allows storage and retrieval of sensitive data in a way that does n't  depend on email and that can be shared with anyone to whom you grant access to your secure web site and knowledge of the private key password . It provides all the same benefits of sending the data in encrypted email messages secure transmission and storage and non-modifiability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with multiple people through your web site " sending " them secure information that they can " pick up " by logging into your secure web site and providing the password to their private key ( which could have been automatically generated by the web server itself ! ) <h> Is Anything Missing ? <p> One natural question that follows from the proposed solutions in the previous section is " what is missing ? " Are there any security or privacy risks that are left ? Are there any issues of trust remaining ? Here we will address these issues : <p> Use of SSL : SSL provides encryption during data transport and also provides some level of trust that the client is connecting to your actual web site and not someone elses . However , the " trust " part is only truly useful for educated clients . Many naive or new Internet users get in the bad habit of clicking " go away " on any and all warning messages and dialog boxes that their web browser may display . Such users will not necessarily be aware if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looks like yours but which is not and which uses an untrusted SSL certificate . They may then enter their sensitive data there , making it available to unintended parties . These are so-called " phishing " attacks , where hackers are " fishing " for sensitive data by sending forged email from respectable companies that tries to get unsuspecting recipients to log into fraudulent web sites setup to look like the real ones to give them anything from content information , to account data , to credit card numbers , etc.There is no simple way to assist uneducated users who do not pay attention to browser warnings and dialog boxes . There are many things that can be done such as using one-time passwords and security tokens for access but these complicate access . For most small web sites , " phishing " attacks are not likely to be an important issue as hackers usually spend their efforts going after " big fish , " where they have a better chance of significant return on their effort . <p> Trust of the Web Server : There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and web hosting company . Your sensitive data is unencrypted and insecure at one point in time inside your web site script(s) . If someone were to break into your web server and have access to your web site scripts , then they could modify them to capture the sensitive data after it arrives via SSL and before it is encrypted . This would grant them full access to all new sensitive data ( though previously captured data would still be safe ) . The interloper could be a hacker breaking in through vulnerabilities in the web server or web hosts infrastructure , or it could be an agent in the web hosting company who already has high-level access to the server . <p> The Email Scenario : . In the scenario where the encrypted data is emailed to you , you must be sure that the password to your private key is known only to authorized people and that only such people have access to the key itself . If someone else gets a copy of a secure message and your private key , they can try to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying all kinds of different passwords until one works if you pick an easily guessed password , this will not be a hard thing to do . <p> Database Scenario : In the scenario where the encrypted data is stored in on the web server along with the private key , there is a further level of trust involved . Anyone with access to the private key and the stored data can try to break into the sensitive data by " brute force " , as described in ( 3 ) . Furthermore , anyone with access to your web scripts could modify them to save a copy of the password to the private key when it is passed to your secure web site . They can then login later and get that saved password and unlock all of the encrypted data . So , in this scenario , you are really trusting that no one can have unauthorized access to your web site and data . <p> Fake data : In the various scenarios we have discussed , the sensitive data is encrypted and saved or emailed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way to be 100% sure that it was created by your web site forms . It might have been created and encrypted by anyone else with access to your public key and web server and then stored or emailed in the same way ( this takes some doing but is possible ) . <h> Secure Email &amp; Communications with SSL with PGP or S/MIME <p> Use of SSL with PGP or S/MIME can protect your sensitive data to a very high level high enough to meet all HIPAA regulations and for you and your clients to feel confident sharing even sensitive financial information . Used together , these technologies ensure : <p> Your data is protected during transmission over the Internet . <p> Your data is protected during storage . <p> Only the intended recipient of the data can ever access it . <p> The data can not be modified without being corrupted . <p> The sender can be sure that s/he is sending to the intended recipient . <p> In the end , there is always an issue of trust you must place a strong degree of trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that : <p> One such company , LuxSci , is ready to help you implement SSL with PGP or S/MIME solutions . LuxSci provides SSL-secured web sites , is partnered with Thawte.com to help you obtain very good and well trusted SSL certificates , and has ready-made scripts for capturing secure form data , encrypting it , and emailing it to you .

At the time , Mason Rothert was working as V.P. of Sales and Technology for a management company overseeing long-term care facilities and a full range therapy company . Nicholas Magers was finishing up his MBA at USC and working for a pulmonary company as a sales director . They decided to combine forces in order to solve the fragmentation of communication amongst covered entities and business associates in healthcare . They would focus on the new technologies available as well as the growing need to encrypt patient health information in order to prevent data breaches . <p> Mediprocity begin in 2009 as a social network for healthcare. - The Company culture has always been to be physician-centric and to help improve communications. - As smartphone and text messaging popularity grew rapidly , it was clear in 2010 that Mediprocity needed to become a simple secure solution for HIPAA-compliant communication . - They set out to combine the best elements of instant messaging , SMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediprocity secure communications product into its offering and is continuing to work closely with them to integrate the SecureChat service more and more tightly with LuxScis SecureLine secure emailing offerings . <p> Mason has agreed to this interview so that we can answer many common SecureChat-related questions for you . <p> 1 . Why are standard text messaging and multimedia messaging services built into everyones phones and tables insecure and insufficient for HIPAA compliance ? <p> There are many reasons why these are not sufficient for HIPAA compliance . <p> The basic stance on standard secure messaging is that it does not fall under the Omnibus safe harbor rule of encryption. - You do not have to use secure text , but you had better build a strong policy to protect yourself in the event you lose or have your phone stolen. - You had also build a strong policy to protect yourself in the event all of the other people you send SMS text that includes PHI never have a breach by losing their phones. - That is pretty well impossible to do . <p> If you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply use encryption. - This debate should no longer be a debate in 2015 , it should be much like healthcares approach of standard of care medicine. - If you send a text that has PHI , make sure it is encrypted. - Period . <p> Then there are the HITECH issues around mobile such as : proper authentication and read receipt. - Remote wipe or logout in event of lost/stolen device. - Proper archive of messages with oversight . <p> Let 's discuss the archive and oversight. - There are many providers out there that let you destroy a message or let it expire and delete. - But that gives a false sense of security as those messages never really get destroyed. - They live on the servers of the company in case they are ever issued a subpoena. - From a users perspective they think they are destroying the message for eternity when that is not the case and that is simply not a fair way to sell a product to your customer. - Or , they do completely wipe the message , because the companys product is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool. - That can be a dangerous arena to play in as well if a Federal or State judge compels you to produce your messages. - Finally , there is the visibility at the admin level of an organization. - If you plan to allow your staff to use messaging from their mobile devices it should be used for PHI. - If it does n't  involve PHI then regular messaging serves the purpose. - Being in a secure professional messaging system allows administrators to have access on users accounts to lock , deactivate , administer privileges and impersonate the user for audit purposes . <p> In light of the recent events with the Sony hack in December 2014 , and the more recent Anthem breach of sensitive data not being encrypted at rest , it also is a good idea to encrypt important company documents and employee records. - Sending these via an unsecure text message is simply a poor choice when there are low-cost options to protect. - The old saying , " it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission " does not apply to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach for unsecure PHI , especially around mobile devices , you had better believe they will want their " pound of flesh " . <p> It is not worth it simply encrypt your communication . <p> 2 . How does SecureChat- work ? <p> Very simple we made our product easy and intuitive. - If you can attach an image to an email or send a text on your phone you can use SecureChat. - You register for an account. - You then can log in via any browser anytime anywhere. - You may also install the app on your phone , search and connect with colleagues and begin sending messages. - Easy . <p> 3 . How does SecureChat- ensure transport security for messages ? <p> End-to-End Encryption. - All of the messages are encrypted at rest ( using 256-bit AES Encryption ) and in transit ( using HIPAA-compliant SSL ) . - Each user has their own unique encryption key. - When you send a message on SecureChat , it is fully encrypted at rest and can only be decrypted by another user in the same conversation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Mediprocity use to ensure that messages are secure " at rest " ? <p> - All messages are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption with a unique password per chat conversation . - The password- to decrypt a conversation and the messages therein is itself encrypted so that only users in the conversation and authorized administrators can access it . - As each of these users has his/her own asymmetric encryption key , the password is encrypted for each of these users using their keys . - The users , when they enter the password to their encryption keys , can then decrypt the password to unlock communications to which they are a party . <p> None of these communications can be decrypted without the password to at least one of the users encryption keys and these are never stored in plain text on the system in any way . - Users are in control of the passwords to their own keys . <p> 5 .

HIPAA requires that access to message data be available to administrators in case of emergency . Can that be done via SecureChat ? <p> Yes , each organization can have an administrator who can gain access to all conversations and messages sent and received by users in his/her organization . - Thus , secure , emergency access is assured . <p> This access is possible , even though everything is encrypted at rest , because the administrators encryption key enables- him to decrypt and access copies of user encryption keys . - This capability permits both emergency access and the ability to reset user encryption keys , in case they are lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does SecureChat- provide audit trails of user access to ePHI ? <p> SecureChat provides " Read Receipts " .

In what ways is Mediprocity- a better solution that competitive services such as TigerText , - Imprivata , and qliqSoft ? <p> All of the competition in this space offer a unique set of tools. - We all started in the secure messaging space around the same time , and since that time Mediprocity has seen dozens of companies enter the market. - Some claim to be the leaders simply because they were first to market in the sense of mass-marketing because they had deep pockets. - Some were able to scale rapidly in the market because of their parent companys products . <p> Mediprocity has been growing steadily and we believe secure messaging in healthcare is not a sprint but a marathon. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of reasons. - Mediprocity offers many of the same tools and are much more cost-effective for small to mid-size organizations than our competition . <p> One of- the biggest advantages of Mediprocity/SecureChat is the clean and simple interface . - The Apps and web interface do one thing and do it very well and very simply . - Compared to the competition there is really no comparison . <p> Another advantage is the security and integration with LuxSci combining SecureChat , secure email , secure forms , and other services though one company has many advantages in terms of time , money , support , and compliance risk . - Further , LuxSci is working with Mediprocity to integrate their secure email services more and more tightly with the mobile-centric SecureChat offering . - Integrated , unified service will be a boon for everyone . <p> - 11 . What are some of the great things on the- roadmap for 2015 ? <p> We just launched Mediprocity 3.0 , which means we are now prepared to rollout features we have been waiting to release for years. - We cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a few exciting features include our integrations with some leading software in the healthcare industry as well as exciting new useful features on both the web and apps that our user community has requested . <p> Additionally , we have big plans with respect to expanding our API to enable tight integration of SecureChat services with other applications . - Think of some of the things that text messaging cane be used for in many cases these can be done better if done securely .

Kangas explains that , when you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review your communications this means your email and Internet activities . If your email communications demonstrate a poor work ethic , lack of tolerance in the workplace , or even worse use of company systems for non-work activities you could be in hot water with the boss before you know it . " After you 've deleted an email , it still can reside on any number of servers for years , " he explains . Emails can be retrieved and read by your employer as long as there are backup copies . Copies of your email can even be archived indefinitely without your knowledge . <p> Even if you are a stellar employee , misuse of information technology by others in your company can cause you problems .

Your recipient has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent has been tampered with or not ! And , if the message was merely deleted , they would n't even know . Messages can also be sent to appear to be from someone other than who they are actually from . modern computer viruses and spammers often send email forged so as to appear to come from people other than the actual senders . <p> Unprotected backups : As messages are stored in plain text on all email servers , any backups of these servers disks may also contain plain text copies of your messages . As backups can be kept for years and can be read by anyone with access to them , you messages could still be laying around in insecure places even after you think that all copies have been " deleted " . <p> Repudiation : Because email messages can be forged , there is almost no way for you to prove that someone sent you a particular message . This means that even if someone DID send you a message , they can successfully deny it , claiming forgery or identity theft . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications , electronic commerce , etc . <p> Use encryption : " You can use various types of encryption to safeguard the messages themselves against such things as eavesdropping , repudiation , unprotected backups , and to ensure that messages can not be altered , " says Kangas . Many companies will offer such features to their employees to protect confidential content . <p> Configure your email to deny read receipts : " If you 're worried about someone tracking whether or not you 've received their email , you can always choose the deny read receipts option on your system so that the time an email was opened ca n't be tracked , " says Kangas . Talk to your IT staff or email provider , or see your email program documentation for ways to block read receipts .

Prior to that we tried out a few of the cheaper providers and found that the support and/or the quality of the hardware and network was not up to our standards. - Rackspace is like an extension of our IT department , helping us to provide the most reliable and redundant services available . <p> One of our long time clients has remarked that we have a " formula for success " that we should n't change. - We attribute this to the combination of our software , our people , and our infrastructure . In this article , well discuss how LuxSci utilizes Rackspace and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rackspaces reliability , security , and support . <h> Rackspace Overview <p> Rackspace , like LuxSci , is a " premium " provider. - This means that although there are many places offering much cheaper dedicated servers and cloud services ; we pay a premium for our Rackspace so that we can get the well vetted hardware , exceptional infrastructure , and Fanatical support that comes along with it. - Our users benefit from that synergy it makes LuxScis services that much better. - Rackspace has three data centers in the USA , two in the United Kingdom , one in Hong Kong , and one in Sydney ; LuxSci can setup servers- for clients in any of these locations . <p> The following sections discuss the very impressive features of the Rackspace data centers that are a part of LuxScis infrastructure . <h> Data Center Physical Security <p> The data centers only house dedicated servers and cloud services ; there is no support for " co-location " . - This means that only authorized Rackspace technicians can ever enter the data centers and gain physical access to the servers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get anywhere near the servers themselves , physically ( without special dispensation and escort ) . - This is a good thing . <p> Independently audited disaster recovery and business continuity plans are in place at Rackspace headquarters and support services . <h> Data Center Precision Environment <p> HVAC : The HVAC ( Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning ) system is N+1 redundant ; this enables duplicate systems to take over should there be an HVAC system failure . <p> Clear Air : - All the air in the data center is circulated and filtered to remove dust and contaminants every 90 seconds . <p> Fire Suppression : Advanced fire suppression systems are in place to stop fires from spreading in the unlikely event one should occur . <p> Nice and neat : - Cables are securely tied down with cable racks suspended from ceilings , providing dual routes for all cables . <h> Data Center Conditioned Power <p> UPS : Every server is attached to conditioned UPS ( Uninterruptible Power Supply ) power so that , should a total utility power outage ever occur , all of the data center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The UPS power subsystem is N+1 redundant ; this provides instantaneous failover if the primary UPS fails . <p> Generators : In the event of an extended utility power outage , routinely tested , on-site diesel generators can run indefinitely . - ( We have seen this happen and it works ) . <h> The Network Infrastructure 100% uptime <p> In addition to excellent physical security and data center planning , the network environment is so good , that Rackspace guarantees 100% network uptime. - How do they do this and what does it mean ? <p> The network is used exclusively for customers. - Bandwidth is never shared with other organizations , such as telecommunications companies , which could deplete available resources . <p> The only bandwidth used is high performance bandwidth ; this is not usually the case with bargain providers . <p> Nine separate network providers including Abovenet , AT&amp;T , MCI , Quest , Sprint , and SBC , are used to ensure multiple redundancies in the flow of information to and from the data centers . <p> Every fiber carrier must enter the data center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure in the unlikely event of a network cut . <p> Rackspace uses a Proactive Network Management methodology which constantly monitors the route efficiency and end-user performance. - It automatically adjusts the network topology and configuration in real-time to provide the most reliable and fastest network possible . <p> The network is intentionally underutilized so that it can be resilient to large spikes in traffic and routing issues. - Typically , the network operates at a 40% threshold , leaving 60% headroom for traffic bursts. - Most companies operate at an 80% threshold , leaving much less room for bursts . <p> The network does not have any single point of failure . <p> Routing equipment is located in a separate secured core routing room which is fed by its own redundant power supply . <p> All networking and security teams working in the data centers are required to be certified . They are also required to be thoroughly experienced in managing and monitoring enterprise level networks . <p> Indeed it is not hype. - This network is always fast and always reliable. - You really do pay for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Rackspace support technicians call themselves " Rackers " . - Rackspace is different in that its support technicians are certified and extensively knowledgeable . On any particular shift on any day of the year , there will be experts available in areas like : <p> These people really exist and we really can talk to them if/when needed 24/7. - LuxSci has a great deal of experience in the areas we focus on : - security , email , hosting , sever administration , etc . However , there can always be a situation that arises that is new or requires very specialized knowledge in a particular area. - The fact that we can pick up a phone at any time and have Rackers jump on an issue to help us get it resolved ASAP is invaluable . Like LuxSci , Rackspace emphasizes fast and quality technical support. - They even guarantee it to LuxSci . <p> We do not need their help very often , but we do consider them to be an extension of our IT team ; our network and server support team can grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as a denial of service attack , network routing problems , etc. - This is why we partner with Rackspace. - This is part of what makes your LuxSci experience so smooth . <h> LuxSci and Rackspace <p> So , how does this all fit in with LuxSci , exactly ? <p> LuxSci leases all of its new production servers from Rackspace to take advantage of their excellent infrastructure , service level agreements , and customer support. - We use our expertise to select server configurations appropriate for the operation of LuxScis infrastructure and to direct Rackspace in the appropriate setup and monitoring of this installation. - LuxSci uses its own custom server monitoring and maintenance software in parallel with Rackspaces monitors to provide redundant and independent server and network health checking. - We work directly with Rackspace technicians to diagnose and resolve any hardware or network issue that may arise like us , they are available 24/7 for any emergency situation that may arise. - LuxSci develops , installs , and manages all of the software on the servers and provides all support to its customers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means that Rackspace ensure the security and privacy of any ePHI that they may come into contact with through their support of us and provisioning of services to us. - This is required by the HIPAA Omnibus of any business partner of ours that may encounter customer PHI . <p> The net effect is a very efficient and cost effective partnership that yields very fast and reliable web and email services through LuxScis feature rich and evolving software . <h> Rackspace Interview <p> To round out this article , we asked Rackspace some leading questions on these topics to get their own viewpoint on the industry . <p> What is Rackspaces commitment/policy in terms of providing quality and timely phone and ticket support ? <p> Rackspace Hosting has an unmatched Service Level Agreement within the industry . This is what sets us apart from the rest . Fanatical Support is something Rackspace takes very seriously . Its our drive to do more than what our industry-leading contracts , Service Level Agreements and guarantees say we will .

TLS is one of the standard ways that computers on the Internet transmit information over an encrypted channel . In general , when one computer connects to another computer and uses TLS , the following happens : <p> Computer A connects to Computer B ( no security ) <p> Computer B says " Hello " ( no security ) <p> Computer A says " Let 's talk securely over TLS " ( no security ) <p> Computer A and B agree on how to do this ( secure ) <p> The rest of the conversation is encrypted ( secure ) <p> In particular : <p> The meat of the conversation is encrypted <p> Computer A can verify the identity of Computer B ( by examining its SSL certificate , which is required for this dialog ) <p> Other information can not be injected into the conversation by third parties . <p> TLS ( and SSL ) is used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet a more secure place , when used . One of the popular uses of TLS is with SMTP- for transmitting email messages between servers in a secure manner. - See also : <p> For folks in the medical field , there is often a lot of uncertainty regarding which kinds of web forms need HIPAA compliance and which ones do not . - We often have customers asking if this or that form really needs to be secure or not . <p> The short answer is that you should probably just make ALL of your forms secure , like like it is best to make all pages of your web site secure , no matter what is on the page . - This instills more trust in your web visitors and as a result results in more business . - It does n't  take much work to secure your forms , so you might as well just do it for all of them in a clear and consistent way . - Your users data will be protected , and they will know that you are looking to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not strictly be necessary . - This is a good thing . <p> Back to the original question . <h> If you are a medical office , do some forms not need to be secure and HIPAA compliant , depending on what is collected ? <p> Note : the following is suggested advice from LuxSci based on our understanding of HIPAA ; however , this should not be taken as legal advice . - We advise you to consult your lawyer for accurate legal advice pertaining to your particular situation . <p> HIPAA requires that all electronic Protected Health Information ( ePHI ) be secured to protect the privacy of the individuals identified in the ePHI. - So , as long as either ( a ) HIPAA does not apply to you , or ( b ) your form does not collect ePHI , then you do not- have to- secure the web form . <p> Let 's look at each of the two criteria so that you can tell if either one may apply to you or your form . <p> Your email is the doorway into your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that you do . - Even the passwords to the myriad of web sites that you use for everything from meet ups to banking can often be reset via access to your email . - The integrity , privacy , and security of email is high on the minds of everyone these days , even folks who historically had little or no insight into how anything works , technically , and did n't  really want to know . - Everyone is wary . <p> Many times when a customer fills out a form on your website , they want a copy for their own records . Providing this copy of the submitted data often takes manual effort on your behalf to search your Inbox , WebAides Documents , or database , extract the appropriate file , and email the file as an attachment back to the individual who filled it out . <p> Of course , this presumes that the submittee entered their email address accurately , and that you send the form back to their correct address . When sending a copy via this method , sensitive information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly be sent to the wrong person or insecurely , resulting in a possible breach and violation ! <p> With- LuxSci SecureForm it is easy to securely provide the person submitting the form a copy , automatically and- immediately after they submit your form . <p> For legal reasons , LuxScis HIPAA customers are required to physically sign a " Business Associate Agreement " - and return it to us. - While this is a simple and commonplace request , it creates a lot of busy work on the part of the customer and LuxSci ! <p> The customer might have to <p> Download the file <p> Print out the 19 pages <p> Sign the agreement <p> Fax back all pages , or scan it and return electronically <p> Then , LuxSci might have to <p> Locate the document <p> Sort out faxes that are in the wrong order , upside down , blank , or missing pages <p> Figure out who sent the document <p> Verify that pages are not missing or changed <p> Counter-sign the document and attach them to the customer account <p> Contact customers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is crucial to the HIPAA certification process <p> Multiplied by lots of customers , this creates a lot of unproductive busy work for everyone and this time costs money . <p> To simplify this process , LuxSci use its own SecureForm and Ink Signatures technologies to make submission of signed contracts a snap for customers , as well as to eliminate most of the busy work LuxSci itself has to do to manage the process . <p> For many different reasons , customers have asked us if we hold the keys to unlocking their email data . Why ? <p> Compliance / Emergencies : Customers with compliance needs , such as HIPAA , need to have emergency access to data and that can mean appealing to LuxSci to access data to which the customer has otherwise lost access . - Having the keys in this case , is very important . <p> Privacy : On the other end of the spectrum , some customers want to do as much as possible to ensure that no one , not even LuxSci staff , can access their email data . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The answer is that " it depends " . - For security and flexibility , LuxSci presents customers a variety of email encryption options that span the complete range from " completely unencrypted " to " LuxSci has no possible access " . - It is up to the customer to choose where in that spectrum they fall often balancing ease of use with security needs . <p> In the following sections , we will consider to what degree LuxSci can assist customers in accessing email ( and WebAides ) data , based on what encryption options the customer has chosen . - We also discuss where and how your trust of LuxSci comes into play .

If speed is a factor , a more powerful server will deliver your messages faster .

It assumes optimal sending conditions : very small ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all to the same recipient domain , where there is no blacklisting or greylisting , where SMTP Pipelining is used without SSL , and where the recommended number of concurrent SMTP connections is employed . <p> Spotlight Mailer Maximum Rate <p> The " maximum sending rate " ( msgs/hr ) for Spotlight Mailer is a theoretical maximum rate that messages can be sent from Spotlight Mailer under the same optimal sending conditions : very small ( 1 KB ) messages , all to the same recipient domain , where there is no blacklisting or greylisting , and where SSL is not used . Spotlight mailer is has an extremely fast connection to the SMTP server , uses SMTP Pipelining , and uses 4 concurrent connections . <p> Actual throughput with Spotlight Mailer will be less based on the other factors which affect sending rate : SSL , Message size , Recipient server and DNS performance , blacklisting and greylisting , and any additional processing being performed ( e.g. anonymization or encryption ) . <p> Expected Rate <p> Under realistic sending conditions , you may find your sending rate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming that you also use SMTP Pipelining , 1 recipient per message , no SSL , have moderately small messages , use a good email sending program , and use the recommended number of concurrent SMTP connections . <p> Expected Daily Rate <p> This is an estimate of the number of messages that you could send in 24 hours of sustained sending at approximately the " Expected " hourly rate . <h> Sustained vs Burst Rate <p> For some customers , the speed of sending is very important . There are two significant modes of sending : <p> Sustained Rate <p> Sending at a consistent rate for a long period of time . E.g. 20,000 messages/hour for minutes or hours . Sustained rates are relevant when sending an email marketing blast to a large subscriber list . <p> Burst Rate <p> A " burst " refers to sending a bunch of messages in a very short time ; e.g. 25 or 50 messages within a second or two . Burst differs from " sustained " in that when you are not " bursting " you are sending one or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is relevant for transactional email messages when you are sending them " as needed " but require the ability to send many at once should that need arise , as it will . <p> Sending speed is important for customers who need to send large mailings at a sustained rate . Understanding sending speed helps you determine how long it will take to send that blast to 100,000 subscribers . <h> Factors Affecting your Sustained Sending Rate <p> There is a theoretical maximum number of messages/hour that any server can manage . How fast you can actually send is affected by a number of factors . <p> 1 . Shared vs Dedicated <p> Dedicated servers will generally be faster . On shared servers , you must share the server sending capacity with others and thus you do not have control over the capacity available to you at any particular time . <p> Use an email marketing program ( like LuxSci Spotlight Mailer ) that supports SMTP Pipelining . With this feature , the program opens a single authenticated connection to the server and sends multiple messages in succession over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection and logging in again for every single message to be sent . <p> SSL is extremely useful for security and for the protection of your username , passwords , and message content . However , when using SSL , your email marketing program and your server must perform work encrypting and decrypting all of your messages . This overhead will slow down your rate of sending . <p> LuxSci Spotlight Mailer does not use SSL by default as the connections are between LuxSci servers behind LuxSci 's firewalls . SSL is not needed in this case . <p> 6 . Concurrent Connections <p> If your program can open 2 connections to our SMTP servers at the same time and send two messages at once , then your sending rate can generally be twice as fast . Depending on how powerful your server is and how slow your network connections are , you can use more and more concurrent connections to achieve higher and higher sending rates . Combined with SMTP Pipelining , an appropriate number of concurrent connections goes a long way to maximizing your throughput potential . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained sending are given for each server type on the Pricing page . <p> Note , however , that if you use more concurrent connections that is recommended , then you are likely just over-working your server . That results in your sending rates actually getting slower . Stick to the recommended number of concurrent connections . <p> LuxSci Spotlight Mailer uses 4 concurrent connections for all customers - dedicated or shared . However , due to the lack of network speed issues slowing down each Spotlight Mailer connection , this behaves effectively like 8 concurrent connections . <p> 7 . Network Speed <p> Your messages must be transmitted from your email marketing program to our servers . The speed of your network and the distance between your sending computer and our servers can significantly impact the maximum rate that you can send messages . <p> For example , LuxSci Spotlight Mailer sends from a server right next to your outbound email servers and thus network speed is not a factor . For someone connecting from outside of LuxSci or internationally , the speed can slow down significantly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger your messages are , the more time it will take to transmit them from your email marketing program to our servers . For example , on a fast network , increasing message size from 1KB to 1MB decreased throughput by 50% . The actual impact of size on you will depend greatly on your network speed and other factors . <p> 9 . Recipient Email Server and DNS Speed <p> In order for our servers to deliver messages to your recipients , they have to ( a ) look up where to deliver the messages to ( DNS ) , and ( b ) talk to those servers to deliver the messages to them . If the DNS lookup as slow or the recipients are in domains that no longer exist , this step can be slow . If the recipient email serves are overloaded , have a slow network , or are having other issues , then the delivery phase can be slow . Delivering many messages to recipients with these issues will slow down your entire sending process ... as other messages have to wait for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipient slowness issue by using our " Anonymous SMTP " ports ( 587 , 6025 , and 6465 ) . In this case your messages are immediately queued on our servers and delivered " later " . This does not speed up the actual time to when the recipients get the messages ( it will in fact slow that down ) ; however , it will speed up the rate that your email marketing program delivers those messages to our servers . <p> 10 . Blacklisting and Greylisting <p> If your email content or sending patterns have gotten your server blacklisted or greylisted , then delivering email messages to recipient servers that are now blocking you or deferring you can slow down your delivery rates . <p> 11 . Recipients per message <p> Most email marketing programs send a separate message to each recipient . This allows them to track opens , views , etc . However , if you send each message to many recipients ( e.g. 100s of recipients ) , then your sending program has significantly fewer messages to deliver to our servers and this process can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent in the usual one recipient/message pattern . <p> Additionally , if each message contains only recipients in a specific domain , then actual delivery to these recipients will be expedited by this efficiency . E.g. If you are sending to 500 AOL users , instead of sending 500 individual messages , send one message with all 500 AOL users listed as " BCC " recipients . Delivery will be almost 500 times faster . <p> 12 .

<p> There are clearly pros and cons to each type of Distribution List. - However , LuxSci accounts can use a combination of these methods to meet their business needs. - For example : <p> WebAide Group Distribution Lists to manage company lists <p> Regular email aliases for ad hoc lists of arbitrary email addresses <p> Custom Filter Lists for maximum control over who can send to your lists . <p> Personal or shared Address Book entries for non-administrative users or for private Distribution Lists ( ones that can not be emailed to by anyone ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lists " <p> have previously discussed the various options for email distribution lists in our post : Three Kinds of Distribution Lists . - However , we are often asked how to make- distribution- lists with special properties , such 5312 @qwx205312 5326 @qwx205326 5320 @qwx205320

" <p> Trust ? Most people likely associate Go Daddy with their recent string of sexually-explicit SuperBowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers thinking of when dealing with trusted online security ? <p> Validation ? The majority of GoDaddy 's certificates are domain-validated . They only validate that the domain is registered by performing a WHOIS lookup . If it is , the certificate is automatically sent to the email address listed for the domain . ( I.e. this is not very secure ) <p> The bulk of Comodo products that LuxSci sells- are- organization-validated products where they perform a full verification of your business , the ownership of your domain , and your authority to apply for the certificate . Their authentication procedures provide the highest level of trust in the industry ( next to EV ) . Go Daddys do not .. <p> Go Daddys certificates require an intermediate certificate to be installed for their use . This is because Go Daddy is down the food chain from upper level , more trusted certificate vendors . The validity of all Go Daddy certificates depends on this chain of trust remaining in place and all dependent business relationships remaining unchanged ! <p> Go Daddy 's core business is as a domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a core business of Comodo and will remain so . SSL will get less attention at GoDaddy . <p> Consider the following when providing your own SSL certificate : <p> You have to order the certificate yourself . <p> You are responsible for ensuring that your certificate does not expire and you must take the initiative for renewing it . <p> If there are any issues with your SSL certificate , you must deal with the support from your third party provider yourself . <p> That 's interesting about the stricter domain validation process of Thawte . <p> &gt;&gt;because they are not signing your certificate directly with that trust root . I recollect reading somewhere that NOT signing the certificate directly with the original trust root is actually more secure than doing so because it prevents the original root from being compromised , ever . <p> Comodo swears by this .
