If we can not resolve the dispute within forty-five ( 45 ) days of receipt of the notice , then the party that sent the notice may submit the dispute to formal arbitration . <p> The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision . We each agree the FAA 's provisions , not state law , govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration . <p> The arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration Forum ( " NAF " ) under its arbitration rules . Except as otherwise explicitly stated , if any NAF rule conflicts with these Terms of Use , these Terms of Use apply . You can obtain procedures , rules , and fee information from the NAF at 1-800-474-2371 or www.adrforum.com . <p> Unless we each agree otherwise , the Arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and will take place in your county of residence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles , California . The federal or state law that applies to these Terms of Use will also apply during the arbitration . <p> We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and Beso , not as part of a classwide claim ( i.e. , not brought on behalf of or together with another individual 's claim ) . If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction and Section 15 are unconscionable or unenforceable , then our agreement to arbitrate does n't apply and the classwide dispute must be brought in court . <p> We each are responsible for our respective costs relating to counsel , experts and witnesses , as well as any other costs relating to the arbitration . However , if you are seeking up to $5,000 , Beso will cover any NAF arbitration filing fees ( " NAF fees " ) above the equivalent court filing fees for a court action in the appropriate jurisdiction ( " court fees " ) . If you are seeking more than $5,000 , Beso will cover one-half of any NAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result in you paying a smaller portion of the NAF fees , the NAF rules will govern . <p> Exceptions To Our Agreement To Arbitrate Disputes .
