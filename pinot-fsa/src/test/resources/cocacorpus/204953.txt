In our minds " and in the minds of people in the outside world " classical music means the old masterworks , Bach and Beethoven , Mozart and Brahms . We have to blow up that idea . We have to redefine classical music as something that goes beyond any style or sound , beyond any repertoire . To me , it 's ( very simply ) music that 's composed in advance of performance , and thus , as we listen , can unfold with the careful flow and detail of a fine novel or film . No other musical genre works that way . Understood like this , classical music can have any sound , incorporate any musical technique . And thus it can be contemporary , can open itself to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more diverse . How can we fit into a greatly varied world , if we 're not ourselves diverse ? How can we ask support from people who do n't hear themselves in our music , and do n't see themselves among the musicians we put onstage ? <p> We need to be more creative . We may not seem creative to the world outside us . We seem to do the same things , play the same music , over and over . We may know that this can be creative , and needs great , focused discipline . But it may not seem creative to the outside world . Because , outside our concert halls , new things are being done with music and with sound , while older music is reinterpreted in new ways . We should join the larger world in doing all these things . <p> We need to be entrepreneurial . To attract a new audience , we need to reinvent the way we do business . We need to perform in new places for new people , and to find new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be creative " and entrepreneurial " we need to change the way we educate classical musicians . We need to teach it more creatively both to children and to aspiring classical music professionals . Everyone should be encouraged to create music , to compose pieces , discover new sounds , and play old in ways all their own . <p> When we play the old masterworks , we have to do it with more individuality , more fire , and more conviction . We have to treat these works as if they were new . What goes on inside them " their narrative , contrasts between one moment and the next " should be unmistakable to everyone listening , even to people who do n't know classical music at all . <p> We have to reinvent the financial structure of classical music . Not everyone who studies classical music can make a living from it . But those who do succeed have been decently paid , making more or less the same money as accomplished professionals in other fields . Can this continue ? The old ways are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classical music living . We do n't yet know how classical music will finance itself after it 's reborn . But we 'll have to figure it out , so that classical musicians of the future can be financially secure . <p> And , one last time , we have to fully join the culture around us . That may not seem easy . And " as once more I say with sympathy " it may not please everyone who loves classical music now . But it 's something we have to do , and , beyond that , it 's a natural impulse for younger people in our field . It will lead them to new places , giving classical music new excitement , new conviction , and new artistic depth . <p> Further reading : <p> Before the Crisis : What classical music was like in the old days , when it was popular. - <h> Comments <p> Im super-interested in this topic , and have been reading through a lot of your posts which I find thoughtful and interesting but I must admit I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@99219946 @3419946/ <h> How to ( Not ) Teach Composition <p> A comment from Scott , a former Bard student , brings to mind ideas about teaching composition that I wonder if anyone else shares . I 've never heard of anyone being taught how to teach composition , except indirectly and by example . Were all winging it , are n't  we ? I had one composition teacher who never said a word I understood , and seemed to enjoy keeping me confused ; another who disliked every piece at first and thought it was lovely as soon as you copied it out neatly ; another who was brilliant but considered Cage and minimalism hoaxes ; another who merely tinkered with my orchestration ( Feldman ) ; one who changed my life simply by telling me about just intonation ( Johnston ) ; and another who did me a world of good simply by enthusing about everything I did . Little of that activity seemed like teaching , though by default that 's what we have to call it . I know of teachers who start out , " Heres how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it , step by step . I think that would have driven me nuts . It always seemed to me that what you mainly absorbed from an older composer was attitude , and you gravitate toward the attitudes that appeal to you . <p> Subsequent experience has suggested to me that there are two kinds of composition students : those who write too little music because they 're too self-critical and those who write too much because they 're not self-critical enough . ( Those who write just the right amount are unheard of . ) I feel much more useful with the ones who do n't  write enough , because that 's the problem I worked through myself . First of all , I hardly make any suggestions on the first piece or two , because I need to learn what their reflexes and aims are before I can tell what they 're trying to do and figure out where they 're not succeeding . Then , when I see them turn down the same road a third or fourth time , I can say , " Aha ! You always do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but just to make them conscious . Sometimes I 'll play them , and analyze a little , pieces that do something similar . In rare cases , if they 're really stuck , I 'll assign specific compositional problems to attack ( like , write a trio only using five pitches ) . I 've only had one case in which that strategy really lit a fire under the student ; more often , they start composing their own pieces faster to induce me to stop . <p> Typically I try to isolate the essential idea of a piece and write my own little variations on it , to look for ways to continue . Sometimes , like all composers , I 'll pull out a piece of my own , show the original problem I struggled with , and show how I solved it . I almost never write notes on their score , because that drove me nuts when I was a student . But I love taking their Sibelius files , " saving as " something else , and tinkering with changes . Occasionally they like the changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply serves to focus them and make them think harder once they leave my office . As an ongoing influence , I harangue them to turn off their superegos , to silence the constant critical carping in the back of their minds that tells them , as soon as they 've written three notes , that those notes are n't  good enough , that compares every line they write with Bach and finds it wanting . If they can do that , they can do anything . Sometimes , if they 're obsessed with a certain composer they worship , I 'll forbid them to listen to that composer any more . I had to quit listening to Cage in college for that reason . <p> The students who write too much are much harder for me . They often come in with a new completed piece every week , which suggests a certain success that 's hard to argue with . Its difficult to convince them that revision is golden , that even when its going well you should n't always settle for the first idea that presents itself . And then , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes in with the final double bar already in place . Of course , like all composition teachers , I pound away at notation , and describe at length how performers respond to , especially , rhythm and articulation markings . That 's the easy part , though they wo n't always believe that you cant start a 4/4 measure with an 8th-note followed by a half-note . My teachers generation often taught little besides penmanship and types of manuscript paper . Similarly , I end up teaching the finer points of Sibelius ( the software ) . <p> I 've taught mostly undergrads , and am happy with that , because they 're more pliable and need more advice . What I 'm not sure is practically helpful is trying to prepare them for the way a composers process changes with the years . I think it seems pretty well established though I do n't  know that Ive ever read this anywhere that young composers tend to get inspired by a sonic image and then just start out without knowing where they 're going . At some point , in a persons 20s or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to me that a composer has to learn to quit waiting for that inspiration . Typically , I think and I ask this as a question college age composers tend to have tremendous bursts of inspiration , and be almost incapable of composing when not inspired . As your psychology changes in your 20s , you start thinking less of individual moments ( or melodies , or motives ) and more about strategies for entire pieces ( like chord progressions or rhythmic structures ) . Then it becomes easier to just sit down and start writing , inspired or not , and at some point inspiration creeps in and lifts the piece off the ground . <p> I 've interviewed dozens of composers for my articles and books , and I 've heard one process described over and over again . A young composer will find some method to generate his music , and use it strictly . At sometime in his 30s , he or she will have internalized the method enough to quit using it consciously . My favorite example like this was Petr Kotik , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous example ) based all his melodies on graphs he had found discarded in a science department that showed the rates of alcohol-level response in experimental rats . For years all his music went back to those found graphs as a kind of chance process based on " found " contours . Then , he said , at some point he learned to intuitively write melodies that had those characteristics without using the graphs anymore . I think you find the same pattern overly strict at first , then later freer and more intuitive in most of the good serialist composers , Boulez and Stockhausen in particular . Then , many composers also go through another tremendous shift during their 40s , in which many of the compositional ideas they studiously avoided in youth begin to appeal to them , and their music finds a whole new level as they start playing with the devices they swore theyd never use . It certainly happened to me , when around 1999 I started allowing myself to borrow stylistic paradigms from jazz and other composers . ( Make sure to shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have great new toys to play with in old age . I have an article in Music Downtown . " Mistaken Memories , " quickly tracing this phenomenon through a wide range of composers . ) <p> As I say , I do n't  know to what extent it helps a young composer to be aware of the eventuality of these changes coming in later in life . I like to think that theyll accept the changes more easily if they know its a lifelong process of evolution , that they wo n't get stuck clinging to the process that always worked in the past . The most important thing of all , I think , is to get them used to the process of trying to extend their technique into some area theyve never tried before , getting stuck , feeling helpless , and just living with their failure until some imaginative breakthrough suddenly makes them see where their imagination had been too limited . Its a process that can cause considerable despair when young , and , as you gain experience , you learn more ( or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary prelude to a creative breakthrough . <p> These , off the top of my head , are my thoughts about teaching composition almost as much , or more , a process of emotional therapy than actual musical instruction . I am curious as to whether other teachers find this same dichotomy between young composers who write too little and those who write too much . I wonder if other composition professors muse as often as I do that training in psychotherapy might have been more helpful for this line of work than musical training has been . And I wonder if the process of " switching gears " in your 20s , relying less on sudden inspiration because it does n't  come as often and you no longer need it so much , is as universal as I imagine . It seems to me that we composers do n't  talk about these processes enough , that we all live in ignorance , blindly feeling our way , having to figure out how it works through self-examination and anecdotal evidence . Perhaps the blogosphere is the arena in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I yield the floor . <h> Comments <p> Very nicely put . No one really " teaches " composition any more than I had to teach my kids how to breathe . One can teach the mechanics of it ( theory , counterpoint , notation , business aspects , etc ) , and certainly encourage someone to trust his or her instincts . But teaching someone how to compose is about as silly a notion as teaching someone how to write poetry . We cant teach someone how to be creative . <p> I know the academics out there will weigh in that its important to have a supportive environment , have opportunities to get peers to perform ones music , yadda yadda yadda . That 's all true . But it still does n't  contradict the fundamental assertion that one simply does n't  teach composition . <p> Everything I learned about composition I taught myself , aided by self-study of an average of 10 scores per week by contemporary composers . I cant think of a single thing I learned from my official composition teacher during high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure he meant well . But after awhile , he stopped coming to teach while at the same time I stopped showing up to lessons , hanging out in the music library instead . We mutually gave up on composition " lessons , " which probably was the best thing at the time . <p> Were I to give advice to a young composer , which I probably should n't since I do n't  feel particularly qualified to do so , I 'd stress the importance of listening to as much music as possible , and diverse music at that . Western , Eastern , classical , rock , jazz , etc . Part of the problem with conservatories is that they tend to be myopic , ignoring the wealth of music around us . That 's one reason why Cages aesthetics were so valuable . He thought outside the box , while so many continue to learn within the box . <p> I agree with just about everything you say . My experience is slightly different since mostly I teach kids ( i.e. pre-college ) . I think what you said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very true . I 've found that I continually have conversations which start with my asking " What does this piece do ? " ( or what is it supposed to do , or will it do , or something ) I think its important that they have some kind of intention that they 're aware ofeven if along the way it changes . ( Apparently when Birtwistle was teaching at Harvard recently he a lot of times asked a similar question : " What is the piece ? " ) . ( At one point I did a lot of thinking about what one kind of standard one could apply to any pieceI finally decided that every piece does something . ) Rate of production is tricky . Sometimes you feel that youd like to see the student do more and do it quicker and sometimes you think its important to try to slow them down and think more about what they 're doing . What 's called for seems different at different times . Mainly I try to keep them working and trying to make sure that what they write down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mean . <p> This post and the previous one are not only great , but timely . Ive been teaching now for a couple of years and this fall I 'll begin the real test being completely in charge of the composition department at SUNY-Fredonia . Obviously these questions are always there , but they 're currently very much on the forefront of my mind and its comforting to hear similar sentiments from you . <p> As far as composition pedagogy , what you 're saying is pretty much where I come from as well ; its not as much a matter of actually teaching how to compose , but rather to allow the student the opportunity to compose a lot of music in the right environment with enough models to choose from ( both in process and in attitude ) . This can be assisted with the existence of many performance opportunities as well as strong collaborative attitudes from the the other music faculty and , through them , their students . <p> Working with new composers can be a challenge , but I can still put myself in their shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single composition " lesson " and by that time I had picked up a lot of different tools from jazz and film scoring that seemed to help when applied to writing concert music . Writing the notes was n't the problem getting over the huge conceptual hump of believing I was a composer with a upper-case " C " was much more difficult ( due in no small measure to my background as a jazz saxophonist/arranger ) . Once I got over the initial self-doubt and the more opportunities I had to write at a high level ( with the accompanying high expectations from **37;0;TOOLONG ) , only then did my own chops blossom and I started having some serious fun . <p> Your techniques of " save as " in Sibelius ( I do the same in Finale ) and giving the students some different options in real time is spot on with what I 've done in the past . With students who write quickly and a lot if they bring in a piece already completed , sometimes I 'll ask them to think about revision , but not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of my premiere performances rough drafts before the final edit , since its only when I hear it performed live with an audience that I truly experience the work as it honestly is , scars and all . <p> If there 's one concept I think I can get across to the students , its the idea that how you say something musically is n't nearly as important as having something personal to say in the first place . As they age and mature , theyll transcend the " how " and focus on the " what " if Ive done my job . Its not deep , but its a start . <p> At the large university here in the Northeast where I teach composition , students are given pvt. lessons in composition for 2 years . If they " stick it out " the following year is spent in a composition class . Most of my students have very little experience in actually writing music . They have worked with software that allows them combine loops and sequence events but there often is n't much thought about harmony , form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting textural qualities . But I often wonder what motivated them to become a " composer " ? It has also motivated me to think about what I mean by the word " composer . " I think many decide to become composers after significant musical experiences of any kind . I remember wanting to become a composer after having heard Stravinskys Sacre for the second time . This first time I heard it I did n't  " get it " and gave it a second hearing . That experience was far more powerful than the angst of Black Sabbath . Here was a music that moved me at a very deep level and I wanted to learn how it was done and learn how I could do it for myself . I spent many Saturdays at the public library listening to all kinds of music and reading as many scores as I possibly could . I would n't have that kind of experience again until I heard Mahlers Third Symphony in Boston in the 1990s . More to a point is that I think young composers write music similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students is always to listen voraciously to all kinds of music and as often as possible with a score . This allows them to see how to make " things " happen . Model their work on the kinds of music that gets them excited . I often have the student analyze the modeled work in tandem with their own composition . But unravelling the threads of the model we can learn how it was assembled . Hopefully we can reassemble the threads in our own effective way . On the other hand I often feel that todays young composer needs to be as versatile as possible . I think one of the best things I can do is to encourage them to experiment in various styles so that their compositional toolbox is well supplied with the kinds of tools the composer can use with some sufficiency . Write the " rock tune " but then arrange it for a jazz band . Write the new age piano piece ( whatever that might mean ) and then score it for a chamber group or make it an underscoring for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then subject yourself to the rigor of serial music . This is one of the ( many ) things I admire in the music of Bjork . Her ability to recontextualize her tunes in various panoramas is , for me , one of the splendors of her sonic world . I agree with the sentiment heard here that these encounteres eventually strengthen ones " original " voice and along the way introduces you to methods of musical expression that you can use when they are the best choice for that expression . We do n't  ( usually ) use a saw to change a tire . In the end , as a composition teacher , I can only respond to the music brought to me by my students and reflect back to them how I experience their work . This always leads to questions that I hope focus the task at hand and support its continuation . <p> How exhilarating all of this is ! Why not expand it and open the discussion to all composers ? KG replies : Well , I yielded the floor . Expand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How do we get them here ? Leave a trail of bread crumbs from The Rest Is Noise ? <p> This has been an excellent and insightful exchange about concepts that , at least for me , have too often remained internal.As a longtime orchestral bassist , program annotator and occasional composer , I 've rarely come upon such honest candor about the compositional process . Bravi ! <p> I get the sense that your comment , " What I 'm not sure is practically helpful is trying to prepare them for the way a composers process changes with the years " is in some way a reaction to my statement about how I like to present many different ways of composing to students so they can learn not to rely on inspiration alone . The thing is , in my experience , the problem of not knowing what to do next is most certainly not limited to older or more experienced composers . I taught a classroom full of high school students a month or so ago , who were working on writing some simple little songs . Almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , except for the beginning . So I asked them how many of them sat down to write , started at the beginning , and then got stuck soon thereafter , and everyone but one student raised his/her hand . Then when I asked them how they eventually finished their songs well , some of them never did and gave me pages of unfinished sketch . Some of them said they just scribbled down anything to finish the project . And some of them said , " well , I just kind of repeated the part I had written until the song was over . " Only about 2 kids out of 25 had written complete songs that they were satisfied by . <p> So I think there 's a great use to teaching various techniques for approaching the blank page . Of course not every student will be helped by this , but not every composition student will be helped by anything , so the best we can do , I think , is to give them a huge array of knowledge and let the 50% ( or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about the rest . Again , I believe quite strongly that more knowledge can never hurt . Best-case scenario , theyll find their own way to understand and incorporate it into their thought processes ; worst-case scenario , theyll ignore it and resent me a little for making them learn it . And even then , chances are that something about it will sink in a few years down the road . <p> The issue of whether or not its possible to " teach composition " seems to be a contentious one . For what its worth , I feel that yes , you certainly can . Of course , there 's a component of being a composer that ca n't be taught ; the ever-elusive Inspiration and Creativity . But that 's the same in any field . To be a great chemist , you need the creative inspiration to come up with a brilliant experiment that 's timely and effective . Without that inspiration , you ca n't be more than a mediocre scientist . But that does n't  stop people from teaching chemistry , because all that knowledge enables ones creativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of composition teaching like acting teaching . Sure , there 's an element of acting that just involves having the right spark . And the public tends to assume that acting is all about talent and nothing else . But there are techniques to acting , and Ive never met a very successful actor who did n't  use them . You need to know how to analyze a script . You need to learn to follow every impulse without blocking . You need to understand that everything you say must be motivated by a specific goal , and that goal must be active rather than passive . You need to learn to never move a body part extraneously , but dedicate your entire body to the task at hand , which gives you stage presence . You need to understand the specific impluse behind each word you say . And so on <p> I think this is directly analogous to teaching composing ( and painting , and poetry writing , et cetera ) . There are many sets of skills , from the very practical ( orchestration , voice leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censoring yourself , learning to take risks ) . These are skills that make one a better composer , which is teaching composition . Sure , we cant teach an uncreative person to be creative . But I do n't  think there are entirely uncreative people . Some people just need the creativity teased out of them , need help not being embarrassed by it , need help trusting it . And in the end , some students who study composition wont be able to access their creativity , and wont become great composers , just as some students who study chemistry will still turn out to be bad chemists . <p> In the end , I just think its a big fallacy to mistake being inspired for being an effective composer . Many of the " you cant teach composition " arguments seem to be implicitly saying " because composition requires inspiration , you cant teach it . " But again , that 's like saying that because being a succesful chemist requires inspiration , we cant teach it . But no one ever questions chemistry teaching because its understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to know how to handle that inspiration if/when it strikes . <p> Once again , long , scattered comment . But I 'm just fascinated by this topic , and am enjoying all the discussion . Thanks for opening the floor ! KG replies : I was n't actually reacting to your statement at all , just talking off the top o my head . <p> To be a great chemist , you need the creative inspiration to come up with a brilliant experiment that 's timely and effective . Without that inspiration , you ca n't be more than a mediocre scientist . But that does n't  stop people from teaching chemistry , because all that knowledge enables ones creativity to come to the fore . Not to split hairs , but there 's a huge difference between the sciences and an artistic pursuit like music composition . Yes , one needs some inspiration when designing experiments , and sometimes even some creativity . But the vast majority of chemistry , physics , mathematics , etc. remains grounded in objective theory and evidence supporting the theory . Richard Feynman was both a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very separate and while he could appreciate the beauty within nature ( indeed , he was very eloquent about it ) , clearly maintained that physics and mathematics were more rational and fact-based . <p> Nothing about composition is fact-based . I was taught how to do differential equations and how to devise and perform experiments in molecular biology . I was never really taught how to compose , and I have no idea what that even means . The term " teaching composition " has zero meaning to me , whereas it is very clear how people can teach someone how to do scientific experiments . The insight for good science is not necessarily taught , since there has to be an innate skill and vision in that regard . But most science really is not so much creating something new as it is making an observation and trying to explain it . Composition is , by definition , creating something new . <p> Not to split hairs , but there 's a huge difference between the sciences and an artistic pursuit like music composition most science really is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation and trying to explain it . Composition is , by definition , creating something new . <p> Thanks for the very thoughtful response , David . Personally , I just do n't  think there 's as huge a difference as people tend to think between the arts and the sciences . Obviously , composition is more creatively-focused than chemistry , but they also have a great deal in common . I 'm just not sure I see the huge difference between studying differential equations to become a lab chemist , and studying ( for instance ) practical music theory to become a composer . Neither of those skills is directly applicable in the actual doing of the task at hand , but both of them provide a strong mental framework that allows the experiment/composition to go ahead more smoothly . One could have a great lab experiment without knowing differential equations ( like Alexander Fleming discovering penicillin on accident ) and a great piece of music without knowing music theory and other musical strategies . But it sure does help to have a base of know-how . <p> Also , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong element of the scientific method ( observation , hypothesis , experiment , results ) in composing . I observe that " Der Leiermann " from the end of Schuberts Winterreise moves me . I hypothesize that its the incredible stillness and repetition after so much tumult that creates a beautiful , somewhat creepy mood . In a future composition , I design a piece that ends using a similar tactic . And then I observe , in my mind , and perhaps in talking to an audience , whether that compositional strategy is effective in the way I want it to be . <p> I 'm making it sound a bit cold , perhaps , but I think this is a process we constantly use as composers . We hear things we like , we guess as to what 's so cool about them , and then we try to extrapolate ideas , lessons , and theories from them , which we later absorb into our own compositional technique . And in order for this to be more and more effective , we have to learn things . We learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to help construct our musical experiments . We learn strategies of approaching the blank page so our experiments do n't  stall . We learn to feel comfortable in lots of musical environments , so we can have a full range of " lab equipment " when we embark on a musical experiment . And so on <p> Of course , there are successful composers who do n't  have all this knowledge at hand . Heck , I do n't  think anyone really has all of it . And there are chemists who are n't  that good at figuring out reaction mechanisms and equations , but have great success in the lab . But all the knowledge you can get helps . A lot . And teachers help us acquire that knowledge . Whether we call it " teaching composition " or " teaching skills that help composers , " its the same thing , and a great thing , in my opinion . <p> Scott , you made my point for me exactly . One can teach theory and other mechanistic , common core subjects necessary but not sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to actually compose . Let me put it like thistheres a difference between learning how to write notes ( theory , counterpoint , etc ) and how to compose . At least in my uninformed opinion .

@@99219970 @3419970/ <h> How to talk and write about music <p> That 's what my Juilliard course this semester is about . And its what the course should be called , though this year we adopted a title that 's a hybrid of what the course used to be and what it is now : " Music Criticism : How to Talk About Music . " <p> Because for many years this was a course about music criticism . But then two things happened . First , fewer and fewer students seemed interested in criticism . I might guess that 's because they " like so many people under 40 " do n't  read newspapers , and thus do n't  encounter music reviews . But as my students this year have told me , it may also be because students , rightly or wrongly , do n't  have much respect for critics , and are n't  very interested in what they might say . ( A feeling magnified , of course , if you are n't  reading critics regularly . ) <p> And then the second thing that happened was Juilliards emphasis on entrepreneurship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows in the footsteps of other schools , which have had entrepreneurship programs for a while . - I 've on the committee which is planning Juilliards evolving program , and no wonder , then , that I thought my course should be part of it . <p> So I remade the course . I 've always emphasized talking about music , and we 've always spent a lot of time on that . I play music every week in class , and ask the students to describe it . Then we work to refine their descriptions , so that they 're true to what the students hear and feel , and also understandable to those who have n't heard the music . <p> This year , I 'm using music critics as examples of how to do that . Of course they 're writing , not talking , but the same principles apply . You just have more time to think how to apply them when you 're writing . <p> And I 've expanded the course to cover artists bios , press releases , program notes , and blogs . These all are important ways that music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well do , or have done for them . And should have opinions about ! That is , musicians should n't simply accept a bio that a manager or publicist writes for them . They should know what they want their bios to say . <p> Its clear how this is entrepreneurial . In an emerging classical music culture where people increasingly make their own careers , you need to take control of " well , your branding , how you 're presented to the world . This course deals with one part of that . <p> I gave a link earlier , which goes to the week by week class schedule , complete with links to all assignments . ( Except for a few I havent decided on - yet . ) You can also look at the course overview , to get a larger idea of what I 'm doing . I think its an important course . <p> Last year , when I talked about the criticism course ( as it was then ) , a number of people said theyd love to take it . So this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course online , in a format much like my branding workshops . Three 90-minute sessions for $200 , though I 'll need a critical mass of five or six people to sign up before I can begin . <p> Let me know if you 're interested ! Well read some top-class older music critics , George Bernard Shaw and Virgil Thomson , as well as some reviews I 'll choose from current writers . Well look at novelists who write about music in special , evocative ways . Well look at bios , press releases , and program notes . If anyone would like to write these things " or write reviews , or do any other kind of music-related writing " I 'll look at what you write ( and give extensive comments ) for an extra fee . <p> If we have time " I have n't mapped out the sessions yet " well look at blogs , and rock criticism , which is n't like classical criticism : the critics emerge in their writing as full personalities , and the writing talks about the meaning and effect of the music , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical details , <h> Related <h> Comments <p> Fine plan for your course , Greg Im doing " Writing about the Arts " at NYU this semester , along the same lines but multi-discipline criticism ( or entrepreneurial writing ) , obviously and Ive just lectured about bio writing for the New School Jazz program . You 're right that many students are not reading criticism , and the question then is how or if criticism will continue . And not just arts criticism , but critical thinking , a sceptical , inquisitive , probing approach . I hope you 'll speak to their interests , and stimulate their thinking . <p> Greg , I 've long waited for you to open up this course to us everymen ( and women ) online . I 'm very much looking forward to taking it . Consider me signed up , then ! I 'll send you an email to confirm . Thanks againLKY . <p> Thanks so much . Looking forward to your email .

@@99219973 @3419973/ <h> Talk to me about opera management <p> Each week ( usually on Fridays , but , on occasionMondays ) , I 'll post an interview with someone far more knowledgeable than myself on specific marketing and publicity subjects . This week , vocal manager Matthew Horner on the changing faces ( and bodies ) of opera and how important ( or not ) marketing materials are at the onset of a singers career . <p> Matthew A. Horner is Vice President and Artist Manager at IMG Artists , New York . Previously , he was an Artist Manager at Columbia Artist Management ( CAMI ) . He does frequent classes for singers at Yale University , The Curtis Institute and Bard College , among others . Matthew has also served as a judge for numerous vocal competitions including the McCammon Competition , the Palm Beach Opera Competition , the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions . <p> Quite a bit . The Mets increasing visibility in cinecasts and HD transmissions , on PBS and international television ( after several years of none of this ) has made it important for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists who are appealing and telegenic . The other houses both domestically and internationally are following their lead , so this will be a trend for some while to come . <p> Do you think the industry is moving toward hot-people-only , or will good singing always prevail over looks ? <p> I view it cyclically . One sees even in the accounts of the Met under Edward Johnson and Rudolf Bing that the public believed that certain singers were being hired more for their looks than for the vocal goods they posessed or did n't  . I think that there will be an increased desire in the future to hear great singing again . Certain operas rise and fall on having the requisite vocal chops , and no degree of theatrical energy or physical glamor can replace this . We will have the " hot " mentality for a period while cinecasts are still popular , but eventually one can only substitute so much before turning out a compromised artistic product . <p> Have we reached a point where marketing is so important that artistic directors will actually think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not their materials , theyll certainly consider looks and have for some time . The materials are important , but most casting directors can see through puffery rather easily and still need some degree of substantive output before casting anyone . <p> How often do people approach you for management ? <p> My colleagues and I get about a half dozen requests a week . I do n't  believe that anyone at IMG has ever taken on anyone who sent unsolicited materials . <p> What is the usual track for opera management ? What is the next step after participating in a young artist program , for example ? <p> Among American singers , its fairly common to find your manager while in a young artists program though some are already managed when they begin . The Met usually restricts their young artists from being managed for the first two years of the program . The " next step " depends largely on the individual . Some artists are ready to work right away after a program ; others still need further work on various things . Its not uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal roles . <p> How could an artist best market him or herself to a manager ? I realize a lot of it is referral , but what do you look for insofar as materials and " package " at the onset of a working relationship ? <p> Certainly at the top level of the profession referrals are critical . While we are always impressed by well-organized materials and elegant presentation , it does n't  replace talent for us . <p> Should aspiring opera singers be concerned about a lack of press ? Its hard to get press even for top singers . Should younger singers focus on reviews from small , local publications , or does press not matter as much at that point ? <p> Having reviews is always important . Anything like a feature , profile or interview is usually the purview of more established artists . We do n't  put an enormous amount of stock in tiny papers or local critics outside the major centers . <p> What are the benefits of being managed by a big company like IMG Artists versus a smaller agency ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one thing that jumps to mind is information flow . Because we are a large and international company , we have access to more information than most and can use this to our clients advantage . <p> Switching gears , how important have sponsorships become in the opera world ? Are all the top singers promoting some kind of product ? Are we moving toward product-placement in operas , or other such craziness ? <p> Its been around for some time , and there are a number of top stars who are associated with fashion , jewelery , cell phone companies and the like . Like it or not , the audience for opera will remain limited , and thus there will never be a huge amount of interest from the commercial world for singer endorsements . <p> Will there be a backlash against this where is the artistry when were worried about who 's promoting which watch or will the industry just keep on trucking in that direction , like basically every other industry ? <p> Again , it goes in cycles . There has always been some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was much more visible in the past . I think there is some backlash against it already within the business . <p> What do think is the most important thing to happen to opera in the past year ? <p> The Mets increased visibility has been very major and has " trickled down " to other companies as well . The companys national profile has really been helped by both cinecasts and the return to multiple telecasts on PBS . <p> What do you think is the most important thing a singer at any level can do to advance his or her career ? <h> Amanda Ameer <p> is a publicist who started First Chair Promotion in July 2007 .

@@99219978 @3419978/ <h> Four keys to the future <p> Here , as promised , are the key things we need to do , if were going to give classical music a future . When I wrote this , I was thinking of people who present classical performances . But I think it applies to all of us " for instance , to people who write about classical music , for whom the last point might be rejiggered as " write vividly . " <p> But enough introduction . here 's my manifesto : <p> We 're in a new era . To adapt to it , and build a new audience , here are four things you should do : <p> Understand and respect the culture outside classical music. - <p> Your new audience will come from the world outside classical music . Where else could it come from ? And to reach these new people , you of course have to know them . Who are they ? What kind of culture do they already have ? You have to respect them , because if you do n't  , they wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The people you want to reach may not yet care about classical music . So they wo n't respond to conventional PR and marketing . They wo n't come to you on their own . And so you have to actively go out and find them . You have to talk to them where they live , where they work , and where they go for entertainment and for inspiration . You have to inhabit their world . <p> Be yourself . <p> Your urgency , your joy , and your passion will draw people to you . But you ca n't be joyful if you do n't  love the music that you perform . So never pander . Never struggle to be relevant . Perform music that makes your heart sing . Trust your new audience . Trust it to be smart , to be curious , and to respond with joy when it sees how joyful you are . <p> Make music vividly . <p> The people you reach will want to love the music you bring them . But can you meet them halfway ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances should be entirely yours , performances nobody else could give . Your music should breathe . Contrasts should feel like they 're contrasts . Climaxes should feel like climaxes . Are you doing everything you can to bring your music alive ? <p> This is n't the tactical guide to building a new audience , that one commenter wanted to see . And which we all need ! But these four points , if you ask me , are the principles that should guide everything we do . If we do n't  apply them , the things we try may not work . <p> I especially like the point " Make music vividly " . I have long grasped for the words to describe this hugely important part of the equation while being respecting of my fellow musicians . Having attended Berlin Phil as well as Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra concerts , it was made abundantly clear to me that there was something beyond individual abilities of the musicians onstage . The right conductor makes a huge difference in sparking " vivid performing " but the Berlin Phil is great at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-esteem or even self-regard for groups to play their hearts out regardless of the externals of the moment . <p> So true , Andy , and wonderfully said . The Berlin and Bolivar orchestras most definitely play vividly . And you 've seen how the Berlin musicians move while they play ! Committing their bodies to the sound , phrasing , meaning of the music . Once , after a NY Berlin Phil performance , a friend who played in the NY Philharmonic came running up to me . " Did you see how they move ? " he said . " I 'd be reprimanded if I moved that way . " <p> Rock on , Greg ! So well said and simply put , and its well-tested . Those of us whove been living our art this way have reaped its benefits tenfold financially , yes , to a degree , but more importantly in social and artistic aspects . <p> Thanks , and great to see you here , Todd ! New music in NY " which you 're so central to " has emerged as a breath of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that I 'm living most of the time in DC . <p> And you know " all of us should start working on the financial part . No reason , as the audience grows , that musicians cant make more money . Which they richly deserve . And if they cant earn more , how will the future be sustainable ? This is something I 'd love to work on as a consultant . <p> You would be a terrific consultant , to soloist and to orchestras , and to more schools developing their young artists for the real world . Why do n't  you do residencies for say , a week at a time , host symposiums at the colleges , visit the orchestras and have public forums for the audiences to be part of what their orchestra is all about . <p> That 's what I 'm working towards ! Of course , Ive done some of these things already , but I 'm gearing up to do more . Thanks for the endorsement , please tell people that I 'm available , and let me know anyone you think I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like your points . It is about your audience , and what you can do to draw them to you , rather than the opposite . You know , in 1988 , and not to name drop here , but when I visited Lucille Ball in her home for a brief two hours , she asked this question : " How can you get close to your audience ? Ca n't you talk to them ? I never liked when there was a wall between the stage and the audience . Talk to them ; talk about the music , make them feel what you 're doing , who you are . " Never forgot these words . I suppose it still applies . Knowing your audience is most important . I like to give them the traditional , what they know and can relate to instantly , but , also something they do not know to spark something new inside . Many times , the presenter will feel this vibe and will make suggestions to the artist for repertoire , which is most helpful . <p> As I 've said many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus a waste of time . Why would you think a culture that does n't  care much about classical music would spend money when money is very short on classical music education ? <p> And also it wo n't do any good , wont reproduce the old classical music culture . Times have changed , and in the 50s and 60s , when classical music education was thriving in schools , kids turned against classical music , and embraced rock . <p> Music lovers are facinated by the creative process that composers go through . Preceding a special presentation of some of my music to about 200 people I explained some of the creative process and things to look for while listening to the works . I was amazed at how this seemed get their complete attention through the hour and a half of music . After the presentation I took questions from the audience , some of whom rarely listen to serious music . This was a very rewarding experience for me , and from their comments for them as well . No matter what the presentation however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listners . <p> Greg Sandow My perusal of Mr. Lorenzos post touches on my point about hubris , even if it is nearly unconscious . He wrote , " some of whom rarely listen to serious music . " What makes classical music more " serious " ? Is it because of its complexity ? Is complexity always better ? Many would argue that simplicity is often a positve quality in itself with regard to the arts . It is this subtle message of intellectual superiority which drives outsiders crazy . It is not that Mr. Lomenzo said an overtly horrible thing but it is begs to be taken as slight . The best thing I read in all of these posts is Mr. Lorenzoa last sentence , were he writes " the most important part is still how the music affects the listeners . " Nothing else really matters . Again , the best of luck in your project . <p> " Work actively to find your audience " This is a also a great point . At least as orchestral musicians , nobody stands to gain more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraising . To simply say " that 's the job of development department " as some colleagues often do , ignores the reality of our situation . New audiences can get loyal to musicians whom they know and like . <p> Great points , Greg ! ! Thank you for your thoughtfulness and persistent inquiry . Thank God there is work for us to do . The classical music field does not have to languish , nor lose hope . Thanks for your positive message ! <p> I agree with your points Greg , but part of the problem is that civic authorities ( predominantly ) have built concert halls and performing arts centres based on formal architectural concepts and practices rooted a long , long way back in the past . The performance venues themselves are very formal , implying a code of behaviour that often intimidates people from attending events in them . Because of the investment in these venues authorities wont want classical orchestras , ensembles and top name artists to perform elsewhere . Yes , orchestras often perform in wineries , parks and other outdoor venues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other types of venues which could be suitable outside summer seasons . Digital technology opens up lots of possibilities , but it will never replace live performances with non-assisted sound . Not better , just different . A subjective response on either side of the digital divide . Maybe we should see it as a glass half full with other performance possibilities opening up which are exciting and have their own positives . Traditional performance structures in traditional venues are just one of them . This way we can open up to other audiences for classical music . <p> I agree , Lesley . We have lots to do , but I see it as an opportunity , not a problem . Its also striking how much these traditional venues change when you do new things in them , or use them in new ways . But this is a time of change . One of the marvelous things right now is how many people/institutions are doing new things , blazing many paths toward our future . <p> The online discussions over the last couple of years about Jackie Evancho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacle to bringing new fans to classical music will be the undeniable hubris shown by so many of its supporters . This issue reduces to near irrelevance any problems with regard to architecture . There are a lot of bumper stickers and decals out there where the various music genres feign disgust for one anothers music but these have been good natured jabs compared to the flood of i 'll will heaped upon Jackie Evancho and her fans from the opera folks . So much of their communication was to make sure that those of the great unwashed clearly understood their musical and social place . They wo n't going react by going to the symhony or to an opera . Classical supporters badly need to show more generosity of spirit and open mindedness instead of grandly setting themselves apart . <p> Thank you , but Mr. Sanchon did n't  address the very real barrier for you of personal hubris . How do you overcome this ? And how did it develop in the first place ? I genuinely wish success for your efforts but I believe there needs to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of your fans and supporters . Actually this should also apply even more to the artists , the opera houses and symphony orchestras , the commentators , the conductors , various organizations , and everyone up the line who fostered so much snobbery . The hubris apparently trickled down from someone , somewhere . <p> as always , insightful and dead on . the last 2 points concern artistic integrity and should go without saying , i think , for any creative artist . ( although the reminder is helpful , especially because in our zeal to reach out to an audience we can try to second guess what they like rather than share what we love. ) how to do successfully achieve the 2nd point , of course , is the real 64,000 question , is n't it ? how to reach the new audience . i hope you will elaborate on that one . <p> the first point , though , familiarity with non classical music , has been at the heart of it for me. more and more i have been talking about the future of classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awareness of many different styles of music increases , especially in the younger generation who listen to so much more variety online than previous generations ever did , classical music has become not just the " other " but one of many " others " . and in that sense , i think it is much more easily entering peoples radars as part of the richness of all the music now easily available to listeners . its no longer pop vs classical , its a big melting pot in which many pure musical styles are morphing into hybrids very rapidly . it seems to me that the younger generation expects this to be the case and view any pure musical style as quaint and possibly delightful , but very 20th century . at the very least , the young audience is very used to hearing a piece in one style right next to another very different one , and see no more issue with that on a concert program than on their ipod in shuffle mode . this is a moment of huge opportunity for classical music to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that second point is crucial . And needs a lot of expansion . I 've said a lot about it here in the past , but will recap all of that at some point soon , and add more . For now , one thought : start by looking at who your fans are now . By name , if possible ! Who already goes to your performances , buys recordings , communicates with you ? And then think what you can do " over time " to keep these people involved . Youll have to communicate regularly . And get them , maybe , to interest their own networks in you . And then think about where you can find more people like your present fan base . <p> This is a start , anyway . About pop music , yes , yes , yes . Pop music creates stylistic hybrids constantly , and classical music has repeatedly been folded into the mix . Then , beyond pop music , I was thinking of the entire range of contemporary culture , which is much wider , richer , more surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we have an audience ready for much more than the classical mainstream is currently giving them . <p> Right on , Greg ! We are also living in a society which is more accepting of mixed stylesand it does n't  dumb down the classics at all . If anything , it enhances the classics when programmed appropriately . <p> Greg , your 4 points are strong and valid . I certainly do n't  think anyone could argue with the last two ; we all must strive , in our own ways , to express our commitment and passion in as palpably vivid a way as possible . I await with interest your expansion on the first two , more problematic areas- honest ways of finding , reaching out to and building your audience . I totally agree that conventional marketing techniques are ineffective and usually inappropriate . Conversely , I 'm not sure we should feel obligated to dramatically change or dumb down our true message just to suit the whims of the iPod generation , simply because they find other styles of music " quaint " or " very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This seems an impossible and fruitless burden to place on any artist ( especially those , like myself , who SPECIALIZE in music of the 20th C ! ! ! ) . To be always fashionable is to be always chasing fashion- not the real goal here , I think ? I would hope there is some fertile middle ground , where the deep substance of classical music-usually much deeper than popular music-can be celebrated , appreciated AND synthesized into the larger musical arena . Good luck with your trailblazing ! <p> No , we should n't dumb down at all . We should be smarter , more diverse , more challenging . here 's an irony " we do have to dumb things down for the mainstream classical audience , because they love hearing the same pieces over and over . I 'm not saying that 's dishonorable , or that they themselves are dumb . Far from it . But they have comparatively simple tastes . <p> A pop culture audience , on the other hand , is ready to be challenged . I 'll take for granted that were not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are millions upon millions of people whose taste is really robust . The existence " how many times have I said this ? " of people like Bjork , selling millions of records , proves this . And then consider tastes in fiction , film , art . Dive beneath the well-publicized top hits , and you find intelligence , diversity , challenge . Its a hallmark of culture today , far more than it was when I was growing up in the 50s and 60s . So if we aim classical music at the audience for terrific things in popular culture and the other arts , well do wonderfully well . Without dumbing down at all . Quite the opposite ! <p> It is laudable that you invest such profound thinking into the issues facing classical music today . <p> However , I have a few observations to make as regards your four points . <p> 1 . Many young instrumentalists understand contemporary " pop " culture quite well and do not hesitate to say so . Rachel Barton Pine , Nigel Kennedy and Gidon Kremer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedrich Gulda embraced pop culture in his compositions his cello concerto is the most famous example and Yusupovs Rock Tango Concerto for viola , performed by Yuri Bashmet are also good examples . You can also observe that , e.g. , the London SO does n't  do many cross-over concerts with rock stars . So do many other orchestras these days . <p> So how is the classical music society not aware of or disrespectful of culture outside of classical music ? It seems that they are , but it is by no means saving the industry . <p> 2 . It seems to me that most musicians today are reaching out at least through YouTube . Pub Concerts in London and the Red Fish in NYC are touted in the press , but only provide small audiences . Musicians are already playing in the metros of NYC , London and Paris for pocket change . <p> How can musicians find decent-sized audiences outside of established venues or YouTube ? You cant , after all , set up a pair of 400 watt loudspeakers in the middle of a residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it wo n't make you any money , at worst , you 'll get arrested . <p> 3 . I do n't  know ANY good musicians who are n't  " themselves " when they perform . The only " classical " musicians who pander are people like Vanessa Mae , Andrea Bocelli , Kathryn Jenkins and Andre Rieux . <p> It seems that the musicians who are profoundly engaged in their art are struggling ( unless they 're top stars of course ) , while those who pander to audiences are making millions . <p> 4 . Try telling the top 20 orchestras in the world that they are not making music vividly . Theyll ask " well what more are we supposed to do that we are n't  already doing ? " There are many wonderful ensembles today which make extremely vivid music , but they are all small , specialized ensembles like LArpeggiata , La Poeme Harmonique and the Kronos Quartet . <p> Chances of hearing them outside of a major town or music festival are minimal . How do other music ensembles perhaps slightly less talented ones , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only so many ways you can play a Haydn quartet : Either in black or wearing a powdered wig and period clothes . After that its just a matter of how well you play nothing new in that . Again , I dare say all good musicians are already trying to convey climaxes , contrasts and bring the music alive . How do you tell for example the Takacs Quartet to do it better than they are already ? <p> With all due respect to your expertise , I have a hard time seeing anything but wishful thinking in your four points . That , or they 're meant for musicians to take to Sedona , find a vortex and meditate until contact with a higher power inspires them to understand what it is you actually mean with your four keys to the future . <p> Eva , I 'd suggest using a little imagination to look beyond the world as you see it . <p> 1 . The examples you cite of classical musicians doing something with popular culture are nice , but very limited . More to the point might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any distinction ( except maybe in technique ) between classical music and pop . But the main point I 'd make is that you can go to most classical concerts " at , for instance , the top 20 orchestras ( to use your citation ) , or to anything the Takacs Quartet does , and not get a whiff of current culture . Current culture goes far beyond writing rock pieces for classical instruments , or ( like Kennedy ) playing Hendrix arrangements . The cultural outlook , outside the classical world , is so different from the ways classical music people think that there 's almost no overlap . You yourself , and the examples you give , pretty much prove that . I suggest you read Richard Floridas description of the nightlife of the people he calls the " creative class , " in his famous book , The Rise of the Creative Class . I 've assigned it in courses I teach , and put it online , at LONG ... Its hard to believe the people described there would ever be interested in going to classical concerts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to enter their world . Or you could read the cultural coverage in the NY Times or the Guardian " read it regularly , carefully , especially about visual art , pop music , fashion , books , and film , and try to put yourself in the lives of the people this coverage is written for . What do you think would attract them to the 20 top orchestras ? They 're used to culture that 's far smarter , far more diverse and original , and far more challenging . <p> 2 . How nice that you 've fantasized such tiny , limited ways to find a new audience . Have you looked either at my writing on this subject , or at the extensive coverage ( the NY Times business section does a good job ) of how marketing is done these days ? You might Google a Times piece some months ago on how the Hunger Games movie was marketed . There are techniques for reaching into the lives of people you want to reach , and making your enterprise part of those lives . You may laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , of course " but it gives a lot of practical ideas for how anyone , not just big Hollywood marketers , can do things you yourself have never dreamed of . My blog post on this ( in which I describe the Hunger Games marketing , and show how the Met Opera could do similar things ) is here : LONG ... <p> 3 . The pandering I was thinking of is something musicians worry about " very much , in my experience " when they think of finding a wider audience . Often they think they need to change what they do , to do what the audience will want . That 's why I advised musicians to be themselves . This is a discussion that 's been going on in your absence , Eva , but if you 'd been part of it , youd see how central my point can be . As for not knowing good musicians who do n't  think they 're being themselves , here 's a challenge to throw back to you : Are musicians really being themselves , or do they just think they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , that students there ( and at other conservatories I 've had close contact with , or taught at ) do n't  feel they 're encouraged to be themselves at all . There 's now , in fact , pretty widespread acknowledgment of that at music schools . More broadly , the concept of what being yourself might be is remarkably limited in classical music , compared to other arts , and to popular culture . And to classical musics own past ! I recommend an extensive immersion in videos of performances from past generations , to see what being yourself ( as a classical musician ) really can mean . One place to start is a 1946 feature film called Carnegie Hall , with performances by many greats of the time " Rubinstein , Ezio Pinza , Piatigorsky , many , many more . Or DVDs of some of the classical music telecasts from the 1950s . Audio recordings , too , will make this point . Listen , for instance , to a 1957 Ernani , performed live by Mario Del Monaco , Ettore Bastianini , and others , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casals , Cortot , and Thibaud . <p> 4 . The end of my last point blends into this one . The best performances in past generations were far more vivid , on the whole , than the best performances now . And why wouldnt I dare to criticize the Takacs Quartet ? Are they gods ? Does their fame mean they 're perfect ? Silly to think such things . For many years I was a music critic , and , Eva , this is what music critics do . Say what 's good and not good about performances . Musicians " I 'm one " do that , too . Constantly , yes ? I 've written extensively about this in the past . Try telling the top 20 orchestras that they do n't  play vividly ? I 've done that , in print and in person . ( Since I 've known many people from orchestras . ) An example Ive often used " to give one quick idea of how performances routinely are n't  vivid " would be most orchestras performances of music from the classical period . Constant alternations , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really hear the contrast ? Are fortes noticeably loud , and pianos noticeably soft ? Not in my experience . Not , of course , that I 'm exactly alone in finding too much routine " at a very high level , but still routine " in top tier classical performances . Just this week I watched the Immolation Scene from the Mets new Ring production , as streamed to movie theaters and then recorded to be sold on DVDs and shown on public TV . I have the DVDs . You could n't possibly tell me that Deborah Voigt was vivid . Forceful , yes , but vivid ? Her tone of voice never changed . So profound moments , like " Ruhe , du Gott , " barely stood out . They were sung in much the same way as everything else . Or the final pages she sings , as she rides into the pyre . Many sopranos , especially in the past , brought transcendent excitement to that . Here there 's not even a flicker . I 'm saying this , not particularly to slag Voigt or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for things that could be more vivid . You can just as well do it with the Takacs . I agree with you , by the way , that many of the most vivid performances these days come from early music groups . So let me ask you something . Do you think the 20 top orchestras listen to Fabio Biondi ( just for instance ) and ask themselves why they do n't  play with that kind of fire ? Maybe they do n't  critique their own playing enough , do n't  set high enough standards . <p> Excellent thoughts Greg . I think you will agree that these are " essential but not sufficient " for musicians and organisations seeing to save themselves . The principle ( my words ) that you should respect but not pander to the audience and potential audience is a difficult one for many musicians . I spent my career in consumer marketing where this rule was learned over and over again . The market is smart , it ca n't me manipulated , but nor can you succeed by just giving it what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks what if we offered audiences insanely great performances ? <p> What makes a classical performance vivid for me are clear feelings of direction , phrasing , tension and release ( T&amp;R ) , and landing points . The DRAMA of any music should hit the audience over the head with a WOW . The SHAPES , long build up and adventure of classical I find to be what distinguishes it from pop . I think pop and art ARE opposites , but DO coexist ( like yin-yang ) in surprising ways as I 've discovered in my own composing . <p> Classical artists are loath to think of ourselves as entertainers because we 've invested so much in the practice room to do this but if we admit that great art is also entertaining , why not go further occasionally to be more entertaining . Myself , Ive gone as far as I can go as an instrumentalist in a major orchestra . My body is losing strength . So now I focus on how far I can go as an " inspirationalist " . And that means more than playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BECAUSE it has no lyrics . My brain is just getting warmed up to warm up curious music lovers . <p> We would talk to a young audience much differently than we do to a traditional audience . We would n't jump up and down for classical in front of a traditional audience but we sure CAN for the younger audience and why NOT ? If you really love it effing SHOW IT ! SHOUT IT ! Answer obvious questions ( elephants in the room ) like : Why is it called CLASSICAL ? Why are the titles so lame ( quartet in C-major No. 5 ) ? How can we play together without a drummer ? Why this alternation between loud and soft ? Why do n't  we take requests ? <p> My thoughts on musical boundries and styles are : some say they love hybrids and music without boundries , while some profess to prefer music that DEFINES a style . In ALL things , offering a balance of BOTH let 's the beholder chose for themselves . I compose a bit of this and a bit of that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you 'll like . <p> My advice to young musicians is that they first focus on building chops , musicianship , teamwork and leadership skills . Its important to understand fully the potential TODAY for classical music . Yes , TAKE auditions and win a job to have a stable platform and resources to create a difference-making outreach enterprise . Freelancing can be a platform too , but auditioning makes us stronger ( if it does n't  kill us ) . We can do ALOT to share the music we love , if we love the people too . <p> Thanks , Linda . Good to hear from you ! Thanks for asking about our family . Rafas going to be a year old next month , and he s a fabulous little guy , with a smile that could light up a city . Were happy . Hard-working , and very happy . <p> Thank you for bringing attention , clarity and care to this topic . Personally , in a nutshell , I do n't  feel the majority of performers ( not that I know this definitively ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did they choose music ? How does it serve them ? What is their " goal " ( if you can call it that ) in performing for a group of people ? I feel that many performers in a sense , " USE " the audience for their own gratification . They seek validation , appreciation , recognition etc . How can a " relationship " like this survive ? We need to give back on a deeper level , in a much more meaningful way . To transcend our " self " , to be a purer conduit through which the music is communicated . <p> Hi , Paul . You bring up an important point . For what its worth , my experience with classical musicians " and especially music students " is that they 're quite humble about what they do , or many ( most ? ) of them are . In fact , too humble . Not willing enough to say ( see my response to Tracy Silverman ) they 're doing something of their own , something creative . <p> The reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians say they wish they got more response . Not because they 're looking for gratification , but because they want to know that someones there , that two-way communication is going on . <p> Hello Greg ! I really believe in what you are saying and live it out in ROCO ( River Oaks Chamber Orchestra ) , as you know . We just opened our season with Beer and Brass inside St. Arnold Brewery with our brass quintet . Our full chamber orchestra show opens in October . I think the culture that is instilled in us in conservatory says " play it right before it is musical . " We find it hard to cross over to assume you can play it right and just go for the musical . I give the orchestra a talk at the beginning of each concert run that says " this is a safe place where people are not waiting for you to mess up . Take the chances you want to take and go for that soft note or that super forte . If it cracks or splats , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances to give yourself the chills you had when you first experienced corporate performance ( group performance ) . " I think this allowing is the key to vivid performance : The space to find the zone because you trust yourself and your years of preparation and your colleagues around you . <p> Brava , brava , brava , Alecia ! ROCO is an inspiration , one of the most successful entrepreneurial projects in classical music . Alecia started an orchestra , a chamber orchestra in Houston . Built an independent audience of her own . Offered childcare at concerts . Made the musicians happy . And they play wonderfully . <p> When I read Alecias words to the musicians , I thought of my students , whove sometimes said that , as they moved from high school into conservatories and then to graduate studies at conservatories , they got more and more afraid of making mistakes . One mistake , some of them believe ( these are graduate students talking ) , and their careers are over . Much the same mindset hits when you get a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing what she can to set this right . <p> Delightfully insightful ! : ) To add to your remarks , it seems that we must offer safe and inviting entry points into the cultural experience , working to understand and accept all types . It also seems important to take the time to consider the perspective of those within your community , as well as those outside or new to the arts . With the Internet , it is becoming increasingly feasible to reach and share among a wider audience than ever before and building a base of fans and supporters will only be effective if the overall tone and personality are authentic and ring true to the person on the other end . One of the major concepts , as you outlined above , is fostering a love for the art ITSELF . People have to WANT to engage with your " product " and want to keep coming back for more . We must give audiences and cultural explorers a good reason to participate in and share the experience provide interesting , relevant , personalized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present , and future of classical music , and approaching programming and presentation with a willingness to adapt to modern society . <p> P.S. Happy to read the above comment about your family and wonderful son , Rafa . <p> Thanks , Catherine . So many good thoughts there . I might even suggest moving further , and not thinking of entry points . I 'd like to move behind the way I and others have been thinking for so long " that we have a project of bringing people to the arts . I 'd rather just say , " We have something great that others will love . And that we should promote it just the way anyone without a cultural agenda would promote something they believe in .

@@99219992 @3419992/ <h> Talk to me about promoting Pilates <p> On mostly Fridays , but sometimes Mondays , I 'll post an interview with someone who knows a lot more than yours truly about specific marketing and publicity topics . This week , my Pilates instructor Jeanette Palmer on keeping students coming back to her classes , on why yoga gets all the good press , and on teaching and marketing to different ability levels . The problem with doing this interview is , of course , that she now knows what I 'm thinking about when Im supposed to be " deepening " my " C-curve " . <p> Ballet-trained at the Boston Conservatory of Music , Jeanette Palmer enjoyed a successful career on the musical theatre stage , including Broadway , New York City Opera at Lincoln Center , and Radio City Music Hall . Overlapping her career as an actress/singer/dancer , she has accumulated over thirty years of teaching experience in the fields of movement , dance and fitness , and now teaches Pilates full time in New York City . Jeanette is on the adjunct faculty of the Graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Womens Swim Team at Columbia University , and conducts weekly Mat classes to the Metropolitan Montessori Schools faculty and staff.By special invitation from the Cirque du Soleil , Jeanette had the honor of guest teaching an afternoon of Pilates workshops to their " Quidam " company while they were in Philadelphia . As the Senior Assistant to the creator of LindaFit Pilates , she co-leads Pilates teacher-training certification programs four times a year in New York City . <p> How long have you been teaching Pilates ? <p> I first began teaching a " Pilates-based " exercise program , called IM=X Fitness Formula , eleven years ago . Some of the sequences are identical to traditional Pilates but some are different , variations on the theme . After about three or four years of teaching IM=X , I started integrating more of the traditional sequences and , gradually , phased out the IM=X c completely . Now , that 's where I am : I teach Pilates . <p> Which is more difficult to get students for : group classes or private sessions ? How do you market yourself differently for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is not an easy one to answer . In fact , its almost a " Trick " question , and here 's why : When I teach group classes , I work for someone else . I teach at a gym , a private school , a graduate school and , until recently , a dance studio . So , my group classes are promoted by the organization that hires me and , over the years , Ive seen a DIRECT correlation between marketing and class size . The Gym where I work is ALWAYS putting the word out about their facility and the classes offered . As a result , my classes there are ALWAYS packed ! The Graduate Center used to publish an extensive bulletin advertising their Continuing Ed classes , and my classes grew and grew to the point where we were turning people away . Then about two years ago , they stopped publishing the bulletin and we 've been scraping by ever since . New Dance Group , on the other hand , NEVER did any marketing and the classes remained TINY . ( BTW , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went out of business ! ) <p> Now , my Private Practice is another story all together . I have never done any advertising , what-so-ever . My entire private practice has come to me through word of mouth . The only thing Ive ever done that might be considered Marketing was to throw a " Client Appreciation Event " about five years into my practice . It was a lovely cocktail party . <p> One more thing on the subject of attracting private clients : When a potential client approaches me , they are almost always concerned about a previous injury or chronic condition . Or , they tell me that they have a very specific goal in mind . So , in our initial interview I explain to them how I will custom tailor the workout to fit their specific needs and goals . <p> How do you balance making group classes challenging enough to all ability levels so that students keep coming back to learn more , but manageable enough that students are n't  scared off and do n't  return ? <p> Practice , practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system that , if you do n't  mind me saying so , works perfectly . <p> Its a combination of things : <p> I let new-comers know that that they can rest at any point and that pain is a warning signal to STOP . <p> I set up EACH exercise so that EVERY student can execute the moves safely . <p> From there , as the students are performing the exercise I build on the basics and add challenging variations for the more experienced students . <p> Finally if demonstration is required for the beginners , I have my advanced students do the demonstrating so that they can keep moving and challenging themselves . <p> Similarly , how do you handle constructive criticism of individuals ? One day in a class I was in , you suggested a woman attempt a deeper position , and she argued back that she could n't ( and never had ) done that . You were very polite and said , " oh , well , I thought you had before " , but it occurred to me that when adults are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone can be awkward for the instructor . How do you deal with that ? <p> Well I do n't  think of it as " criticizing " my students . I think of it as giving them corrections . I think of it as " teaching " so , usually it does n't  feel awkward at all . To me it always feels like I am helping them and , in fact , sometimes it feels like I am saving their lives ! <p> Also , for the most part ( unless I am having a particularly bad day ) I feel LOVE for my students and have the utmost respect for them . So , whatever anyone can do , at any given point in time , is usually O.K. with me . Its all a process . <p> I feel like yoga is trendier or at least more widely-known than Pilates . How and why did that happen ? <p> Hmmmm . That 's a good question , and I 'm not entirely sure except to say that Yoga has been around for a LOT longer than Pilates . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was taught in private one-on-one sessions . So very few people either knew about it or could afford privates sessions . It was n't until VERY recently that Pilates was offered in a group class setting . <p> Do people ever come in and say , " I read about Pilates in X publication " ? If so , what are some of those publications . Dance magazines ? Yoga magazines ? <p> Yes , I suppose they DO say that , on occasion . Yes , now that I think of it , absolutely ! In fact , my students often cut the articles out and bring them to me. ( its quite sweet , actually ! ) But the publications mentioned have been more mainstream like Shape , Fitness , Cosmopolitan , the New York Times , the Washington Post , etc .. And more recently , of course , Pilates Style Magazine , which is a relatively new publication . <p> There are tons of anti-smoking commercials on TV . Anti-drugs , anti-drunk driving ; I even keep seeing commercials that are pro-corn syrup , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont kill you . You do n't  see physical fitness TV commercials , though , or very many print ads for fitness eithe r , beyond ads for private gyms . Are there not-for-profit pro-fitness service organizations in the US ? What about organizations that promote mind/body forms of fitness like yoga and Pilates ? <p> Another very interesting point ! I never even noticed the lack because , as a fitness professional , I receive so many professional trade publications . From where I stand , it seems that the word is not just out there , but " In your face " . Your question makes me realize , of course , that this is not true . <p> I 'm not up on all the organizations but one does come to mind : IDEA Health and Fitness Association . www.ideafit.com <p> Do you know if Pilates ( or yoga ) is ever taught in public schools ? Do you think it should be ? <p> Perhaps Yoga has made it into the public schools but , as far as I know , Pilates has is not , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would be beneficial for the BASICS to be taught in that arena . Maybe the best way would be to apply the Pilates Principles to allforms of exercise . <p> Are Pilates DVDs ( or podcasts ) more popular than group classes ? Are at-home DVDs sufficient , or do you think a teacher is necessary ? <p> Well I think the Idea the intention of working out at home with a DVD or Podcast is more popular than a group class . But in my experience , few people have the self discipline to stick to the routine or work themselves hard enough . <p> And I DO think that a teacher is necessary when one is first learning the technique . At home DVDs , etc are fine for the experienced practitioner . ( but even the pros should check in with a teacher from time-to-time . There 's no replacement for having a pair of eyes watching you , making minor adjustments to your form here and there ) <p> If you had to name one thing , what is it that keeps students coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicist who started First Chair Promotion in July 2007 .

Let 's start from that point . <p> Last fall , I was privileged to speak to the Private Art Dealers Association , which used to be made up largely of Old Master dealers , about getting more people interested in the art they sell . And language came up . <p> Apparently , some people today do n't  want to buy " Old " Masters . Have you noticed that- Christies , while still labeling its department " Old Masters , " has created a week called " Masters " week , dropping the old . And , when it existed , the spring fair at the Park Avenue Armory was called " Sping Masters , " no reference to the dreaded " old " word . <p> In the fall , some people suggested " historical art " or " traditional art .

Are we now dating art of the past by referencing todays art ? <p> " Since its earliest days , the museum has prioritized the acquisition of American art and , as a result , we have an exemplary collection of paintings , prints , drawings , and decorative arts from the 1600s to the present day , " said Jon L. Seydl , director of curatorial affairs and curator of European Art at WAM , in a statement . " However , many of these works have received less attention for research and exhibition in the last twenty years as the museum focused on presenting its colonial and 20th Century holdings . This crucial support from the Luce Foundation makes it possible for the museum , led by our curator of American art , Elizabeth Athens , to re-engage vigorously with many of these compelling works and explore new ways to present them to the public .

My own complaint with the term " pre-contemporary American art " is that by " contemporary . . . art " it means postmodernist or avant-garde work and implicitly equates , as you do , the terms " contemporary . . . art " and " todays art , " while ignoring the fact that Classical Realist or traditional art is also being made . . . today ( at the Florence Academy of Art , for example ) , and thus is also " contemporary art . " ( I develop this point further my recent essay " The Interminable Monopoly of the Avant-Garde .

But that is what has been happening in recent weeks for Icons of Modern Art : The Shchukin Collection at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris . I did it myself over Presidents weekend , andthanks to airfare and hotel sales , largely due to a drop in tourism in France attributed by many to terrorism fearsbelieve it was worth every penny I spent . <p> The Shchukin show is simply amazing . The highlight is a roomful of Matisse paintings , including The Red Room ( Harmony in Red ) . It faces a wall with The Pick Studio in the center , as seen here ( I got in as soon as the exhibition openedlater this room was much more crowded ) : <p> But there are so many surprises tooa tapestry work by- Edward Burne-Jones ; Picassos Portrait of Soler ; - a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon , a biplane and a dirigibl ; a wonderful Cezanne self-portrait ; many Picassos , and a great roomful of Gauguins . <p> Shchukin bought these works between 1898 and 1914the 130 at FLV , and another 145 or sofrom top dealers like Vollard , Durand-Ruel , Bernheim and Kahnweiler .

And that does n't  include the curators who spent their own money to go . <p> The one false move , for me , was an opening multi-screen video installation by Peter Greenaway and Saskia Boddeke that creates a conversation between Shchukin and Matisse , largely about his murals La Danse and Music , and gives minor roles to other artists .

Tell them you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . Tell them to take 10 minutes to write a love note or break up note ( depending upon your answer to #3 ) to your organization or a specific program , performance , etc . ( See #2 ) . Tell them to be very specific. - Once you 've received a batch of letters , go through and- find common threads. - Rank the themes in terms of importance to the customers. - Whenever possible provide feedback to the letter-writers . <h> Some helpful tips : <p> One path for a break up note would be to ask them to choose a one thing in your organization that they want to break up with any one thing . <p> Writing the letters could be a good exercise to have a group do in-person after an activity . If you provide some nifty cards , it could be something that you can proudly display . <p> The display could be on-going and could elicit even more notes/feedback . <p> The examples provided are great but they can lead folks to over think it . We are n't all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . <p> It could be fun way to engage your board . ( Maybe even with that first bullet . You might be surprised by their responses . ) <p> Make the review and analysis of the letters a team sport . Its always better to have more input and it will likely be a good morale boost . <h> Give it a try <p> Ask a handful of stakeholders to write love notes and/or break up notes . Give them a tight deadline to signal it should n't be onerous . Feel free to write your own love/break up note of your own .

@@99220035 @3420035/ <h> Learning To Cook : Frittata <p> Eggs , and recipes for eggs , are paradoxical . That should n't seem so at first . An egg will do a certain thing when placed near , or mixed with , another thing , and do that thing at a certain temperature for a certain amount of time . Which is what all ingredients do . <p> Now that the writer has gotten that out of his system , the cook removes half a dozen organic , free-range conundrums from the fridge and places them in a bowl to throw off the shock of the cold . <p> As I do so , and the weather warms as well , I think of Summer Cooking , Elizabeth Davids modest 1955 masterwork that Ive written about before . Its chapter " Eggs " offers about 25 recipes , many of which have taught me the way heat and half-minutes work their wiles on these liquid laboratories . Cream and egg in tandem sop up herb aroma . Bottom warmth clearly differs from that which surrounds . And when a hidden yolk reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can feel its limpness just begin to muscle up ? Stop ! Oeufs mollets . <p> She hates frittatas . In her elaborate , thumb-nose gift to postwar Britain , Italian Food , David writes that the countrys cooks " are particularly stubborn with regard to the cooking of omelettes , insist on frying them in oil , and use far too much of the filling , whether it is ham , cheese , onion , tomatoes , or spinach , in proportion to the number of eggs , and in consequence produce a leathery egg pudding rather than an omelette . " <p> Poor baby . And , in this rare case , wrong . She was n't willing or able to jump from her quivering French envelope to something else . I can hear my friend and neighbor Camilla laughing her Milanese head off . <h> Camilla Makes Frittatas <p> Camilla across the street is a character , and by that I mean a figure in any novel you 'd want to read or story you 'd want to tell and yes , something of a character in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her job , a film and video editor , for which shes been chosen as an Emmy finalist . But she appears here for one reason : the lukewarm , leftover frittata that sits on her kitchen counter . <p> " Have some ! " <p> Her voice does not allow refusal ; this is hospitality as demand . Its not a motherly offer , or motherly food : too sensuous and even sexy for that . Yes , Camilla cooks a sexy frittata , almost delicate in texture and flavor yet substantial , the very antidote to leather . Hers is studded with herb and the crispest vegetable she could buy or pluck from her backyard plot , ready for a dotted trail of oil and fling of salt . <p> Once , she pulled a pan ( the Danish Scanpan ) out of a drawer that she said works faultlessly on the stovetop ; she does n't  finish her frittata under a broiler . Camilla , as it happens , belongs to a local swimming group that is predominantly social and includes our villages renowned Isabella . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had been invited last year to Camillas place after their dip for a frittata lesson , performed in the manner , most likely , that her mother and two sisters in Piedmont also cook the dish . <p> For many reasons , I wish I had been there . Yet today , in a hurry , she told me a few of her tricks . The first is to invert the proportion of egg to vegetable : " They all have too much egg , and that 's what makes them tough . " So she uses 4 , not 6 , eggs in her 10-inch pan , and more of the other stuff . <p> " Also , I fry dry , " she added , making sure her spinach or leeks or onion have no extra moisture , which she said prevents the egg from browning properly at the end . I admitted that I sort of disagreed , but that may be because I finish mine in the oven . <p> She instead cooks frittata properly on the stove only by turning it over in the tradizionale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if I knew her particular " clock method " to keep the bottom from burning . I did not , so she groaned and graciously explained how she rotates her pan on the burner , 12 to 3 , 3 to 6 , 6 to 9 , for even cooking . <p> Of course , I listened carefully its hard not to listen to Camilla because her result is so appealing , and my own frittata is the development stage , slowly solidifying . Still , after more than a dozen attempts , its good enough to serve , so Ill share my frittata logic . <p> And Camilla has promised , promised ! that as soon as she returns from Italy , shell give me her favorite frittata recipe : onion , apple , sage . When she does , patient reader , you shall have it . <h> The Author Tries <p> The first frittata I ever ate was in La Jolla , California , when I was a graduate student in my early 20s . I have a cinematic memory of a new place on fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that turned them out fast , a sort of frittataria , but it also could have been the older C &amp; M ( Cresci and Mercurio ) Deli , which specialized in artichoke frittatas ( click and go to page A14 of the hoary La Jolla Light ) and made hot sandwiches out of them . As you can see , the C &amp; M recipe mixes parboiled , diced baby chokes , bread crumbs , garlic , onion , basil , parsley with the eggs , hand-forms the stiff stuff into patties and fries them in vegetable , not olive , oil . Does any reader remember either place , or both ? <p> Wow , were they good . The egg in those napkin demanders served as a classic binder , but one with different textures at the same time . <p> So this is my frittata thinking , which I admit is n't unusual . The goal is to make a round form that holds together as it moves from pan to plate . Inside and out should be solid , not runny , but also tender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a moist crumble in the process . It can be a shaped patty if you like , and you can fry it as C &amp; M did . The result will be oily and crunchy , but that 's not where my frittatas going . <p> I rarely use nonstick anything , but in this case a 10-inch nonstick frying pan does the trick ( mine is Calphalon ) . A few hours before you want to eat , take 6 eggs ( I hear Camilla groan ) out of the refrigerator and let them sit . Then , the creative question is , what shall this disk taste like ? <p> Sometimes I go to the farm stand or even our garden and get the just-picked thing : asparagus , yellow squash , spring onions . I have also been known to scrounge in the crisper : that half red pepper , a few orphan scallions , lonesome celery , dirty spinach . I almost always use finely chopped garlic and some potato , which can be any kind . Leftover pasta is welcome , too . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss cheese . Many things that call themselves frittatas , including a quite appealing impostor by elBulli chef Ferran Adri+ that replaces Spanish-style , thinly sliced potatoes with egg-soaked potato chips , exclude Parmesan or Pecorino Romano . But either or both ( or ricotta ) can be a happy addition . However , I do n't  like what melty cheeses do to frittata texture . <p> Grate a small chunk and mix half in early with the liquid egg , and assort the rest over the unset top before it goes under the broiler . Exclude the cheese if you have a midday yearning for one , maybe two , pure flavors . <h> Frittata 1.0 <p> Do you want a recipe ? I always do , so understanding that its an imaginative outline , you may start with this . I am vague on vegetable quantities because each can vary , but their cooked volume should at least match the eggs ( about 1 1/2 cups ) . <p> 6 eggs , not icy cold <p> a few tbsp. olive oil <p> a few small boiling potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red is pretty ) , diced <p> a few or more cloves of garlic , chopped fine <p> one vegetable , the freshest , the one you love , or whatever you have around , chopped bite-size <p> one or two fresh herbs , ripped or coarsely chopped <p> 1 cup or more grated Parmesan and/or Pecorino Romano <p> Youve read the steps already , so Ill try to be succinct . <p> Heat the pan to medium and add enough oil to thinly cover the surface when you swirl . Wait till the oil is hot . <p> Add a splash of chicken or vegetable broth , or water , stir , and let the liquid simmer down , cooking the potato . Itll take a few minutes . <p> Add black pepper or red-pepper flakes at any point , but be cautious ; you can add more as you eat . <p> Beat those eggs in a bowl with half the cheese . Beat , do n't  be omelette effete . You may now take the hot contents of the pan and scrape it into the bowl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the empty pan and let it heat . <p> Plop the mass back into the pan , turning the temp down a notch . Shake gently to settle the food if necessary . Do not stir . <p> Or you may do as I do and pour the cheesed eggs into the half-full pan off the heat and stir it up just once to mix ingredients , wait a minute , then reduce heat to low-medium , return the pan , and watch . If the cooking seems too fast , remove pan from the burner again until things calm down . <p> After 3 to 5 minutes , you will spy a solid yellow bottom showing itself through the jiggly raw top . You are allowed to get a spatula and check that the aforesaid bottom is beginning to brown . <p> If so , its time to sprinkle the rest of the cheese on the top and put the pan under the broiler : not too close , and the oven door should be open slightly . The term " broasted " has been used for 50s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs . Watch the top like a hawk , and when it begins to show its first tan pocks , grab a potholder easy to forget that ! to pull your meal out . <h> A Spanish Coda <p> When you feel comfortable about this play with eggs , you may enjoy a decidedly unmolecular gastronomical variation . But please make sure the chips this sounds odd are just out of the bag . <p> Pour the egg lava into an oil-slicked pan at medium heat and follow the frittata steps above . Remember : do n't  stir . <p> If underdone as you cut into it at the table , just put your package back in the oven . <p> Frittatas taste nothing like American breakfast , our ordinary blank and eggs . Beyond my dual pleasure in cooking and eating , I should mention the frittata moment that makes me happiest : when I found that I could slide the sizzler from pan to serving plate with no trouble whatsoever .

She may be a professor , the highest of high-brow professors , but she writes and speaks ( albeit with a British accent ) like an actual human . Enjoy . <p> Her talk begins : <p> In 1915 Charlotte Perkins Gilman published a funny but unsettling story called Herland . As the title hints , it 's a fantasy about a nation of women and women only that has existed for two thousand years in some remote , still unexplored part of the globe . A magnificent utopia : clean and tidy , collaborative , peaceful ( even the cats have stopped killing the birds ) , brilliantly organised in everything from its sustainable agriculture and delicious food to its social services and education . And it all depends on one miraculous innovation . At the very beginning of its history , the founding mothers had somehow perfected the technique of parthenogenesis .

@@99220064 @3420064/ <h> What " Composing the Music You Hear " Means <p> Since people seemed to like the subject of keeping the performer in mind while composing , its been on my mind , in response to a couple of comments , to hopefully blow apart a notion I regard as superficial and misleading : that the composer " writes what he hears . " Creative activity is virtually infinite in its forms , and I would never claim that no composer does this , but I think it must be fairly rare . Of course , in a sense I certainly do write the music I want to hear ( my ability to relisten to my own CDs verges on narcissism ) , and I do " hear " my music before I compose it ; but it often comes out sounding different than I expect , and I almost always end up rewriting it into something I never quite expected to hear . I 'd be disappointed if my music did n't  regularly surprise me . <p> Take this blog entry , for instance . I 've started it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about some mistaken notion I see myself in a position to correct . Its been running through my mind for a few days , and the mental form it always takes is that the initial , central idea always comes first , and other related ideas , or apropos phrases , group themselves around it in no particular order , like spokes around the hub of a wheel . Now I 've sat down to write , and all those disconnected ideas must arrange themselves in series , into coherent paragraphs . Some of them do n't  link logically . Transitional ideas must be grabbed out of the air . I struggle with introspection , because at this exact point in writing my initial idea has been stated , but the other eloquent phrases I 'm eager to use do n't  fit in yet . Very , very often I find , as I think any serious essayist must , that what I end up meaning as the essay takes shape is not exactly what I expected to say . I might possibly find myself contradicting the gist of this blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that the linear format of these paragraphs is not isomorphic to my obsessive musings of the past few days , and that I can not possibly simply throw the latter down on paper ( or screen ) as they exist in my head . The impetus is transformed by the process . In a sense I had something to say and I will have said it , but more accurately , I will have found out by the end of this essay what I think . Which is the value , for me personally , of writing a blog and would continue to be even were no one reading it . <p> Music is not language ( though- recent studies- are suggesting that it uses the same part of the brain h/t McLaren ) , and parallels between them are always tenuous . You might imagine , however , and correctly , that writing music and writing words have become particularly conflated in the lifestyle that has chosen me . In a sense Ive been better professionally trained to write words than music only because being edited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composing has increasingly borrowed reflexes from my writing . ( Theres&lt; a point I did n't expect to think of . ) Everything I 've said about my experience writing this blog entry applies to my composing , more or less depending on the piece . I always have an idea I want to get across , or an effect I want to create ; but most of the time ( not all ) , I find that the idea does n't get across , or the effect does n't happen , the first way I write it down . These little bits of nonlinear music that float through my brain do n't map onto the linear page without some organization . Ultimately , the piece goes where it wants to go , and I 'm smart enough to try and get out of the way . It is common to believe , I gather , that people think the material of music is simply sound , and that , being so incorporeal , music is the freest of the arts , that the composer can simply make something appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . The materials of music exert as much resistance back to the artist as clay does to the potter , paint and color to the painter , granite and steel to the sculptor , words and syntax to the poet - and even more so , I tentatively think , because the materials involved , at least in composing via notation for human performers , are heterogeneous in origin . It depends , I suppose , on how you define your materials , and this is how I define mine : <p> 1 . 12 pitches and their octave equivalents ( unless I 'm composing microtonally , in which case I gather pitches like a kid with a credit card in a toy store until I 'm a little freaked out by how many I have to carry home ; and in this case they tend to group themselves into clumps of associated pitches ) ; <p> 2 . Musical notation , which includes rhythm within all its humanly possible limitations ; <p> 3 . The instruments and the sounds they can make that I find attractive or acceptable ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponticello ) ; <p> 4 . Insofar as I can anticipate it , the trained psychology of my performers , which may vary in specificity depending on how well I know them . <p> Other composers will conceptualize their materials differently , depending on medium or performing abilities , but I expect that for virtually everyone its kind of an odd assortment or becomes so with experience . ( As several commenters have suggested , realizing pieces electronically changes the game entirely but even there , with my limited skills , the medium resists with a vengeance . ) I push all of these materials to do what I want , and I am accustomed to finding that they push back . I want to create effects that turn out to be inelegant or unwieldy or a pain for the performers , and in composing ( or , more strictly , revising ) I find how those effects can realize themselves within the materials Ive got . Everyone knows that Stockhausen asked Feldman what his " system " was , and Feldman replied : " I do n't  push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit ? " It becomes painfully obvious to me , in composing , when I 'm " pushing the notes around , " and I back off . <p> For instance , in the string quartet Im writing , there 's a lovely pandiatonic passage on the D-major scale . The section preceding it ends on an A7 chord , which I considered a nice link . But that preceding section was too complicated , difficult to play in rhythm , and with an unmemorable melody ; so I rewrote it , and its voice-leading led to a B7 chord . I tried transposing the D-major , and it just ruined the resonance of the cello . I was despondent for about ten minutes , but playing through it realized that the A7 to D sounded trite , and the B7 to D was not only charming , but expressed my overall , non-causal expressive intentions better . The notes seem to be smarter than me . Thank goodness the purpose of the piece is not to demonstrate to the world how smart its composer is ( which strikes me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another compromise I made : In the first movement of Desert Sonata , I have an isorhythmic passage ( in 41/16 meter ) in which the bass line runs through a repeating rhythmic cycle and a pitch cycle that go out of phase . Given my usual numerological inclinations , I would have had something like 17 notes in the rhythm and 19 in the pitch , so that theyd never come back in sync within the time framework of the piece . But the cognitive demands on the pianist would have been outrageous . Finally I settled for the non-mutually-prime numbers 15 against 18 , so that the whole pattern would repeat every five measures , and it sounds great not only easier to play , but easier for the listener to grasp what 's going on. - <p> Parenthetically , though it furthers the point , I find that some composers write more effectively for solo strings than I do because they can keep in mind what all the open strings are , to take advantage of them for double- and triple-stops . I just do n't  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed harmonies , and so to this extent I arrogantly fail by my own criterion . I 'm an emotion/intuition type , and not earthy at all . For the same reason I find classical guitar nearly impossible to write for . The physical material is too eccentric . ) <p> The point about keeping the performers is mind is that I have found that I ignore category no. 4 , performer psychology , at my peril . The first version of the " Moon " movement from my The Planets turned out to be impossible to play without a conductor , and since the rest of the piece does n't  require one , this was unacceptable . ( I actually strolled onstage to conduct " Moon " at its first performance , which I felt reflected something of a failure in my composing . ) One of the most difficult things about my music , which is hardly ever virtuosic , is that I try to create rhythmically free situations in which various performers have virtual downbeats in different places , often unrelated to the meter and especially to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wont feel like the piece is mine . But in this instance I rewrote the work with more frequent articulated downbeats , especially in the percussion , so that the players could keep track of where they were . It may seem like a compromise to some , but I was certainly happier with the performance as it turned out . <p> I doubt what I 'm saying is particularly controversial ( though I have given up trying to anticipate reactions ) . My colleague Joan Tower , who 's from a completely different side of the aesthetic tracks , likes to say , " When you 're composing you think you 're in control , but you 're not , " and other well-established composers have said similar things to me in conversation . They say the young Mozart conceived works all of a piece , and I suppose it sometimes happens . David Galensons book- Old Masters and Young Geniuses- suggests that planning a work out in advance is more typical of young artists , and experimenting to " find " the piece more typical of older ones , which accords with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the results did n't  always flow . I know a retired composer who says that he always hears music in his head , and when he starts composing he just writes it down ; but he has n't  had much of a career . <p> What makes the point worth stressing , I think , is that we are still emerging from a kind of collective macho mindset which overrated the untrammeled will of the composer . I have been strongly influenced by Pauline Oliveross famous 1984 article " The Contribution of Women Composers , " in which she drew a contrast between two types of creativity : <p> ( 1 ) active , purposive creativity , resulting from cognitive thought , deliberate acting upon or willful shaping of materials , and ( 2 ) receptive creativity , during which the artist is like a channel through which material flows and seems to shape itself . <p> Quoting both Mozart and Beethoven in support of the idea that we need both kinds , she goes on to say , <p> " Artists who are locked into the analytical mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to produce one-sided works of art . Certainly many of the totally determined , serial works of the post-war years seem to fit that category . " <p> The emphasis I bring to my composition students is that the piece is king , they are servants ; the needs of the piece they 're writing are more important than their own needs . " This piece wants something from you , " I 'm always telling them ; " what is it ? " And the disappointing response I usually get is , " Well , that 's just the way I want it , " which I consider a miserable failure as a rationale . Or else they 're giving the performers something that 's going to take tremendous trouble to play for very little or confusing effect . <p> A live-performed musical experience is something that it takes several intelligences to create , and the composer is only one of them . For me to ignore the way my performers will react to the notation , in order to effect some pre-ordained system of my own , would be as stupid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently water-colors act than oil paints . Those musicians are the clay I have to work with . The composer has something to learn from his or her own music just as everyone else does . And while we talk loosely about the composer " writing down the music he hears , " I think we do more justice to the complexity and reciprocal value of artistic experience by admitting that the composer is just as subject to his or her materials as anyone else . All praise to the composition but the composer should be humble . <h> Comments <p> Regarding " Music is not language ( though recent studies are suggesting that it uses the same part of the brain " well , yes and no . Like so much of musical perception and cognition , its complicated . Brain imaging studies and auditory cognition experiments have shown that some aspects of musical perception take place primarily in the left brain which also does linguistic processing and abstract reasoning . Specifically , tracking the roots of harmonic progressions : the left brain language centers light up when people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall shape of a melody ( as , for instance , when they hear a melody and try to figure out if its a recap of a melody they 've heard before ) , at that point the left brain goes dark on the fMRI and the right brain lights up with lots of activity . Now , the right brain is non-verbal holistic and intuitivein almost every way the opposite of the left brain hemisphere . Moreover , the right brain is responsible for emotional processing . And here 's where the real kicker comes in , because when we experience an emotional wallop from music , its always the right brain lighting up . So for most people ( non-musicians ) listening to music most of the time , its mainly the right brain hemisphere that 's active . But its even more complicated than that . Because the left brain hemisphere does process individiual notes in a melody if they stand out and you try to recognize em . For example , if you hear a melody that keeps rising chromatically toward the tonic , your left brain hemisphere will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific pitch and your cognitive processing changes when you pick out specific pitches amidst a melody . Moreover , musicians will typically show brain acitivity in both hemisphere for most music because we are used to performing the music and that usually means reading it from a page , which is a highly literate left-brain abstract logical activity . Also the specific mechanics of producing a pitch , whether by placing your hand on the string on a violin or by fingering notes on a piano , requies lots of left-brain logical reasoning . Everyone who plays piano has had the experience of having to working out fingering for a given passage that 's left-brain-oriented . So when musicians listen to music their left brain hemisphere is also active because they 're recreating in their minds the experience of playing the music , albeit half-unconsciously . ( I often have the experience when listening to piano music of figuring what fingering I 'd have to use to play various passages and if the passage is really virtuosic or requires hand-crossing it hits me with a particular jolt that non-musicians probably wo n't get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For non-musicians , as long you 're not hearing changing roots in chord progressions , most of what 's going on will be right brain intuitive holistic emotional cognitive acitivty taking place mainly in the right brain hemisphere . Unless the melody picks out specific notes as mentioned , or unless you get a chord progression with constantly changing roots . This left brain hemisphere vs right brain hemisphere stuff is enormously important because as Pauline Oliveros points out , the super-macho control-freak logic-ueber-alles mode of music-making is all left brain . It tends to disregard emotion , it disparages intuitive , its highly atomized and anti-holistic , and its a really intense form of power gaming that gets into an almost B&amp;D-style top-vs-bottom submissive/dominant mode of behavior . That 's high modernism . But the huge importance of what Pauline is talking about is that we have this whole other mode of being that most listeners ( non-musicians ) use most of the time when they listen to music . Namely , right brain holistic intuitive emotional cognition . The right brain hemisphere takes lots of melodic notes and reduces em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hologram takes individual rays of laser light and reduces it to a single image . Its a totally different mode of cognition from left-brain abstract logic thinking but equally valid and in its own domain , crucial and irreplaceable .

That 's not the only mode of valid cognition for dealing with music . <p> mclaren wrote : " Western music education emphasizes a Germanic left-brain control freak approach , especially at the postgraduate level in college .

Thanks for taking the time to write this entry , Mr. Gann.KG replies : Its pretty well documented . What McLaren says all seems backed up by what Ive read . <p> Nice post , Kyle ! Just to quote ( also borderline-narcistically ) a Facebook Status Update I posted a few days back : " Could the form of this piece STOP CHANGING FOR A MINUTE so that I can go compose it or what ? " I can only write my pieces when I know that every layer of it " fits " . I wont settle for anything that is less than perfect which does n't  mean all of my works are masterpieces , but at least they are complete thoughts . My subjective role I find is in a way very passive . Its simply making sure that the thought gets to be complete , and just wait , see how it develops , step out of the way , try to locate the obstacles to clarity and remove them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth immediate , rare , enormous , and perfect " , as Xenakis puts it . There 's something anti-humanistic about it : you depend on a structure that is still " out there " , not inside . I find this to give me a freedom in the truest sense . It liberates you from the usual expressive-subjective notions which are really a form of being enslaved to oneself . ( oh and re : writing with the performer in mind : I do believe that if your idea achieves clarity , difficult and strenuous passages can in fact be a useful part of it . Provided you understand that the difficulty and strenuousness are in fact part of the musical message and not simply forms of sloppiness . But if everybody can understand that what a performer is doing is really a feat , and the reason why it has to be difficult it clear , then performers may actually get to enjoy that kind of difficulty . ) KG replies : Amen . Certainly there 's nothing wrong with extreme difficulty , as long as you know what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good performers stay away from my music because there 's little overt virtuosity involved , but I do n't  really like the sound of virtuosity , just personally . <p> Re listening to your own music funny how that varies amongst composers . Some people never want to hear it once its done , others enjoy hearing it a lot . I enjoy playing my own music in a group you get to hear your own music many times , especially when its in a theatre or dance run . As long as it does n't  get to the burdensome level of Led Zeppelin having to play Stairway to Heaven at every single gig . <p> I can relate to that ! But I was n't really thinking virtuosity in particular ; there 's also the kind of superhuman concentration needed for , say , the Feldman 2nd quartet which is " virtuosity " of a different kind . Myself , I 've often written music with vast swathes of notes , but I 've somehow never quite thought of it as virtuoso in the Liszt way . For me , dense &amp; fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks a lot for this Kyle , you should give this post to all your composition students on day 1 ! The sculptor/clay anology is really helpful ( as indeed is the writing an essay one ) my neighbour asked me a few days ago do I hear tunes in my head and I found it hard to articulate a response this will help tremendously in future ! However I do also suspect as far as young composers are concerned it may well be part of the learning process to even understand that the musical clay has its own resistance , that the material does indeed speak back to you . Your definitions of material are also invaluable here in the past when I 've heard people talking about a composer must respect their material I 'm always thinking about a Brahmsian use of motivic development , but your much wider description of the material we must respect is far more valuable a concept to be aware of I think . Thanks again ! <p> I was thoroughly startled to read , in your second paragraph , an absolutely accurate description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you quote you profligately : " The impetus is transformed by the process . In a sense I had something to say and I will have said it , but more accurately , I will have found out by the end of this essay what I think . " Many thanks ! <p> GW asserts : I think this is not the case . Graduate schools in the USA are famous for the emphasis on Schenkerian and neo-Riemannian analysis which are both linear I feel there exist other perspectives in addition to the one you 've just stated . " The music curriculum at mostinstitutions of higher educationis based on a musical culture of which only remnants still exist , and has little relevance to music int he last half of the twentieth century . In short , our approach to teaching the history , theory , performance , and composition of music , at all levels , is reactionary and of little value to either liberal-arts students or young musicians with professional aspirations . " Appleton , Jon , " The College Music Curriculum Is In Pressing need of Reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pg . B2 . " The fact that our education system modeled the German one is hardly a new observation , but we should remember that these techniques of German scholarship had already sunk into the unconscious temperament of American education by the 1920s and 30s when the American Musicological Society , the National Association of Schools of Music , and many other professional organizations were formed . These atomistic techniques for knowing music provided the foundation for the standards these organizations would uphold ( or is it impose ? ) for the next sixty years . ( .. ) " As an example of the depth of German influence , consider the expatriate German musicologists whose work formed the nucleus of Nortons first efforts to provide comprehensive historical texts for graduate and undergraduate use , that is Manfred Bukofzer , Afred Einstein and Gustav Reese , whose works exemplify the standards discussed above . Even Grouts text bears their stamp ( .. ) " The German model clearly explains the last three hundred years of Western musical culture as the progression of tonality ( pardon the pun ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours finding unresolved dominant sevenths and reveling in the genius of Schubert and the late Romantics as they took modulation from dominant/subdominant through mediant/submediant and supertonic ending with Schoenberg who rejects much of the process . Then we searched for row inversion and retrogrades as symbols of our sleuthing powers as an indication that we were mastering the techniques of modern harmony The acceptance of the evolution of tonality and tonal form as the standard preference for musical development provided clearcut criteria against which to analyze new works and to compare them to their predecessors ( predominantly German ones ) . But the process also excluded works from those cultures choosing a different aesthetic approach . ( .. ) " The dominance of German models for excellence can be seen in the works which most students study . My experience is that most undergraduate history texts make no reference to Italian , French , or English composers of the eighteenth century other than Vivaldi , Rameau , or Purcell who can be so easily incorporated into the German model ( note Grouts first and second editions ) . Equally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded because they chose to explore new applications of tonality . Since the German model labels tonality ( post-1901 Schoenberg ) bankrupt and defines the future as serialism and other twelve-tone techniques , most other Europeans and Americans remain marginally a part of the theoretical development of music . Note that the title of Grouts last chapter is After Webern , attesting to the primacy of the German frame of reference . " Ridout , Roger , " The German Model in Music Curricula , " College Music Symposium Vol. 30-31 , 1990 , pp. 106-108 . The German model of music theory derives from logic and analysis it breaks music down into motifs and harmonies . You do n't  get far in a college music analysis course using intuition and hard-to-define holistic gestalts even though that might offer the best model for how a particular composition is actually experienced by listeners . ( Consider , by way of example , compositions like Luigi Nonos A Carlo Scarpa architetto , ai suoi infiniti possibili , Eliane Radigues Trilogie de la Morte , Larry Fasts Computer Music Experiments Vo1. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erosphere , or Iannis Xenakis Kraanerg . Notice also that a disproportionate number of these composers are French , not German . ) In the German model of musical analysis you do n't  get multiple different viewpoints of music history , you get a single line of musical " evolution " and that line is n't contingent , its teleological , leading ( supposedly ) inevitably from one stage in music history to the next . The German concept of musical form is n't ambiguous or hard to define ; its clear-cut . There 's a right way to analyze Germanic compositions from the Romantic period and every other way is wrong . The concept that a musical work might not prove amenable to formal analysis , or that there might exist many different equally valid perspectives for how a given composition works , or that a composition might not be best defined by its abstract structure , are all concepts alien to the German musical tradition , and consequently unthinkable in Euro-American college music education and Euro-American music criticism . Notice that the way GW phrases hi/r assertion involves the apotheosis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the case , " there are only two possible options , right or wrong . Female holistic inuitive emotional intelligence might have offered an objection like this : " I feel there are other possibilities ; many viewpoints coexist which may mutually illuminate the truth behind this issue " I suspect that this is how women feel when they get hammered with male power games claiming their statements are " not the case . " If the woman composer/musicologist uses linguistic verbal-mathematical reasoning to rebut the claim , she loses by default because she 's just gotten co-opted into the male power game ; and if she refuses to play the power game , she loses outright because she has failed to leap up and clash horns with the male composer who seems intent on playing the charging stag . If , instead of playing these kind of essentially male linguistic verbal-mathematical power games , we could explore the manifold possibilities of music , how would our Western musical world change ? Imagine if , instead of awarding one composer a prize and implicitly shunning all the rest as inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated them all , announcing , " All of you shine with difference kinds of excellences , and we cherish you all . " Imagine if , instead of reducing the great musical masterworks to motivic and harmonic atoms and surgically dismembering them by means of logic and math , we were to diagram great Western compositions by drawing graphs of their emotional intensity and their musical drama what sort of new knowledge would we discover about Western music ? Gann remarks : I would have thought analyzing how the right-brain aspects work was a pretty left-brain thing to do . This exemplifies the antinomy faced by anyone who proposes an alternative to the linguistic and mathematical-rational reasoning that vaunts itself as the only mode of cognition of any value in music , or , indeed , in Western culture . Catch-22 . In order to convince anyone of the importance of non-verbal intuitive modes of thinking , you have to present evidence and use logicbut the instant you do , presto ! Gotcha ! The critic immediately snickers " But I notice you 're using words and logic to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ! " So what 's the alternative ? Should I present an interpretive dance as rebuttal and upload it to YouTube ? If someone does that , then the acolyte of **31;142;TOOLONG reasoning can simply retort , " Obviously this interpretive dance video presents a silly irrelevancy and fails to refute our arguments . Therefore , since no logical argument contradicts our claim and no evidence refutes it , our claim for the supremacy of verbal logical left-brain reasoning must obviously be correct . " Damned if you do , damned if you do n't  . To escape this trap , we need to recognize that while we can not directly explore non-verbal intuitive holistic modes of reasoning by using words , we can nonetheless powerfully suggest them . Although words cant exactly specify the experience of non-verbal holistic thinking , they can limn its broad outlines quite vividly . Moreover , what were discussing here involves something profoundly real . Efforts to play word games that ensnare people with " gotchas " fall apart against the reality that non-verbal holistic intuitive reasoning forms an enormously important part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more efficiently by non-verbal intuitive holistic modes of thinking problems against which linguistic logical-mathematical reasoning often proves powerless . " Popular belief has it that science is the preserve of logical Mr. Spocks . A great scientific discovery must surely spring from a series of logical steps , each taken coolly and calmly , in rational order . But take some time to leaf through the pages of history and you will find the surprising truth . Some of the greatest discoveries in science were only made because logic fell by the wayside and some mysterious intuition came into play . " Chown , Marcus , " What 's Logic Got to Do With It ? " New Scientist , 27 July 1996 , pg . 40 . Moreover , the different modes of musical cognition are n't  as straightforward as left brain or right brain thinking . Although the right and left brain hemispheres do process music differently , its an oversimplification , because the right brain hemisphere does on occasion perform some linguistic functions , while the left brain hemisphere sometimes activates when dealing with holistic or non-verbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognition is more like " contemplative " versus " analytic " or " intuitive " versus " deductive . " It very hard to talk about this stuff in words because what were discussing is by definition a non-verbal mode of thinking that fails to fit into neat categories of Aristotelian logic . " Recent scientific evidence shows convincingly that the more patient , less deliberate modes of mind are particularly suited to making sense of situations that are intricate , shadowy , or ill defined . Deliberate thinkingworks well when the problem it is facing is easily conceptualized . ( .. ) But when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account , or even which questions to pose or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought we need recourse to the tortoise mind .

@@99220067 @3420067/ <h> WHAT MAKES A GREAT OPERA SINGER ? <p> In America today there is a strange anomaly : more and more young men and women studying to become opera singers and a decline in subscribers to opera companies . I specify subscribers even though single-ticket buyers are down , too , because opera companies live off of the committed subscriber . Though the recession is over , most companys bottom lines do not look healthy , yet the flood of singers graduating from universities and conservatories continues unabated. - I think there are more Americans seeking opera careers per capita than in any other country except Germany . <p> If so many of our young people are seeking to give us opera , what is wrong ? And what can be done to help ? I do not agree with those who say that the opera repertory is too stagnant , that the majority of people are not interested in opera , new or old . There may be some truth that the Millennial generation finds it impossible to concentrate on anything for longer than 52 minutes or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one problem that shouldnt now affect most ticket buyers who are generally older . In America opera companies spend a great deal of money educating the young , knowing that in their twenties and thirties when- men or women- are establishing careers and trying hard to find the money to educate their children , they have neither the money nor the time to buy opera tickets . But over the last half century- those who were educated as young people come back to opera in their forties and fifties . This is not happening as readily as before , and opera lovers therefore have a real problem . <p> Some may say it is a stultification of repertory , but I do n't  agree . Since opera began , some works disappear because they lose currency , others remain vital . Meyerbeer was the toast of Europe and America in the 1800s ; his work has rarely been performed since 1900 . When I was young , no opera had greater popularity or more repetitions everywhere than Aida . But the grand opera format with elaborate sets , ballet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . Audiences now look for opera as theater . Look at the explosion of interest in Handel who had virtually no American performances thirty or forty years ago . As recently as 1970 Charles Rosen , one of the most distinguished musicologists of the time , declared Handel operas much less successful than his oratorios . Today the frequency of Handel performance is so great that a singers- audition in which a Handel aria is not offered is rare . <p> I think the problem with audience comes in part from something James Levine said quite a while ago . He pointed out that the coaches who worked with Puccini , Verdi and Wagner are long dead . Even their grandchildren are gone so the contact with the composer and what he wanted is pretty much non-existent. - All through the letters and writing of Verdi , Wagner , and Puccini are comments about the need for singers to convey emotion , to express feelings , but opera today is too often coached and prepared by those to whom technique is valued over expression . The American singer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training stops . <p> Obviously one must have the notes , but- the most successful singers of the past who filled opera- houses involved their audiences emotionally in the way they sang . If a soprano can handle all the runs in Lucias Mad Scene brilliantly , if a tenor has the right legato for " Una furtiva lagrima " or a baritone the vocal power and accuracy for " Cortigiani " , they are deemed ready for the roles of Lucia , Nemorino , and Rigoletto . Did an audience censor Maria Callas for leaving out the first high E-flat in the Mad Scene ? Or Franco Corellis throwing in high notes because he could sing them ? Or Leonard Warrens varying the tempi and holding high notes longer than the score indicated ? <p> Another problem with correctness is who it excludes . My firm belief is that two of the greatest artists of the past century , Maria Callas and Leonie Rysanek , would find it hard today to find a job . Why ? Both of them , because they were so emotionally involved in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both could on some nights hit every note , and on others give downright painful performances . <p> Rysanek once said to- me that she had never succeeded in Tosca the way she wanted to because in Act II she always got too carried away and had too little to give in Act III . I also remember nights when her pitch went crazy in that very opera . But did anyone care ? No , because even if she was not hitting every note on the noseand this was certainly the case with Callasshe was pouring her whole personality , her whole soul into what she was doing , and the audience lived the drama with her . When Rysanek finished her long aria in Elektra and she pounded the stage as though she would die of frustration , the audience loved it . She brought home to everyone what it meant to live with an evil mother , her consort , and her crazy sister . Would anyone do that today ? <p> I have dwelt on two sopranos but there were singers in every voice range who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ears and eyes and made them come back for more . Recently Lorraine Hunt Lieberson could certainly do this as could Carol Vaness and Tatiana Troyanos. - Male- artists- usually- do n't  vary quite so much , but certainly Placido Domingo and Jon Vickers- packed houses wherever they sang- as much because they were- dramatically thrilling- and individual- as that they were great singers. - - And I can not complete such a list without mentioning- Franco Corelli , whose fidelity to the text or the production might- have been- questionable but whose vocal and physical personality- sold out every seat- in any house in the world . <p> Opera is first , last , and always an emotional art form , and today we are not getting nearly as much personal emotion from those who are creating the art as we should . I see this as more of a problem for those who are presenting opera than for the artists . Too often the singer who is just correct , who can always keep the curtain up , is praised while the more emotional , variable singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera performance never fails to be chancy ; the human voice is always at risk . But those who play for the biggest stakes keep opera thrilling and involving . <p> Hear , hear ! Well into the mid-20th century singers who knew the language and times of the composer intimatelywho might have known the composer intimately ! inhabited our opera stages and poured their hearts into their performances . Now , with our focus on technique , we get a " mediocrity of perfection " . What is necessary is to bring the sense of immediacy of the opera experience backby creatiing opera productions that speak to audiences , both novice and veteran ; by fostering the skills in young singers to carry opera forward ( and believe me , many of those skills are being overlooked in conservatories and music schools ) ; and by ensuring the singers and audiences understand every word that is being sung . Bravo ! when this works . <p> Its the same with instrumentalists : Most are indistinguishable and interchangeable . No risks , no thrill , no drama . Gone are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huberman or Gy+rgy Cziffra where each note was a unique personal statement . <p> I may not be a subscriber to the opera , but I have enjoyed a range of opera from the traditionally classic to contemporary , many times in my life . <p> This article is spot on in my opinion and reflects very well what we currently try to achieve at Hallmark of Harmony , one of the best barbershop choruses in the UK , whilst the musical leadership also spend a great deal of time on vocal technique as well as on how we articulate the words , how we shape our mouths to deliver them , as well as , essentially , engaging our minds with the emotional content of a song . <p> There are singers today who can transmit that emotional thrill . Rene Pape , as GurnemanzI did not hear this in the theater , but even via my car speakers , I paid attention and , for the first time , saw the point of the Act 3 narration . Kelly Kaduce is a singer who has more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are so right in your comment about the emotional commitment and expression of great singers of the past and that this is an essential element that made them great . Todays singers are so often interchangeable and unrecognizable in the sense of them not having a recognizable vocal profile . <p> On the other hand , it is quite amazing to see , as you have also commented , that the numbers of graduates from music conservatories around the world seems to be growing exponentially . When I hear that a competition such as " Neue Stimmen " has over 5000 applications and that Brian Dickie listens to well over 1000 of these candidates in person in order to chose just 40 candidates to compete in G++tersloh , Germany . What are these young singers all to do ? <p> Your article highlights an interesting observation less emotional understanding in singing with more volume of singers with good " voices " . The development of a greater functional understanding of the mechanics of the voice has been intellectually stimulating and , in the hands of a few good teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lager volume of real singing super stars in the modern opera world . I am beginning to become aware of a rumbling counter movementa move in some sections of the singing fraternity towards more interest in the teaching of meaning . Let 's hope this continues ! It is important to encourage all our singers to feel the meaning and colour of words not just the voice ! Thank you for your contribution towards the debate . <p> Wonderful insights , yet one point that I strongly feel which was left out " regie theater " when a directors vision is more important than the score , the singers , and even the composer ! Callas would never have performed many of the contemporary productions we see today on the stages of major opera houses . Eva Marton , in my opinion , was one of the last great opera personalities who was larger-than-life on the stage and created that unique " out-of-body " experience when one feels part of the action on stage , not just a spectator in the auditorium . Most of her legendary performances were traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter Morris , Joyce DiDonato , Eric Owens , Sondra Radvanovsky , all of them USA born and bred The list goes on . And among younger singers as well : ones I know who have trained in the USA include Jonathan Blalock , Maya Lahyani , Claudia Chapa Lucia di Lammermoor that we had in Opera in Williamsburg ( VA ) with Haeran Hong , Won Whi Choi , Suchan Kim , and Branch Fields was deeply emotionally compelling . <p> Anybody who aims for a career as an opera singer is passionate about it it is certainly not an easy way to build a career or a life . It is a tribute to the power of opera as an art form that so many talented people are drawn to it . In the best singers , after years of disciplined study , this passion combines with technical mastery ( which Callas and Rysanek certainly had ) to create breathtaking performances . So was the case in the past , and such is the case today . It is up to us to support venues where such outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the term " correctness " is the key to this puzzle . Current singers may be well-trained in some respects , but the " business " of opera ( agents , directors , PR people , record executives and even the audiences to a degree ) has evolved to a critical point where individuality is much less valued than , say , 30-50 years ago . Sound reproduction ( radio , recordings , DVDs ) has become so advanced that every little glitch in a singers performance can be heard . In the past , as you have pointed out , great singing transcended the minor blemishes ( even some major ones : Sutherlands terrible diction , Rysaneks wayward pitch , Domingos short top , etc. ) usually due to the overall impact of the unique , individual personalities of the singers and their approach to communication through music . These days , there seems to be great interest in personal beauty , but much less interest in unique expression . Corelli , Callas , Kraus , Gruberova , Sills , Gobbi , and many others knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes the results were imperfect . There are fewer and fewer singers willing and able to take such vocal and interpretive risks , lest they step outside the bounds of " correctness " . The result : a rather more generic art form , increasingly devoid of the mercurial stars badly needed to buoy its popularity . <p> THANK YOU ! As a performer and teacher , I say to students all the time that the " business " does not support individuality , on stage or in the recording studio . Also , I believe we go at auditions in a completely backwards fashion . " Scouts " should be out at university and regional productions , seeing performers in action in a real hall on a real stage , where they are able to show their full chops . <p> I think , as Mr.Jenkins himself said- its more that the companies are not taking the risks . They are quicker to hire a safe singer who sings with a solid technique than one who might display some moments of inconsistency vocally but will give you an emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain a discipline that will enable the art .

No music in schools . no audiences later More band programs , more musicals . Hockey is good , band is better .. Those that do n't  make it as professional players make an appreciative audience . Its a rare phenomena to see a 70 year old playing hockey but he can sure dazzle us on the keyboard or violin . <p> " There may be some truth that the Millennial generation finds it impossible to concentrate on anything for longer than 52 minutes or what constitutes the length of most TV programs " <p> As someone who will hit the big 5-0 next year , I 'm beginning to sympathize with the " teenagers are annoying , dress funny , and their music stinks " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one .

Trust me , their attention span is fine and generally outlasts their parents there is no truth to the above claim whatsoever . <p> This is exactly what I 'm talking about . Most of the movies targeting the millennial generation push three hours in length if not more . Every Marvel movie and Lord of the Rings epic has long running times . Time to ditch the attention span blame game as an explanation . This is a marketing problem , and the fact that we do not have opera stars to rally around that produce the performances worthy of chatter is one of the big branding issues . Many productions are either too safe overall or overblown in the wrong places . Opera is comedy , sex , murder , violence , everything you see on TV and in movies today . Houses that rework the marketing formula to the contemporary American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old money will continue to decline . <p> Your comment is very interesting . I am well aware of the capacity of people in their thirties and forties , as well as teenagers and twenty-year-olds sitting in one chair and playing a game for hours . So why have I heard from people in the thirty and forty age group that our operas are too long , that I should abbreviate them ? Since I never hear that from older opera attendees , I attribute it to the inability of watching something that takes concentration for longer than a TV show . Maybe this is because when they are playing a game , they are in action ; when they are attending an opera , they are watching and listening , not in action . Of course you point out that many can watch television for long hours ; I can only argue that the stories on television are never very long ; they change quickly and are often broken up by advertisements . In opera one must focus on the same story for a longer period of time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with charismatic artists onstage who have both voice and the ability to act , we can overcome the problem . <p> Or it could just be that the seats are uncomfortable . I love attending live opera , but , being tall and wide , I find it difficult to appreciate the music when the seats are so narrow my knees are scraping the seat in front of me . <p> Given the choice between paying upwards of $100 per ticket for seats that feel like implements of torture or staying home on my nice , comfy couch and watching an opera on DVDwell , I know which one I 'd pick . <p> I agree with Speight Jenkins response to your comment , Janis , and I would add that I strongly disagree with your emphatic assertion that " their attention span is fine " . While it may appear that Millenials watch hours of uninterrupted television , I have a hunch that you refer to long strings of episodic material that do n't  require much concentration on plot ( or anything , for that matter ) . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are also on their electronic devices tweeting , texting , whatever throughout perhaps also eating , drinking , taking phone calls , etc . In other words , the collected stimuli add up to something very different than sitting quietly in the operahouse ( no noise , no texting , no interruptions ) which seems nearly impossible for the younger generations to endure . <p> You have written a truly important article . I have been in the opera world for over 43 years now . I agree totally with you . " Opera is first , last , and always an emotional art form , and today we are not getting nearly as much personal emotion from those who are creating the art as we should . I see this as more of a problem for those who are presenting opera than for the artists . " The great artists of the past knew this and were excluded from the " modern opera world " . I was friends with Licia Albanese from 1975 till her passing away in August 2015. ( 40 years ) Her knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her generation was ignored by the powers to be at the Met and in other opera houses around the world . They were not needed . I am very happy that I started my own opera company , Opera Classica Europa , without help from anyone and our attendence is at an all time high . Opera is exciting when singers are set free to display their understanding of the great operas written by Verdi or Puccini or all other great composers . <p> When Callas or Rysanek missed a note or wrecked an aria , they did n't  have to worry about everyone in the audience going home to put their impressions on Facebook . I 'm sure that singers today must be extremely aware that every false step and gargled note , every ill-fitting wig or unattractive costume , is going to be commented on or posted in a blog for everyone to see . Many commenters are merely out to show off their mastery of the snarky putdown . And of course nothing in the digital world can be forgotten . It is n't surprising that young performers go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Speight . The central point about emotion coupled with the Levine comment about the coaches that worked with great composers is incredibly valid . <p> Back when I started and before I " made it " I was sent to Italy to study with Campanini in Naples and was also fortunate enough to be coached by Roberto Benaglio in Milan and to work early on with Gianadrea Gavazzeni and Carlo Maria Giulini . They may not have been connected directly to Verdi and Puccini but they all had learned from people who were . Sir Georg Solti had learned much from Toscanini who played cello in the orchestra at La Scala while Verdi sat in on the rehearsals for his new opera Otello . All these people had much to pass on to young singers like me . Our role models were Callas , Tebaldi and Sutherland . <p> I was struck by Rysaneks comment to Speight about Tosca . It seems today that there is serious lack of TRUE spinto singers . Now whether this down to lack of training or , as I think , lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure those voices are being born but i know it took me 14 years of ongoing study to develop my spinto and as I got older and experienced some challenges , the types of teachers that might have been able to help simply did not exist or if they did , I could n't find them . <p> Today , a great singer is snapped up by every house , jets across the globe , sings as much as possible and generally does not experience a full term career . The idea of being married to one house , serving its public and the odd leisurely international tour , pre the jet age , is gone . I think the long term development of great voices went with it . <p> The passion of a great Puccini role or the line , colour and depth of a great Verdi heroine were enhanced by the greatness of the other singers who joined you on stage . I sang with people like Siepi , Cappucilli , Bruson , Taddei , Zancanaro , Domingo , Carreras , Pavarotti , Cosutta , Cossotto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of them perfect except that they were just perfect ( if you know what I mean ) . <p> Rosalind Plowright is exactly the type of artist of whom I was writing . I remember her Medea in London that was the most remarkable performance of the role I had experienced since Callas , and the excellent Klytemnestra she sang at Seattle Opera . What I want to do more than anything is to encourage young singers , who often are of the highest quality , to spend the time not just to sing well but to sing with emotion and meaning . If only they can be taught that rushing from one engagement to the next with no time for relaxation or thought is not a good idea , and that every new role takes time to mature in their voices and their minds , opera audiences would pay them back more than they can believe . <p> What makes a Great Opera Singer has nothing to do with voice . An opera star is no different than any other kind of star . What makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not themselves . Beverly was n't even particularly irreplaceable vocally . But she was Beverly . Stars demand fees and are not replaceable . Opera houses ( and Broadway houses ) can not afford fees and can not afford for attendance to depend on the audiences affection for individuals , who cancel , get sick , get old . They must have consistency . They are trains that must run on time . And so they invest in the interchangeable . And the interchangeable is what they now offer . Why cant opera hold the audiences attention span ? They are n't  offering anything that would . <p> I agree with your fine article . There are a few factors that I feel really have impacted ticket sales and certainly subscriptions . I will try to make this as concise as possible . I started going to the opera at the age of 5 in the early 80s . I had the interest , but had the productions been as they are now , my mother simply would not have taken me . I am not a moralist nor am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have split political parties to two extremes , we still have Victorian basic morals . We have parents of all walks of life struggling to keep control of what their children are exposed to because of the internet etc . That very few parents are going to invest in season tickets if they can not bring their young people or even teenagers or even grandma . I stopped buying season tickets about ten years ago because I used to take some of my elderly friends and nieces to the opera , and I got tired of having to call the opera house before each opera to ask if there was nudity , or overt sexual content . I wo n't waste time here telling you of some of the stage directions etc . Youve then got the elderly opera goers who are literally dying off and the ones who have n't will try financially and physically to come , but only if it is what they expect ! Dying of TB on stage and a courtesan is as about as much as they can handle , and only if it is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowed who has made enough money to finally start going to the opera because it is an upper class social event . They have never really been to an opera , not studied the libretto and do not know what to expect , so the opera company is telling them " this is the bible truth " . And they accept it . I do not however expect that we do moth eaten old productions of Butterfly every year , the points Callas made were really about staging and artistry . Her complaints about " The old Lucia , the old Traviata etc " were that they were archaic sets and mismatched costumes dating back to the 20s and 30s . She wanted new life in newly staged productions . I never saw her in modern dress . I am sorry that many young singers in order to work have to lend their talent to these unattractive and frequently salacious productions . How can they become fine individual artists if they are put in such unattractive packaging and presented to the public . Young singers who are striving to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the voice , sometimes with Wagner they make an exception out of necessity . If we had had to rely on he physical beauty of our favourite and greatist singers in the world , past and many present , we might never had heard them and opera certainly would not have come into the 20th century . I have a really clever idea for opera companies and directors . Take the original score , read it ! Do what the composer asks , find voices that can sing it well , get a talented set designer and you will find you have sold out subscriptions ! Treat the material like it was hot off the press and that will make it fresh . Not cheap theatrics to appeal only to limited audiences who 's only taste is in their mouths ! This is in no way directed towards Mr. Jenkins . It is a generalization of a few of the serious problems affecting the modern opera world . Pace ! <p> The excellent transformation of live operas to the screen : in movie theaters , on television , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many ways . People who ca n't afford to attend operas live are able to see the best and less best singers in the world on screen . I attend all of the performances of Live From the Met . Out of a feeling of duty and curiosity , I also go to the productions of our local opera , with which I sang for many years . They are mostly disappointing ( vocally/musically rather than dramatically ) , and if I was n't invited by a music critic who sits in the front rows , I probably would n't be willing to shell out the $100+ for a ticket . Many young people are inspired by opera on YouTube , etc. which may explain the jump in aspiring opera singers as opposed to opera house attendance . They see much more opera at home than at the opera house . <p> The recording and screening of live opera also exposes the singers technical lapses for posterity . When recordings are made of operas with many takes and lots of electronic manipulations , we can buy almost perfect CDs . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once passing moments to be forgotten and forgiven . Now millions can hear them over and over again . Opera singers can also no longer get away with the kind of grimaces and physical mannerisms they once used to produce big sounds . On stage they could get away with them ; on screen the public wont accept them . <p> But filming of opera has made good acting an important priority of an opera singers education . Acting in film is different then acting on stage . I remember the first time I saw Pavarotti live . I was in the balcony and pretty much watched a fat tenor singing in a very static position on stage , wiping his sweat a lot with his handkerchief . My opera glasses were not much of a help . But when I saw him on the screen , I was able to see the facial expression which expressed every word and feeling of the text and music . I was blown over . <p> Whereas acting in traditional opera was often overblown in order to reach the audience over the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in the movies as opposed to the theater ) . I believe that this is also the reason that many lyric voices are singing dramatic and spinto roles today . On screen they do n't  need to amplify the way they do on stage . Its as though singers are trying to juggle two related but different arts : stage and screen . As a result , secret microphones often help amplify the voices in many large opera houses . <p> Opera has somehow become a more " intimate " art . This also explains the rise of Baroque operas , which require smaller orchestras and not such big voices . Whereas Opera Seria was once static and boring , it can now be spruced up with all kinds of visual and technical effects . It has become more interesting to the public . <p> Mr. Jenkins , I agree totally that opera singers have to be trained to portray emotion vocally as well as facially and bodily . I believe that emotional involvement comes on top of their basic vocal technique and requires experience and technical freedom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I disagree that expressive singing is not being taught and encouraged by todays teachers and coaches .

" <p> Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an audience it must contain some element of entertainment by which I mean something to hold an audiences attention . A work of art that is so on-point relevant and hard-hitting that it commands attention is a terrific ideal but impractical for day-to-day operations of organizations that present/produce works of art on a regular basis . In your words , " just entertainment , " I hear the kind of disdain with which art snobs describe " lesser " or " commercial " endeavors . Clearly there is art that soars far above entertainment and we relish it ! To embrace a responsibility to entertain is not a denial of the desire to be visionary , provocative or profound but of some recognition that even at that great height , there must exist something for an audience to enjoy . <p> As an artist of over 30 years experience at reasonably high levels in Australia I can only say that your sentimental analogy and " list " makes me ill .

A script that tells artists what will be accepted , tolerated , and funded . " Make entertaining art or you are fired ! " <p> Art has never worked that way . Art evolves , changes , grows , develops not from the arts administrator down but from the artist up . We call the shots . We do n't  need your type of neoliberal advocacy . <p> It is revealing that Richard and Scott both chimed in to suggest that the audience focus of your essay was in some way a problem . Not wrong , necessarily , but lacking . They are both artists , after all , and when someone talks about art and leaves the artist hung out to dry its a real question what was missing . How can we talk about art and NOT consider what artists themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and NOT talk about what motivates artists or WHY artists make art in the first place ? <p> Are artists simply pawns in a larger game , or are they sometimes forced to play a game despite their own intentions ? Do they have different motivations that are NOT aligned with serving the public ? Is there a conflict between what art does in the public and why there is any art at all to begin with ? Why do we make art ? Why is there art ? <p> A big question is this : Is art extrinsically motivated or is it intrinsically motivated ? If extrinsic , then serving the ends of public goods may be all that matters . Art is a means , of entertainment etc . We can dispense with the artists own eccentric ideals and , perhaps , even the artists themselves . An artificial intelligence calibrated to public goods might be the art we prefer . Do we even need human artists ? If machines made art would that satisfy us better ? If serving the public were all that mattered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions it seems artists are the unspoken and neglected factor in art . By treating art as extrinsic artists themselves are forgotten . They are the humans we DO NT want to acknowledge . They are separate from the human public . We talk about art as being what art does FOR the public . Which is like talking about food as simply what it does for the people eating . You have a Hamburger and the point is that someone gets to eat it . But what of the cow that died to give us that burger ? What were its dreams and intentions ? <p> We think of art like we think of food : The consumer needs take exclusive precedence . The burger is simply what we consume . And art becomes more about consumption than who did what to get it to your table . Artists are like the cow that gets sacrificed for our meal . And until we respect artists and what their own motivations are we will continue sacrificing them to feed an insatiable appetite of the consumer . Is this right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most artists . STOP BEING A MINDLESS CONSUMER ! If art matters to the public can it matter any less to the artists who devote their lives to producing it ? To not even consider artists in the equation is inexcusable . <p> Why would artists support a public vision for art when they end up so inevitably and casually roasted over the fire ? There are all these impressive claims for the value of art to the public , and yet artists themselves are devalued . They are removed from the point of view . Hidden under the rug . You want your art , but you do n't  want the artists who made it . You do n't  care about the artists , you care about the art . <p> Artists are treated like servants in a big house . " Do your job and do n't  interfere . Do n't  do anything to get noticed , but make sure the toilets are cleaned and the clothes are washed . " Results are all that matter . Some people want artists to be unseen , merely inconvenient necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how the sausage gets made ?

When you say " To embrace a responsibility to entertain is not a denial of the desire to be visionary , provocative or profound " but of some recognition that even at that great height , there must exist something for an audience to enjoy " you are confusing the cart and the horse . A responsibility to entertain ? Oh My God !

@@99220111 @3420111/ <p> My colleagues among the London critics are divided by Ivo van Hove 's new National Theatre production of Hedda Gabler , in an un-gimmicky , plain new version by Patrick Marber " except that they all agree in their high praise of Ruth Wilson 's performance in the title role . In fact , the cast is uniformly excellent , but this is Hedda 's show . <p> When I first read Hedda Gabler at school , I 'm sure I did n't get it at all , and thought Ibsen 's 1891 heroine was meant to be a philosophical egoist like Howard Roark in Ayn Rand 's The Fountainhead ( my own late-adolescent obsession ) . Now that I 'm senior enough to have seen a good many productions , I think that my juvenile musings might have had a tiny grain of sense in them . At least , that reading shields the character from the accusation of being evil ( as claims her academic husband , Tesler , played with a full-on American accent by Kyle Soller ) ; perverse ( as the blackmailing Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an unbearable tease ( as her ex- , Lovborg , played with a gorgeous Byronic profile by Chukwudi Iwuji , implies ) ; or as a control freak who has lost all power ( as Ruth Wilson 's Hedda says explicitly ) . <p> To this catalogue of flaws too gross to be tragic , we have to add that of the title of Olivia Laing 's NT programme essay , Nasty Women , ' of whom Hedda is one of literature 's prime examples . Laing rates her as repulsive , ' petty , ' a drawing-room nihilist , a post-punk princess , ' too ravenous and angular for the world in which she finds herself . ' But I wonder if Ivo van Hove is not , as well , thinking of Coleridge 's view of Iago as an unmotivated evil character " - more like Melville 's Claggart than like Flaubert 's Emma Bovary ? What explains Hedda leading " forcing " Lovborg to suicide with her father 's second pistol ? She says her concern is that Lovborg 's suicide should be beautiful . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as an aesthetic act ? What 's more , Hedda bullies Lovborg into killing himself . To say Hedda is amoral is a lunatic understatement . <p> Ruth Wilson 's Hedda is definitely the spoiled child of privilege , and this wilfulness complements her upbringing perfectly . Is her privileging of the aesthetic over the ethical a reflection of her father 's aristocratic position ? Perhaps . <p> The puzzle is that Hedda seems to be engaged with momentous philosophical issues without having been educated . In fact , there 's little evidence in the play that she is capable of thinking much at all , let alone deeply . - She feels , rather than thinks . Most of what she feels is suffering . But why should we care ? Apart from her physical beauty , what can we find attractive or sympathetic about this ( literally ) vicious character ? <p> Okay , we know Ibsen generally thought men bore a lot of blame for women turning out this way ; but despite what at least one silly critic has said about this production , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all women , or on gender . It 's a portrait of one individual , particular woman , which is exactly why Ruth Wilson is so good : she presents us with a full , if warped human being ; not a very intelligible person ( we 're still stumped , as we 're meant to be , by her intentions ) ; and very much not a nice or agreeable member of our species . This Hedda is a horror : the modern dress and the songs " Joni Mitchell 's Blue ' and Jeff Buckley covering Leonard Cohen 's Hallelujah ' " make it a bit easier for our contemporary sensibilities not to think all the abnormal pathology we are witnessing is either a case study , or confined entirely to Hedda . Judge Brack is a snake ; and poor Lovborg a recovering addict , whom it is all too easy to goad into drinking again . Is the Marber/van Hove production definitive , then ? <p> I looked up my last review of a production of Hedda , the Old Vic 's 2012 version by Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was interesting , but I now think wrong .

Everyone deals with these problems , actually , even the top professional groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choruses manage , in spite of the competing obligations in their lives , to deliver the musical goods admirably well . <p> So I 'd like to suggest a fourth option for chorus directors who feel they 're at a crossroads and spend too much time in rehearsals haranguing their singers : <p> Suck it up , smile and work to the best of your abilities with the happy , talented amateurs that you 've got standing in front of you . <p> Another option could be hiring a singing teacher to come in for one or two sessions at the beginning of the season to give some group warmups and pedagogy . These sessions should be mandatory for all members , and agreed to when they sign up . When the chorus understands the mechanics of how to produce good tone , breathe correctly , and standardize the vowels* , they will feel an uplift of self confidence because they then can better meet the artistic demands of the conductor . <p> * Im a big fan of setting a communal standard for the " ah " ( as in Ave Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowel that if you ask a room of 20 people to sing " ah " you will see 20 different facial positions and 20 different sounds . A conductor who gets the " ah " lined up properly will get better results overall . <p> I think that Ms. Ivanoff is correct , especially where an " ah " vowel is concerned , but I will take it one step further : does the CONDUCTOR know how to sing ? Or does he/she just have an idea of how they want to piece to sound as a end product ? If the conductor does not know something of the actualy mechanics of singing ( you 'd be surprised how many do n't  know where the diaphragm is located or what it IS ! ) , how can he/she expect to get a choir to sing ? I think that the conductor should take a few provate lessons as well . <p> Well , there are two different dynamics at work hereon the one hand , no , amateur musicians can not be expected to achieve at the speed and level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often have a sort of " ceiling " of how close to the conductors ideal its going to get . ( And lemme tell youpros have intonation and blend problems too ! ) <p> On the other hand , I do n't  think its too much for a conductor to ask that if a member is going to commit to the season , or the year , or the concert series , or whatever , that they FOLLOW THROUGH on their commitment , attend the rehearsals they agreed to attend , be on time , and be as fully mentally present as they are able at each one . When you agree to be part of something , you 've created an expectation not just on the part of the leader but on the part of everyone else in the room who 's made the same commitment , and when you fail to follow through on that mutual contract you are in effect saying , to the conductor and to your fellow choristers , that you do not respect them enough to keep your word . ( Obviously , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting called at the last minute and " gosh Im wiped out , I do n't  think I 'll go to choir tonight . " ) <p> Without a solid and reliable body of folks who actually show up to experience the unified " ah " vowel or whatever the conductor is working on , there can be no success . And the members themselves wont have fun or succeednot just the ones who were there , but the ones who missed will know they are way behind , have much more tension and anxiety in their voices and spirits , and no one has fun . <p> I also find that when the expectations are laid out in the beginning of the season , laid out as above but with maybe a little more nuance and kindness in the phrasing , people generally do live up to them . Or they thoughtfully decide that maybe this is not the month to do this , and could they perhaps rejoin after the April concert when tax season is overVolunteer musicians can still be treated like grownups .

Hmm <p> Perhaps a better idea is for the the " conductor " to videotape herself during the rehearsal , and then view the tape with her regular conducting teacher , and incorporate that method into her regular conducting lessons , which any amateur conductor would clearly be taking on a weekly basis , just like any amateur musician . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for either a new conducting teacher , or a new profession for the " conductor " .

@@99220119 @3420119/ <h> Indy Decides to Outsource Exhibition Decisions <p> For the last few years , the Indianapolis Museum of Art has , it seems to me , been on a crazy trajectory . As soon as it does something smart , it turns around and undermines itself . Now it seems to be hitting a new low . - Not content to anger its local constituency in 2014-15- by attempting to charge $18 in admissions to enter its grounds and restricting entry to one point ( leading to charges that the museum was becoming " a fortress " ) , - the IMA is now attempting to assuageand presumably pleasethe crowds in a way that should anger the museum profession . <p> The museum is using a public web-based survey to decide what exhibitions to present , thus turning over its curatorial expertise and prerogative to the public .

So I did . And that 's the first fault with this online survey . Are all answers valid ? How do they know if I was honest or not ? How do they know if I live in the Indy area ? <p> But the survey itself was offensive . It listed and described , in three or four sentences and with a few illustrations , six exhibitions and asked " Based on the description above , how likely would you be to visit the IMA to view this exhibition ?

Will that mean no more real art at Indy ? <p> I am equally concerned with the ethics and the implications of this outsourcing its curatorial duties . Why would a curator want to work at IMA ? Shouldnt curators believe that they can , with their specialized knowledge and research , make their subject compelling to the public ? Shouldnt the director make choices among curatorial options ? Isnt that what he or she is paid for ? Should that pay drop if such decisions are outsourced ? Are three or four sentences , plus a few pictures , enough for the public to weigh in on whether they would attend ? <p> Maybe a robot could be tasked with these decisions , <p> Venable did n't  say what the IMA would do with the results of this unrepresentative survey . It also asked questions about ethnicity , income , ages of children in the respondent household , whether the respondent would take their to the museum for each exhibit , etc. - Maybe its a foil to ask those questions ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copycats , please ! This is a bad idea , even if the results are ignored . <h> Comments <p> This is an awfully blustery response about a potentially legitimate concern . Cultural institutions of all kinds often do marketing surveys to gauge public interest in potential offerings their curatorial and artistic staff are considering . Despite Venables poorly worded FB post , the public is not going to " determine " what the IMA exhibits , any more than you or I get to determine what any cultural institution or corporation offers us . <p> I 'm currently on an informal national review panel for a national magazine that monthly sends an email with potential titles for the same articles and ask me to indicate which one I fin most appealing . I highly doubt the top vote getter determines what appears in the magazine , but I am sure that the responses are considered by the editorial team in drafting their final language or perhaps changing an article title that they thought was the sure winner , but respondents overwhelmingly said they would ignore . <p> A more thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what is the appropriate calibration in the social media era between public input and feedback and artistic decision-making , a program topic at conventions of many arts programmers and producers . How can communications staff leverage curatorial expertise about a planned exhibition with audience insight into their potential interest in a way that crafts the most compelling marketing campaign ? I am no fan of the IMAs change in admission philosophy and the change to its campus , but your harsh reaction to a simple marketing outreach effort might suggest a bit of unconscious bias on your own part . <p> Thanks for your commentbut I take issue with your equating of a panel , presumably of chosen people , reviewing potential headlines with an unnamed , uncontrolled ( even for location ) public online survey reviewing 3 to 4-sentence descriptions of an exhibition . As for " bias , " I have both praised and panned both IMA and Venable in the pastso I do n't  think I can be accused of bias , except against ill-conceived " outreach " efforts that imho damage the credibility of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked by masterful communication . However , I was intrigued by some of the proposals in the survey , and I disagree that robotics and cars ca n't be " real art . " I 've seen some clever , beautiful and even breathtaking examples of digital , 3D-printed and even , yes , mechanical pieces of sculpture , imagery and environmental art . I 'm going to have to agree with Harolds comments as well about the necessity for a more nuanced dialogue . There 's got to be a way that cultural organizations can balance the views of traditionalists who are the backbone of their support with the more social-savvy and crowdsourcing-friendly younger demos . Note : I 've criticized the IMA for its tone-deafness to general public perception , so I 'm not unhappy that they 're trying a survey to drive more audience engagement in non traditional ways . <p> What an elitist thing to say about " the more social-savvy and crowdsourcing-friendly younger demos . " I reject the idea that this group is less interested in tradition art or methods . In fact , a survey a few years back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry I do not still have the citation . <p> I agree with Mr. Walkers assessment of your blustery response to the IMAs survey , but think your bias lies not against the IMA but with the notion of gathering input from outside the curatorial center of the museum . Museums are moving forward from this old model , realizing that strict adherence to the top-down approach has left many visitors with a big question mark over their heads and not in a way that drives them to find out more about what they experience in a museum . Carrying on in the same way they always have is going to leave museums with only a few aged white visitors , promenading in proper curator-approved fashion from label to label . <p> With this post , I in no way implied that museums should carry on in the same way they always have . But there are smart and meaningful ways to change and , I think , useless and ( yes ) dumb ways to do itas at IMA . See my post today on the Royal Academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smarter way . <p> Dear Judith : I am grateful to everyone who has shared their passion for museums and the IMA and who , like I do , care so deeply about excellence in museum practice . <p> I wanted to take a moment to clarify a few points related to your recent blog post on the IMA 's exhibition survey . We agree that curators are a central part of the exhibition development process " their expertise and talent is invaluable . The exhibitions in the survey have all been proposed by our curators or curators at other institutions . <p> I also agree that attendance should not be the only metric used to determine exhibitions , and it is not in this case . Surveys like this provide additional data and context to the curators to inform their work and the work of our talented interpretation team . For instance , our recent exhibition , Gustave Baumann , German Craftsman " American Artist , scored low on this survey several years ago , but we still executed it since our curator , Marty Krause , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the artist 's prints and woodcuts . We learned from the survey the types of guests this exhibition would attract and the interests of those guests . Specifically , we learned that guests expected to learn a great deal about the artist 's life and his process . This information informed our interpretation materials , such as the inclusion of a full-scale printmaking workshop inside the exhibition where guests could participate in making woodblock prints . In the end , our Baumann exhibition was a great success . <p> This type of survey is something we have done for several years andas others have noted is part of a growing trend industry wide to increase our understanding of visitors . At this year 's American Association of Museums Annual Meeting there is an entire track devoted to Audience Research and Evaluation . We are members of the professional network dedicated to enhancing learning experiences through research and evaluation , the Visitor Studies Association . <p> Dear Charles , many thanks for taking time to respond to my post . We certainly agree on some things . However , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already explained in my post . Your mention of " this type of survey " as something IMA has done for years does not excuse the short descriptions and lack of control , or knowledge , about respondents . Mention of the AAM session does not clarify or justify that point either . <p> While of course I expected that curators would still curate these exhibitions , according to a story in the Indianapolis Business Journal that followed my post , " only two or three of the specific exhibits polled in the survey . " Thus the point of the survey seems to be not just tinkering with the marketing or interpretation , but rather the choice of what exhibitions are funded and scheduled . <p> The fact that audience research is a growing trend is a bit of a red herringI do n't  oppose audience research , but rather sometimes the way it is done and the use to which it is put . <p> The notion that Charles Venable values the " expertise and talent " of curators is laughable . You asked why a curator would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  . Many have fled to other institutions and their curatorial responsibilities have either been spread among the few who remain ( regardless of their expertise ) or " outsourced " along with exhibition decision-making . 25396 @qwx885396 25406 @qwx885406 25397 @qwx885397 25407 @qwx885407 <h> Archives <p> Archives 25398 @qwx885398 25405 @qwx885405

I appealed of course , and a few days later the banners had been removed and the threats of takedown rescinded. - But . The claims of copyright violation were repeated for every concert and for almost every piece of every concert , necessitating the same annoying appeal process . <p> Of course what had happened was that Google uses- a content bot that compared the music of every stream and upload to a copyright database , and automatically sent violation notices to every " offender " it detected . This is what can happen when we let machines police content , and okay , the algorithm needed some tweaking , but in the meantime , the burden of proving our rights had shifted to us rather than someone making a specific violation claim . <p> Then there is the case of- photographer Carol Highsmith , who had donated all her photographs to the Library of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getty Images demanding $120 for her use of one of her own pictures .

Their bots do n't know the ins and outs of how their images were acquired : All they do is relentlessly sweep the Web looking for watermarks , or however else they are trained to recognize proprietary imagery . The bots send an alert to a legal department , which sends out a standard letter . They are sending letters all day , every day .

But with the advent of recorded sound and the growing professionalization of music-making in the late 19th and 20th centuries , people largely moved away from singing themselves to passively listening to others with more expertise and sex appeal do it . " It 's not surprising that this has happened , " says Prerna Gupta , the chief product officer at Smule , a company that develops music-making apps for mobile devices , and the guest on this weeks edition of VoiceBox . " If you can listen to all this amazing music sung by stars , it 's easier than creating it yourself especially if you 're not particularly talented at it .

You do n't  need to be able to sing well or even at all to get something out of the experience . <p> The LaDiDa app , for instance , allows users to sing in as off-key a fashion as they like into their device , and at the touch of a button , the app will convert the raw vocal into a produced song complete with harmonies and instrumental backing . " LaDiDa makes bad singers sound good , " Prerna likes to say . ( Even bad singers have to have a sense of timing to use LaDiDa , however . If you cant maintain the selected tempo while voicing your song , the backing is all out of joint with the singing in the final product , as I discovered when I tried the app myself and did n't  see the countdown icons flashing on the iPhone screen signifying the tempo I was supposed to sing at . ) <p> Another interesting app is Songify , which takes any spoken text and converts it into sung music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say some words into it , and when you click another button , your speech becomes a song , again with a choice of backing instrumental .

Its a sort of a remote group karaoke experience . Prerna tells me about how Sing ! was quite movingly used in 2011 by someone who wanted to show solidarity for peoples suffering in the aftermath of the tsunami and earthquake in Japan . That user put out a call on Sing ! asking people to join her in singing Bill Withers " Lean On Me . " More than a thousand people answered her call . Powerful stuff . <p> I could go on and on .

There 's also the question of if and how these apps can be of use to people who already sing and do it well . How can apps encourage and reward virtuosity ? <p> But in my world , any resource that encourages people to sing and especially sing together is a good thing . <p> To find out more about the VoiceBox program about mobile vocal music apps , which launches on Friday 25 January 2013 , click here . <h> Comments <p> Cool gizmos from a tech point of view .

Reason is not disembodied , nor is music-making . Every thought we have , and above all music , comes from the very structures and details of our embodiment .

Go see them before they are returned to storage . <p> For example , the Met owns many works by Manet ( I cant tell you how many , because the museums new websites collection search function is not working properly ; its giving me Tissots , Degas and others among the Manets ) and I therefore wonder if The Funeral , an unfinished painting from c. 1867 , thought to depict Baudelaires funeral , is usually on view . ( If it is , its overshadowed by his finished works . ) At the Met Breuer , the label says that it was still in Manets studio at the time of his death 15 years after the event . It was donated by Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years , if my memory serves . <p> Some works on view have very interesting stories behind them . A beautiful Corot ( above right ) , for exampleBoatman Among the Reedsis a finished painting , with Corots trademark " tiny flecks of colored paint that appear to float above the fictive space of the picture , " says the label . But , it continues , critics warned viewers not to get " too close " to Corots paintings " nothing is finished , nothing is carried throughKeep your distance . " <p> An even better example is Titians Portrait of a Lady and Her Daughter . Titian left it ( at left below ) unfinished in his studio , and after his death " the painting was altered by someone in the studio to depict Tobias and the archangel Raphael ( at right below ) only in the second half of the 20th century was the underlying tender but incomplete image of the mother and child revealed . " <p> The Mets mix of chronological and thematic display here is confusingand not worthy of the Met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the 3rd floor is not contemporary art . But there in a corner section are works by not only Lucien Freud but also Elizabeth Peyton . Why ? Its a section about portraiture . <p> The room devoted to Turner holds some terrific works called of " complex and ambiguous status " in the wall label . No one knows what Turner planned next for them . But these few works made me really sad that I did not see the Tates late Turner exhibition in 2014-15 . <p> Criticisms aside , some paintings here clearly show how an artist worked , what they painted first , how they sketched or did preparatory sketches , etc . See below . That 's a worthy goal . <p> I know some people at the Met have been dismayed by the negative criticism , and some have told me " you have to read the catalogue . " Sorry , that does n't  hold water . Back in 2011 , Gary Tinterowthen still at the Met , now director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houstoncommented on a different blog post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fewer than 5% of the visitors to an exhibition will buy the catalogue ; typically only 2-3% at a popular exhibition ( more than 250,000 ) will leave with the catalogue in hand . " I am guessing that is still the case . Curators can not program to the 2 to 5% ; they must get their message across to most of the public . <p> My biggest takeaway is disheartening : the Met had much time to work on this show and it still slipped short of the mark people expect from the Met . How will it be able to program the Breuer space given the shorter time frame it will have going forward ? Already , some shows planned for Fifth AvenueIve been told but have not verifiedare being moved to the Met Breuer . The Mets modern and contemporary department has already grown in size , while other departments have not . I 'd like the Met to succeed on Madison Avenue , but right now I 'm a bit skeptical . <h> Comments <p> Many thanks for a great post , especially for these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of Art ( a name I use on purpose , lest we forget what The Met actually represents ) . Good for you . So do I. ( I appreciated your later reference to " the Tate , " not to " Tate , " as the Tate insists on calling itself . ) Next , that the exhibition " is unquestionably more interesting on the third floor of the building , where works from the 15th through the early 20th centuries are installed . . . . " Indeed it is . So interesting for me , in fact , that I almost forgot to go up to the fourth !

There 's much to digest . here 's the link to them . <p> But I 'm going to paste here just four charts from them that speak to one aspect of the environment for arts museums . Each one tracks interest in going to an art exhibit by people who had not been to an art museum in the last 12 months . They were asked : <p> During the last 12 months , was there a performance or exhibit that you wanted to go to , but did not ? <p> Chart No. 1 : As you can see , about 5 percent of both females and ( a little less ) males said they had been interested in going to see an art show . That 's it . <p> Chart No. 2 : When you cut the data by age , younger peopleaged 19 to 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to art exhibits than are older people . The 45 to 59 age group is the only one exceeding 5 percentand just by a percent at most . <p> Chart No. 3 : The race/ethnicity data is also no surprise , really . Non-Hispanic whites are at 5 percent ; **26;209;TOOLONG are a little below that , and Other is a little above that . I 'm guessingbut based on my knowledge of similar previous surveys , the most interested " other " are Asians , who have had higher arts participation rates in the past . <p> What do all of these charts say ? That , across the whole population , interest in attending art exhibits is low . <p> I think it also means that museums that are programming for the massesthe 95 percent of those not already goingare making a mistake . They just are n't  that interested in art , and its doubtful that they will be drawn in huge numbers to art museums , no matter what gimmick a museum tries . <p> Instead , museums should focus on that 5 percent of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Why are n't  these people going to art museums , even once a year ? See the last chart . <p> According to the NEA survey , the biggest factor waswait for itno time . More than 50 percent say they 've got too much to do or too much work , outside the museum-going . The next reason was " too difficult to get there . " Again , based on past knowledge of other surveys , this is the " there 's nowhere to park " response . Museums outside big cities have to figure out the parking problems . <p> Only then came costit looks like about 28 percent . To me , this means seeking more underwriting from donors for free days or evenings . I am regularly told by museum directors ( and others ) that trustees push for big attendance numbers for special shows . Fine , then development directors should priorities asking them to help offer free admissionor reduced admissionat certain times . <p> Finally , the last big reason is that the interested non-attendees have no one to go with . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art with someone(s) . And in some cities doing anything alone is not comfortable for most people . Museums should attempt to change that , to emphasize occasionally that museums are wonderful experiences for someone on their own . <p> It is true that the vast majority of people go to museums with someone . Art museums are social spaces . At MoMA , Glenn Lowry told me not too long ago , the number is 85 percentif memory serves . But they 're not just social spaces . What about luring the other 15 percent , not with singles nights , but just a little attention to the experience for someone on his or her own ? <h> Comments <p> I think that the 5% who enjoy museums come because they know something about the art that is there . The lack of history of art classes , as much as the lack of art classes , in early public education can only lead to disinterest through lack of informed personal experience . An annual bus trip to a museum is not enough . <p> Thanks for your comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in going to an exhibition , but did n't  go in the last 12 months . The percent of the population that goes to art museums at least once a year is larger than 5% , but I do not recall the number at the moment ; its in a different NEA study . <p> Thank you for publishing this information . It is very useful for people who forget that the museums appeal to a very limited sector of society . Even in the years of the tremendous attendance growth that in aggregate was greater than all professional sporting attendance combined , museum attendance is still of small percentage of American society . There is simply not a substantial culture of museum going and art event attendance beyond the prototypical " educated , white , middle age , upper middle class ( and higher ) , female " demographic . I think that the blockbuster exhibition mentality needs to be balanced with thoughtful shows for the primary audience . Further , the money spent on marketing special exhibitions ( outside of major tourist centers ) is money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect will be compensated by increased ticket revenue , but in reality offsets the increased ticket revenues . This is a vicious cycle that requires thoughtful balance . <p> This is interesting information , and hopefully useful for museums . However , just a comment about the " too difficult to get there " categorythis may pertain to people who live too far from an art museum to really get there easily . For example , I live in Austin , Texas , and the shows I might be interested in seeing are in Houston or Dallas ( or New York , or elsewhere ) . Its a 3-hour drive to get to Houston or Dallas . Its not a parking issue , its that I do n't  live there . 25396 @qwx885396 25406 @qwx885406 25397 @qwx885397 25407 @qwx885407 <h> Archives <p> Archives 25398 @qwx885398 25405 @qwx885405 
@@99220173 @3420173/ <h> We Asked : What 's the Biggest Challenge Facing the Arts ? <p> Last week we conducted our first ArtsJournal poll , asking readers : What 's the biggest challenge facing the arts ? We had 3,191 votes , with the largest percentage 37% answering funding . Second at 24% was " relevance/changing tastes " followed by " diversity " at 15% and " leadership " at 13% . Technology came in a distant fifth at 4% . <p> I will admit that the results surprised me a bit . Over the past year issues of diversity have become more and more visible . In theatre and what plays get produced . Movies and who makes decisions behind the cameras . Universities and who gets to say what and how they get to say it . The Oscars . <p> Then theres- relevance . I would guess that a good half of all the stories I see about the arts these days have something to do with changing tastes and winning- the attention of an ever-more-saturated audience . So many arts organizations and artists seem to be turning themselves inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how to appeal to overloaded people who seem to be expecting more than they 're getting . <p> But funding ? I get that its tough to balance budgets and keep the lights on . But " funding " seems like a small ball - answer . It smacks of not being appreciated enough , of unmet expectations , of entitlement not fulfilled . Americans spend a lot of money on the arts . The arts are a substantial industry with considerable assets . According to Americans for the Arts , " nationally , the industry generated $135.2 billion of economic activity " $61.1 billion by the nations nonprofit arts and culture organizations in addition to $74.1 billion in event-related expenditures by their audiences . " And just look at the billions of dollars in new museums , concert halls and theatres built in the past 20 years . And funding is the biggest issue ? <p> The current state of the arts in this country is a microcosm of the state of the nation . Large , mainstream arts institutions , founded to serve the public good and assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive country clubs . Meanwhile , outside their walls , a dynamic new generation of artists , and the diverse communities where they live and work , are being systematically denied access to resources and cultural legitimation . <p> The piece paints a picture of cultural haves and have-nots and rising inequality , with public funding now broken and overwhelmed by demand able to do less with less to bridge the gap . Public funding , of course , makes up a smaller proportion of todays arts budgets than it used to . But slippage of the arts from Americans lives is surely a bigger issue than a growing gap in public funding . Do we think that the non-profit arts are the publicly-subsidized housing of the larger American culture ? <p> ArtsJournal blogger Diane Ragsdale wrote a post Monday in response to a question by the Irvine Foundation- which has been focused for several years on engagement in the arts : " Is there an issue in the arts field that is more urgent than engagement ? " Her answer , a resounding yes . <p> While lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would offer that a larger problem is that- the nonprofit , professional arts have become , by-and-large , as commodified , homogeneous , transactional , and subject to market forces as every other aspect of American society . From where I sit , the most important issue in the arts field these days may be that the different value system that art represents no longer seems to be widely recognized or upheld " by society-at-large , or even within the arts field itself <p> Here we are in the 21st century and it strikes me that the nonprofit arts have become increasingly dehumanized " which is ironic since arguably one of the primary benefits of the arts is that they stimulate the senses , awaken us to beauty , fill us with awe , connect us to others , and inspire us to be better- humans . <p> Yes , but can you measure that ( the " better humans " part ) ? I 'm being facetious , of course , but it occurs to me that our frenzy to measure everything these days has made us bump up hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unmeasurable . We 've always measured art in one way or another . Those measurements havent been particularly scientific , accurate or objective . More critical and biased and personal . Messy . Like art . <p> But because we can now measure the neurons and DNA and clicks and " micro-moments " - that are a window on human behavior , were building new matrices of value and currency around them , and were struggling with the relevance of things we can not yet satisfactorily quantify , the arts certainly among them . And yes , because of it , our value systems are changing . <p> How many arts donors/funders do we know who are more interested in the " impact " of the art they support than whether its any good ? Somehow it no longer seems enough just to support something just because you like it . And foundations have gone from asking artists what are the cool things they 're doing that the foundation can support to asking how artists can serve a foundation agenda . But then , what does " any good " mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My vote would be it all starts with leadership . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> Funding is the principle issue , and objective numbers prove it . The NEA spends about 50 cents per capita on the arts . When funding by states and localities are included , the amount comes to about $3.60 per capita . Private funding for the arts comes to about $26 per capita . Public and private funding combined come to about $30 per capita . <p> By comparison Austria spends $324 per capita , Denmark $374 , Norway $667 , Germany $146 , Italy $147 , and Netherlands $333 . The average for these countries is $331 " 11 times higher than American spending , both public and private . <p> This lack of funding for the arts is everywhere apparent in American society . The country , for example , only has 3 cities in the top 100 for opera performances per year . It ranks 39th for opera performances per capita behind every European country except Portugal . In recent years the orchestras in San Diego , Miami , Kansas City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans , Denver , San Jose , Colorado Springs , Honolulu , Miami , and Philadelphia declared bankruptcy . Many more are in continual financial trouble . <p> The real question is why only 37% saw funding as the principle problem . The other 63% of those who did the survey are clueless if they cant see the massive funding problem the USA has . <p> So the saying goes , when you are a hammer , every problem looks like a nail . We may have to account for such myopia in surveys . To a manager , funding is likely to be the largest issue . To a musician , leadership is likely to be a bigger issue . To audience outside the fine arts , relevance may likely be the bigger fish . Perhaps your survey could break down who answers the poll . <p> Metrics are perhaps most important for funders . As you seem to indicate , more important is the impact we cant yet measure . If there are ways to create real-but-immeasurable impact ( stirring the pot ) on a small scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refine and scale up without having to waste resources measuring true impact . Its obvious when ideas are beginning to work as more people come out . And yet real solutions are nec. medium- to long-term . <p> Fortunately there are a few funders recognizing the potential . Creative Capital , Knight Foundation and Kresge Foundation among others . Inside Philanthropy has a very good digest of trends , quotes and rationale to read . <p> The issues are all connected , but as the picture ( at least in the U.S. ) increasingly becomes a battle between going out ( to the arts or even to dinner or a ball game ) vs. staying at home ( Netflix , quality TV , livestreamed opera and music and theatre ) , " relevance " seems to me the core issue that will define whether the live performing arts will go the way of vaudeville after the introduction of movies or whether we will find a way to convince audiences ( and ourselves ) that the magic of " live " is worth the effort and the cost . Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uneven . Huge spending and operational expenses for museums , concert halls and theatres while charging exorbident fees to small dance companies who need special florring , mirrors and space to rehearse and perform . Much serious theartre and musical rehersals can occur in a living room or garage ; not so for dance which requires more space and sprung floors to prevent injury . Dancers must also generally rehearse as a group for long periods of time to get accoustomed to the nuances of a new piece . Dancers and choreographers need low cost access to publically funded performance facilities . Set aside funds created with such buildings could cover low cost rent ( electric , heat , security and janatorial services ) for local dance companies . at least .

" The statistics also show that around 50% of dancers ' jobs pay less than the minimum wage , and that 70% of dancers have performed in unsuitable work environments in the past 12 months . " Add to this how short dancers careers are and you wonder why anyone would try to make a living as a dancer . <p> These statistics sound familiar . Over the past two years my colleague Sasha Anawalt at the Annenberg School of Journalism and Communications at the University of Southern California , and I worked on a project- examining- the dance community in Los Angeles County. - We began by wondering if we could figure out ways to look inside a creative community and make it more visible . Visibility is the first step to being heard . Visibility is power . <p> We chose dance because its a smaller community than music or theatre or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been less visible than other art forms in LA . And though LA has a significant history in dance as well as a thriving commercial dance industry , its also had difficulty getting broader artistic recognition . Multiple attempts to organize the community have failed to get much traction . When you talk about dance in LA , no one is entirely sure what the community actually looks like . <p> So We Decided To Ask <p> Over the course of four months in 2015 , 1,036 members of LAs dance community took a survey about their lives in dance . Then , last summer , we invited the dance community to come together to look at the results and figure out what they mean . You can see the results here at DanceMapLA . <p> The survey results are interesting , but not unexpected . What was unexpected though was that when we got dancers together to talk about the results , it turns out that they do n't  even have a common language to talk about their work or about how their field functions . <p> And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they do , how do they describe it to the larger community ? <p> The larger community , - including- The New York Times , - has- begun to notice that there 's something interesting going on in LA dance , some suggesting that the city is becoming a significant center of dance . But some dancers suggested that one difficulty in promoting LA dance is that like much of the citys art , it comes out of the streets and is n't necessarily transportable outside its communities . <p> As for what dancers in LA look like , as expected , they earn little half making less than $5000 a year from dance . Seventy percent make less than $40,000 a year from all sources , including other jobs they take to subsidize their dance careers . Remember these are people who identify themselves as professional dancers . Which of course begs the question , what constitutes a professional dancer ?

Tom Campbell , Sheena Wagstaff , Jeff Rosenheim ( photography ) and Limor Tomor ( performances ) spoke. - I was encouraged by two things in particular : Campbell said that the Met has spent time and money spiffing up the building , returning it to the condition in which it opened in 1965 , they said . Wagstaff- spoke also somewhat , and I learned more in conversations over drinks , by the range and potential of Unfinished : Thoughts Left Visible , the first large exhibition set for the Met Breuer .

But I 'm not sure the extent of the gaps have been digested by the press , though surely Wagstaff knows . <p> So today I conducted a little exercise . I made a list of the top best-selling living artists last year , American and European . I added in a few names , like Kiefer , that few people would quarrel about as important .

And by the very fact that these artists attain high prices at auction , the Met probably can not afford to buy them , and therefore must depend on donations from collectors . <p> The Met does have something to offer collectors , and rightly it is the historical context that might make contemporary works more understandable or give them more gravitas ( we wish ) .

@@99220183 @3420183/ <h> What To Put On the Wall , Along With the Art <p> The perennially quotidian but important issue of museum labels has cropped up into several conversations I 've had lately . That put me , for the most part , in mind of some quotes from an artist , none other than that conceptual artist and sometime prankster John Baldessari . <p> There 's little questions that some museums have dumbed down their labels of late . Granted , people seem to know less and less about art , even as museum attendance seems to be growing . ( That may be because there 's so much more to know and to learn about art , what with more museums showing increasingly broad and diverse offerings ) . For prime evidence of the dumbing down , though , look no further than the Copper Hewitt Museum in Manhattan . I was there a week ago to view Provocations : The Architecture and Design of Heatherwick Studio . Heatherwicks work is original , innovative and fascinating . But neither the show nor the labels do him justice . <p> Well stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Probably meant to be engaging , to involve viewers , they instead are condescending . The museum feels like a kindergarten . <p> Where is the line , when does a label cross from being informative to being condescending ( or even insulting ) ? Heres what Baldessari said when he was in New York for his exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum in 2010 . As Reuters- related it : <p> " I do n't  think they ( visitors ) need any preshow counseling , " the 79-year-old artist , who was dressed in all-black with a scraggly white beard , told reporters at a preview of the show . <p> Baldessari is often described as a conceptual artist . Critics regularly refer to Salvador Dali and Marcel Duchamp when describing his humorous , usually colorful creations packed with pop culture references . <p> But Baldessari said his art is accessible to anyone who visits the museum . <p> " I do n't  think you really have to spoon feed the viewer , " he explained . " You just have to give them something to hang on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of like reading a detective story , you get a clue , you follow that . " <p> He s right , I think . <p> Now , on a related issue , brought to my attention by an RCA reader , I ask your help : Have you been in museums recently that have removed labels altogether ? I 've written in The Wall Street Journal and here- about the Worcester Museum of Art , which removed the labels in its Old Master galleries . The public did n't  like it . But theory is that this forces the visitor to look at the art , rather than the label . <p> I 'd love to know of additional examples . Please leave a comment or send a message to me via the " Contact " link at the top of this website . <h> Comments <p> Always interesting how people like the writer or Baldessari , who spend their lives and make their living deep inside the art world , and in the writers case , making a living writing much longer articles about art and arts institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who came to the museum and did n't  know anything about the work found it condescending <p> Thanks for your comment , but I do n't  bristle at 100-word labels and I 'm not sure how you got that impression . What was condescending at the Cooper-Hewitt was the tone , the Q&amp;A format and the choice of language to answer the Q. <p> Many museums provide extended ( i.e. 50 to 150 words ) labels for some but not all works of art . Here the question is how does the staff determine which receive labels and which do not . Label writing is an incredibly tough assignment and requires intense study of the object at hand . Most museums vet label copy rigorously and the best labels evoke something about what makes the object " museum-worthy " as well as a bit of context historical , social and cultural . That 's not easy to do in 50 or even 150 words . I have n't seen the Cooper-Hewitts labels but agree that if you are addressing work by a living artist , a few quotes might be preferable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do question Worcesters decision to remove labels from their old master galleries . Historical work needs historical background , especially in this age of historical amnesia and constant attention to " now . " <p> Perhaps the Worcester is the extreme , but it does seem like an exercise in futility . Art , particularly in museum and gallery presentations are often shunned by the general public because they are made to feel inferior . The snooty , pretentious attitudes and arcane , often buzz word- laden , commentaries and descriptions befuddle and condescend , rather than simplify or allow interpretation ( like this sentence , for instance ) . Watch visitors at exhibitions and you will see them read the " captions " first and then step back to see if they " get it . " For me , the proper appraoch when looking at or " experiencing " art is to just see it . You like it or do n't  . Your interpretation is your own , i.e. all art is subjective-period ! Instead of trying to figure out what the artist intended , why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . The truly curious can explore it further , if desired . <p> I do not go to a museum to be " forced " to do anything . I go to enjoy and to learn from experts who have studied art and artists for lifetimes . Museum personnel , give freely and generously of your knowledge . Worcester , please correct the error of your ways ! <p> I like a label with complete attribution info close to the work in question . I 've noticed a trend lately where , in order not to disturb the " design " of the installation , ( often an empty wall ) , the label is off somewhere else and you have to search for it and figure out which label belongs to which work ! Why cant the whole thing just be transparent and easy to access ? <p> Removing labels , erasing the history of an object , is a horrifying practice . When you say that the labels are removed , are you also saying there 's no information about the artist , the title , the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional explanatory information that has vanished ? <p> I know that there 's a general distaste for history nowadays ; there 's a sense that if things are not new , they are of no interest . But that is fundamentally untrue . We need the past to understand the present . An Italian Annunciation and a German Annunciation tell the viewer different things . A landscape painted by Gainsborough tells the view something different from a landscape painted by Rockwell Kent . To remove labels and explanatory text reduces everything to anonymous decoration . I can not comprehend this fear of knowledge . <p> The Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia has no labels . Each gallery room has a laminated description of the artworks in that room . It is located on a table or somewhere else in the gallery . So visitors are encouraged to look at the art first . ( It does n't  always happen , but for many , the art becomes the focus , rather than the labels . ) <p> I think its hilarious that you did n't  even provide any examples of the labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like a kindergarten " . here 's a blog post LONG ... where someone took the time to respond to your inane post and provide examples of the labels . After looking at them I 'd say they 're actually very informative and provide useful context . You could take a lesson from her and try showing your work . <p> You laugh easilythats good to know . I did n't  provide examples of the labels because when I went to the exhibition I had no intention of blogging about it . I went to learn about Heatherwicks work . It was only afterward , when I was speaking with people about museum labels , that I decided to blog : I discovered in that conversation , that other people read the labels the same way I had . <p> The labels and text panels in the " Wonder " exhibition at the newly reopened Renwick in DC are among the most inane I have ever encountered . Unfortunately , a great example of dumbing down . 25396 @qwx885396 25406 @qwx885406 25397 @qwx885397 25407 @qwx885407 <h> Archives <p> Archives 25398 @qwx885398 25405 @qwx885405 
@@99220195 @3420195/ <h> Pretending to be a Stumblebum <p> AMSTERDAM The painter Philip Guston was Morton Feldmans best friend . In 1970 , Guston abandoned the abstract expressionist style he had been closely associated with , and began painting cartoonish figures that often included shoes , disembodied eyeballs , and hooded figures . To say Feldman was shocked would be an understatement . As someone recently told me the story ( heard from someone else who was there ) , Feldman came to the initial exhibition and Guston came up to ask him what he thought . For several minutes , Feldman simply could n't speak , and Guston slowly and sadly got the point . Finally Feldman just turned away and left , and the two parted ways for years . And Feldman was n't the only one . " It was as though I had left the church , " Guston later recalled ; " I was excommunicated for awhile . " The dependably venomous Hilton Kramer titled his review of the show , " A Mandarin Pretending to be a Stumblebum . " <p> Guston : The Street <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got here early to see John Luther Adams and to hear his beautiful sound installations Vespers and Veils . John and I have fantastic conversations . Something about the interaction of his profundity and vagueness and my superficiality and sharpness gives off sparks that seem to intermittently illuminate all of existence . Perhaps the most mind-blowing musical conversation I 've had in my life was one John and I had about a year and a half ago , walking through the snow and cold outside Fairbanks . I keep meaning to blog about it someday , but I 'm still trying to process it . I 'll tell you about it when I can do it justice . <p> John , as everyone knows , is a composer whose paradigm is nature . Vespers and Veils , based on prime-numbered harmonics of the overtone series , are softly roaring continua . All of Johns works , by his own frequent admission , have to do with the incredible Alaskan landscape he lives within . His pieces are walls of sound : not impenetrable , but gorgeous , relentless , ebbing and flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch beyond ones concert-hall attention span . Veils engulfs you and makes you just want to sit down and be quiet . His orchestra piece For Lou Harrison , just released this month on New World , is a series of avalanches , each one quite like the last but different in detail , before whose massive beauty one can only submit . His music is big , beyond human in its scope , and as impersonal as it is translucent . <p> Back in the 80s , I tried to be the kind of composer John is . It was in the air . Cage had unleashed the force of nature into music , and everyone was obsessed with sonority and process , trying to get their own personality out of the music and let nature speak for itself . The objectivity of 12-tone music had given way to a perhaps even greater objectivity of process-oriented logic . But over years of experimentation , I found that nature did n't  speak through me . The natural processes I came up with were more tedious than compelling . I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichs , and Johns , but it was not mine to write . Whatever joy I took in composing had to do with the personal and subjective : the quirky melodic decoration , the unexpected key change , the rhythmic figure that seems bizarre at first , but finally becomes familiar through repetition . I greatly admired the composers of nature , and wrote about them enthusiastically , but I was not one of them . My muse led in a different direction . <p> I 'd been thinking about this difference between me and John lately , and in discussing it , we wandered into Feldman and Guston . Both of us largely base our music in a Feldmanesque paradigm , an ongoing continuum of only subtle dynamic change . For me , Feldman was not a composer of nature , though he is ambiguous in this respect , and the question is one about which reasonable people could disagree . " Those 88 notes are my Walden , " he said , referring to the piano keyboard , and I interpret that to mean he saw himself not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacting to nature . I hear the anxious melodic figures in Rothko Chapel as psychological , not natural , conscious of their alienation and attempting to find release or resolution or integration . Take the incredible passage near the end of Feldmans For Philip Guston where the music strips down to just four chromatic pitches for a full 25 minutes , and then suddenly opens up into a pure C-major scale across the entire piano : that 's no natural process , the result of no inevitable logic , but an incredible psychic release after almost unendurable repression . Of course , I 'm cherry-picking my examples to make the point . <p> What was revealing was the differing reactions John and I had to Gustons heretical pictorial style . When he first encountered it years ago , John , he said , had the same reaction as Feldman : he could n't believe that a great abstract expressionist had turned away from the wonders of pure color and shape to paint naive-looking figures with strangely personal , idiosyncratic associations . It took him awhile to decide that Gustons late works were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guston from his earlier work as well , but the shoes and giant eyeballs and hooded figures flooded me with an instantaneous sense of relief . It was liberating . I had been a Jackson Pollock fanatic , or thought I was , but Guston made me realize that I was hungry for art to reintegrate the human element , the personal element , the whimsical and idiosyncratic . Nature is a paradigm that an artist can hardly help worshipping , but ultimately I felt that we also need an art that is about being human , with all the attendant neuroses , embarrassments , longings , and humor . I love(d) abstract expressionism , but I wanted to know how , once we had made our way through it , we were going to come back to dealing with the uncomfortableness and absurdity of human consciousness . <p> I fear that , to the sophisticated new-music fans whove learned to love the sublime blankness of Johns self-evident canvases , those caricatures must seem like a naive back-pedaling . I often use secondary dominants , and even in these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " signifiers " of originality . Composers ( though never John ) sometimes react to my music with the same disappointment that Feldman showed Gustons late work , denigrating it as merely pastiche or satire , and I 've learned very well how it feels to seem like a mandarin pretending to be a stumblebum . On the other hand , I think my music may be more comfortable for fans of 19th-century classical music than Johns , in whose wide canvases they might miss a certain expected level of surface detail . In 1989 John Rockwell , kinder than Kramer , called my music " naively pictorial , " and it was a phrase from heaven . I 've carried the banner of " naive pictorialism " ever since . <p> I wrote a piano concerto about hurricane Katrina only it skips over the hurricane . The first movement , " Before , " is an expression of happy thoughtlessness ; the second movement , " After , " is about anger , mourning , betrayal , recovery , and includes a stylized image of a New Orleans funeral . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the hurricane . It would be a hurricane . <p> The " natural " path was not easy to abandon . " New music , " as we called it back then , was almost definable as music that " let nature take its course . " Back in the day I even gave a New Music America lecture titled " The De-Spiritualization of Sound , " about how new music was now about sound waves and not personality , but I gave it with an uneasy conscience . Distinctions like natural versus psychological , literal versus metaphorical , are not trivial : they are the axes in reference to which we position ourselves to stake out aesthetic territory and explore what music means and what it can accomplish , because , thankfully , well never know everything music can achieve . But just as it was fundamentally stupid to think , as so many did in the 50s , " OK , the age of tonal music is over , from now on music can only be atonal and anyone who lapses back into tonality is not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that " history now demands " that music now be always literal in its depiction , or that psychological metaphor must be abandoned as old-fashioned . George Rochberg was right : the problem with 12-tone music was not what it added to our vocabulary but what it tried to subtract , that it attempted to outlaw anything associated with the past . The history of creative music never goes backward , but neither does it ever decide that one side of a creative duality is now useless , and only the opposite side can be gainfully explored . <p> What 's most fascinating for me , though , is that , if you made an aesthetic map of the new-music world , John would be nearly my closest neighbor . It is immodest of me to link myself with him , I know , because he is far better known as a composer than I am . But as he and I discuss it , we both share a backyard boundary with Peter Garland , with Jim Fox and Mikel Rouse next door , Michael Gordon down the road one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . You could n't find two composers more in the same " camp " than me and John . We have the same influences , similar histories , the same heros , the same dreams . But our brains are wired differently , and all those new-music impulses that hit his brain and turn into vast celebrations of nature hit mine and turn into quirky celebrations of personality . He once called me a " force of nature , " but that was a generous projection : he s the force of nature , I 'm a force of culture . ( Quite parallel , John still models himself after Thoreau , while I long ago realized I actually prefer Emerson . ) Its astonishing how diametrically opposite people with so much affinity for each other can be when you look at them close enough . <h> Comments <p> Kyle , what a beautiful tribute to friendship and a gorgeous exploration of aesthetics .

I 'm torn between thinking its really worthwhile to be that self-aware , and thinking its a real and quite perilous trap to be that self-aware .

@@99220204 @3420204/ <h> What Musicians Want from their Conductor--and Why it Matters <p> " Is n't it normal for 60 percent of the orchestra to hate their music director ? " " Musicians never like their conductor . " " Why would you give employees any rights in choosing their boss ? " <p> All of these comments , and many more like them , have been made to me over my career by well-meaning board members of orchestras . This is not really surprising , because most orchestra board members are not professionals in the orchestra business and have no experience with orchestras other than their own . And some music directors , in their own interest , and as a form of self protection , promote that kind of thinking . <p> I can tell you without any doubt--after 45 years in this business , and having spent time with more than 150 different American orchestras--that that kind of thinking is way , way off the mark . <p> People choose to make a life as performing musicians with one goal--to make the best music that they can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or as chamber musicians , or in an orchestra . What orchestra musicians want is a conductor who displays both technical competence and emotional communication . Not all musicians will agree on whether the conductor is doing that successfully . When I was managing the Chicago Symphony , I once got two letters , after a multi-week residency by a guest conductor , from two experienced musicians . One complained that my engagement of this particular conductor was an insult to the CSO because of the lack of clarity of his beat , the other said " there is no guest conductor I look forward to with keener anticipation than XXX . " I photocopied the two letters , whiting out the names , and sent them to the opposite musician with a note from me that said " see how hard it is to get a consensus around here . " <p> You will rarely get unanimity from an orchestra about a music director or a guest conductor . But the truth is that you will almost always get an obvious consensus . And it is not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the orchestra . " In fact , I know of many cases where orchestra musicians demanded a change precisely because they felt their music director was not demanding enough . Yes , they want " demanding " to be done with professionalism and respect , not rudely or dictatorially . But musicians want to be challenged and stretched . If a majority of any orchestra thinks it is time for a change , in my experience it is virtually always time for a change . And devaluing the opinions of an orchestra will be as strong a morale killer as just about anything . <p> Another remark I have occasionally heard from board members is that " about 10 or 15 percent of our orchestra does n't like the conductor , another 10 or 15 percent love him , and the remaining 80 or 85 percent do n't care , they just want to come in and do their job . I guarantee you that that is never true . I have never met an orchestra where 80 percent ( or even 25 percent ) of the members did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional and musical lives , and the way they make music , than any other person . To assume that they would n't consider him the most important aspect of their professional lives is to misunderstand the nature of musicians . <h> Categories : <h> 6 Comments <p> Leinard Slatkin 's remarks remind me of my own teacher , Sir John Barbirolli 's , advice when I was a student . He said " If you 're ever in front of a professional orchestra , and only 75 percent of them are a better musician than you , you 'll be lucky . If the percentage is higher , you 're unlucky ! " Too many conductors either do n't know that or choose to ignore it to their cost . As a conductor and an ex-orchestral musician , we all work as a team . A conductor should remember that an orchestra could manage reasonably well without him - he would look very silly without them ! <p> Wow - thank you , Henry , for writing an article which accurately reflects what we orchestral musicians feel , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public ( including on this site by another critic ) . It could not have been put better or more fairly . <p> Leonard Slatkin tells the story -- apocryphal , one assumes ! -- of what a conducting teacher once said to him : " When you 're standing on that podium , always remember one thing . Eighty per cent of those musicians think they can conduct better than you . The other twenty per cent probably can . " <p> One of the inherent conflicts of the music profession is the way that we train and assess players of orchestral instruments as soloists -we demand a distinctive imaginative approach as well as technical skill for higher degrees in performance - but then life as orchestral player involves handing over so much of that interpretive work to the conductor . It is not surprising that it matters so much to players how a conductor works with them : it is not only that the conductor has such power to shape the musical and interactional experience , but the potential of all those years of dedicated training are vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism for players , and a sign of things already wrong with the relationship . <p> The great conductors who remain popular with their orchestras are those who find a way to take a chamber music approach to making music , even though they must maintain control in the end . I remember once when I saw Daniel Barenboim conduct Schubert 's Ninth Symphony twice in a span of less than two months , once with the Chicago Symphony and once with the Berlin Philharmonic . When I remarked to him on how different the two performances were - not in overall interpretive shape but in myriad internal details - he looked surprised at my comment and said " well of course . They 're two different orchestras . " I think that great conductors know how to take from the orchestras members as well as give to them . But sadly , many conductors do not take that approach . -Henry <p> This comment is certainly right on from the musician 's standpoint . The Houston Symphony and Christoph Eschenbach were in sync for 11 straight years and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see successful concerts from the audience point of view from lesser conductors whom the musicians hate . What they do n't know is that the musicians are under enormous stress trying to salvage the music making from an either unclear or unmusical conductor . And that additional muscular stress can even lead to extra physical problems . This is the one field in music where the musician does not have direct control over the interpretation . The best we can hope for is a conductor who clearly makes the case for a compelling interpretation which we can wholeheartedly support . <p> There are also other factors such as programming which affect audience response . A combination of the right programming and the right conductor should make an orchestra thrive and management should make these two areas a priority . Only then will ticket sales and fundraising become much easier .

The facilitator does not need to be an expert in the content of the discussion , but does need to follow the guidelines of the protocol . They are there to guide the process and set the tone , not to lecture or expound or correct . So , with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even audience member could lead the process . <p> In brief ( a two-sided PDF describing the protocol is available for the details ) , the facilitator welcomes the group and introduces the process , explaining that " we can better understand any complex work or experience when we slow down and first pay attention to what we notice , remember , feel , and wonder about it . " And then the prompting questions begin : <p> What did you notice ? ( 10 minutes ) Encouraging participants to share what they saw or heard during the experience , without judgment . If judgment emerges , the facilitator asks for the evidence upon which that judgment was based : " What did you see that makes you say that ? " <p> What did it remind you of ? ( 10 minutes ) Encouraging participants to share how they can connect the work to their own life , what they recalled when they experienced it . <p> How did you or do you feel ? ( 10 minutes ) Sharing what feelings the work evoked in them , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( 10 minutes ) What does the experience make you wonder about ? <p> Speculate ( 10 minutes ) Asking the group to speculate about what the work helps them to understand , or what they think was the artists intent . <p> Respond/Discuss/Reflect ( 10-20 minutes ) Opening the conversation for more general discussions , connections , reflections . <p> All in , the process takes 70-85 minutes , which in our demonstration went by quickly . The power of the process is extraordinary to welcome everyone into conversation , to validate whatever it is they saw or remembered or felt , to acknowledge and integrate their questions about what they saw and what it meant to others , to delay the impulse to judge the work without first creating a shared idea of what the work was . The artist was not present ( which seemed best to foster an open discussion about our experience ) . But we were primed to ask the artist more focused and responsive questions than we might have otherwise . In fact , we were aching to ask some question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . <p> The protocol is openly available , and easy to attempt . If you 're looking for a better structure and strategy for any discussion with your constituents ( audiences , boards , staff , colleagues ) , you should consider this one . Its available , along with many other helpful protocols and tools , on the Artful Tools resource page . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> Critical Response *is* awesome ; I use it in writing workshops and in one-on-one work I do with clients .

@@99220211 @3420211/ <h> What do women want ( of jazz clubs ) ? <p> Why do n't  women feel welcome as jazz listeners ? My posting hit a nerve with Facebook " friends " and commentors including ArtsJournals Mind the Gap blog , which takes up the issue of " comfort when it comes to experiencing art " and rightly understands I was thinking more about " psychic comfort " than anything limited to the physical . <p> What about it , readers how much are you willing to suffer to hear what you want ? <h> Related <h> Comments <p> Comfort &amp; safety are important parts of going out to hear music &amp; doing many other things too ! But getting to the heart of your question about the lack of women in jazz clubs , or in the jazz audience : we need more women players , &amp; that means starting girls out young , with lots of support from female role models who can demonstrate that making jazz music is something a girl can do &amp; that women can &amp; should do . IMO we are 2-3 generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Thinking on it maybe comfort *is* over-rated , cf. CBGBs among various rock venues that have attracted women attendance despite/because of grunge . Of course women conveying to other women that jazz is something women " can &amp; should do " is key . If a mom , sister , aunt , neighbor , teacher , friend is playing or listening for demonstrably positive reasons , that 's got to make more of a difference than if just anybody tells you its the right thing to do . Still , men encouraging/accepting women cant hurt . My inner hippie shouts : Everybody should encourage everybody to play ! But really , many musicians have spoken in interviews of their mentors and models , influential cross-gender ; men have as often told me of women whove guided them ( and who they learned to play for , in attempts to attract/impress ) as often as guiding guys , and women have often mentioned their fathers interests as sparking their own , or giving them basic exposure to/claim on music they found they loved . Two-three generations for parity , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " American and European women were expected to have some hands-on familiarity with a musical instrument ? What happened ? <p> FROM FACEBOOK COMMENTS DITA : I have n't found that women are that interested in jazz outside of a social context . I 've always gone to see artists I like whether or not I have company , but most women do n't  like to go out alone . GARY : . . . Dita has a good point about women and going out alone but on the other hand , if women had women jazz friends , theyd not have to go out alone . I do n't  often go to a show ( jazz or otherwise ) alone , either . But I 've been a jazz guy for forty years and from my observations at live jazz events , there are more women now than there was in the past , and , depending on the event , a wider age spread.Also , in terms of live jazz , the demographic changes depending on the musicians , what subgenre of jazz it is , what event , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was amazed recently when I went out to hear Peter Brotzman in Lexington , KY , of all places , at the number of people there and wide variation agewise and genderwise . Plenty of women there and young people , too . It would have been a very respectable turnout anywhere , New York included . I have no way of knowing how many of them knew what they were getting into but there was only one walkout . DUCK : I agree that when you get into the freer forms the gender gap narrows . You get into the truly Bohemian world , its only natural that a high percentage of the audience is artistic in some way or other , so you 'll have more dancers , writers , artists , and lots of them will be women . I 'm glad to hear that this imbalance might be changing we all want it to ! KELVIN : I 'd choose exposure over marketing any day of the week . Some years ago , Les Paul analyzed audiences for me by the day of the week . I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly accurate . He talked about traditional date nights ( weekends obviously ) as opposed to , say , Mondays , when musicians had the night off and might come out and hang with whomever was working . Actually , I wonder what Lorraine Gordon Village Vanguard proprietor would have to say about this , because I think I remember her saying she noticed that Japanese women did n't  seem to have any qualms coming to the club by themselves , in pairs or whatever . Obviously , none of this is scientific . <p> Male mentors are very important , and I 've had a couple myself , for which I 'm grateful ! But we are so not there yet when it comes to balance . Women producers : can you name any ? Besides the late Helen Keane ? ( who had to fight tooth and nail for credit and recognition . ) Re hands-on familiarity with a musical instrument : I had years of piano lessons . That 's not the same as pursuing a path as a professional musician obviously . Very complicated and thorny issues here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry and Howard are right about playing an instrument as an avenue into jazz . I got into jazz because I was playing classical clarinet in the high school band and some of my ( male ) friends were in the jazz band . They took me out to see folks like Sun Ra ( sneaking out after curfew on a band trip to Philly ) , Zoot Sims , and many others and helped me to develop a passion for the music . Many women and men , too , for that matter havent had the chance to hear jazz and do n't  think they like it . Most do n't  know the great variety of the music and if given a chance would certainly find something to like . I invite friends to hear jazz all the time ; the ones who tend to really appreciate it are those who already have an artistic bent and ones from other countries . But a little exposure can go a long way . I once took a friend and her son to an outdoor concert by Lester Bowie ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boy was so captivated them that they still talk about it to this day . So more woman players , more folks bringing friends to hear music , more opportunities to hear it in a variety of settings . Bands such as Either/Orchestra and MMW whove got broader audiences , toured extensively and played ALL kinds of clubs jazz , rock , performing arts centers as they built their reputations and I do see many women at their concerts . <p> To answer Terri : a few more women producers : Nobuko Cobi Narita , the recently-passed Rosetta Reitz . If clubs " count , " you 'd have to include Lorraine Gordon and the late Queva Lutz . And of course there are women producing on a small scale ( house concerts , that sort of thing ) . Are women uncomfortable going to jazz clubs ? I suppose it can still be uncomfortable for a woman to go into any bar by herself , but I do n't know if it 's any more difficult to go to jazz clubs , specifically . Is it the clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way the players relate ( or do n't  relate ) to the audience ? Many people still think of jazz as a man 's world , and assume women musicians are singers or maybe pianists . And there 's still machismo within the jazz world , but that will diminish with each passing generation , as the current youngsters become the elders , and all the musicians have been schooled in the academy instead of on the bandstand and the road .

" - - In fact if you put that phrase into Google , you 'll get a few million hits , explaining that the " transmittal " method of teaching is increasingly unhelpful ( the teacher knows something that the student does not , and his/her job is to transmit it to the class ) because it wo n't prepare people for the lives they will need to lead in the future ( particularly since we expect the rate of change- to- increase ) . - - Instead , we need to help students learn to- teach themselves throughout their lifetimes. - - The underlying- premise is that information is readily available , but knowledge must be constructed by the individual. - And this is best nurtured through inquiry-based teaching methods. - - The teachers job- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within which students discover what is important to be known. - Questions , games , or " challenges " are designed to facilitate discovery , and the teacher is- the resource for problem-solving , not the one with the Answer Key . <p> Debates about the best teaching methods have been going on for- a long time ( centuries ) and would not be particularly noteworthy , except that with the advent of portable computing devices , the ability to discover information has never been easier. - As classrooms move to " one- to one " computing ( each student has her own untethered device ) , teaching methods can be device-powered in new ways. - Apps that support inquiry-based classroom education are proliferating , making education more- easily self-directed- and rendering printed- textbooks obsolete .

" Vocalist/pianist Judith Hill totally stole the show with her lucid , sparkling version of " River .

I predict that this confection will be an embarrassment within a decade and forgotten in storage after that . <p> I agree with Kathleen Whitney . I also think the lime green icicle the MFA in Boston bought is an embarrassment . Its most definitely NOT art , just a piece of gigantic decoration , &amp; its another sign of the bad taste of Director Malcolm Rogers .

" The paintings in the extraordinary " Civil War and American Art " exhibition at the Met ( closes this week ! ) , for example , spur many worthy things in viewers , but " creativity " is not one of them . <p> While some may applaud Mount Holyokes collection of so-called contemporary art , its lamentable that it , and no other college art museum ( and few public museums for that matter ) , possesses any contemporary Classical Realist art ( see images at the Ann Long Fine Art and the Florence Academy of Art websites ) .

Sorgh , Dorothea Tanning , Afruz Amighi , Carrie Mae Weems , and Bartolomeo di Giovanni . Honestly , Chihuly has wider popular name recognition than these artists and " Clear and Gold Tower " is a great addition to the campus that will sit in the heart of the Librarys busiest area . Hopefully the publicity around this acquisition will encourage people to explore the rest of the Museums exciting collection . <p> I do n't  really understand how anyone can say that the Chihuly piece is " not art . " It certainly was envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no counterpart in the real world ( unlike , say a Damien Hurst or Jeff Koons piece , or for that matter , much of Andy Warhols output ) . Calling it decoration does n't  make it cease to be art . The Bard Graduate Center just closed an exhibition devoted to a huge collection of decorative art pieces from the Met that included things like wall panels and chair frames ; the Met is a museum of art . The Louvre has a vast separate museum devoted to French decorative arts . Someone might not like Chihulys work ( I do like it ) but its as much art as anything else being produced and shown in galleries today . Whether it will last is another question . <p> But , to take another case , I doubt that many people at the time expected that the purely utilitarian objects created by the Tiffany company would end up as prized possessions of art museums. , but we certainly still go to see Tiffany lamps when they are in exhibits . And the Met has an exhibit of Faberge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will last . <p> Your comments are well taken . When I say that Chihulys work is not " art " I 'm using this term in the sense of " fine art , " which is usually distinguished from " decorative art . " This distinction is reflected in the Mets Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Art , which , it says , includes " sculpture in many sizes and media , woodwork and furniture , ceramics and glass , metalwork and jewelry , horological and mathematical instruments , and tapestries and textiles . " In my view , Chihulys work is at best " decorative art " in the sense suggested by this listing .

Its force as art has been softened with age , and unconsciously or not we condescend to its conventions , its narrower world , to fully enjoy it . It coddles us with the safe haven of its familiar forms . Art , living art , has the capacity to be terrifying , disturbing , iconoclastic , risky , and if you find something of value by a living composer it can connect with you with unequalled vitality .

I saw their concert , talked to them at Miss Prissys house on South Wilton Place , and watched them dance at a krump session at Chucos Justice Center in Inglewood . Its still remarkable to think that Miss Prissy , one of the very first krumpers , actually chose the very aggressive , twisted energy of krump over all the ballet/jazz/hip hop she was studying as a kid . With Lil C , its almost inconceivable that he s entirely self-taught . His choreography is just so sublime . There 's great video accompanying my story over at Los Angeles Times .

The result was panel discussions , crammed workshops and the launch of the company to cheering crowds . <p> Anawalt describes the duos telepathic team-teaching ( " they really do n't  have to talk to each other to understand what the other wants " ) and how their codification of krumps moves convinced her of its lasting potential .

@@99220281 @3420281/ <h> How well orchestras play : applying some criteria <p> How well , I asked , do our orchestras play ? In my first post about that , I said that I thought this subject is to say the least curiously muted inside the orchestra world , and not adequately discussed in public outside it . <p> I got some pushback on that ( no surprise ) , which I 'll address next week ( though some of what I say in this post might clarify what I meant ) . <p> And then , in a post Wednesday , I offered four criteria for judging how well an orchestra plays : <p> technical excellence ( balance , intonation , ensemble ) <p> the strength of each section , and of each principal <p> ow well the orchestra plays various musical styles <p> whether the orchestra plays with edge of the seat excitement , with melting passion , with visible and audible commitment <p> And now I might add another point , something I raised in passing , in my last post . How well does the orchestra play under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players do n't  like ? Does the playing sag ? Or do the musicians play their best ( as individuals and as a group ) , no matter who the conductor is ? <p> A pointed question <p> So now its time to ask : How often do we see an orchestra thoroughly assessed , either in public or private , with all these criteria weighed ? Do we see critics do it ? Does the orchestras board do it , perhaps presenting each year its own thorough summary of where the orchestra stands artistically ? Do the players do it , perhaps themselves meeting each year , to discuss whether they could do better ? <p> The answers to all these questions , as I think we 'd all agree , is almost always no . These assessments are n't  made . Maybe they come up informally , in conversation among musicians , among members of the orchestras artistic staff , or even among members of the audience . Or in private comments from the music director . But we certainly do n't  run into these complete assessments often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see in sports . In baseball , for instance , every serious Mets fan , every player on the team , everyone in the teams front office , and every sportswriter in New York can tell you the teams strengths and weakness . <p> Critics do judge an orchestras performances , but for the most part they say whether they liked what happened in a particular piece , maybe noting some notably good or poor playing from a section or individual . But theyll rarely give a complete assessment of how the orchestra plays , not just at a single concert , but in all of its performances . ( If anyones seen a review that does this , please let me know ! ) <p> Going further <p> Now I 'd like to zero in on one of my criteria , the strength of an orchestras sections , brass , winds , strings , and percussion . Someone , commenting on Twitter , said these things do get talked about . We all know , for instance , that the Philadelphia Orchestra has terrific strings , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really know that ? ADDED LATER : Or , rather , does knowing that mean that these orchestras have the best strings and brass ? <p> Many orchestras have good string sections . I 've heard terrific string playing at ( just for instance ) the NY Philharmonic , the Pittsburgh Symphony , the Cleveland Orchestra , the New Jersey Symphony , and ( of course ) the Berlin Philharmonic . As , I 'm sure , have many music critics . But you do n't  think to write , " Ah , those legendary Berlin strings ! " Its the Philadelphia strings who get the special praise , but maybe that 's just conventional wisdom . Maybe their strings are n't  any better than the strings at some other top orchestras . <p> And even if they are , do we know who 's second-best ? Whos third ? Which major orchestras have strings or individual string sections that need improvement ? These things we do n't  hear about . <p> And who has the best oboes ? Oboists would know ( or at least could offer an opinion ) . Maybe orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-connected orchestral musicians who play other instruments . <p> But the public does n't  know . Critics most likely do n't  know , or anyway do n't  say . And were not likely to see the board of some top orchestra declare , even in private , that their oboes need improvement , the way the Mets front office ( and every Mets fan ) knew at the start of this season that the team needed starting pitching and a second baseman . ( And , as the unfolding year has shown , a lot else , too , but let 's not go there . ) <p> As one example of what might be said , I 'll dare to offer a review I wrote in 1998 for the Wall Street Journal , after I 'd heard the New York Philharmonic several times in the same week . ( They were playing all the Beethoven symphonies in a special festival ) . Heres part of what I said : <p> The Philharmonics advertising last year stressed the musicians virtuosity , and that 's accurate . But some of the principal players the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played first flute for seven of the nine symphonies stood out too much , as if their virtuosity meant too much to them . The entire horn section , extraordinary inst instrumentalists sometimes engaged in blatant self-promotion , at their worst conveying just one message : " Yo ! Listen to us ! " <p> The first violins are weak ; they sounded crude and prosaic in the slow movement of the ninth , in great contrast to the violas , whose purity was a high musical achievement . Incredibly , the back stands of the first violins sometimes dragged behind the rest ( especially in the sweeping upward scale at bars 210 to 212 in the slow movement of the Seventh Symphony . ) The basses are the strongest section noble , precise and always true to the musics inner meaning . <p> My point is n't to praise myself , but to ask why we do n't  hear or read things like this more often . <p> Years later , I found out that Kurt Masur the music director back then had been working hard , and sometimes brutally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purge the Philharmonics first violins . Which surely is why I now can say Ive wholly liked the Philharmonics strings . <p> Note , though , that from everything I 've heard this was Masurs individual campaign . And not something openly discussed , within the institution , as something that should or should n't be done . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> I currently live in Toronto , and the Toronto Symphony , which was in the doldrums from about the time that Seiji Ozawa left , in the late 70s , has blossomed again under Maestro Oundjian , whose star is deservedly rising abroad as well now . Your criteria are fine , and yet there are intangibles , too . The Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell ( I lived there briefly during his tenure ) was consistently terrific , though he was apparently not well liked , but rather feared . <p> How much of an orchestras quality is the players ? How much the conductor ? How much some other factors ? All I know is that yes , when you sit and listen closely you can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I hesitate to say this . We the audience do n't  go to a concert to sit as judges marking perfection or the lack of it in each performance , and we the players , though we struggle for perfect technique as the notes go by , also open ourselves to feeling and try to allow the technique to carry it to the audience . The overall purpose of the concert is to convey humanity in all its variety through the medium of sound . It is n't about the perfection of the notes . For me the most reward from a review comes when the writer starts with the composer and states what he feels the conductors interpretation is trying to accomplish and then comments on whether this was well done or not , and why . <p> sports teams main focus is on ( short-term ) WINNING , orchestras focus is on quality performance . <p> So how do you think sports teams manage to win ? Only by delivering quality performances , as individuals and as a team . This is n't at all a short-term proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of careful work , detailed training , lots of practice , and creative , diligent coaching . The similarity here with orchestras ought to be obvious although few people in the audience may be aware of the long-term work that goes into orchestra-building . <p> AS a fellow reviewer and classical music enthusiast , I often wonder how to put what I think about a performance on to paper ( or in a blog ) . Several times Ive written opinions ( not reviews ) about what I think a performance should be , and technically perfect is n't high on my list . <p> While I do want the right notes played with the right dynamics and articulation , the passion behind the performance is , to me , much more important . One of the problems I think orchestras fall into today is the need to be " technically " accurate and fail to capture the passion . The most thrilling performances are those when the conductor encourages the ensemble to create a unified emotional impact . <p> I disagree with Joan people do go to concerts to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  like what they hear or they think the price is too expensive for what they heard , they wont be back . So , whether they mean to or not , they are judging ; its human nature . <p> However , all that said part of a reviewers job is to assess the orchestra . BUT , I 'm not sure I agree they should be assessing any performance too harshly . Orchestras do n't  want reviews that crucify them . They wo n't sell more tickets and orchestras are having a hard enough time as it is without critics making it more difficult . <p> But we ca n't be too soft either . If the audience clearly did n't  enjoy the concert , then a good review is n't honest either and a critics credibility goes down the drain . <p> There has to be a happy medium , offering positive words about what went right , while pointing out the ways they can improve or just say nothing at all , and Ive certainly done that ! <p> We also need to consider the digital world . Most classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . I know of very few " live " recordings by orchestras , because they want to fix and tweak all those little things that make the performance less than perfect . So , if the 1st flute was too loud , we bring it down in the mix , or if the horns were say " look at me " we have them play it again with a little less bravado and slip that into the recording . People do n't  go to a concert hall expecting the same perfection they get from a CD ( and they wo n't get it ) but they should be something exciting . <p> Yes , maybe replacing professional players with younger , more enthusiastic players might give a more exciting performance , albeit less technically perfect . <p> In the end , the question for me really is when we judge how well an orchestra plays , where do we publicize this judgment ? ( if we publicize it at all ) <p> I think that people are naturally critics . The normal response , after a performance of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster trucks ) is to discuss it . Maybe dish it , maybe tear it apart , maybe rave to the skies . But always to talk in great detail . <p> But somehow orchestra concerts are different . They exist to uplift us . Which means that we leave our brains at the door ? We cant talk intelligently and , if necessary , critically about what went on ? <p> But winning does n't  lead to quality performance ( anyone who has seen a few boring soccer matches will agree with me ) ; quantity rules . <p> Classical music is n't soccer , nor should it be . In fact , I believe TRUE art is anti-competitive in nature , because its beauty lies in the new , innovative , and imaginary approach to traditional or new works of arts ; such an approach is by nature qualitative . <p> By extension , true arts organization are , in my view , the complete OPPOSITE of sports team . Yes , both take years to build , but artists work toward bringing a transformational experience ( qualitative ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance ; as long as they keep ahead of the competition , all is fine . <p> Eric , forgive me , but you do n't  understand sports at all . Read the sports pages . Watch games on TV . You 'll see that much of the discussion is about character moral and ethical things , which are considered crucial . As well as matters of teamwork , which are , in the end , matters of character . A player who puts him or herself before the team is despised . Such players exist . Nobody likes them very much . And they do n't  help a team win . 25395 @qwx885395 25409 @qwx885409 25393 @qwx885393 25408 @qwx885408 25394 @qwx885394 25401 @qwx885401 25400 @qwx885400 <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> @gsandow <h> Resources 25399 @qwx885399 25403 @qwx885403 25402 @qwx885402 25410 @qwx885410 25404 @qwx885404

@@99220290 @3420290/ <h> How to Handle Rodelinda <p> After a series of dud new productions , the English National Opera has at last got a palpable hit , with its first-ever staging of Handel 's Rodelinda , directed by Richard Jones and conducted by Christian Curnyn . The company needed this badly , especially in view of the failure of their new Rigoletto , an ill-advised replacement for their money-spinning old production by Jonathan Miller. - The ENO sometimes seems to have had a policy of looking for directors outside the ranks of experienced directors of opera , especially courting filmmakers . If success is measured by revivals of productions , the only unalloyed success I can think of was the Madame Butterfly by the late Anthony Minghella . <p> Of course the choice of veteran opera director Christopher Alden to create the new Rigoletto should have been a safer bet " but the production had already had two unsuccessful outings with the Canadian Opera Company and the Lyric in Chicago . Killing off Sir Jonathan 's wonderful Rigoletto was just plain stupid ; but why , one wonders , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the budget to commission the still-productive and ever-imaginative Miller to make yet another commercially valuable production for them ? <p> However , if I had to name the other best opera director now working in Britain , it would be Richard Jones . I 'm in a minority in admiring his 1994 Ring cycle for the Royal Opera , but I think all opera critics agree that his work is never less than stimulating . <p> The tale of the usurped king ( Bertarido ) , supposed dead by his faithful wife ( Rodelinda ) , child ( Flavio ) and compromised sister ( Eduige ) , who is betrothed to the usurper ( Grimoaldo ) is complicated by Grimoaldo 's lust for Rodelinda . Jones sets the tale in Fascist-era Milan . Designer Jeremy Herbert 's sets encompass two rooms , with a narrow corridor in between , meaning there are lots of doors to slam between the stage-right room where the villains have their offices and living spaces , and the stage-left room with its surveillance cameras . In part this is a solution to the ever-present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ da capo arias , but it is an elegant way to separate the factions , even if it does mean that there is a little too much stage business . <p> In truth , though , this cast is so strong musically and dramatically that we 'd still be transfixed if the action took place in a simple white cube . In the title role Rebecca Evans is magnificent , singing with conviction and intensity . No praise is sufficient for countertenor Iestyn Davies , for the beauty of his tone is almost startling . I heard him in a recital in Edinburgh this past summer , and was impressed ; but it did n't prepare me for this moving , thrillingly sensuous performance . The rest of this home-grown cast is grand , and Mr Curnyn gets a magnificent , urgent reading of the score from the orchestra .

Also known as Bunyan 's Tableau , it was created in 1851 and presented to audiences nationwide throughout the second half of the 19th century. - - Panoramas were presented by scrolling the massive canvas paintings across a stage , accompanied by narration and music . John Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , on which this panorama is based , was also a sensation in its time and beyond . Written in 1678 England , it achieved a peak of popularity in 19th-century America , where it became a huge influence upon literature and religion . The Moving Panorama of Pilgrim 's Progress was one of the most important moving panoramas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genre of painting that bridged high art and popular culture . <p> It was conceived by members of the National Academy of Design in New York , with designs contributed by Hudson River School masters Frederic Edwin Church , Jasper Cropsey , Daniel Huntington , and others . <p> In this way , it relates directly to the developing national school of landscape painting. - After its final performance in York County , Maine , the Moving Panorama of Pilgrim 's Progress spent many years in a Biddeford barn and was ultimately given to the York Institute ( now the Saco Museum ) in 1896. - The panorama was forgotten as the museum 's location moved from building to building , and was periodically closed for wartime uses , throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries . It was not until 1996that the panorama was rediscovered in the museum 's storage vault. - It was this discovery that prompted the panorama 's partial conservation " approximately one fourth was treated " and exhibition tour in 1999 . This current project completes the conservation work begun two decades ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative new strategies to make this immense masterpiece of 19th century American art accessible to audiences and scholars worldwide . <p> There 's much more here about the restoration- in the press release , and the Saco Museum has also created a website for the panorama , where it has posted a film about the project , and a blog . The museum has also scheduled a- day-long public symposium on- September 21-22 , 2012 . <p> I 'm hoping the piece , which- is on view through Nov. 12 , creates a lot of excitement in Maine . Saco is a small town , with fewer than 20,000 people , though it gets a lot of summer tourists . <h> Comments <p> Thank you for your comments about the Moving Panorama of Pilgrims Progress . You are correct to note their previous obscurity . When we discovered the Saco panorama in 1996 there was very little written about moving panoramas and it was a very difficult object to research .

For now the Wikipedia article is a good introduction , as well as the other resources which can be reached from sacomuseum.org .

And theatre 's like that . You do n't  know exactly what 's going to happen because its live . I mean sure , its going to follow the script and the characters but it also varies . It varies night to night , how different things can be , and there are little things that shift that add up to make a huge difference between , say Friday night and Saturday night . <p> The situation changes minute by minute . The pitch count . How many balls . How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are men on base . Where are the outfielders playing in relationship to the capability of the hitter ? All of these things come together , these different pieces , all at once . You do n't  know what 's going to happen . And unlike other sports , for me , baseball engages me intellectually as well as emotionally . I have a stake in the outcome of the game . <p> And what it really is about , for me , is the way that moment-to-moment thing happens . Something happens , and something else happens , and something else happens . The moments build on each other , and then suddenly there 's a moment that 's very exciting out of something that was n't exciting , and you 're surprised . <p> With theatre , one thing happens . Another thing happens . It builds , it builds , it builds . You 're not quite sure where its going to go , and then suddenly something explosive happens . <p> There was this production that William Ball did in New York in the 60 's . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor of a hotel building , I think . In the round , and he did a production of Six Characters in Search of an Author . <p> And towards the end of the play , there 's this denouement , around the child drowning in the fountain . I was alone for this production , and this moment towards the end of the play , this drowning came out in a kind of a pantomime show . And I knew the play ; its not like I was surprised by the plot , what was happening . But I was blown away by the way it was presented and the overwhelming emotional experience of this coming together at the end of the play . <p> Ill just never forget that . <p> Every time you get that feeling , I assume , without any empirical evidence to back it up , that everyone else in the audience is feeling that same thing at the same moment . And usually that 's validated by the response at the end of the show , where people really get excited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park " you do n't  say , " Oh , I guess I should get up , everybody else is getting up . " Everybody just gets up , because its so exciting . You 're so involved . Youve been waiting for something to happen and then bam it happens and you connect with it . <p> That 's the way it felt to me at Six Characters . It was a small audience , but the enthusiasm and the response to it was like there was a large crowd . We were all there together , on our feet . <p> You have to be taken out of the isolation of your point of view about the world . You have to experience other worlds , other peoples experiences of life . And there are lots of ways for people to connect with one another , but when you get 100 , 500 , 700 people together and have them experiencing something together , that 's a connection . Theater does that better than any art form . And that 's a real important thing for people . <p> This country right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing where were disconnecting from our ability to relate positively and empathize . Empathize , that might be the word , with other people . I do n't  understand how that happens or why that 's happening , but I do believe that art can ameliorate that tendency to a great extent , and put people in touch with things that might not have occurred to them , and can possibly change their lives . We were talking earlier about experiences that change your life . I would think that that might be a possibility , with theatre . And that 's an amazing thing . <p> We all need to be taken out of ourselves sometimes . Because , you know , you live in yourself , really , except when you 're engaged in something that takes you out of yourself . Like with baseball : time just kind of goes by when you 're at the park , and you 're not thinking about yourself . <p> For me , theater really takes me out of myself the whole time the shows going on . You inhabit the world of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and away from what you want . And then some moment comes in the show , towards the end , when suddenly you realize that the reason you 've been so involved in this production is because what they want is really what you want .

@@99220322 @3420322/ <h> The St+del Museum Expands : Four Reasons To Note <p> In the last few days , the St+del Museum in Frankfurt has opened its doors on an expansion that 's significant for a couple of reasons. - <p> First , the art : The St+del has long been known for its great collection of Old Masters . Now , with the completion of new galleries designed by the architectural firm schneider+schumacher ( of Frankfurt ) , it is showing Western art of the past 700 years . The new space , almost 32,300 square feet , - doubles- the area available to- show- the St+del 's holdings . Although the museum has collected some contemporary art in the past , two recent acquisitions - 600 works from the Deutsche Bank collection and 220 photographs from that of the DZ Bank plus many major- donations and some- purchases have added what the museum says is- 1,200 new- contemporary works to- the St+del 's collections . About 330 works are on view in the current hanging . <p> Second , the locale : these new galleries are all located underground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet they still soar more than 26 feet in some places , allowing the presentation of big works . The- ceiling is supported by juts 12 columns , and the galleries are lit naturally by 195- round skylights , each nearly 5 feet to about 8 feet in diameter , that form a distinctive pattern in the garden . Not that many museums have pulled off such a feat most just enlarge their footprint , which is not necessarily a good thing . The grassy garden remains pretty much in tact . <p> Third , the cost : how did the Stadel manage to build these galleries and renovate its old building for less than $72 million at todays exchange rate ? I could n't find an exact comparion , but that sounds low to me especially because the construction was- underground . <p> Finally , the funding : 50% of that total came from foundations , corporations and individuals . The rest came from the city and the state . Private largesse- may be traditional in the U.S.- but its new to Frankfurt , new to much of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , government support for the arts in Europe is not going to be enough in the future. - The museums I speak with in Europe are all talking about emulating the U.S. model , which has its own problems . - <p> But Max Hollein , the St+dels director , has worked in the U.S. , at the Guggenheim , and he s said he learned how to raise money here. - " One should n't take a no as a no , ' " he told Der Spiegel. - " Rather , it is a sign that the question has merely been formulated wrong . " That article continues : <p> In Frankfurt , the bankers and collectors like this attitude , even if they insist that the art culture in Germany is very different from the US . But the mindset comes across when they refer to the museum as a " good product " a comment that many German art lovers would find profoundly profane . <p> One collector sent Hollein , who had been persistent in his requests , a postcard with a picture of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings . The approach clearly works here in Frankfurt , even if it would be unthinkable in other , similarly wealthy German cities such as Hamburg . <p> I commend the rest of that article to you , if you 're at all interested in Holleins thinking . - <p> Hollein visited with me in New York when he was here last year , and explained some of the legal questions/arrangements that had to be settled before various donations were accepted . Good for him for working things out . And he s not shy about gimmicks either selling yellow rain boots to supporters of the museum , who wear their support in public , for example . ( Hes- shown in some photos wearing the yellow boots . ) So while this transition is n't always easy , above and beyond asking people for money , its done . <h> Comments <p> Max Hollein ran the Kunsthalle in Frankfurt , the Schirn , before he took over the Staedel as well . To his credit he has not only supported contemporary art at the museum which , of course , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to the Old Master department which has developed nicely under Jochen Sander . <p> My father , who grew up in Frankfurt , always said they did not have a large collection but each old master painting was a master work by the artist .

Of course , the Met is showing a gem in their Portrait show by Botticelli <p> Take a look at the provenances of the St+dels old master paintings . You will find names such as Rothschild , and other members of the merchant class . Frankfurts bankers have alway been generous to the arts , and so significant private support of the museums expansion in the 21st century comes as no surprise . Perhaps this is because the city never came into possession of a major princely art collection in contrast to , say , Munich or Dresden , which were capitals of former kingdoms .

Increasingly arts and culture organizations are seeking to be- audience-driven by inviting customers into their process. - We look to crowdsourcing as a means to achieve this type of engagement , and there 's certainly no shortage of organizations involving their customers in program design . Much emphasis has been placed on participatory experiences , and these are by no means without value . <p> How often does this engagement extend beyond audience development initiatives or one-off programs ? Are we asking our customers what they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , or so our organizations can become more representative of the communities we serve ? <p> Bringing users into our organizations should not happen only as a response to changing consumer preferences and habits . Nonprofit organizations receive tax-exempt status based on the promise that we will meet a need not being served by government or the private sector . Are we really delivering on that promise ? Without a deeply engaged and mutually trusting relationship with our communities , how can we possibly know what needs are n't being met ?

@@99220325 @3420325/ <h> How to attract a young audience ( for real ) <p> Not a theory instead , a way that really works. - I 've heard about it working , and Ive also seen it myself , twice. - You combine classical music with alternative pop ( an- umbrella term that may not really exist , but which I 'm using here to mean all- kinds of pop music that is n't on the pop charts , including alternative rock and- electronica ) . The London Sinfonietta- ( as I 've written here before ) has done this several times , and ( or so I 've been- told ) has gotten 1000 people in their 20s cheering for Xenakis . <p> There 's a double CD set on Warp Records- ( Warp is the Sinfoniettas pop collaborator ) - documenting some of these events . There 's no Xenakis- on it , but you can hear people screaming for Ligeti , - Steve Reich , and the John Cage Sonatas- and Interludes for Prepared Piano . ( Aphex Twin , a- Warp artist , uses prepared piano on his album- Drukqs . ) <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer with the Chamber Music- Society of Lincoln Center , has staged two events of this kind in a church . I- just came from one . A band called A Hawk and a Hacksaw with two people in it , - playing violin and accordion opened the show , to cheers from the crowd . The- church was packed with people who seemed to be in their 20s . <p> Then Steven Beck , a very good pianist ( who took one of my- Juilliard courses some years ago ) , played the Bach B flat Partita , to more- cheers . And in fact the crowd cheered him twice , breaking into spontaneous- applause after the Courante , and then cheering even more after the Gigue . <p> At the first of Ronens concerts , last month ( if my tired- mind remembers the date correctly ) , members of Wilco- played some free jazz improvisations , not by any means easy listening , joined- from the classical side by Jenny Lin , another very fine pianist , and Elliott- Sharp , who 's been an out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny also played some Shostakovich , which the crowd ( even larger than- the one tonight ) seemed to love . <p> This really works . And the best part is that this audience- is serious . You do n't  need to shorten , sugarcoat , or simplify the classical- pieces . The people hear them just as easily as they hear the pop stuff . It- really works . And , maybe best of all , it takes classical music off its- pedestal , and makes it nothing more ( but also nothing less ) than something- terrific to listen to . <p> Wouldnt it be cool to present Bachs Brandenburg No. 5 in a jazz club or modern day coffee shop the way it was probably done at Silbermans ? I bet a double mocha that the crowd would start cheering right after the harpsichord cadenza . And I bet they did the same in Bachs time . How are the stuffy ones now , eh ? ? ? <p> Good question . At the concert last night , Steve Beck played an entire Bach partita , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That amounts to a half a program of Bach . ( Actually it was one-third of the concert ; there was another non-classical act after that , but I could n't stay to hear it . I was fried from traveling , and had to drive somewhere that night . I did stay long enough to hear Steve get cheered . ) <p> I do n't  know how the London Sinfonietta arranged their programs . Ill try to find out . <p> I 'm 22. so not quite over-the-hill ( ! ) . and the thought of having to listen to some prog rock alongside a Parry cantata really does n't  seem too inspiring . <p> Reich , Glass and the rest of " that " bunch are all not so very far removed from rock , pop and blues for it to work ok but I just cant see a heavy weight Mahler symphony or something sitting comfortably in such a <p> concert . <p> I 'm always booked for the Chillis when they 're on tour and have as big an indie record collection as anybody but whenenever Ive been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material . The Kronos Quartet are among the more successful in this area , maybe because of the intimacy of the ensemble . <p> Oh.and the thought of people jabbering away during a Haydn symphonyforget it . Thatd piss me off big time ! . <p> I get what you 're saying and Ive really enjoyed reading your book but I really would n't like to have to sit through cross-over concerts all the time . I actually do like sitting in a concert hall or church and soaking up the heavy stuff ! .. there 's something I find inspiring about it all . <p> Just my 2. maybe 3 cents ! ! <p> ( Oh , BTW Greg , I 'm a writer/researcher not a musician ) <p> Hi , Melanie . Thanks for your three or maybe four cents ! <p> Not every classical piece is going to work in the formats I described . Or maybe even Mahler will who knows ? We have a lot to learn about how all this works . I can only say that , from my experience last night , Bach is n't trrivialized at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nodding to myself , agreeing with you and then I thought of something else . If we stop worrying about attracting people to classical music , we might think of these events as just another kind of concert , but a very interesting kind . A kind of concert that interests many serious people , whatever kind of music theyd say they normally like . Among other things , its a chance to hear music you do n't  already know ( classical or not ) , And a chance to make musical connections among many genres . <p> Sure , knock yerselves out with these concerts whatever . But frankly I do n't  give a rip if young people come to classical music . Fact is , most people show up when they 're older anyway , so wuts the prob ? <p> To put it bluntly , there is no classical music crisis , except in your own imagination . <p> Clearly this guy has n't  seen any of the data . Falling ticket sales , to a disastrous extent . Financial crises . And an aging audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences ) the average age of orchestral concertgoers was around 30 . In 1962 ( when another study was done ) it was 38 . Since 1982 , the National Endowment for the Arts has been monitoring the age of the classical music audience , and its been steadily rising . Young people are absolutely not replacing the people who grow too old to go to classical concerts . <p> There 's much more to be said on all this , for instance about the penetration of classical music into our culture . In the 50s , to cite just one thing , there were classical music shows on network TV . Not now , obviously . Younger people do n't  see classical music as a normal part of their cultural landscape . When I was in college , in the early 60s , any smart student who cared about music had classical records . No longer . <p> Since the current audience is disappearing , and a younger one is n't taking its place , we clearly have to do something . Gene Barnes might want to check the facts before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted this , Greg . My first-year seminar class at DePauw is putting on a concert along these lines as a class project on Dec. 5 . They are doing a mix of classical and non-classical music , including pop , Broadway , some African music , and some improvisation . After some informal field research , they discovered that the word " classical " is a big turn-off for their peers . So they are calling the event " A Musical Buffet " and somewhere on the posters it will say " . . . punch and pie , " which is a reference to the South Park movie . <p> Instead of having the event in a concert hall in the School of Music , they are holding it in the Ballroom in the Student Union . And serving punch and pie , among other things . <p> Interestingly , when some of them suggested they were trying to create a coffee-house atmosphere , some of them did n't  know what a coffee house is ; they do n't  associate live music with Starbucks , the only coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop ? I agree a month ago I had the ( great ) pleasure of leading the orchestral collaboration with Europes leading accordion trio , the " Motion Trio " from Krakau , Poland . These guys are reinventing the instrument with an extraordinary blend of techno , folk , free jazz , minimalism and comedy unplugged , of course . <p> Liverpool , UK , a city of only 400,000 people can sell-out its Philharmonic Hall ( 2000 seats ) with a concert of electronica a mix of varese , cage and dj remixers . I do n't  see that there 's any problem in attracting audiences to new music . <p> Of course , Liverpool has a musical tradition lacking in most larger British cities . <p> Too often we try to soften the blow of modern music by combining it with the old warhorses in the same concert . The trouble is , it takes a different part of the brain for each style of music , so the cognitive dissonance in one night is considerable . So let 's just make concerts of all new music . IRCAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , hip audience , and people there do n't  squirm when the new music is playing . <p> Remember the part in Ken Burns " Jazz " series where we were told that Miles Davis was watching Sly and the Family Stone tear up the place while his own band received polite applause , and Miles decided to change his style to get that same Sly-like enthusiasm ? Putting Bach on the same program as alt rock will , I think , eventually have the same effect polite response , except for the fast stuff . Youd need to keep all the music at about the same level ( of intellectual interest ? I du n no ) . Whatever , I think this gambit will have a short shelf life . <p> Integrate , Chris ? The kids do n't  show up for the conventional Beethoven , and the old farts hate the Xenakis , so that leaves only a blessed few who will appreciate the whole concert , dontcha think ? <p> Gene , in your first paragraph here , you seem to be making the unspoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't even remotely true . Its not even true of established rock . ( Joni Mitchell , anyone ? " Michelle " ? " Sad-eyed Lady of the Lowlands " ? Power ballads ? ) But its especially untrue of alternative stuff , in genres ranging from folk to electronica . You could put , for instance , Josephine Foster on a pop/classical program , singing her Schubert versions in her ghostly wisp of a voice , as she did on her last album . You then could pair that with normal Schubert , and in every case the Schubert songs as normally performed would be far more rhythmic than the Foster versions . <p> Or you could make up other programs , with slow pop , and rhythmic classical . And if it went the other way round fast pop and slow classical why assume that people wont like it ? Since they already love slow pop stuffthey could easily love the slow classical pieces ( Morton Feldman ? ) as exactly the kind of contrast they already take for granted in pop . <p> Earlier in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " modern " sounding new works with warhorses , and pointed out ( I think correctly ) that rather than providing " something for everyone " on every concert , it more effectively provides something for everyone to hate about each and every concert . I believe you essesntially advocated ( or implied that you would later in the book ) that there be separate warhorse concerts and modern concerts so that everyone can have what they want without the baggage . Have you suddenly changed your mind ? <p> Hi , Stefan . I 'd say that different rules ( assuming that there can be any rules here ) apply to different audiences . For the established classical audience , there seems to be a problem in pairing established and new works . This audience often does n't  do much more than tolerate the new works , and may ( though they rarely speak up about this ) resent having to hear them . Then there 's a small percentage of this new audience ( one marketer I know in the biz estimates it as 6% ) that likes new music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> For a new ( and probably younger ) audience , none of this applies . Much , maybe all , of classical music is new to them , and they do n't  mind new classical works at all . So theyll listen with great interest to anything on any concert they attend . <p> If this is done , it should only be artists that are fairly obscure and " harsh " enough towhere the boundaries separating them from classical is blurred anyway . <p> To elaborate , I am speaking of musicians like late " Autechre " , which blur with Xenakis and Stockhausen . " Behold the Arctopus " , " Meshuggah " , " Gorguts " and " Spiral Architect " often have fans that are classical musicians . Paganini and Vivaldi would not need any introduction , they are usually the musicians of choice when one who normally listens to metal chooses to listen to classical . When you are at that edge of the " popular " music spectrum , the audience is mainly composed of people who are willing to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyve already heard everything else that popular music can offer . <p> Nice post Greg , but there seems to be a misrepresentation developing in the comments here . Although to some ears the Warp/London Sinfonietta concerts might seem like crossover experiments , they werent really promoted that way and certainly werent received as such . Many of the Warp artists ( Aphex Twin in particular ) have a long-acknowledged love for the classical avant garde ; this in turn sparked , some time in the 1990s , a huge hipster interest in Xenakis , Stockhausen , Ferrari , etc ( Ligetis also been cool on and off since Space Odyssey ) . Visit eBay and see how much 60s avant garde LPs are selling for : there 's a sizable , knowledgable , devoted market for this music , and its largely the same constituency that listens to Aphex Twin , Squarepusher , etc . So the Warp concerts were less a crossover than ( finally ) an acknowledgement of this constituency and a focussed attempt to put on music for them . There was some crossover ( not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerto , eg ) , but the gap was much narrower than some of the suggestions made in comments here certainly nothing on the scale of , eg , prog rock next to Parry . ( Although , come to think of it . ) <p> Thanks , Tim . These are important points , to put it mildly . I think they reinforce what I said in a later post , about how these cross-genre concerts are art in their own right , and have to be thought of that way , not as some attempt to accomplish any external goal . <p> As for prog rock and Parry I 've listened to Parry , and suffered through a concert featuring some reunited version of Yes . I think they deserve each other ! ( forgive me , Yes fans . ) <p> The mention above of Beholdthe Arctopus ! reminded me of an amusing event on the avant-progressive mailing list . One of the more prolific posters listened to some Wuorinen because Rich Woodson claims him as an influence , but decided that Wuorinen was " too bland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IDM fans whore into the knotty modernism stuff . <p> As for the various comments about prog rock , its easy and uninteresting to rag on Yes or ELP , but ( I think ) somewhat harder to do so with many other bands that are either more obscure ( possibly because harder to mock ) or not thought of as prog ( because then youd have to admit that some prog is good ) say , Blast , Henry Cow , Tortoise , some of Nels Clines projects ( its kind of funny to me to see Cline referred to as " a member of Wilco " ) , Orthrelm , James Grigsby , The Dirty Projectors ( that last is tendentious ) I could keep this up forever . Knocking progressive rock on the basis of Yes is like saying you do n't  like classical music on the basis of half an hours worth of unimaginative programming on a lackluster classical radio station . ( Anyway , what do you do with band/collectives like Zs or Normal Love ? ) <p> Criticism accepted . Thanks . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known better . <p> I feel like one very important point is being ignored here , namely , that different musics are conceived for different venues , different contexts , different audiences . While it may be a novelty for the singer-songwriter to share the stage with the avant garde classical ensemble , I think ultimately its a conceit , an exercise to show an equality between the two that does n't  exist . Rather than a value judgement , I think of it more as a recognition that different musics do different things . Even within the realm of classical music this consideration is often ignored . For example , I continue to make the mistake of buying tickets to chamber music events in the main hall at Carnegie . Ill probably continue to make that mistake because I 'm kind of a fool in that way , but The Uninitiated who buy a student ticket and sit in the back row of the top balcony for one of these concerts will never be back , I can assure you . <p> I happen to be someone who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit of a venue or a gamba recital at a museum and be happy either way , but in no way does this mean that I want to see Jordi Savall at the Knitting Factory or Joanna Newsom at the Cloisters . Even less so if they 're sharing the stage . If you 're a music-lover of any variety , you go to a concert to try and soak up some of that Aura of Authenticity that listening to the recording on your iPod does n't  give you . The concerts being proposed here do n't  seem authentic , in fact they seem like a desperate maneuver by a marketing team with no faith in their product . <p> Eli , I think its clear that you do n't  want to go to the concerts I 'm describing . That does n't  mean that others wont . I notice that you talk about concerts I 'm " proposing , " and there 's an important distinction here . I 'm not proposing these concerts ; theyve already taken place , so we can say pretty definitely that they work . <p> Of course , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . But there are lots of surprises down that road , I 've found , and your joking example of a singer-songwriter and an edgy classical group might not always be so crazy . If James Taylor is the singer-songwriter , then , sure , its a stretch . But if its Feist ? That might work very well . <p> And is this a cynical marketing ploy ? Certainly I do n't  think of it that way . And I know the producers of the two concert series I talked about ( the one in New York , and the series the London Sinfonietta has done ) . They are n't  cynical people , and they 're certainly not doing this for cynical reasons . <p> And , still , after all that if you do n't  want to go to these concerts , you should n't go to them ! Nobodys forcing this on anyone . <p> Perhaps my post came off as more of an attack than I intended . My attitude in all things is " whatever works , " despite the strong language that tends to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence in particular was a bit overstated . I did not mean to imply that the concert promoters were cynical , I was trying to make a comment about perception rather than intention . Might it not come across as " a spoonful of sugar " where the classical music is the medicine ? Probably not to those who already listen to classical , but maybe to those coming from another direction . Any idea what the makeup of the audience was in this regard at the concerts you attended ? <p> Hi , Eli , <p> Welcome back , and I guess I could echo what you 're saying I hope my reply to you was n't too truculent . <p> The people at these concerts are visibly young , mostly in their 20s , if my judgment of age is any good . And from everything I 've heard , they 're not people who normally go to classical concerts . The same was true , from what Ive heard , at the events the London Sinfonietta presented . <p> But smart , younger people today listen to a great variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iTunes , even if they do n't  go to classical concerts . So the idea of a concert with a variety of music on it ( classical included ) would n't be foreign to them . <p> What you 're saying , though , is very important . These concerts have to be put on with real sincerity , by people who genuinely like all the music that 's played . The minute the concerts exist mainly to promote the classical music , the phoniness of the enterprise will shine through , and people will head for the exits . Or at least never come back again . Maybe one reason the London Sinfonietta has such success is that it co-produces the concerts with a leading electronica label . And the guy who produces the concerts Ive heard in New York really likes all the music he puts on them . <p> Best , <p> Eli 25395 @qwx885395 25409 @qwx885409 25393 @qwx885393 25408 @qwx885408 25394 @qwx885394 25401 @qwx885401 25400 @qwx885400 <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> @gsandow <h> Resources 25399 @qwx885399 25403 @qwx885403 25402 @qwx885402 25410 @qwx885410 25404 @qwx885404

@@99220342 @3420342/ <h> Homage to Brion Gysin <p> Ian MacFadyens astounding book-length essay about the avant garde artist-poet-novelist Brion Gysin , " A Trip from Here to There , " knocked me out . It had just been posted at RealityStudio , so I was raving about it could n't help myself to anyone within listening distance . <p> Along came a savvy , multilingual writer Im acquainted with , precisely the kind of guy I figured would be interested : an intellectual world citizen , so to speak , a self-described " outsider " born in Egypt , educated at Harvard , now an erudite graduate professor of comparative literature in New York , not to mention an authority on Proust and the author of a highly regarded memoir , a collection of essays , and a couple of novels . <p> Well he drew a blank . Gysin ? Never heard of him . He had heard of William Burroughs , though . Hooray for that . <p> here 's a video clip of Gysin with Burroughs in an excerpt from a 1966 film by Antony Balch , which illustrates some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of that writer-professor and anybody else who has never heard of Gysin , here are three excerpts from MacFadyens huge essay . Not an " easy read , " its a brilliant piece of devoted scholarship that moves between two poles : clear narrative material often based on biographical facts and abstruse speculation based on linguistic and visual analysis in other words , lingo spew of a very high order . <p> Even more than William Burroughss belief in Gysin ( " He was the only man I ever respected . I have admired many others , esteemed and valued others , but respected only him . " ) , MacFadyens homage the depth of it , the weight of it , the insights and style of it is the truest ballast of the BG sailship . <p> Let 's begin with <p> Euphonics <p> " BG " is Gysins monogram , but as a sound poet and as an artist who used letter and calligraphic forms , he was aware of the symbolism of these two letters and their combinatory resonance , their euphonic expressive meaning . Gysin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of words through appropriately sounded letters , and he would have paid close attention to the works subtitle , " On the Correctness of Names , " because he felt that his own name was not correct , and he would struggle for years to write it right . For example , he would sign his work " Brion " followed by a monogram or motif or ideograph for " von Listel , " signifying " from Listel , " in Switzerland , after his grandfather . Then he ditched the symbol , before signing himself " Brion Gysin , " only later , in many cases , to write simply " Brion " over the top of the previous signature . In 1958 he might sign a work " Brion Gysin , " but in 1959 this would be reduced to " Brion " with the von Listel motif returning , while in 1960 he signed a number of works with the minimal " BG . " Terry Wilson remembers seeing a 1940s copy of Harpers or Vogue in which , in the society pages , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reception for Beni Montessore , and Gysin was identified in the text as " Brion Gysin von Listel , " using what Burroughs would later mock as his " phoney von . " But Gysins confusion with his name went far beyond the imposture of the aristocratic . If his evident dissatisfaction and awkwardness with his own name seems surprising in an artist now known for placing his own name , as it were , center stage in his own creations , it testifies to a profound discomfiture that was at the heart of the process of questioning his " mistaken identity , " without which the script of his " true name " would never have been developed . His problem signature , with its continual variations , influenced the creation/discovery of his " signature script " of proliferating , calligraphic " BG " s as if the sign for " self " that was self-consciously blocked on the quotidian level , could be unleashed and run rampant on another plane of signification . Gysin would sign works " BG " too , but this does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or simply an expression of ego on the contrary , it was precisely the undoing of these representations of identity , their physical mutability over their semiotic fixity , that he pursued . Even when his " signature script " was in place , it functioned both as a confirmation and a dispersal of the integrity of the name . Gysin explored the idea that a word resembles , indeed embodies , in its shape and sound , through alliteration and visual associations , what it describes that meaning is influenced by the shape and sound of individual letters , and by their combinatory effects . Language was magical because , although a word is not the thing it names , it may have a visual and sound resemblance to it , and it is this euphony that is vital in poetry . Gysin deconstructed syntax through cut-up and permutation , he coined portmanteau words and he painted texts and wrote on paintings and he created his own personal script in all these ways he attacked and played with language , both spoken and written , revealing meanings hiding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fixity of linguistic referents . In the case of his use of his own initial letters , this reaches a terminal paradox he undoes his own name in the work , deconstructs and permutates and explodes it , and then signs it with those very same letters , in his own name . The one who signs himself with the singular " BG , " who authenticates an image of multiple " BG " s , is both related to and yet quite separate from the one who strews his emblematic initials through calligraphic script that confirmatory signature is of a different written order to the swarming plethora of signs in the image , and not only because of the distinction between art and its validation , or between writing as image and writing as sign/ature . The " BG " of the picture is " open , " to use Gysins terms , open , that is , to interpretation and multiple readings , whereas the signatory " BG " is " closed " and functions as a legal and professional verification of authorship . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy the same plane , they function on quite different planes of reference . They testify to the gulf between an art of signing and the signature as artistic guarantee in fact , it is the calligraphic script of the image which is the absolute artistic guarantee , not the appended lower right corner appellation . The calligraphic " BG " is the mark of the self-created , the notarised " BG " is the problematic identity of the woman-born . There is another fracture in Gysins sign : " B " and " G " rhyme , they are sound-related , but otherwise , the two letters are at permanent war , and Gysin , for whom these initials were of vital significance , surely knew this . To homage John Michell and his charming book Euphonics " B " is the letter of the physical Body , the Blooming and Bucolic , it knows no Bounds , while the " G " is disGusted by this BiG Buffoon , it wants to cloG it , Grease it up , Gum it , and then Gash its Binary Bubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Greve , the Balloon of the " B " punctured by the Gravity of " G. " Further , even as Gysin brought the two letters together in a supposed singularity of identification , he knew that " B " opens and " G " closes " the B-eginnin-G " of his own existence , and his own signifying script as it repeatedly inscribes the brief trip from " B-irth " to the " G-rave " . <p> The boys were very interesting to watch their negligent grace , their vague yet exact gestures , their delicately mocking salutes , when you gave them money , which they tucked in their turbans . Their hip movements and flirtatious play with their scarves is exquisitely campy and yet essentially masculine : this is in no sense a drag show . In the most beautiful of the dances , the boy carries a whole tray of glasses and lights on his head . Later the boys sang with one of the musicians , and I felt they were really enjoying themselves . <p> Gysins work is profoundly transcultural and historically polymathic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all a magpie , maverick approach all the diverse elements of his immense learning are synthesized in his own personal cosmogony . Gysins thinking was an intellectual and intuitive process of syncretism through which he discovered surprising connections between quite different media , genres , subjects and philosophies . But this was only the beginning of the process he then proceeded through a series of steps or actions to extend and combine the possibilities , sometimes mixing the ingredients and chopping them up , sometimes carefully laying them out and rearranging them like data on a spreadsheet . It was curiosity in action , making the latent visible , procuring the unexpected , delightful result , not the sought-for outcome of logically deterministic cause-and-effect . . . He looks at the German manufacturers name on his tape recorder " UHER . " Suddenly he sees , and hears , " ( YO ) U/HER , " and these two pronouns generate " I , " " THOU , " " HE , " " SHE , " " IT , " " WE , " " YOU ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " " THEY , " providing the conceptual framework of his 1969 novel The Process , at the centre of which is the tape recorder , the " UHER that both records and wipes out the words " the " YOU/HER " words of those speaking subjects who exist as subject pronouns , both created through language and then erased by it , for despite the tape transcriptions , " from the book alone , nothing emerges . " Gysin is both deadly serious and wonderfully playful in the ways in which he exploits and expands and puns upon the linguistic possibilities of this theme the tape machine is both a metaphor for , and the literal embodiment of , the circulation of language , the telling of tales in an alpha-omega loop , equated with the twin reels of the tape recorder and the ouroboros smoke rings of kif . Gysin transposes and syncretizes linguistic usage , treating figures of speech as literal and taking the literal as representational . Likewise , he recognized " Word symbols turning back into visual symbols " in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be read , " while translating permutated poems into abstract symbols and then into drawings . . . His work exemplifies the synesthesia of all media and the transference and translation of experience through all the senses it is the quintessence of Rimbauds program in his 1871 letter and his " Alchemy of the Word , " and the expression of Gysins hallucinogenic experiences as well as his multiple artistic gifts .

TED conferences are interesting because of the intentional diversity of themthe variety of fields , cultures , subjects , points of view , styles , and modes of thinking- represented by the speakers. - We all use the same jargon at arts conferences and all have ( virtually ) the same story to tell . <p> Many sessions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others presenting findings from research or outcomes from new ( often described as innovative ) practices they have tried . But now such dissemination of data- and experiences- could happen- just as easily via a Webinar . The NEA released three new reports via Webinar a few weeks back and it was highly effective , as well as time- and energy-efficient . <p> It seems that technology has- made redundant much of the purpose of the annual arts conference and that the yearly gathering of the field- ( if there is still a reason to have one ) needs to be transformed . I 'm not suggesting there is- not a reason for everyone to get on a plane and fly across the country to hang out ; but I am suggesting that the purpose ( and thus the structure of the event ) might need to be radically different from the corporate-style , top-down , **44;604;TOOLONG conferences to which we 've all become indoctrinated . <p> People sometimes wander the halls of these conferences sighing and saying , " Its the same conversation we 've been having for 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long thought that this was because the same people have been sitting in the room year after year leading the conversation . But perhaps its also something about the structure of these events ? If form dictates content , perhaps if we blew up the traditional conference format and got some new people in the room talking to each other we would succeed in moving the field conversation forward , as well ? <h> Comments <p> I 'm only in my third year of attending national arts conferences and I 'm already starting to feel like they 're old hat . But I realized something important last year , which was that part of the reason I was feeling that way was because I was n't challenging myself enough to seek out experiences outside my comfort zone at conferences . My first instinct the first two years was to gravitate towards the sessions on topics with which I was familiar and with people that I 'd heard of . This was very successful the first year , when I was n't that knowledgeable about those topics , and not so successful the second year , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to try and make a conscious decision to keep learning at conferences , which will require me to take in sessions that I would n't have previously considered . Without disputing the main thrust of your post , I do think that the current format can still work well so long as the people in the room are really there to learn . <p> We are all engaging in social media channels which have at their core group discussion and decentralized authority . As your interesting article points out , to have a conference structure with experts on the dias seems outmoded and counter to how we are all operating in our non-conference lives . <p> The other development that I 've been intrigued by , over the first four of these " fishbowl " convenings ( like that description , btw , since transparency is a core value of this work ) is the inclusion of the " third circle " of virtual participants . It takes effort , but streaming , live blogging , and tweeting the conference discussions further flattens the hierarchies and explodes the participation far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room . We also try to make it clear and " front of mind " that those at the table , and those in the listening circle , are really delegates of the field when they are here- not the experts or leaders dispensing wisdom to the lucky few in attendance , but instead they are in the room representing constituencies of experiences , structures , and perspectives . Its challenging to people who have worked long and hard to arrive at the role of " leader " and " expert " in that hierarchical world when they are not directly included or " featured " in these discussions but when it is cooking , this format can get at things we 'd struggle to get out of the expert/leader/usual suspects sort of discussions . <p> If you 're trying to change thinking in a field or even broaden it , the speakers or front of the room talkers need to not be from the center of the discussion . There needs to be an element of the outside or you 're just reading mission statements to one another . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is self-selective for those with jobs in the field . Prices are set at a level organizations will approve and then they take care of hotel and airfare . Despite the fact that I would enjoy and I think contribute to such a gathering I could never afford it.l <p> Our local Theatre Alliance held its annual conference last Fall and used the " Devoted and Disgruntled " format where we , the participants decided what the topics were and led the discussion with those people who wanted to talk about it . <p> A lot of sharing , of best practice , personal stories and brainstorming all with a great deal of respect . <p> I normally regret attending but this time I was very engaed and very encouraged by the energy of our community . <p> The result is an ongoing dialogue and an emerging vision for our sector . <p> I will testify to suffering from the political , repetitive , and ( too often ) dry arts conferences in which all too often the " biggies , " or the elite institutions mostly preach down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggies stay gathered among themselves , leaving the smaller groups to do something entirely different . I have been really perplexed at being separated into " fiscal tribes , " and allowed to attend meetings only among peer organizations within the same budget range . What is really the benefit of this method of " sorting " peer organizations who are there to learn how to grow , economize , and develop programs ? On content , I cant count the number of sessions I 've attended over the last ten years that featured the obligatory panel of experts on the dais trying to outdo each other and impress the audience with big terms like " paradigm shift " ( my personal favorite I now leave the room if I hear it ) , but end up imparting very few new ideas . For a truly valuable learning and networking experience , I suggest attending NON-arts conferences in fields like tourism , economic development , marketing , journalism , education , and so on . Many conferences allow non-members to register and attend , or they will make an exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you attend just a keynote or plenary session that sparked your attention , but not the entire conference . At non-arts conferences , not only are regular attendees often fascinated by the presence and input of an arts professional , but there is no shortage of new things to learn and bright ideas that can inspire " a-ha " moments . A related idea is to attend conferences in arts disciplines outside your immediate artistic field . It can be eye-opening to examine similar realities from a different artistic point of view . As a performing arts administrator , I 'm currently fascinated by the museum field , and what the performing arts can learn from it . <p> I just attended a week-long intensive seminar at the University of Washingtons Evans School of Public Affairs . It was a non-profit leadership institute that focused on some of the latest , and best training on change management , value-based leadership , and combined 28 of us from all walks of the non-profit sector not just the arts . We also created mini-consultancies to help guide specific peer challenges . Applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break through . <p> I think the day of conferences being a one-way conversation , and the national or sector " voice of God " approach is long over . Look around you people . Revolutions are happening because of the many to many conversations , organized on a set of deeply held principles . Sometimes the answer is n't hiring a consultant , or hearing the latest " surveys said " data . The answer is in our hands , with our peers , and in our actions . Remember , we are measured on what we do , not on what we say we do . <p> While I always enjoy your posts , Diane , this may have been the first at which I snorted aloud . It IS always Ballroom D at the far end of the Hutchinson Concourse I think you enrobe in your own query the nut of a great answer : " Unless we invited people who are NOT working in the arts " As you know , that 's the dialogue to which we at the Arts &amp; Business Council(s) aspire : arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . But something for which we can all try harder . <p> I agree 110% . This line just takes the cake : Perhaps if we blew up the traditional conference format and got some new people in the room talking to each other we would succeed in moving the field conversation forward , as well ? <p> I speak from the perspective of someone who is continuously told she is " really young " ( I am 33 ) . Perhaps relatively speaking , I am . However , I know old models when I see them and what I 've experience in the past 8-10 years has been some new content or a new approach to spreading the word of the conference and content , but not a new model for the conference . I also spend a good amount of time at booking conferences where things are very much agent booths , programming folk wandering around , buy/sell mentality , and adjourn to a PD session , a showcase , and/or bar . And the PD sessions are led by the SAME type of people , covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I 've asked countless times to lead or co-lead a panel or create a new look for a session only to be told that the conference committee wants people with more experience ( I guess that means15-20 yrs in the field b/c I have 10 and that 's not good enough ) . <p> What is it going to take for this to change ? To be relevant ? Because really , I am the one in 10 years who will still be at it not the majority of the 50 year olds today . I need to go to conduct my business so unfortunately , I can not boycott it . But how hard is it to add some TED influence or BlogHer influence to all of this ? For the so called creative industry that we are to NOT lag behind in conference ideas and planning ? <p> I know this is bigger than just reformatting the conference model . When there are virtually no middle management positions in our industry who will attend and push for change , and the fresh young talent are n't  mentored or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same people are tapped to be sponsors , and change as a whole feared in an economic recession progress is very slow . <p> I wonder how ( or whether ) people " graduate " from one conference to anothereg as SXSW continues to be derided for being overrun by marketers , there 's bound to be someone who creates a new conference for the highly technical folks . In the for-profit marketplace , this " sorting " happens organically because there 's a profit motive and profit potential for creating a new conference . This may be less the case for the nonprofit artsif people are dissatisfied with their experience at XYZ art conference , are they going to create their own , or just decide to go to different industrys events ? <p> I also wonder how Twitter change the function of conferenceseg I recently went to a talk by the conf coordinator for TED , titled " How We Grew TED by Giving it Away " and it made me think a lot about how a conference might rethink the purpose of the conferenceif people are consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , and if networking is really all that people are getting out of conferences anymore , then what would a " networking only " conference look like ? <p> I suppose more generally you 've got to define for any event/product : who 's your target market , what is the unique value you 're providing to them , and what 's the best distribution model to get that value to that market . <p> Ive been attending about 6 conferences a year for just the past 3 or 4 years , and had a lot of boring sessions to tune out and dream about what a conference looks like that Im interested in . here 's a few ideas that come to mindsome totally antithetical to what would make a conference actually function . I wish I could see the slide deck or talking points for a panel/presentation BEFORE the conference begins . That way I could rely on the actual content , and not just the vague description in the program book , and someone elses definition of **30;650;TOOLONG . I would also have more time to reflect on those ideas before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive . I wish there were more variety in the length of sessionssome topics I want 20 people to give me a 5 minute pitch each of their ideas , on other topics I want a 3 hour block to get really down and dirty . I wish networking opportunities were more structuredmore like online dating . I fill out a profile of what I 'm looking for in a networking opp , what I can bring to the table , and the conference helps match me up with good professional contacts . I wish the environment could be as ( potentially ) inspiring as the conversation in the room . Nondescript hotel breakout rooms do n't  so much trigger my imagination . This goes the same for time of daywere theatre people . Why not conference from noon to midnight instead of 9 to 5 . I wish the several days of the conference built on ideas/topics from the previous days , or there was some unique theme for each day . I wish there was a " best of " day of final presentationsmuch like film festivals where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of the best and these are re-screened on the final day I wish there were more debates at arts conferences . One of the best TCG sessions I ever went to was right after Mike Daisey published HTFA , and the group debate at that years conference was provocative . I wish there was more problem solving happening in the room , eg : someone proposes what they see as an intractable problem &amp; the room proposes potential solutions . I wish speakers got more feedback from audience members about the session that just happened , and that feedback was used by future conferences in making better sessions . <p> What I do n't  know how to get around is the inherent self promotion that tends to run rampant at conferences . Consultants who use their sessions as a thinly guised pitch for their services , audience members who hog the conversation , speakers who over-promise how world changing and awesome their session is going to be , online participants who take quotes out of context &amp; can derail a productive conversation . <p> In my ( embarrassingly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ballroom D problem to be endemic . Perhaps the conference model can be reconceived along the lines that some arts orgs are evaluating their value proposition : 1 ) who is the audience ? 2 ) how best to reach them ? 3 ) what impact or outcomes are desired ? I would advocate for taking the first and third questions together and the second may answer itself . If the first and third are taken seriously , its unlikely that Ballroom D at the end of the Hutchinson concourse will be the answer . We are more likely to end up with participatory , diverse , media-rich , and INTERESTING sessions at professional conferences . <p> Linda my sincere apologies for the delay in getting this comment posted . For some reason WordPress did not send me an alert that new comments were posted so I was unaware that you had left one . Thanks for the comment here and your own post . <p> Wonderful post and comments ! People come to conferences with wildly different needs and interests , so I agree that the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish , and for whom . ( One reason conferences stay the same is that they serve needs of organizations and staff . ) This is especially important to figure out now that so many former conference functions are happening outside conferences . What are the best reasons for people to come together ? What can only be done in person ? <p> Harrison Owen ( inventor of Open Space ) and others have pointed out that the best part of conferences is the coffee breaks , so one thing to do is to make more of the conference be like that . <p> A large conference probably needs lots of different things going on , at lots of levels of expertise : presentations , inspiring speeches , new ideas from outside the field , participatory sessions , open-ended conversation , facilitated exploration , etc . But if there are over-arching questions or issues that affect the whole field , Open Space is a wonderful way to explore them . If the goal is for participants to learn something , learning can be enriched through participatory sessions . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with knowledge and experience . <p> I second the suggestion to use other kinds of spaces . Instead of hotels that might be anywhere , what about places with character , with sunlight and fresh air , with some sense of personality and place ? <p> Following the lead of Theater Communications Group , for this years opera conference in Boston , OPERA America launched a community website through Omnipress that we hope will stimulate discussion before , during and after the Annual Conference . The website is essentially a Facebook for conferences users set up a profile with a photo , bio and tags , and the system also allows the users to link their profiles to their LinkedIn and twitter accounts . Once registered , users can start conversations on moderated message boards , contact other conference attendees to set up meetings at the event and ask questions to speakers in advance of the sessions . <p> Nothing revolutionary yet , but I believe its a good start in the right direction . I would hope that as our members get more comfortable with this format , sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought up on discussion boards . <p> Great post Diane and lots of great comments . My favorite model is the world cafe model , which can be done with fairly large crowds . The questions are framed and then people sit in relatively small groups and drill fairly deeply into the issues . People move from table to table at predetermined intervals and one facilitator at each table keeps people up to speed on the main ideas that have been percolating in that group . Report backs at the end attempt to identify patterns , recurring themes , places where conversations get stuck , etc . Also , critical to participate in gatherings that are not arts-centric . We go round and round in circles looking for new ideas and innovations within a system that is totally exhausted . We need to draw support from other sectors , and to do that we need to be in the trenches , bringing our special skills as artists to discussions and initiatives around shared challenges . <p> ( full disclosure : Diane provided us with one of our best keynote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference organizer , I have my own wish list : that all conference presenters would submit their presentations in advance ; that we could always find the perfect venue with natural light , creative catering , small enough for intimacy &amp; large enough for everyone , and cheap ; that delegates would read the materials circulated beforehand and be prepared to share their ideas ; and that all pens / laptops / mikes would work on demand . Alas . <p> When a conference session really works when participants really listen and contribute , when new ideas surface , and some answers are found it makes it all worthwhile .

@@99220357 @3420357/ <h> What we have to do <p> Now its time to return to the main business of this blog , which of course is the future of classical music . <p> And also to return to something I stressed before my vacation , which is that the main business " the highest priority , the central focus " of people in our field should be to find a new audience . <p> This ought to be a no-brainer . As things are now , the old audience is n't being replaced , or at least not in anywhere near large enough numbers to sustain classical music institutions at the size they are now . Or to give smaller groups and solo musicians enough audience to survive . <p> Teaching classical music in our schools - " for so many people the beloved solution " really is n't much more than a dream . There are four problems with it : <p> How are we going to get classical music taught all over the US ( limiting myself just to the situation here ) , when , first , interest in classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ? My town of Warwick , NY closed one of its elementary schools last year , because of the economic crisis . This year it cut back so much on schoolbuses that police warned everyone driving a car to be careful of kids walking either to school , or to schoolbus stops that used to be much closer to their homes . With this going on , is Warwick suddenly going to start teaching classical music ? <p> How are we going to get people to agree to music education that highlights classical music - " a genre with an almost entirely white audience " in an age of growing diversity , with an emerging nonwhite majority ? <p> Why do we think that teaching kids classical music will turn them , later in life , into a paying classical audience ? Back in the 60s , classical music was widely taught , but that did n't  stop kids from rejecting it , and exploding toward rock instead . Why are kids going to reject the exciting , creative , deeply artistic music of our current culture , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if , in spite of the last three points , classical music spreads widely in our schools , and does produce a new audience , itll take decades before that new audience is large enough to make a difference . We do n't  have that much time . <p> So we have to find a new audience now , in other ways . Which means ( as I 've written many times before ) that classical music will have to change , because our culture has changed . Old-school classical performances wont , for the most part , speak to our current world . We have to find new ways of doing things . <p> I 've got a four-point proposal , for things that anyone presenting classical music should do . Itll be in my next post . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> Now tell me WHAT deeply artistic music culture is he talking about . Lady GaGa ? Jay-Z ? I saydo nothing . If the audience wants to grow up and seek out real culture , fine . I found it despite the 1960s self absorbed music nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crap . Either way , theyll deserve it . <p> An audience , yes . But maybe not a big enough audience to support the composers and performers playing the music . If you are a fan , you can have the luxury of snobbery , but for those of us who compose and perform classical music , this is not possible or desirable . <p> Aside from the economic necessity for growing an audience , I want to share classical music with more people because I love it and I believe it can enrich their lives . <p> There is music of much better quality than Jay-Z or Lady Gaga being produced , but it still does not meet classical standards , it is generally very underground , and many of its listeners already have some interest in classical music anyway , so I also have no idea what " deeply artistic music " is being referred to either . I do see that while many people are content with the mainstream , seemingly more people than ever , of all ages , are disillusioned with the " music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought out classical music or underground music , but others have lost interest in music altogether , and offering classical music to them would be worth a try . To find older classical works of value is not difficult , and plausible for most people with some spare time . To find new ones is very difficult , mainly because most sites of living composers feature an incredible amount of fluff about their **32;682;TOOLONG and next to no information about what their music actually sounds like . Perhaps there will be quotes from newspaper critics claiming one of their compositions was " vital " , " dynamic " , " vibrant " , " effervescent " or something else equally devoid of meaning , and some poorly recorded audio samples that turn out to be atonal chaos anyway . The largest exception to that pattern is Vox Saeculorum , who offer a clear indication of style , and audio samples that display plenty of competence , but then they have 20+ composers and it is practically impossible to find an album by one of them for sale . Now imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style with nothing existent except a few mp3 files and pages of sheet music per band would look . Then consider the ordeals that musicians have to go through that listeners do not ; for example , attempting to network with classical musicians , despite the capabilities of the internet , is basically unproductive torture . The premise of your comment is generally correct , but I can not see " do nothing " as the ideal plan of action when there is a situation where a few people listen to quality music , but rarely create it ( and will be ignored if they do ) , ultimately remaining culturally inferior to those who made it flourish . <p> Not sure Im going to post a tactical plan just now , but I 've had some posts about it in the past . Since you 're interested , and I 'm sure others are " and because its a crucial issue " I may summarize those past posts shortly . <p> Ha ha Richard you really need to get out more . Obviously there 's a hell of a lot more to contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is a great deal of stunning music . Maybe you could start with Radiohead <p> Maybe not , since Radiohead are basically as inept as any rap or bubblegum pop project ( if they are more skilled , then they refuse to demonstrate it at all , which is even worse ) . Almost every song I have heard from them consisted of a two second percussion loop , with much more cymbals than actual drums , and the same guitar motif repeated verbatim for about four minutes , accompanied by occasional droning notes from a synthesizer . Even deathcore bands include more content and display more virtuosity than that . <p> You 're listening to the wrong things check out the " grain of the voice " aspects , like the design of the guitar sounds , the way the vocal delivery interacts with the lyrics , the texture of the sound . Its like you 're complaining about Beethoven not having enough 13th chords or power chord distorted guitars . Or complaining about blues having only three chords , ignoring the main thing about it . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music looped for 4 minutes , I should pay attention to texture , since including texture in a 4-5 second loop will somehow make it sound as impressive as a full 4 minutes of music with actual counterpoint and thematic development . <p> I do not ignore the " main thing behind " blues , which is that it is the worst mistake in musical history . I am not inclined to complain about the lack of chordal variation , however , as it is less offensive than the disjunct melody , badly applied chromaticism , sloppy timing , and pitch bending that would repulse anyone with a serious interest in classical aesthetics . <p> Its easy to prove that any kind of music , any kind at all , is superior , if you take the things it does best and say that they 're the most important things music can do . So for you , the important things are counterpoint , thematic development , and ( apparently ) pure , unbent pitches . For someone else , its improvisation , for someone else subtleties of rhythm unknown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations of pitch , for someone else texture . Whos right ? No one . Music is too rich to be barricaded in these ways , to have fences erected inside which " and only inside which " is musical truth to be found . <p> Blues is the heart of American music Dymitry if you are closing your ears and mind so tightly against it , you will never understand American culture . What makes disjunct melody , rhythmic nuance and pitch bending automatically bad ? Do you also think French speakers are silly because they have different sounds from those in English ? <p> Youve got to be kidding ! I looked up the Vox Saeculorum website . Maybe I should send them some of my assignments from counterpoint classes . I was well taught in the French " Conservatoire de Paris " tradition ( Gedalge " School of Fugue " ) . I have n't noticed that there is a shortage of Baroque music . <p> I will never understand American " culture " anyway ; there are other regions of the world with cultures I may never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why people professionally involved with classical music are so apologetic about their own music and so concerned with defending things like blues , jazz , elderly millionaire rockstars , Hollywood , and American " culture " in general . Nor will I understand why those people have managed to run classical music into the ground with so little resistance . <p> What makes those characteristics automatically bad is that they sound bad , which was a universally held view prior to the twentieth century , and even today there are many underground musicians who avoid using them . Compositional treatises devoted space in the early pages emphasizing conjunct motion and balancing skips properly , and the sheet music never specified that performers bend their viol strings up to different pitches . <p> Dmitry , western culture in the past century has been profoundly influenced , musically , by cultures from various parts of the world , , especially Africa . Those cultures have their own ways of doing music , which now have been absorbed into the west . Classical mjusic needs to see itself as only one approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is . It hardly matters what the orthodox belief was in the past . Berlioz heard Chinese music in Paris , and thought it was ridiculous , because the musicians ( though only by western standards ) did n't  play in tune . We cant think that way anymore ! Which were doing , if we think the emphasis other cultures place on rhythm , texture , and microtonal inflections is inferior to what we stress in classical music . <p> The idea that everyone in the western world belongs to a single monolithic culture has little to do with reality . Countless members of different underground music scenes openly express a strong aversion to most popular culture , in forum posts , interviews , and lyrics . They are more tolerant of poor technique than I am , but when they do complain , their criticisms are often similar to my own . My criticisms are just more technical , as I have more experience studying music theory than they do , and draw more heavily from classical principles , as their discussions are usually not related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can write pieces that avoid audible non-European elements , then obviously so can classical composers . Everything else is just an excuse . <p> I mentioned compositional treatises not because I believe everything written in the past had to be correct , but because testing out their directions for myself provided generally very good results in spite of the variance between different authors writing in different countries and times . By looking at what they did have in common , it was easy to see that they shared underlying principles that worked well ; abandoning those principles lead to poor results . The " orthodox view " may have held everything else in low regard , but it never encroached upon traditional music making in other regions of the world to the degree that corporate pop has . The way Berlioz reacted may not have helped diplomatic relations , but there are certainly enough people in China to support their own music , and few of them should lose any sleep over whether some people halfway around the world think it is out of tune . <p> One only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of one standard for classical listeners , another for everyone else . The only comment sections online where I have seen anyone babble about how " this other style is equally valid " , have been classical ones . The overwhelming majority of statements praising mainstream rock bands were posted on classical forums , and the minority of criticisms . One time I have actually seen someone start a topic complaining that another site claimed classical music was superior to other styles ; this might have made sense had the forum been anything other than a classical forum . The list could go on for several times as long , yet in spite of that , it is the classical listeners who are constantly being reminded to show more humility or admiration for pop culture . One can contrast with the regulars at an industrial forum exchanging stories of how their music bothers other people in public , with one in the habit of telling any of his critics to " go listen to your whiny indie garbage " . What really is unfortunate is that there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do listen to " whiny indie garbage " . <p> It is nice to have so much condensed proof to show others both what a self-deprecating politically correct farce classical music has turned into , as well as that classical participants really do try to tell people how they can and can not think ( not that it would ever affect how I behave , but it was something others were incredulous about ) in one convenient page , so this will be my final comment . <p> Well , of course music is divided into tiny subcultures . Which often hate each other . This is n't news . Lester Bangs talked about it in his Elvin obituary , back in 1977 . The one whose final words were : " I wont say goodbye to Elvis . Ill say goodbye to you . " Because he and you doubtless listened to different music , as would not have been the case some years earlier . <p> But note a difference between the sites you 're talking about , and the situation in classical music . If fans of dark metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genre supports itself in the marketplace , and does n't  demand any special privileges . <p> Classical music does demand them . It demands funding , public funding for its new concert halls , and education for schoolkids that gives it special prominence . Schools , in other words , should teach people to like classical music . I 've seen jazz people demand the same for jazz , and also have heard it from a member of the Guitar Institutes board , because ( or so he said ) not enough kids were studying the guitar , and so should be taught it in schools . <p> Classical music backs up its demands with assertions of how much better classical music is . And also fails badly when going out into the world to find new listeners , because it does n't  understand or respect the existing musical taste of the people its trying to reach . <p> Nobody would seriously say that fans of combative pop genres are doing anything similar . They 're not demanding public money , and they 're not demanding that kids should be taught to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music is special , and needs to be fought . <p> I will never understand American " culture " anyway ; there are other regions of the world with cultures I may never understand either . What I also will never understand is why people professionally involved with classical music are so apologetic about their own music and so concerned with defending things like blues , jazz , elderly millionaire rockstars , Hollywood , and American " culture " in general . Nor will I understand why those people have managed to run classical music into the ground with so little resistance . <p> What makes those characteristics automatically bad is that they sound bad , which was a universally held view prior to the twentieth century , and even today there are many underground musicians who avoid using them . Compositional treatises devoted space in the early pages emphasizing conjunct motion and balancing skips properly , and the sheet music never specified that performers bend their viol strings up to different pitches , no matter how much feeling was intended . <p> Dim Dymitry , Do you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements ? You do realize , do n't  you , that when he and Kodaly collected folk songs , some were collected in areas that were part of the former Ottoman Empire ? This music was greatly influenced by middle eastern music , and can be found in Bartoks work . <p> I 'm sorry about the " dim " , I did n't  mean it . There is something buggy with the comment box . When I typed in the " Enter your comment here " line did n't  go away , so I " tabbed " and started again .

@@99220358 @3420358/ <p> Let me start with some optimism . If you have any audience at all , you can make it bigger . If you believe in yourself , that is , and ( of course ) if other people want to hear your music . But do n't  assume they wo n't ! You never know how big an audience you can have until you try to build one . And if you do n't  believe that anyone wants to hear you , why are you playing music , singing , composing- presenting performances ! Even if what you do appeals to just a few people , you can find a few more . And inflame their passion for what you do . <p> So if you 're a student , and four friends come to your recital , along with your teacher and your family , maybe you can get eight friends to come . Or get your friends to bring their friends <p> But let 's aim higher ! Why ca n't at least a few Juilliard students find fans all over New York , so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they give concerts ? ( George Nickson , who took my Classical Music in an Age of Pop course at Juilliard last spring , told me he got 400 people at his recital the year before , when he was in Boston , graduating from NEC . ) <p> Why should n't the young musicians in the Academy Juilliard 's project with Carnegie Hall have eager fans their own age , showing up when they give concerts ? <p> And why should n't at least a few alt-classical musicians Maya Beiser , say sell 10,000 , 20,000 , or even 50,000 copies of their tremendously appealing albums , crossing over from the art market ( very limited ) into the pop arena , without changing anything they do ? ( Bands that do n't sound all that different from these people are , I 'm sure , already selling in those numbers . ) <p> Crazy thinking ? No . To me it 's crazy not to think this way . <p> So how do you start ? More on that in posts to come . What you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one thing that everyone should do . Look at who your fans are now , and find ways to bind them to you very tightly , and to increase their number . <p> George Nickson , by the way , invited some bands to share the bill with him . And played with them . So you might think it was easy for him to fill the hall . The bands had fans of their own . Which is true , but he also promoted extensively . And he had to devise a program that would be coherent not , for instance , some music by the bands , and then , unrelated , some classical pieces . I 've seen that done , and its not convincing . Especially if you want to get some of the bands fans to come to your future events ! <p> Which then is another key point about blended classical-pop programming . For a classical musician , that might just be a first step . You might later want to do fully classical concerts , but draw in some of the pop fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy . And which tells us that blended pop-classical programming is n't the simple no-brainer some people might think it is . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> Your points are valid , and with the internet providing extra opportunities to build young audiences through fans , friends and colleagues of the younger musicians , they are able to reach a wider audience simply through networking online . Of course , I chime in with your last statement , because I 've been doing the classical-pops programming since the middle 1980s . Many presenters who were working back then would remember my concerts of Gershwin ( Rhapsody in Blue ) and Liszt ( Concerto #1 ) , or Keith Emerson ( Concerto #1 ) with Chopin ( Andante Spianato et Grande Polonaise ) . Now , I have added Neil Sedakas " Manhattan Intermezzo " to the mix and the Leroy Anderson Piano Concerto , which can pair with a shorter work ( the Cesar Franck " Symphonic Variations " is a favorite , although I have n't seen it pop up on recent symphony programs ) . These are just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing similar . You are correct , Greg , that it is not the simple no-brainer and can only work if you have conductors interested to attract both sides of their listening audience . Another aspect concerns the composer . If todays composers write in a style which blends the two worlds , the new composition can be billed as such . For one , as I have mentioned in previous comments , Ellen Taaffe Zwilich is good at this , by adding a trap set and other interesting percussion instruments to the standard orchestral instrumentation . <p> Another angle in promoting a concert with a presenter , if it involves a new work , is to invite the composer to attend . It depends on the budget of the organization , but can add a remarkable energy to the event . Yes , Neil Sedaka has attended a performance of his new piano concerto , and Keith Emerson has ( and will do so in the future ) as well . This is , of course , the icing on the cake , as audiences have the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated musicians , but to have the chance to mingle with them . They can not always attend , naturally , but it has been done . <p> The examples above are only a few , and the young musicians of our time are very savvy and experienced with technology . One thought they might employ is to hook up their performances to an internet service and stream the event online , which might gain a wider audience for them over time . Or , perhaps the local radio station can record their performance and stream it at a later date . They might also search for local interest groups through the social network they are signed to . A simple posting of a performance at one of these local groups might attract x number of new listeners to the event . <p> I cant see Juilliard students building their own audiences . That kind of independence goes against the master tradition , and that kind of concern with worldly matters goes against the supposed total dedication to Art . <p> If NEC is a different scene , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from New York and Carnegie Hall . <p> I think many of the students would build their audiences , if they could . And would appreciate help in doing it . The school as a whole is just beginning to enter this territory . As are most music schools . The obstacle , I think , is n't the physical Carnegie Hall , or closeness to it . Its what I might call the Carnegie Hall within . And that well find at most music schools , I think . NEC might be different because its president , Tony Woodcock , forcefully takes a new path . But I 'm sure we can all name music schools far from New York that have just as much Carnegie Hall inside them as any NYC school might . 25395 @qwx885395 25409 @qwx885409 25393 @qwx885393 25408 @qwx885408 25394 @qwx885394 25401 @qwx885401 25400 @qwx885400 <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> @gsandow <h> Resources 25399 @qwx885399 25403 @qwx885403 25402 @qwx885402 25410 @qwx885410 25404 @qwx885404

" <p> That must have been tomato sauce or , more likely , ketchup probably Heinz in our conventional household . We have no idea how the ghosts corpse tasted . <p> I would n't blame Moms particular meatloaf for that . No matter how good the food she gave us every single night was , our kitchen-table meals tended toward forgettable . Dad was rarely home for them , - which may have been both the cause and the effect of our sullen suppers . <p> One of my fine Facebook friends in the deep Midwest likes to promote her circles meatloaf contests , which is why I decided never to post a photo of actual meatloaf ready on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bank to imagine that something so mud-ugly could make anyone happy ? <p> But camera-ready or not , the end of 2011 is my meatloaf moment . <p> The ever-twee village of Bellport , New York , on Long Islands glistening South Shore , has a block-long commercial center of shops . Anchoring these is a small supermarket called Wallens . <p> It had been the Roulston Grocery Store , which moved across main street in the 30s to its present site , taking over the Comet Theater where in 1917 Irving Berlin sang " Yip-Yip-Yaphank " ( or " Yip ! Yip ! Yaphank ! " - according to a 1918 review in the New York Times , which must be right , no matter what the sheet music says ) . If you look hard , you can see remnants of the old vaudeville dressing rooms in Wallens storage area . <p> As long as I 've been shopping there , Wallens has offered a freshly ground " meat loaf mix " : one-third each of beef , veal , pork , sometimes in three discrete lumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and my gratitude rises especially high for their boned legs of lamb , having learned the hard way ( from Beck , Bertholle and Childs Mastering the Art of French Cooking ) how wrist-aching and messy it is to bone the thing myself . Did the sweat of pride season my first , garlic-larded result ? Sure it did ; always does . <p> Decades later , just as I have fashioned a meatloaf worth writing about , Wallens announces it must close . <p> Yes , some disasters are local . This December , as before , you pull open the door to a sepia , quasi-utopian zone . You slow down ; your iPhone dissolves . Norman Rockwell fantasies are seductive and usually emotionally false , but when corn-flake nostalgia takes neighborly , shopping-bag form a few blocks away , its hard to resist taking part . The Jean Arthur-Jimmy Stewart you in this scenario could really be you . Why in heaven not ? <p> Wallens price for Hellmans mayo is higher than that at the " local " Stop &amp; Shop , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate bargain . And after the farmstands close at Thanksgiving , Wallens still finds apples , broccoli , - cabbage , cauliflower grown within pickup distance to put in its cool produce bins . <p> After Wallens closes , will I have to grind it myself ? <p> My praise wont save the store , not now or a year from now . Yet every writer knows that we treasure most what we know well lose , so we pretend to try . <p> With a cossetting smile , the butcher tells me that even though theyll be gone , all will be well , thanking me for my concern . Im relieved for him , but how could all be well or tolerable if I cant get my meatloaf mix ? <p> I have spent years making fun of meatloaf , which technically is a way to stretch meat a primitive Hamburger Helper . Those who claim that day-old-meatloaf sandwiches are better than the steaming aromatic preliminary have been easy to knock down , in a " so you love leftovers ? " way . <p> They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth getting cold in the first place . <p> The problem with meatloaf is its total surrender : each ingredient just gives up . Keeping the animal muscle moist with milky breadcrumbs and canned tomato is n't enough ; the parts should gain and strengthen through their baking , not wave the gray-meat flag the moment they spy an oven . <p> Yet a meatloafs blending of identities , not ideal for creativity but the essence of democratic cooking , should result in a satisfying culinary negotiation . I have never cooked or eaten great meatloaf , because that 's not a possibility , but I 'd like to offer one you could bed down with . <p> I am aware that home cooks across the country will draw swords at my claim , but martial meatloafing is not the point . The sweetest thing about meatloaf is that there 's no best one . Its a meat mirror , reflecting the face of the one cooking it , and the one eating . All I may do is show myself in the following flexible recipe , developed over many winter tries : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ground chuck , under 80 percent lean best ; or that fatty chuck and some ground pork too , up to half . <p> 1 raw egg <p> 1/2 cup of fresh or dried breadcrumbs ( or panko ) with or without crusts , makes no great difference <p> Place the chopped meat in the largest bowl you have , handling the sticky mass as if it were fluffy . Make a well in the middle and crack your egg in . If you squint , the yolk will look like a glazed orange garnet set in a brooch of deep carnelian . That shining jewel , I realize , is my only foregone meatloaf memory , one that waits for red-tipped fingers to break it . <p> Loosely chop the vegetables , prunes , and possible anchovy into chunks , and either Cuisinart them quickly to retain some texture or continue to mince by hand . <p> Oh , before you do that , soak the breadcrumbs in milk or the gelatined beef broth . A recipe for meatballs in the Sarcoptes or " Meat Mincer " chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its filler , which you may do too . One ripped slice of any bread in that same machine above takes a few seconds to crumb . <p> Add the vegetable mixture and sodden crumbs to the bowl , with modest amounts of salt and whichever pepper . I season by eye . You do n't  want to mask or strip the flavor that sits in the meat ; you hope to provide accompaniment . <p> We were given hands in order to stick them into Cthulhu treats- such as the one in front of you , so pretend you 're mud-wrestling or caught in quicksand and squish everything around until a single , though particulate , tone is reached . Do n't  squeeze and press the air out ; play staccato piano in the bowl . Do not even think to answer the phone or door until you are done . <p> Add more milk or a dash of vinegar if too dry ; more dry crumbs if too wet . <p> No need to rinse your hands . Grab half the stuff and place in half the pan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few inches high , sides away from the edge so an almost-crust may form . Do the same in the other half . Manipulate the pair so they at least appear to be the same size ( they never are ) , which also allows them to cook at about the same rate . <p> Present the unattractive duo to your eating partner as if they were a kings ransom , put em in the oven and bake for a little more than half an hour ( depends upon how cold the meat is when you start ) to an internal temperature of 155 degrees that 's all . A siren fragrance will fill your kitchen , one that invites you to the food , but paradoxically always surpasses it . <p> Remove the pan and test the loaves if you need to .

What Is It ? <p> " Times are changing for the traditional exhibition catalogue , " I write in the September issue of The Art Newspaper . Its a subject I 've pondered before , but for the recently published feature , I dug much deeper , prying some rule-of-thumb numbers from sources and discovering several worthy experiments . <p> The Los Angeles County Museum of Art , for example , is offering a print-on-demand anthology of articles for its Manly Pursuits : The Sporting Images of Thomas Eakins exhibition , rather than a traditional catalogue . ( His The Champion Single Sculls is at left . ) <p> The Philadelphia Museum of Art produced no catalogue for its recent Picasso and the Avant-Garde in Paris , initially thinking it would publish one online , but later deciding to post a " gallery guide " allowing online visitors to " walk through " the exhibition remotely . <p> And , since 2002 , the Brooklyn Museum has produced " mini-catalogues " for smaller exhibitions whose content and budget do n't  allow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6- by 9-inches , hard-bound , fewer than 100 pages , and printed on the museums onsite four-color press . <p> Behind those experiments are factors like these : <p> Production costs paper , ink , printing , binding and so on for 10,000 copies of a 250-300 page book typically range from $150,000 to $250,000 . <p> Add in the time spent by curators on research , writing and editing , the fees paid to outside authors , reproduction rights for dozens of images , design costs , distribution , and so on , and the actual cost per book can reach into three-figures . So they are all money-losers . <p> As few as 2% of people visiting an exhibition usually buy the catalogue . 5% is a big deal . <p> The more popular an exhibition is , and the more familiar the artist is , the lower the sell-through rate . That 's because popular shows draw wider audiences , composed of regular museum-goers who may feel they know the artist and occasional visitors whose interest in art is less serious ; apparently , neither category wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catalogue . <p> Its pretty clear that museums would like to dispense with these big catalogues , possibly in favor of e-books . They cant for two reasons lenders to a big traveling show want a catalogue and reproduction rights for pictures online catalogues are more difficult to obtain . <p> What 's emerging may be a hybrid , with a printed catalogue where some elements like the checklist are left out and available only online . <p> Or , back at LACMA , for California Design , 1930-1965 : Living in a Modern Way , beginning in October , 2011 , a curators wish to include a directory of designers and manufacturers in the catalogue led to a different solution : a stand-alone , print-on-demand book , possibly with pictures of artists in their studios , not of objects in the exhibition , is in the offing . <p> Read the whole article on my website . All of this , seems to me , is good . <h> Comments <p> It will be a shame for these catalogs to go the way of the dodothey ( the catalogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their essays and high-quality images often the only access to the material we people out in the boondocks have . Online photos and online reading just do n't  stack up to expertly printed versions . And as I often tell my history students , the catalogs themselves become historical documents pointing to attitudes , limits of knowledge , prevailing theories of a given time and place . <p> Nice article . Catalogues are but one type of " didactic " that museums use lengthy artwork and wall labels , as well as brochures and audiotapes are the others and it seems that hiring critics or historians to write publishable essays is the mark of a show that is to be taken seriously . For those writers , they may well want the hardcopy catalogues for their own files . Additionally , I have noticed from time to time that reviewers at the New York Times appear to review the catalogue essay more than the actual exhibition . Those catalogues ( or the essays from them ) are probably sent to the reviewers in advance of their coming to the exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose oeuvre may not be properly covered in up to date monographs . Often the organizing institution is situated in the provincial birthplaces of artists , or backwaters where they later spent much time . The economics of these exhibitions usually relies on local government funding and corporate sponsorship within the immediate community . The shows deserve to be called " monographic " not just because they concentrate on the work of a single artist ; they are also often accompanied by serious monographic catalogues . As a rule , these books would be economically unfeasible if they were published without the subsidies and the audience created by exhibitions . In this way , local community pride has enriched the art historical literature over the years . It would be a shame if slipshod online publishing where to end this tradition . <p> I love the catalogues but the prices nowadays are way too steep I have a couple from the past that are treasures de Kooning , Vermeer , Van Gogh but that 's all . It would be better for the public , if not the donors/lenders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing the works , a bit about them , a MAP of the exhibition space ( usually sadly lacking ) People might pay a couple dollars , like $5 , for such . Do n't  forget one has already paid a considerable sum to see one of these blockbusters . Why continue to publish a loser ? <p> Yes , most catalogs are money-losers , just as symphony orchestras , nonprofit theatres , museums , and universities are " money-losers " .

@@99220367 @3420367/ <h> Vegas comes to City Hall . Sorta . <p> One of the more surreal evenings that I 've spent in my many years in San Francisco was spent on Saturday night at a lavish corporate party at San Francisco City Hall . <p> The party was thrown by a tech company called Computers and Structures Inc ( CSI ) which I 'd never heard of before . CSI is- a structural and earthquake engineering software firm based in Berkeley , California . Its headed up by a very flamboyant , fun-lovin , lady-admirin structural engineer by the name of Ashraf Habibullah. - <p> Now normally I do n't  go to these kinds of events . For one thing , I do n't  get invited . And for another , I 'm usually out seeing performances . For a third , corporate events are not really my kind of scene . But when a choreographer friend of mine who has directed the entertainment portion of previous parties thrown by CSI ( apparently the City Hall shindig is an annual occurrence ) invited me , I accepted mostly for two reasons . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economic recession ; and two , I was curious about- Habibullah , the host for the evening . <p> The Pakistani-American entrepreneur has a passion for the arts . He s a co-founder of the Diablo Ballet- company and started an organization called- the Engineers Alliance for the Arts which encourages school kids to explore the links between art , technology and structural engineering . In other words , - Habibullah is no ordinary engineering firm CEO . <p> The work of Diablo Ballet is a far cry- from the Las Vegas theme of- Habibullahs party though . <p> The setup was tacky and fun and probably pretty pricey . There were carefully-made , large-scale mock-ups of Vegas architectural landmarks and the company had hired what seemed to be top-of-the-line pop star impersonators . <p> At one point in the evening , a cavalcade that included a lookalike Elvis , Cher , Celine Dion , Madonna and Michael Jackson performed short snippets of hit pop songs on the grand staircase flanked by feather-and-sequin-clad chorus girls . The lookalikes were mostly pretty convincing , unlike the few performers who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( badly ) that staple of the contemporary Vegas entertainment scene , the Blue Man Group . <p> Our host looked like he was having a great time throughout . He insisted that every guest had their picture taken with him as they walked in and loved giving people hugs . I admired his outfit : Habibullah- was wearing a custom-made suit which glimmered with tiny winking lights . His shoes flashed with the same LEDs . <p> Despite the attention to detail , one thing that was curiously absent from the Vegasification of City Hall was the gambling . I wonder why this form of entertainment , which is closer to the heart of Sin City culture even than Celine Dion , was kept out of the proceedings ? I guess corporations that spend perhaps a quarter of a million dollars on a party do n't  want to be reminded of the easy come easy go nature of cash-flow . <p> I personally found the metaphor of the slot machine-less Vegas to be a bit creepy in this context . San Francisco is a city whose wealth has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That a Bay Area corporation should arrange a Vegas-themed party in the seat of local government without recognizing this irony in an upfront way seems like willful ignorance . <p> P.S. Its interesting to consider how much money might have been dropped on this black-tie party for about 800 guests . City Hall is surprisingly inexpensive to rent for a space of its size and history . From the website that displays the fees , it looks like that aspect of the evening might have come in at around $12,500 . But the cost of the amazing amounts of delicious food ( which ranged from made-in-the-moment sushi to Indian fare ) and drink , the transformative decor and the entertainment must not have been slight . <h> Comments <p> The food was Pakistani , not Indian . Habibullah is a Muslim name , and that is why there was no gambling . ( Muslims do n't  gamble . ) Willful ignorance ? As a journalist in the genre of arts and culture , you ought to do your research before you print . <p> Thank you for correcting me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being Indian at least Ive ordered most of them at various Indian restaurants Ive eaten at in recent history . As for the fact that Muslims do n't  gamble : why pick Vegas as a theme then if you 're going to keep the most obvious thing about Vegas out of it ?

The aural " processing " in terms of interval class 3 and octatonic structuring is complicated by the sheer rapidity of change <p> If this is the best assurance we can get from someone who understands Le Marteau well enough to correct Koblyakovs misconceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever making detailed aural sense of the piece . As Fred Lerdahl famously wrote ( and Taruskin quotes it in his history ) , &lt; <p> Boulezs Le Marteau sans Maitre ( 1954 ) was widely hailed as a masterpiece of post-war serialism . Yet nobody could figure out , much less hear , how the piece was serial . From hints in Boulez ( 1963 ) , Koblyakov ( 1977 ) at last determined that it was indeed serial , though in an idiosyncratic way . In the interim , listeners made what sense they could of the piece in ways unrelated to its construction . Nor has Koblyakovs decipherment subsequently changed how the piece is heard . The serial organization of Le Marteau&gt; would appear , 30 years later , to be irrelevant . The story is , or should be , disturbing . ( " Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems , " in Generative Processes in Music , Oxford , 1988 ) <p> I agree . I 'm disturbed @ @ @ @ @ and yet , just as I could n't decipher Le Marteau on my own without Koblyakovs almost grudging help , neither had I been able to tease any detailed sense out of Stravinskys Requiem Canticles before Joseph Strauss Stravinskys Late Music appeared . ( Koblyakov proudly asserts that he analyzed Le Marteau without seeing Boulezs sketches , which are apparently lost , but I gather Straus had access to Stravinskys notes . ) In my youth I struggled vainly to relate the luscious quadruple flute chords from the Interlude ( so proto-Feldmanesque , although Feldman was already doing similar things ) to any kind of pitch order drawn from the first movement : <p> What a relief it was to learn that the chords are drawn from the first two-note columns in an array of four rows , prime , retrograde , inversion , and retrograde inversion : <p> And , going on , the two chords in the fifth measure are drawn from columns 3 and 4 , respectively . The relationship of this fat A-flat 9 chord , drawn from two notes each from four different row forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content is just as tenuous as the order of Boulezs chord multiplications . Here and elsewhere , its almost like Stravinsky wrote out his row forms in some interesting logical order and then just glanced around for groups of pitches he liked that happened to be adjacent on the page . Of course , that gorgeous chord locked in the choice of other chords following it , quasi-randomly determined , with little musical function of their own but to resolve back to the initial one . The approach seems more charmingly intuitive , almost accidental or even opportunistic , than theoretical . Im reminded of Bill Duckworths piece from the 1970s Pitch City , in which the players are given a map for improvising their way through a row matrix . <p> ( I was also amused to read in Strauss book about Boulezs and Stravinskys relationship . Despite the flattering interest Stravinsky showed in the young Boulez , Boulez led a disastrous 1958 performance of Stravinskys Threni , and frequently made public his contempt for all of Stravinskys post-1923 music . In 1970 Stravinsky said , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after visiting me in Hollywood three years ago , he talked about my latest compositions with unforgivable condescension , then went on to play them at a prestigious concert in Edinburgh . This was not the first proof of disingenuousness I had had of that arch-careerist , but it will be the last in which I have any personal connection . " ( Stravinskys Late Music , p. 34 , n. 66 ) I 'm not sure " arch-careerist " is the precise term for someone who bites the hand that could feed him , but I do feel certain that , even with my stunted sense of political advantage-taking , I would have returned the solicitations of Igor Stravinsky more graciously than that . ) <p> In neither the case of Le Marteau nor Requiem Canticles does the technique seem to have any perceptible relation to the unifying idea of a 12-tone row . In the case of Requiem Canticles , though , it does n't  matter to me , because I 've always loved the piece and I always will ; it and Threni are among my favorite Stravinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed of Stravinsky fan . ( Straus goes concept-by-concept too , but with his broad hints Ive been able to trace the rows through half of Threni . ) I 'm curious to find out how Requiem Canticles was composed , but the knowledge wont influence the way I listen to it , and I did n't  care what the process " turned out " to be . In Le Marteaus case , however , I have always been baffled by the music , was never able to learn to love it or even like it or remember any of it , and finding out what total disregard for perceptibility it was written with is more likely to reinforce my dismissive attitude toward it than to make me listen more sympathetically . ( Im with- this guy . ) And yet I do love some of Boulezs later music , particularly Pli selon pli and Rituel . <p> Going further into all this is bracing me for the big philosophical question I 'm expecting from the students this fall : Why use 12-tone method ? What was the point ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I mentioned in modernism class that some composers deviate from strict use of the row , they became indignant ; if you believe in the theory , they said , you should trust it devoutly , and if not you should abandon it . ( Young people can afford to be so pure . ) The music itself will have to convince them that its not so black and white : that the row is sometimes a unifying factor , sometimes a melody , sometimes a note generator , sometimes a pretext , sometimes an ideological weapon , sometimes a bad idea entertained for too long , sometimes even a Rorschach test . But I think I can convince them some beautiful music happened in spite of it , if not always because of it . <h> Comments <p> Amazing to think that mainstream media actually cared about such things a mere 30 years ago . Around that time , the Harvard Lampoon produced a parody of Newsweek , in which the results of a " readers survey " appeared . One of the survey questions was : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoenberg ! scream our readers . " Fourth and last was " the emphatically flat Pierre Boulez , proving that music is not the universal language . " <p> " if you believe in the theory , they said , you should trust it devoutly , and if not you should abandon it . ( Young people can afford to be so pure . ) " I will never forget a young , pure student leaping to his feet , convinced that hed caught a mistake in Lichter Wasser , and asking Stockhausen if he realized he had repeated a note that broke with his tone row ( at that point , Stockhausen called them formulas ) . Stockhausen had spent hours upon hours drilling into our heads how his formulas shaped every moment in the music , how all of the music germinated from the formulas . When confronted with evidence that he had n't  quite followed his own strict pattern , Stockhausen shrugged and said , " I wanted to repeat that note " By that point , Stockhausen had been deviating from his own patterns for 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he cared about pleasing his sense of drama more than any system hed devised . So , if the Grand Poobah of total serialization can laugh it off when he wants to , I 'd say your students can too . <p> Ah , what a fine good old subject ! If I may attempt some answers of my own to the question of " Why serialism " First , I 'd suggest the difference with Cageian chance is that chance ends up being more wild , or more honestly so . Cage is not going to avoid any octaves and triads , but the serial system can and will usually be skewed towards the appearance of certain favorite interval distribution patterns . Secondly , in some composers the use of symmetries and the like was very expressive . Third , the most important thing in serialism is I believe not the series , but the way it made people aware of the single pitch and the single interval , and the parametrization of music . The best work in the style shows a great awareness of precision for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note and which can sound exhilarating when done well . By giving every note its own place in the structure , it seems as if every note is saying something even if it is not in a " language " you can actually understand , and that 's great a music that almost entirely consists of articulations , but not of " words " . Early Stockhausen in this regard is to my ears vastly preferable to Boulez . Finally , of course it really started taking off when higher order textural concerns were being studied at their proper level of structural abstraction . Hence Xenakis , who I would say is easily the greatest of all the European composers of that generation.KG replies : I never meant to imply that European serialism did n't  bring about a welcome revolution in the area of musical texture . But as your non-12-tone example of Xenakis definitively clinches , why did it require a 12-tone row ? <p> I do n't  even think of Rituel and Pli selon pli as being particularly late Boulez ! Rituel is a great piece , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in marked opposition to everything else Ive heard of his ) . The only real early music of Boulez I 've heard are the piano sonatas , which I cant get a grip on at all . Its amazing that its the same composer who wrote such lushly beautiful pieces as explosante-fixe Its hard for me to think of any twelve-tone piece in which perceiving anything interesting about the way that it was put together is actually possible without a score and a few pencils . Maybe Bergs violin concerto ? And I guess some Webern he s so minimal that his scores sometimes read more like the architectural scaffolding of actual pieces.KG replies : I did n't  mean they were late Boulez , just later than Le Marteau . <p> Kyle : with the example of Xenakis , the argument I would make is that the twelve-tone row was the instrument to get to parametric thinking . Would other instruments have been thinkable ? Probably . Of course the case can still be made that Messiaens " Mode " was more influential than anything else . But they seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of form . The problem of course being that parametric thought does not have any kind of internal temporal logic , like tonality does . I 'd say the row as a transitional instrument was useful because it combines a parametric view of materials , which is " a-temporal " , with temporal organization . That is again a reason why row composition is different from Cageian chance composition , of course , Cage understanding parametric thought and its implications in the time domain more profoundly than Boulez . ( But , of course , Cages major inventions in this area were influenced by European serialism to some degree ) So the row combines an atemporal way of looking at materials with a temporalizing logic , and also it does so on the basis of a sense of harmonic completeness ( you manipulate every pitch , interval , etc. in the gamut ) . I do think its a very clumsy tool , however , and perhaps Boulez intricacies are symptoms of his recognition of this fact . ( Appropriately , the spambot-filter words I have to type for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see all that . Talking about European 12-tone music and American 12-tone music , you know , are like talking about two almost entirely different animals . In America it became such an ideological article of faith , and you strayed from the letter of the law at your spiritual peril . In the 60s Berio and Zimmermann and Ligeti wandered away from serialism with a nonchalance unknown in America ; here every individual apostasy brought a threat of academic execution . One of the challenges is going to be teaching both these conceptions of the style in one class . <p> In that respect , Kyle , how do you see Carters work ? He was never really serial . Isnt it that in the States , serialism has primarily meant Schoenbergs influence , whereas in Europe , he was conveniently absent ? ( Still , there have been scandals about things like octaves oooo ! in Darmstadt around the time of the later 50s ! ) Perhaps a unified narrative works something like this ? There was a pre-war European modernism that continued in the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stravinsky . But in Europe , the absence of this tradition because of the war opened the way to truly experimental approaches . These , however , were soon brought to blossom in the States most clearly by Cage and his tradition Cage being uniquely positioned , having ( 1 ) studied with Schoenberg ; ( 2 ) corresponded with Boulez in the late 40s ; ( 3 ) been able to connect it all to an existing , very American tradition that includes people like Ives , Cowell and Var+se ( and ( 4 ) also been able to connect it all to what was happening in the other arts in post-war NYC ) . Cage then would be the American " serialist " in the European sense of the word , whereas the American sense of the word simply does not have any real representatives in Europe post-WW II , Boulez &amp; Stockhausen already trying to get away from the strictures of the row almost from the moment they first started using it . Youd have the row as subjective language ( pre-war European developments , with Webern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th century contrapuntal models ) , as disciplining structure ( American academicism ) and as " line of flight " ( experimentalism , using the row as a ladder to be thrown away ) . That makes for a nice tripartite dialectical model ! KG replies : That sounds pretty good . I guess Carters works have a more expressionist , European profile , but I think he cares as little as Babbitt does whether you can hear what he s doing or not . Americans may be more satisfied with what 's on paper . <p> There was a point in time when I was really into the 12-tone method , but I 've always enjoyed the 2nd Vienese Schools music much more than any of the post-war serialists that came afterwards . Like your analysis above , it bothered me that the pitch choices of the latter pieces seemed largely arbitrary , and that if you were clever enough you could probably justify almost anything if you wanted to . Even " traditional " methods of transposition , inversion , and retrogrades I could n't see what the point was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impetus behind the method has always been to give each pitch equal weight . In that case , the most diciplined thing to do would be to repeat the row over and over without straying at all , which is something you can actually hear . I wrote a piece using that idea , giving each instrument its own tone-row to give " character " ( and idea I stole from Carter , where he assigns intervals to each instrument ) and it turned out pretty comical : <p> Like 5 people talking to each other , but not really communicating since they 're all completely unwaivering . After that piece I pretty much gave up on the method altogether because I could n't really use it without it turning into a parody of itself . If you want to hit " all the pitches " you can do that intuitively ( like a lot of improvisers do ) or use rules of harmonic modulation if you want some sort of theoretical justification behind what you 're doing . And these sort of things you can actually hear , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonate with people much better than his later , more formalized works . <p> Boulez and Stockhausen et al . took that formalized process to the next level , but the premise itself was shoddy so I do n't  think it can really be justified from an intellectual point of view . Boulez probably disliked Cage mostly because the latter composer illuminated arbitrariness behind these types of structures and posed a threat to the music-theory castle that the former had built for himself . If you 're just writing whatever you want , why create an overly elaborate pretense ? <p> Now that I 've been out of school for a while why nobody wants to listen to that kind of stuff seems pretty obvious . Advocates say that it makes more " sense " the more you study and listen to it , but I think that any honest inquiry will lead anybody towards the opposite direction . Its hard to realize that from the inside , though . <p> Riegger employed a loodey-goosey 12 tone technique in his 3rd symphony , so there has been an american tradition of non-ideological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for " Ordnung " is behind Schoenbergs " discovery " . German speaking folks fear chaos , we thrive on it.KG replies : I was listening to that piece last night as a possible replacement for the Copland , and angry because I forgot to bring the score home from my office . I 'm also looking into his 2nd Quartet , but I forget whether its 12-tone . <p> Come on , Derive II and Sur Incises are lovely , sensuous works . Take your point on the rest of it though.KG replies : Since I complimented some Boulez works after Le Marteau , I have no idea what the " come on " is in response to . <p> Kyle , since you 've dropped the Copland 12-tone pieces from your syllabus , how about adding Irving Fine , either the Symphony ormy personal favoritehis Fantasia for String Trio . Very exciting and discernible use of rows most of the time as well as tuneful and rhythmically inventive all the time . FJOKG replies : Do n't  know either piece . ! ! ! <p> The Time news story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my iPod this week gorgeous stuff ) is pretty fascinating . But I wonder why it was newsworthy why did the piece need to have its code cracked ? Surely Koblyakov could just have asked Boulez what he did why was there a puzzle to be worked out when it was the result of a deliberate , conscious process ? Unless its set up like a Rubiks cube , Rubik and Boulez keeping their solutions secret . Pardon my ignorance if I 've missed something . Its a general feeling I have about analysis of serial-related music why are analysts even necessary ( beyond systematising and organising ) when the processes in the music were decided consciously ? Its not like they are revealing the structure behind intuitive choices.KG replies : The method of Le Marteau is so complicated no one could ever figure it out . Boulez threw out a couple of hints in On Music Today , but withheld crucial information , and by the 70s he was saying that the sketches were lost and he did n't  remember what he did .

I would have picked them as my favorites as well , along with Le Soliel des Eaux and explosante fixe . But I also have to agree with some of the comments here that maybe were just not taking into account enough of B.s output . There 's actually very little beyond Le Marteau that matches its coldness . I remember reading Boulezs book , rereading the same passage on " multiplication " many times , over a course of days .

The movie industry did indeed benefit from extra time and no one today is talking about the death of the movie business . <p> Simply put , while a highly competitive Internet publishing market can provide enough ad and direct payment revenue to support reporting , it can no longer routinely provide the funding to support a traditional corporate model for journalism , one that demands a deep organizational chart and significant annual profits . <p> That corporate model did provide great value to journalism in the past , of course . Its managers and ad representative leveraged financial support from communities , allowing journalists to do their reporting unconcerned with that work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of leveraging community financial support falls to the reporters ( and few remaining editors ) themselves , a task that few are trained to do . <p> Which leads to an inevitable question . If large news organizations can no longer support themselves , do we really need large institutions to report news ? Niles again : <p> Small organizations can do robust work . Instead of handling all tasks of reporting and editing in house , they can leverage the abilities of their communities to build substantial reporting work . Witness some of the crowd-sourced vetting of Friday " document dumps " done by small sites such as Talking Points Memo , for example . ( TPM Media grew from a one-person blog , by the way . ) Small and one-person news sites can work with one another , as well , to build and share traffic and reporting resources . Large-scale investigative reporting need not be sacrificed under a new , small-scale organizational model . <p> There 's lots of debating to be done about whether we need large institutions to report news . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 1990s was a decade of arts institutionalization in America . Smaller theatres became larger theatres . Mid-size museums became bigger museums .

Personal digital players have changed the ways audiences consume art . <p> Concurrently , the institutional arts are finding their business models eroding as corporate funding dissolves , foundation support erodes and endowments shrink . Perhaps things will bounce back when the economy improves . But maybe not . We increasingly distrust the institutional voice in favor of individual or community collaboration , and whereas we once needed institutions to accomplish things , increasingly we find community effort to be more efficient . Clay Shirky has been exploring this idea for a while : <p> Surely we need institutions to perform symphonies , display Tutankhamun relics , or dance Swan Lake .

As people have more choices , their loyalties to institutions soften . Most arts institutions have done a better job of selling tickets than building communities . In a world of rapidly expanding choice , selling tickets gets harder . For an audience , investing in a relationship or community is different from the consumer choice of simply buying a ticket .

Saying that institutions make art is like saying the orchestra pit gave a great performance tonight . No orchestra pits and large institutions do not make art , they support it . Afterall , the orchestra players need a place within which to play . But only individuals make the art . Shirky 's Flicker example fails in one aspect , without the company " Flicker " , without the structure of a group of individuals ( probably capitalists ) there would not be the platform upon which the cooperative effort stands .

@@99220385 @3420385/ <h> How they used to do it <p> I 've talked many times here about performance practice in the past how musicians used to change the music they played , and how they often improvised their changes . <p> We know that , of course , and the standard word for what they used to do is " ornamentation . " What we do n't  often hear , though , is how extensive those changes used to be . So here 's a striking example . Its a passage from the Almamiva-Figaro duet in the first act of The Barber of Seville , as sung by Manuel Garcia , the tenor who created the role of Count Almaviva . It was published years later in a book , The Art of Singing , by his son , Manuel Garcia , Jr. , one of the most famous voice teachers in the 19th century . <p> Notice how free the ornamentation is , and how exuberant . And how the rhythmic notation at the end of the first measure and the start of the second cant possibly be exact . Garcia must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that notation ca n't really capture . Note also that Garcia Jr . cites this as an example of rubato , which in the 19th century meant that the soloist varied the written rhythm while the accompaniment stayed in tempo . <p> And now imagine an entire performance , full of changes like this . Then imagine going to hear the opera again with a different tenor , whod make entirely different changes of his own . We do n't  have any experience like this today , and if I wanted to be fierce , I could say that were falsifying the music , which Rossini wrote fully expecting all singers to make their own changes . <p> Heres what Garcia sang : <p> Footnotes : if we trust Garcia Jr.s notation , the duet was sung transposed a tone down . <p> And I also should address something well known about Rossini , which is that at some point he got tired of singers making really bad changes which of course happened and started notating the exact ornaments he wanted them to sing . Yes , he did that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , hell write the same highly ornamented passage twice in a row , knowing full well that nobody in the 19th century sang repeated passages without making changes . <p> So obviously he expected some changes . What he did , I think , was to limit the ballpark in which changes could be made , not forbid them entirely which , as he would have known , was completely impossible . And also would have weakened performances , since one point of the changes was to take music written for one singer , and make it more suitable for others . <p> here 's an example . Rossinis wife , Isabella Colbran , was more comfortable , at least when she was with Rossini , in the lower part of her voice . So the role of Semiramide , which he wrote for her , is written very low . Another soprano , more comfortable in her higher range , would have said , in effect , " Well , there 's no point in my singing that ! It would n't sound good at all . So I 'll rewrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) is exactly what Joan Sutherland does in her performance of the big soprano aria from Semiramide on her recording The Art of the Prima Donna . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> So you 're suggesting that we could perform classical music similarly to how jazz musicians perform rhythm changes or other standards ? Or how U2s interpretation of " All Along the Watchtower " differs from Dave Matthews which differs from the original ? I like it . <p> The biggest challenge with this , however , is that improvisation is almost completely restricted to jazz and rock in the 21st century . Classical musicians , by and large , do not improvise , do not play by ear , and in my experience possess a profound fear and dislike for improvising . I think going to concerts where this is the norm is the same as having an art gallery display nothing but paint-by-numbers watercolors of the masters . " Wow , you exactly recreated Las Meninas. Congrats , Im bored . " <p> The audiences , I think , would welcome variety and personal interpretation . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  know how , or they feel it demeans the music they 're performing . Its completely up to the performers to first learn how to improvise , and then to apply it tastefully . <p> Thanks for the post , and the historical context , too ! <p> Thanks , Chris . One implication here is that classical musicians need to learn how to improvise , if they want to perform much of the repertoire correctly . Its funny we have the idea that people should play classical music in the correct style , and that they should respect the composers intentions . That usually translates , in part , into playing the notes exactly as written in the score . But many composers did n't  want their music played that way ! They expected musicians to make changes . So our current orthodoxy hides some contradictions . <p> A couple of caveats . First , as the 19th century progressed , there was less and less ornamentation . It would n't be right at all to play or sing Brahms with all this freedom , for instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applauded after the cadenza of his violin concerto right during the music , in other words he seems to have liked that ) . <p> Second , while instrumentalists often improvised , singers often planned their ornaments in advance , and then wrote them down for future reference . They may have always sung their music in the same way , which , granted , was n't exactly as written in the score , but still might not have varied ( or not varied all that much ) from performance to performance . <p> Still , in Stendhals famous Life of Rossini , there 's a lovely passage about singers ornamentation . S. says that music , as composed , can only express broad emotions , and so emotional nuances can only be conveyed by changes improvised on the spot by performers . He thinks just as if he were a theater person in our time that singers might feel a little differently about their roles , or about themselves , from night to night , and thus might improvise different ornaments , to catch the changing nuances in their emotions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but the passage in the book is a lovely glimpse of how at least one literate connoisseur thought about these things early in the 19th century . <p> You hit on a lot of important points in this post and your response to the first comment , Greg . <p> One thing that led to the death of improvisation in what we now call classical music was bad improvising . Even back in the Baroque era composers were frustrated when singers and instrumentalists ornamented excessively or badly and sometimes suggested no ornamentation was better than bad , excessive ornamentation . Bach was criticized for writing out so much of his ornamentation , but its easy to see why he did itand how great it is that he did ! But the consensus seems to have been that the best-case scenario was ornamentation added by someone who had the skill and insight to use it to enhance the music , not distract from it . And that 's what you 're saying about Rossini , too . <p> The other thing is that the music has to invite improvisation for improvisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvisation , in realizing figured bass , in ornamentation , etc . Rossini invites ornamentation ( done well , anyway ) . Jazz invites improvisation . Brahms does n't  ( seem to ) . <p> In much jazz , the subject for the improvisation is a standard tune , which in its original form as a song was completely written out . But the context was/is so different from classical musicCole Porter expected arrangements and jazz improvs on his stuff . ( And about the last version I want to hear of a Cole Porter song is Cole Porter singing it in its original form . ) <p> As for jazz improvisation , I 've read that Gunther Schuller has documented that solos that began as improvisations often become more and more set and repeatable . Improvisations often evolve into compositions , and that 's an aspect of the written-out nineteenth-century ornamentation you mention . Not everyone could improvise ornaments well , and needed to work them out in advance . But I 'm sure there was also a practice in which ornamentation ideas presented themselves in improvisations and then because they worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does his music really not invite improvisation ? We object to the notion of improvisationally ( or with malice aforethought ) adding , subtracting , or otherwise changing the notes of a Brahms piano piece . But I assert we still do a lot of improvising , even when we play Brahms note-for-note , true-to-the-text . All the sound colors , phrasing , rubato , nuances , voicings , etc. , that change from performance to performancethe improvisational impulse is still there . And the same qualities that make for a satisfying interpretation of a Brahms piece are those that make for a satisfying realization of a figured bass or for ornamentation in the violin line of a Corelli sonata . The performer somehow captures the emotional essence of the piece and makes choices that convey that essence . ( Actually , I do n't  believe there is a single " essence " to a piece but this is about as close as I can get at the moment . ) <p> What about an improvisation based on a Brahms piece ? Improvising on a piece , rather than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who asks his priest , " Father , is it OK to smoke while I 'm praying ? " " Certainly not , my son , you should devote your whole self to prayer . " A pause . " Father , can I say a prayer when I 'm smoking ? " " Certainly , my son , you can pray when you are doing anything . " <p> Can I improvise while playing the Brahms G minor Ballade ? No . Can I do an improvisation inspired on the G minor Ballade ? Sure . <p> And can I improvise a prelude before playing a Brahms Ballade ? Of course , and you 've written about that quite extensively . <p> So I do n't  see anything " wrong " with doing improvisations based on classical pieces ( and doing it in some sort of classical , rather than jazz , style ) . It can be especially valuable as something to do in private as a way of exploring a piece . In public , there 's always the argument that no improvisation on a great classical work could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of the improvisation . <p> Finally , I 'm thinking of that interesting recording of the Beethoven Choral Fantasy where Robert Levin includes improvised alternatives to big opening piano cadenza Beethoven composed . That 's the sort of thing where it gets really interesting , more so in a live performance than a recording . Sure , no one can do " better " Beethoven than Beethoven . But improvising a cadenza creates a kind of drama and excitement in a performance that only comes from improvising . I know I 've talked myself in a circle to some extent , since I suggest that there 's a lot of improvisation ( or can be a lot ) even in performances that stick only to the composed notes . And really great performances of classical music , to me , feel improvised . <p> Maybe one could say that the three most important things in improvisation are context , contxet , and context , at least when it comes to what is " acceptable . " I doubt anyone walked out of the Village Vanguard when Moran started improvising on Brahms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montero concerts when she starts her jazz-flavored improvisations based on classical pieces . <p> I recall discussing the matter of modern-day improvising with Jeffrey Kahane about 20 years ago on Compuserves old Music Forum ( before he got too busy to take part ) . He learned ( or taught himself ) to improvise as a quite young pianist when he was playing for dance classes , and all they really needed at a given time was a set tempo and meter . So rather than choosing " real " music to play , he would take a basic idea of the right type and simply play , as the spirit moved him . He said then that he thought it was a great lack in the training of young musicians that they werent encouraged to do that from a quite early stage , rather than being kept focused so totally on the printed notes . <p> Later on he worked out prepared " original " cadenzas for Mozart concertos , but he finally decided to try improvising one himself , on the spot , as Mozart had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do that , though I do n't  know whether he has continued the practice as his conducting career developed . <p> Of course Robert Levin is noted for that kind of improvisation , especially in Mozart , and he does so with attention to the audience of a given night . When he played a Mozart concerto with the Boston Pops on the night that his Harvard 25th reunion class as in attendance , he worked a couple of refernces to Harvard songs into the cadenza , each of which got an appreciative chuckle from the audience . That 's a very 18th or early-19th century thing to do . <p> The interesting thing about that passage you provided from Barbiere is that according to Garcia , his father applied rubato starting with the eighth-quarter note triplet figure at the end of the first complete measure and running through to the cadence on the last two syllables of the word " singolar . " So , in addition to ornamenting melodic lines , singers could also introduce a certain amount of elasticity in tempo , something that 's almost wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed precisely in time . ( Or as precisely as any Italian opera orchestra would have played , back in those days . ) Garcia provides other striking examples , which I might find the time to post here . And yes , this is entirely missing in classical music today . That 's a shame , because musicians playing music in which this used to be expected have lost the freedom the music expects them to have . And , of course , were now falsifying the music even though we have a cult of doing what the composer intended . <p> Some of the less experienced students in my Baroque Performance Practice class look at me in disbelief when I tell them that musicians in the Baroque were not only expected to improvise ornaments , but even an entire part ( in the case of figured bass . ) We have some interesting discussions about the concept of " fidelity to the composers intentions " in this context . <p> This article also calls to mind Gustav Leonhardt , who I am given to understand refuses to allow live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom to take risks with the ornamentation and so on , which of course carries the risk that it can go horribly wrong . But is n't that part of the excitement that only a live performance provides the idea , however well sublimated , that things can go horribly wrong ? <p> Just wanted to mention Jacques Loussier , who for MANY years has very artfully combined jazz with JS Bach . 25395 @qwx885395 25409 @qwx885409 25393 @qwx885393 25408 @qwx885408 25394 @qwx885394 25401 @qwx885401 25400 @qwx885400 <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> @gsandow <h> Resources 25399 @qwx885399 25403 @qwx885403 25402 @qwx885402 25410 @qwx885410 25404 @qwx885404 
@@99220387 @3420387/ <h> Website Header <h> Website Navigation <h> How to enunciate ' r 's in French opera and how to be one <p> Some weeks ago , the mezzo-soprano Rinat Shaham had a dilemma . Rinat is the worlds Carmen of choice and a director asked her to change the way she pronounced her r for a Belgian audience at La Monnaie . He wanted it gutturalised rather than rolled . <p> Have you any idea how difficult it is to sing guttural and sound beautiful ? Its no coincidence that radio people prefer to roll their rs , as do most opera singers . <p> Rinat , being a willing trooper , tried the guttural track in rehearsal and brought it off tremendously on stage , saving her rolled rs for the high-lying passages where she could feel comfortable and no-one else would notice . - We exchanged a few letters about it , and I was really pleased for her . <p> This morning , after another production Massenets Cendrillon some half-arsed reviewer on an internet site has attacked her for singing approximate French . Just the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . <p> If I had n't  known that Rinat worked so hard on her French diction , I might have overlooked that as another bit of internet bile , unworthy of attention . But the comment was xenophobic , possibly racist and intended to hurt . Its bad reviewing , unamplified and without context . <p> Opera singers have a right to be respected for the heroic efforts they make to sound credible in several languages . Opera houses should not give tickets to critics who display an anti-foreign bias. - If Forum Opera wants to be considered a respectable review site , it needs to remove that remark and its author . Right now . <h> SHARE THIS : <h> Comments ( 20 ) <p> Terrible joke from remebered from distant youth : Director to Scottish singer : I would prefer it if you did n't  roll your rs so much . Scottish singer : Och , that would be on account of these high heels I 'm wearing ! <p> Oh , so you actually advocate censorship ? People are only alowed to write things the censors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment . You write : " If I had n't known that Rinat worked so hard on her French diction , " well her working hard or indeed SO hard , still does not mean she achieved the goal . Some people need to work very hard and never get there , some do n't  have to work at all and achieve the goal . Oh , and yes , life is not fair . Then you end with " Opera singers have a right to be respected for the heroic efforts they make to sound credible in several languages . Opera houses should not give tickets to critics who display an anti-foreign bias . " Well , the singers know what they get themselves into . Some singers speak more then 5 languages , some only their mother tongue . Unfair ? Well tough tities . Not all singers have equal inteligence level . Unfair ? And yet they are measured with the same ruler . Not every language remark is xenofobic or in her case antisemitic , please ! And to end this post : it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Ms Shaham goes . <p> A fragment of a longer sentence , actually . I do not see any racism or anti-semitism . The critic wrote a lengthy report with a greater focus on the production , staging , decor etc . He states early on that the regular press ( " paper press " ) has already praised the singers etc .. The exact translation of the reference to Shaham goes : " and the approximate French of Rinat Shaham in the title role , ( who exhibited ) very little variation in timbre but ( who was ) " delicious " to look at " . If I were a singer , especially in a title role , I would certainly not have appreciated this " critique " . Far too brief and basically irrelevant ! But I really would not brand it as racist . I have never heard Ms Shaham , but seeing that the rest of the cast is made out of native French speakers , I would not be surprised if her French did not sound utterly " gaulois " . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to hers .. <p> It is quite normal not to roll rs when singing French nowadays , and many singers succeed perfectly well in singing beautifully even with guttural rs blended in ( see Natalie Dessay , to name but one ) . The discussion on what 's preferable is far from closed , but I believe many feel the rolled r is too unnatural when compared to spoken modern French . <p> I fail however to see how a small remark like the one in this review , however unjust it might be , could imply xenophobia , let alone racism . The reviewer does n't  mention Shahams nationality or race . Every artist knows how it feels to have an intense performance of several hours reduced by a criic to a small phrase singling out a perceived minor defect . Its part of the job and I suppose Rinat Shaham knows how to deal with it . <p> I sang many French operas during my career ( most the Paris Opera ) . My pronunciation was always praised by French critics as be " native " . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , used the rolled r . Since when do directors have a say in the way a singers enunciates the language . <p> Most of my French colleagues now use the gutteral " r " and it is indeed very difficult to bring the vowel that follows it into a forward , bright position , so I do a light rolled " r " instead . Bernac , and the older generation were much against the gutteral " r " , considering it to be vulgar . I agree that directors , beyond having the right to say if they do n't  understand what they are hearing , have no right to pontificate on pronunciation , though I gather that in some theatres , the management have laid down that the gutteral " r " must be used ; Compi+gne is one such , I believe . <p> I thnk the critic was simply taking the oppotunity to create criticism , and since he probably has little else to offer criticising the French of the only non-French cast member is sort of like shooting sitting ducks ! Sheesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xenophobic , just the one certain negative he could come up with for the evening . If you you don-t know what else you can say , criticise the pronounciation of the non-native speakers . Interestingly enough , its more often than not that the non-natives deliver the better text/dialogue , because they have to work harder at it . <p> I am a former Micaela , who has sung in the biggest European houses with some of the most famous Carmens of my generation such as Agnes Baltsa , ( also obviously non-French ) . Also obvious that she did n't  sing Carmen like a French person . One cant have it allso this critic obviously was n't interested in the performer or performance as a whole and was looking for something or someone to pick on . Typical but sad . <p> I do n't  know if I would call it racist . I can see that someone might think that it does sort of imply something of " we the French who have no accent are the only ones who should be seen as relating to our language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior that forms the glue that makes sure a group does n't  hold together . Its normal superior kind of behavior , maybe . Maybe the writer had an issue with her French just the same as that he would criticize another technical aspect . But then none of the other singers criticized her French . But then maybe they were shy to . Maybe its the butlers fault ? Is there a red herring ? Did her brand of lipstick somehow numb her tongue for this one performance ? Who makes this lipstick or was this intentional to ridicule her for some reason because of jealousy professional ( who added the numbing agent ) or was it for some other reason ? You do have non toxic make-up by the way . I do think its just sort of standard that people will poke fun of someone with an accent as not being " with us " . Its sort of just an insecurity people have . And accents then have stereotypes that go with them . I 'm glad this was brought up because I 've been acting out ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern accent . And there 's quite a bit of stereotyping for a character with a southern US accent . So , I 'm glad to be reminded to look deeper into this character , which I was already doing . Its just this empty space I had and I needed perspective <p> Sorry , but I do n't  think the comment was xenophobic . Negative , yes , but nothing more . Being French , I usually notice when a singers French pronunciation is not good , and it bothers me . But likewise , I went to see a Magic Flute this week in Paris and I was displeased to hear the French casts poor German pronunciation . Opera lovers are an intolerant lot , especially me : I always dream to get the full package from a singer , and yes , sometimes a tiny defect is enough to spoil my pleasure . As regards FORUMOPERA.COM , I have been reading their articles for a long time , and they are neither racist nor xenophobic . Just critical , which is their job ! <p> I was at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , at the Sydney Opera House earlier this year . Absolutely up there with the best , as far as Im concerned . I know there has been some discussion of the gutteral " r " both in French and in German , in recent years , with a view to requiring its use in both opera and art song . The technical Catch-22 , which all singers understand , remains . The old conundrum : la musica o le parole <p> I was trained by coaches who had all studied with Pierre Bernac . I was taught it was " caberet " and not lyric French to sing with the gutteral " r . " I was also taught that I should flip and not roll the " r " in French . The rolled " r " was only to be used at moments of great drama or impact . It was greatly impressed upon me that lyric ( read stage ) French was much different than spoken French . I still teach my students to flip the " r . " MHO . <h> Website Footer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve your online experience .

@@99220388 @3420388/ <h> Talk to me about conservatory education <p> Each week , I 'll post an interview with someone far more knowledgeable than myself on specific marketing and publicity subjects . This week , Juilliard masters student ( and my assistant ! ) Allegra Lilly on how prepared she feels Juilliard students are for The Industry post graduation . <p> Allegra Lilly began playing the harp at age seven and made her solo debut with the Detroit Symphony at age twelve . Recent honors include winning the Anne Adams Award of the American Harp Society , taking third prize in the Concours International de Harpe in Nice , and being invited to substitute with the New York Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony . Allegra completed her undergraduate studies with Nancy Allen at The Juilliard School in 2007 , and will obtain her Masters Degree from Juilliard in 2009 . <p> What is your major at Juilliard ? <p> I 'm now finishing my Masters in harp performance , and I did my undergrad there as well . <p> How much room is there to take music industry classes in a typical schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument , because some departments have more rigorous academic requirements . Also , music industry classes are considered graduate curriculum , so undergraduates can only take them in their third or fourth years . But I think everyone has the chance to take at least one music industry class at some point . <p> How many music industry classes are taught at Juilliard ? What kind of subjects are there ? <p> There are only a handful courses that I would consider " music industry classes . " One is " The Business of Music , " which I took last year . Its taught by Bob Sherman , WQXR host and former New York Times critic , and frankly , I think it should be required of all music students , graduate or otherwise . We learned the essentials of writing a proper bio , press release , and cover letter , and how to choose a good publicity photo . We also had guest speakers who discussed topics like music education , the orchestral audition process , and studio orchestra work , and Anthony Tommasini came in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances . <p> Another option is the " Career Development Seminar , " a course in creating performance opportunities and developing audiences . From what I understand , this class covers a lot of the same material as " The Business of Music , " but its run through the schools Career Services Office . There is also a special class , " The Artist and Contracts , " which revolves exclusively around the drafting and negotiation of contract agreements . <p> Finally , there are two courses taught by Greg Sandow , both of which I took last year : " Music Criticism " and " Classical Music in an Age of Pop . " The latter was particularly helpful , because we not only talked about the state of the arts world , we discussed what we could do about it , whether it be through careful programming , crossover performance , creative venue choices , and audience interaction and whether these approaches distracted from the music itself ( we decided they did n't  have to ) . Of all of the classes that Ive taken at Juilliard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having a successful career as a classical musician at a time when audiences seem restless with the same old buttoned-down format . <p> Are there business classes offered ? Graphic design classes ? Is there some kind of partnership program with NYU or Columbia for those kinds of courses ? <p> There is one class that offers more help with the straight business side , called " Writing for the Professions . " It concentrates on the composition of business documents , like curricula vitae , grant applications , and application letters . As far as I know , there is n't any class on graphic design otherwise , I would take it ! There is an exchange program : if you have perfect grades , you can apply to take one class per semester at Columbia or Barnard ( conversely , if a Columbia or Barnard student auditions and is accepted , he or she can take private lessons at Juilliard ) . <p> About once a week , the Career Development Office hosts an open " Lunch and Learn " seminar , in which a speaker comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the basics of recording a demo CD , or health insurance for musicians ) . They 're open to any student who wants to attendand there 's free pizza . <p> What is the career services set-up at Juilliard ? At Dartmouth , I remember the head of career " services " directed me to the " Performing Arts Library ' " , a shelf over his right shoulder that held three books on arts internships printed ca. 1993 <p> There are some very young students at Juilliard . Are they expected to take music industry classes ? Do you personally think they should ? <p> I 'm not aware of any business instruction for pre-college students , and the courses offered in the regular school are all electives . Personally , I do n't  think you 're ever too young to know the practical side of your field , and I absolutely think that at least one music industry class should be required of every Juilliard student . Its a lot easier to learn about the business in a classroom than through trial and error in the real world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think would be able to program , market and publicize their own concerts ? <p> I think a lot of Juilliard musicians make the error of assuming that their talent will be enough , that being a Juilliard graduate will open all of the doors . There was an article in The Times a few years back about Juilliard alumni and where they were years after graduation . As I recall , far too many of them had been forced to give up on their musical careers because they simply could n't make enough money to survive . The sad reality is that even the most exceptional musician will fail without the necessary business sense . And not only that , it takes endless determination and self-assuredness to promote oneself , and only a combination of these qualities ( plus luck ) will lead to success . Since I do n't  even know many people who are talented , business-savvy , perseverant , confident , and lucky , I 'm forced to say that Juilliard musicians who fit this description are decidedly in the minority . <p> Upon graduation , how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility to bring that orchestra to a wider audience ? <p> I know a lot of students who feel that responsibility . Over the last five years or so , I 've noticed a distinct change in the attitude of young musicians . Whereas they used to feel that pleasing the audience was akin to pandering , they now seem determined to reach out to those who have n't yet discovered classical music . Far more musicians are speaking to the audience during r ecitals and exploring alternative venues , and most seemed to have expanded their programming horizons . This younger generation is bringing about a truly exciting change in the very atmosphere of the classical music world , something that 's appearing to affect the management , programming , and promotion of major symphony orchestras . <p> Is there marketing support and/or a budget for student recitals ? <p> Yes and no . Any recital that you give as a Juilliard student , even one that is n't presented as fulfillment of a degree requirement , is free both to the student and for the audience . But if , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school does n't  have , the financial burden is yours to bear . Also , your recital is only promoted if you choose to promote it through your own means . Recitals are listed in the Juilliard Journal and on the schools website , but getting them listed elsewhere is close to impossible . Consequently , school bulletin boards are constantly papered with posters and flyers that range from basic to hilarious to glossy and expensive . Now that everyone is on Facebook , most students use " Events " to post concert info and invite friends , which generally results in a decent turnout . <p> Are there any students that you know of who did a really great job **33;744;TOOLONG their student recitals ? What kinds of things have people done ? <p> Some of the best programming Ive seen was at the senior recital of a friend of mine , Brandon Ridenour , who is an outstanding trumpet player . The first half was all pretty standard trumpet repertoire , but the entire second half of his recital consisted of pop works that he had arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two highlights : Radioheads " Pyramid Song " , which gave me chills , and " Take On Me " by A-ha , which was hilarious . I know there are people out there who think that playing anything non-serious spoils the dignity that should surround a classical performance , but I cant see why that should be the case . I was all the more impressed with my friends playing because he could play so brilliantly in two such different styles . <p> As far as marketing , a lot of people have discovered the real way to entice an audience : free booze . Still works like a charm . Apart from that , students are pretty limited in the methods they can use to promote their recitals . For one thing , there are only two halls in the building in which recitals are permitted , so there is n't too much to promote on that account . Also , students can only perform repertoire that is approved by their primary teachers , and many Juilliard teachers would n't dream of allowing pop music in a required recital ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is a member of the experimental band Pink Baby Monster in addition to being a classical badass ) . <p> How focused are students on finding managers ? Most management companies will only take on a few artists a year , if that . Do students think about positioning themselves to attract attention from management companies , or is that something Juilliard navigates for them ? <p> I do n't  think management is on the radar of the average student . If you 're not a string player , a pianist , a singer , or a flutist , its very difficult to get attention from a manager . I think most people are just focused on making connections in general , and using those connections to get more performance opportunities . The general consensus seems to be that if you have enough of a career that you require a manager , a manager will probably approach you . Juilliard does n't  overtly offer any information about managers , but its the type of thing you could discuss in a consultation with the Career Services Office . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a harp soloist , would you know where to begin ? <p> At this point , I feel like Juilliard has helped me to acquire almost all of the skills and materials I need to start my career , but a lot depends on the opportunities that arise . If a major orchestral job opens up right after I graduate , I would most likely drop everything to prepare for the audition . If not , I might plan for the next international harp competition , because winning would have a huge impact on my potential to book solo performances . In the end , the key thing I 've learned about the music industry is the importance of flexibility . If you have resolved only to work as a soloist , you will most likely end up with an instrument that gathers dust in the corner . If you keep an open mind , the music world will be more open to you . <h> Comments <p> I can sorta guess from your questions but What sort of things *should* be included from this area in conservatory education ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that a typical theatre program will have actors , directors , designers , technical , and dramaturgs ) ? What kind of person might be a fairly universally available local resource a program could bring in to address these issues ( assuming the resource is n't already available in house ) ? <p> It is indeed refreshing to hear a current students assessment of the needs and requirements to get through a Juilliard education in 2008 . When I was a stduent there from 1979-85 , the main focus was who did you study with , which competitions were you being prepared for , will you acquire a manager . The courses which Allegra shares are wonderful ! Of course , the life lessons are difficult to teach , but it seems that The Juilliard School is providing the students with as much necessary ammunition to understand what the realities are as staples of the industry . I like the description of Brandon Ridenours programI was at Juilliard with his fatherand we never went as far as off-beat programming . It was not acceptable . Due to the acceptances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cases , musicians are required to think out of the box . I also learned most of the things Allegra speaks about on my own , as these courses were not offered when I attended Juilliard . But we did have a marvelous education when I was a student , and the administration has gone to leaps and bounds to make sure the students of today are as well advised as possible . The internet has certainly opened many doors to communication and ease of creating marketing tools , but the direct contacts and how to cultivate them through conversation and meeting face-to-face is still the most personal and challenging means to create relationships in the industry . <p> This article speaks volumes about Ms. Lilly and her school . Both seem to be making a valiant effort to prepare for the future . No school can teach all students everything they need to know for their professional life , we only hope to give them the tools and an open-minded outlook so that they can figure out this most rewarding and sometimes frustrating profession on their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their curricula with " business " courses but do keep a balanced outlook as they address the needs of todays professional performers be they musicians , actors , or dancers . <h> Amanda Ameer <p> is a publicist who started First Chair Promotion in July 2007 .

@@99220391 @3420391/ <h> The Composers Guide to History <p> My- summer hobby , as it turns out , pursued in-between writing a string quartet and- finishing my Ashley book , will be relearning the history of music at the feet- of Richard Taruskin . That is , from his five-volume Oxford History of Western- Music . I should have bought it earlier , and I know what a brilliant writer he- is , but I thought it would be full of things I already knew , perhaps kind of a- super-Grout ( and no former music student will need to be told that I am- referring to Donald J. Grouts omni-required and stultifying A History of Western Music ) . - But , stuck in New York City recently without my Kindle and with a few hours to kill , I bought- Taruskins Volume Five , Music in the Late Twentieth Century , and learned within- minutes how groundless any such fears were . It is a thorough and creative- rethinking of all of Western music . I could hardly put it down , and weeks later , going- backwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter is the most transcendent music history writing I 've ever- read , along with Rosens The Classical Style and possibly above it . He starts with the bombing of Hiroshima , using it as a grand metaphor for what- he calls " Zero Hour " the attempted total redefinition of music at Darmstadt. - And yet , he brilliantly juxtaposes this with the Zhdanovshchina , the official- rebuke that Zhdanov made to Soviet composers like Shostakovich and Prokofiev , - calling on them to eschew abstraction and write accessible music using folk tunes . Through several long chapters Taruskin charts the centurys most amazing musical paradox : that under a totalitarianism that mandated simple , melodic music , the mechanical algorithms of total serialism came to represent freedom . And at the same time , on the Western side of the Iron Curtain , total serialism came to express mankinds existential despair in the face of the possibility of nuclear annihilation . What a head trip ! <p> For- instance , here he is on Stefan Wolpe , whose early music was often political agitprop : <p> Wolpes- thorny late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A- listener would be hard-pressed to paraphrase its " message , " or guess its- precise motivation , with any confidence . But if it thus frustrated willing- listeners , it also frustrated would-be censors , and that may well have been the point . The hermeticism of Wolpes postwar or rather , Cold War music was a deliberate and demonstrative refusal to comply with the directives of the Zhdanovshchina . And yet , the question nags , how did an artist with Wolpes social conscience feel about a decision , however honestly arrived at , to insulate his artistic integrity within a music that eventually became so abstract that its content would be a riddle , its style so advanced that few except fellow musicians could take pleasure in it , and so demanding of its performers that almost no one could play it ? p. 14 <p> Adorno , - he says , in his Philosophie der neuen Musik , <p> added- an existentialist argument to the older doctrine of progress If , as the existentialists argued , authenticity can only be personal and justified from within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a music that by virtue of its difficulty shunned popularity had to be a more authentic music than one that potentially spoke for the many . Responding only to what Adorno called " the inherent tendency of musical material " rather to any call from the wider world , twelve-tone music seemed to embody a perfect artistic autonomy . p. 17 <p> And- yet , in another sharp irony , the collective pressure put on composers to switch to dodecaphony would have seemed to destroy the autonomy of the composer , and thus the authenticity of his music . Referring to Boulezs infamous " Schoenberg is Dead " article , <p> The- violence that Leibowitz had predicted certainly came to the fore in Boulezs frantically coercive and intolerant rhetoric . No one who has read the article has ever forgotten its frightening climax the line about any composer who has n't  understood the necessity of the 12-tone language being USELESSNot- even Zhdanov had ever voiced a judgment more categorical or intransigent ( and indeed it is obvious that Boulezs rhetorical model was the Communist journalism of his day ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of simple nihilism , or belief in nothing , the renunciation total serialism demanded might rather be seen as expressing existential despair . It was the passionately intense reaction of artists who could no longer believe in the supreme value of the individual self , the " autonomous subject " exalted by romanticism , at a time when a hundred thousand selves just as individual as theirs might vanish at the push of a button . p. 43 <p> Virtually- every argument Taruskin makes is buttressed by telling details from obscure corners of history . He analyzes Stockhausens Kreuzspiel , an early work Ive always heard of , but have never actually heard ( and there seems to be no currently available recording ) . Because it has a steady drumbeat running underneath it , it was attractive , and Stockhausen suppressed it : <p> Within- the ascetic world of " total serialism , " at any rate , Kreuzspiel counts as easy listening . That may be one reason why Stockhausen supressed constant pulsation in the works that followed , and also withheld Kreuzspiel from publication for nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , - Taruskin credits the anti-Communist backlash in the U.S. as having partly motivated a turn toward 12-tone music , since " accessibility " had earned a politically suspicious reputation . Evidence ? The month in which Aaron Copland was first denounced by a rightwing group for his Communist connections happened to be the month he began his first 12-tone piece , the Piano Quartet . The contradictions of the age had made over-intelligibility politically incorrect . I had n't  realized that Erno Lendvai had been dismissed from his Academy post in- Budapest for writing his book about Bartoks axis system and Golden Sections . The book made Bartok sound like a decadent formalist , but Ligeti broadcast Lendvais ideas at Darmstadt to revive Bartoks flagging reputation among the 12-toners , and thus add prestige to his own lineage . <p> This is- history written in very broad strokes , and they are dazzingly creative , flexible enough to be encompassing , while supported in enormous detail . The major theme Taruskin brings out for the postwar era is the question of whether a composer is indebted to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important thing is to build on past music and to keep progress going ; if to society , then musical style does n't  matter , even to the point of seeming anachronism , as long as the point gets across . I vividly remember feeling crucified on this exact point in the 1970s , torn between systematic composing methods and Cardew-esque political critique . ( In fact , my **25;813;TOOLONG solution to that puzzle making my music lyrical and harmonically simple on the surface , while hiding my secret innovations in the backgrounded rhythms and tuning occupies me to this day . I spent the morning wrestling with it . ) Interestingly , Taruskin brings all this out in the volumes center with a contrast between Benjamin Britten and Elliott Carter , two composers whose " followings tended to be mutually exclusive . " <p> This is- a revisionist history , but unlike Carl Dahlhauss otherwise wonderful Nineteenth-Century Music , it- is not a revision that requires one to have read the original first . It explains everything clearly enough from the ground up that I think undergrads could deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my modernism class to read ) . The only things that might daunt them are the rather detailed analyses of Boulez and Babbitt , which do contribute to Taruskins overall points . In fact , the book ripples with musical analysis . This is a history book by someone who loves to analyze music , and does it very well , capturing the essence of musical styles with a few well-chosen and deeply plumbed examples . The sections on pitch relationships in Debussy and Scriabin have greatly deepened my understanding of two composers I 'd never gotten around to looking at closely . I cant escape the impression , actually , that it is a history of music written specifically for composers : I cant quite imagine any other group getting as much out of it . Virtually every historical generalization eventually gets pinned down to specific instances of compositional technique . ( I 've told the story here before that Taruskin was one of the external evaluators for my tenure ; he made such penetrating comments about my compositional technique that I changed my style in response to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Of course , Ive- been policing Taruskin like a hawk on the American composers I 'm most invested in . He sometimes looks likely to overdo an emphasis , and never does ; every crucial point is hit , every ameliorating factor noted . His parsing of Ives , for instance , is that he was a- maximalist but not a modernist : that is , he shared the early 20th-century- tendency for ramping up levels of complexity and dissonance ( maximalism ) , but conservatively held to a 19th-century view of musics appropriate expressive ends ; I 've said something similar myself , though without documenting it nearly so well . ( In fact , Taruskin quotes me at some length on music after 1970 , so a few of my agreements with him approach tautology . ) He even collects Ives with composers like Crawford and Rudhyar as Americans who used technical innovations toward spiritual ends , which is a nice point Ive never seen anyone make . People get left out Nancarrow , for instance , is n't mentioned but his framework is so all-encompassing that the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered a vocal score to Salome and downloaded from IMSLP ( because the available scores cost a fortune ) one of Elektra , two operas that impressed me when I was a teenager but that Ive hardly listened to since ; Taruskins analyses resparked my interest . I 'm beginning to get out recordings I have n't listened to for years , and Ive taken up an interest in Andrzej Panufnik , whom Taruskin contrasts curiously with Ligeti . In short , I am swept up in the irresistible flow of Taruskins vastly creative musical logic , and , with 3000 pages to go , the rest of my summer is pretty well planned out . <p> May I conclude with a didactic point for those whom it may concern ? Youll notice I 've quoted Taruskin heavily , and allowed him to make his points with his own words . This is how you write a book review . Read a book through once , describe it from memory , and you 'll invariably falsify it . This is what happened with that idiot who reviewed my Cage book , and its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewing , copy out things you 'll want to quote , and add the page number . Look at them again in context while you 're writing . Its astonishing how often you 'll find that the author did n't  actually say what you first imagined he said . If you want to damn the author , do it with- his own words and he cant complain . In fact , Ive overdone it a little here for emphasis ; people do n't  like to read too many long quotations . A book review without quotations , however , is never , ever to be trusted . <h> Comments <p> Excellent post ! Would you say this series could be handled by an undergraduate self-proclaimed history geek ( and hopeful musicology grad student ? ) KG replies : Anybody who has the requisite basic terminology ( and he s generous with definitions ) . <p> Interesting . I will definitely order the book . A few quick points : 1 . Kreutzspiel gosh , I think I 've heard it , but I cant remember it . Stockhausen said that steady drum beats came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more likely reason for its later suppression than a distain for popularity ? 2 . Stimmung is one of Stockhausens most popular works , and that 's very , very tonal ( and probably very influenced by La Monte Young ) . 3 . The source material in Hymnen national anthems is very tonal too . It influenced the Beatles " Revolution Number Nine " . 4 . Stockhausens former pupils include Holger Czukay ( bassist of Krautrock band " Can " ) and Fourth World trumpet virtuoso Jon Hassell . Both found Stockhausen an inspiring teacher , and neither felt pressured to write atonal music ( Similarly , Steve Reich says Darmstadt veteran Luciano Berio actually encouraged him to write tonal music ) . The ( intensely tonal ) synth pop band Kraftwerk was formed after Ralf H++tter and Florian Schneider attended a Stockhausen concert together . 5 . The young Stockhausen clashed with the old Adorno at Darmstadt . He disliked Adornos determination to steer the young avant garde according to his own Frankfurt agenda . At one lecture he stood up and said Adorno was " trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stockhausen was too much of a cosmic space hippie to ever take up residence with Adorno in the " Grand Hotel Abbyss " , do n't  you think ? KG replies : Taruskin relates the chicken story . Your comments seem meant to protest something that I do n't  remember ever saying . Maybe you should read the book . <p> Well , youve probably already received a dozen emails with this info , but you can always order a recording of Kreuzspiel from Stockhausen Verlag directly , for the low , low price of $26 . Its on CD 1 . We analyzed it for one of my classes at Ithaca and Ive always thought it one his most ingratiating pieces . So of course it needed to be suppressed . I think he did something similar with Formel , which he said was too " thematic , " if memory serves . <p> I 've taught Kreuzspiel for a few years , and it recently popped up in Burkholders re-writing of the Grout so legions of undergraduates will be hearing it over the next few years . Invariably my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies : Hey , I can look askance at Le Marteau . <p> As much as I love the campfire stories we love to tell ourselves about serialism in the 20th century , hopefully Taruskin will be the last to give it such a gloss as to call it the Zero Hour . ( ugh ) Alex Ross leapt at the chance to retell this tale , and its a good yarn , but my God is it a tired look at the last century . As our distance from those years expands , the infighting over serialism becomes smaller and smaller in the rearview.KG replies : Taruskin seemed to borrow the term from one used commonly at the time in Germany , and not only with regard to music I do n't  think he originated it . Not sure if its what you mean , but I too would love to see 12-tone music reduced in the history books to a curious experimental dead-end that produced a few handfuls of fascinating and attractive works before petering out . But there may be some value in documenting it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , 2010 5:03 AM said : " Kreutzspiel gosh , I think I 've heard it , but I cant remember it . Stockhausen said that steady drum beats came to remind him of Nazi marching music . " I once knew a German Jewish lady who had lived in Nuremburg during the 1930s . She said that the insistent beat of the marchers could be heard for miles around for hours , and sometimes days , before each Nazi Party rally.KG replies : Unless they were marching in 12/16 triple time at a pretty good clip , though , I cant imagine Kreuzspiel reminding anyone of them . <p> The studio recording of Kreuzspiel by the London Sinfonietta is available from the Stockhausen-Verlag , as stated above ; at one time I actually bought both the original LP and the CD , and if you want an mp3 copy just to hear in the interim let me know its actually a pretty interesting piece ( though personally I prefer Stockhausens later music ) . KG replies : Thanks , Eric , I really did record it from You Tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fart is part of my charm.Funny how the only part of this people want to talk about is Stockhausen . <p> Did Taruskin mention anything about Morton Feldman , or John Cages later works , i.e. after String Quartet 2 , or the Number Pieces ? I 'm thinking there 's a lot to be said , on an intellectual level about both composers later output ; the extremity , and economy of it . To me , these periods tend to be the most overlooked , judging by what Ive read , and the lack of commentary on them . Maybe its just me , and I 've missed the various essays over the years.KG replies : He has a few pages on Feldman , concentrating on the early stuff , and mentioning that the long works are like religious rituals . He gets up as far as Zorn ( in a section called " Modernists in Postmodern Clothing " not the first or second to make that observation ) , Laurie Anderson , Meredith Monk , Del Tredici . Had he gotten more into my generation I think he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine is incensed because he leaves out Sibelius ( the composer ) . But the omissions do n't  bother me . What we needed was a narrative , not an encyclopedia , and the book is more in-depth and readable because it does n't  try to touch every base as opposed to , say , my American Music in the Twentieth Century , in which I felt a certain pressure to get everybodys name in , at some expense in dramatic sweep . <p> This has convinced me to buy the books and have a crack at them myself . Incidentally , I took a look at these when they first came out , but was held off by the price of the hardcover edition ( $600 ! ) . Now there 's a softcover edition which is much more affordable.KG replies : Now that you mention it , that 's probably why I put them out of my mind when they first appeared . <p> One quick aside : many of us owe Richard Taruskin , not just for these five but for much else . Years ago I submitted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . They asked Richard to evaluate it . He did , and offered a typically clear and constructive vantage . More than that , in many later e-mails he offered a way out of an avenue marked no exit into which I had blundered . I was ( and remain ) astonished that he would give so much time and so much clarity to an unknown writer examining an almost forgotten musician . The book came out . It owes much to Richard and his critical kindness . I know I am not alone in my debt to this great and generous scholar . Those five volumes ? Worth every peseta.KG replies : If you 're too modest to advertise it here , I will : Lost in the Stars : The Forgotten Musical Life of Alexander Siloti , by Charles LONG ... mentioned him in program notes on Rachmaninoff . Best of luck with it . Richard is , indeed , generous . <p> Dammit , Kyle , now I 'm going to have to read these . As if the shelf space was n't too cramped already.KG replies : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request a book to be made available for the Kindle . <p> " Stunde null " ( hour zero ) is a German military term indicating the beginning of a planned action or event . It gained association with the moment of Nazi capitulation at the end of the Second World War . Its use as a non-military term is controversial as it can be used to avoid engagement with the past ( **25;840;TOOLONG ) by creating the fiction of a clean break with the past and so avoid to take responsibility for the past . Stunde null is more associated with literature than music , but even the most important postwar literature organization , the Gruppe 47 advocating a strippeddown modern style and modern thematics , had not such an easy relationship to this term . Postwar avantgarde composers tended to have more direct relationships to prewar literature , for example Stockhausen to Hesse , Barraque to Broch , Berio to Joyce , Boulez to Mallarme and Char.KG replies : Thanks ! <p> Not having read Taruskins series , I can only comment on your comments and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems like he is one of the many historians who miss the rather important point that composers write what they want to write , their primary influence being other music , mostly from the past . Yes , composers have often been constrained in various ways , like Haydn by his patrons , or by writing vocal music , or by official government edicts , but great composers work within these limits to create music that rises above the limits . What is important is not the limitations , but the music . Grouts A History of Western Music also seemed somewhat " stultifying " to me as a music student , but when I read it now , I appreciate its focus on music.KG replies : I sure wish I wrote what I want to write like all those other composers . But I will say I never think its a sound idea to publicly criticize a book you have n't read . <p> Volume 4 ( Early 20th Century ) is amazing . His analysis of the major works , and some of the back history , is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit disappointing . Even tho it says " Late 20th C " there are some really big holes . For example Lou Harrison is n't even in the index . ( But George is ) . And I think his focus ( or interest ) ends around 1985 . There is an end-of-the-millennium postlude , but it is very summary . Maybe its too soon for that . The book was originally published in 2005 , which probably means the manuscript was completed a few years earlier . That does n't  give one much time to sort things out . But , on the other hand , this is not an encyclopedia . Still , like Gibbon , someday I hope to finish reading all five volumes of this massive work . But I agree , it is extraordinary on many levels.KG replies : I am immodest enough to hope that if someone wanted to extend the history of American music past 1985 , they would have to familiarize themselves with most of the repertoire I know in order to go beyond what I 've already written about it .

@@99220399 @3420399/ <h> The Right to Steal Shall Not Be Abridged <p> Occasionally teaching is indeed its own reward , even discounting the involvement of the students . This semester I 'm teaching my Advanced Analysis Seminar , which I 'm devoting to minimalist and postminimalist music ( partly in advance of my postminimalism book , partly in anticipation of next Septembers minimalism conference ) . The idea of the seminar is that we work on pieces I have n't yet analyzed myself , so that instead of me telling them ex cathedra what I already know , we all go through the discovery process together , and they watch me do what I do when I analyze music , both fumbling around and flashes of insight . And they help me , their brains being newer and quicker than mine . Classically minimalist music is , of course , fairly easy to parse , though we have to come up with our own methods to represent its procedures and figure out how perception and process interrelate . And today we were working on Einstein on the Beach , of which I bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a blast . Whenever I go through a piece of music I know well with the score for the first or second time , my opinion of the piece either rises or falls somewhat , depending on what I start to perceive in the piece once I fully realize what 's going on . Einstein was a vastly important piece from my youth , and while I always loved sections of it , my opinion of the whole has risen noticeably this week . ( I had an opposite experience with Glasss later opera The Voyage , a more tedious work than I 'd remembered . ) Today we went through the " Train " scene in about an hour and a half , and broke it down into an A A B A " B form its the most complex scene from the opera , bringing together two of the recurring chord progressions ( there are only about five in the whole four-hour work ) , as well as running ostinatos of different lengths together , Totalist style which I may have to start calling Minimalist style . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sections , so its really A x A x B x A " x B , and the three A sections all fall into the same material after awhile , but start out with a different additive-process buildup . ( The B sections recur in the final " Spaceship " scene . ) In short , the form is both musically logical and satisfyingly intuitive . We had a similar experience with Reichs Music for Mallet Instruments , Voices , and Organ , and I 'm not even going to tell you where I got that rare score one of the prettiest pieces ever made . Much as I love so much minimalist repertoire , I somehow do n't  expect it to excel in the intuition department , and I 'm being pleasantly surprised . <p> And now Im pissed off as hell that I had to wait until age 52 to get a score to Einstein , a piece I 'd been obsessed with since I was 22 . I was wearing out my vinyl discs of this piece nonstop in 1978 , and a score should have been available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned all of Glasss ( and Reichs ) formal tricks before I embarked on my professional career . Instead , I find out that I correctly stole some of their ideas by ear , but there were some other neat formulas that I did n't  realize were there . Its criminal that great music cant pass in score form to younger composers within a few years . And its why I put nearly all my scores up as PDFs on my web site : I refuse to catapult any ideas out into the world without facilitating their immediate theft by young ( or older ) composers . I may not have any ideas anyone wants to rip off , but I 'll be damned if I 'm going to squirrel them away out of reach . <h> Comments <p> That 's a great way to teach analysis , Kyle . And by that I mean , of course , that that 's how I would do it . I agree about the Reich . What a pretty ( and beautiful ) piece !

I recently printed up , played and enjoyed a couple of your " Private Dances . " Nicely done ! I am very interested in how musicians , academic and otherwise , think about the music of Glass , Adams , Part and others . I admire the fact that you are doing your analysis in tandem with your students . I too have parsed this music sectionally , harmonically and motivically in an effort to understand it . But since the materials of the music itself can sometimes be pretty simple , I wonder about how it works on me and other listeners . As a sometimes busker living , writing and performing here in Western Michigan , I have had interesting conversations with listeners on the street after performing " China Gates " by John Adams on my EP . " Sounds random " a couple of elderly appreciative listeners new to the style once observed . I realized that this aspect of the music is something that also attracts me . I have introduced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parts " Spiegel i 'm Spiegel " and been amazed at how often this simply-constructed piece finds sympathetic and patient first-time listeners . Does this music work a bit like a Calder mobile ? A mobile is a concrete creation . But I think of it as non-linear the same way I think of some music as non-linear . There are random aspects of a mobile that rely on the subjective point of view of the looker . For me , the experience of looking at it and being in the same room with it creates a still kind of changing motion that reminds me of the music I like by people like Glass , Reich , Adams and Part . Not sure exactly how this kind of observation relates to the rigorous analytical studies necessary for parsing any music . I did notice however that in Adamss pictorial analysis included in my copy of his score for " China Gates " that he seems to make a few mistakes in relation to his parsing of his own music . At least it seems that way to me as I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was reading recently about Brahmss reaction to his colleagues less-than-enthusiatic reception of his Fourth symphony . He said something about the impossibility of analysing or quantifying melody . I think that unquenchable curiosity about all aspects of music is a given , but I have n't really been exposed to much thinking about the so-called miminalist approach to composing that has helped me in the same way I remebmber Schenkerian analysis turned on some lights of understanding for me as a student . Come to think of it , as I age I tend to conceptualize about the music I play , listen to and write more and more in a subjective intuitive way even as I continue to analyse it . <p> I wanted to thank you for taking the music of Glass so seriously ; all too often , Ive run up against the idea that he does not deserve serious consideration as a composer and had nothing more than a gimmick .

Unbeknownst to me , it beautifully illustrates one of thestrategies I was going to bring up at my lunch with Director Arnold Lehman for getting people interested in seeing museums permanent collections . Lehman and the museums curators were one step ahead of me : they had already displayed some of Shonibares works within the permanent collection galleries . <p> Most of the Shonibare show is on view in the fourth-floor special exhibitions galleries , with a couple pieces on the first floor , too . But Brooklyn also asked him to make site-specific works that are on display surprise in its period rooms . <p> Retailers have used this strategy for years setting up boutiques for , say , Coach leather goods in a department store .

@@99220404 @3420404/ <h> What About That Clyfford Still Museum Plan To " Deaccession " ? <p> Let 's consider the " deaccessioning " situation at the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver . The other day , it emerged that Dean Sobel , the director , has a plan that would allow the sale of four works before they are officially accessioned to raise money for the museums endowment . <p> here 's the gist : The Still Museum will soon receive 825 Still paintings from a bequest of Stills widow , Patricia , who died in 2005 plus more than 1,000 drawings . However , the museum has petitioned the court to release four paintings to the city of Denver before official distribution of her estate , so that the museum does not violate museum ethics policies against deaccessioning for purposes other than buying new works of art . The city would sell them for the benefit of the museum . The take could be as much as $25 million , according to published reports . The museum would use the money for all museum activities , including research and publications . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted all his works in one place . On the other hand , his widow has already donated or sold 13 of them . <p> A few other factors to consider : the museum is making or rather enabling the sale openly , announcing it . Sobel chose the four works carefully , according to a report in the Denver Post , making a package that covers all three phases in Stills career . They will be sold in a group , and only to another museum . <p> Critics have called this " problematic " saying that Sobel is using a " loophole " in standard museum policies . The second part is true , for sure . The first let 's say its not ideal . <p> But nobody is going to walk through an exhibit of nearly 2,400 Still works , the total of its holdings . The museum is only 28,500 sq . ft. all told anyway . So many works will go straight into storage . Why shouldnt the Still Museum sell a couple to a museum that will put these paintings on display ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger question , to me can any museum plunk down $25 million for the paintings ? And if not , what does the Still do ? When it opens late next year , will it start out behind ? <p> The museum has already cut back . Last November , the Denver Post reported that it had trimmed its cost from $33 million to $29 million , and quoted Sobel saying , " It was very difficult to get to this point in this economy . " This point is $26 million , so there is still further to go . Sobel talked hopefully about raising a $10 million endowment , but figured he might have to settle for $5 million . <p> I would rather see the sale of four paintings from the collection than see the museum start out life shakily . Besides , I have heard that selling donated works before official accessioning which sometimes takes place years after the initial gift or bequest is hardly rare among museums . It just happens in secret . <h> Comments <p> When a single-artist museum sells major works " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its future ability to draw upon its own collection in order to mount coherent displays of specific periods or themes in the artists production . The depth of the institutions holdings may no longer be sufficient , and it is depth which should distinguish this species of museum . I would have no problem with the Still Museum culling , say , 100 totally mediocre works out of the 2,400 donated to it . So long as these were of no artistic or documentary value , it would streamline the collection and reduce storage problems . But selling off four important works is like tearing limbs off of a body . The wholeness and integrity of the Still donation will have been violated . Still himself was almost fanatical in his efforts to keep the better part of his production TOGETHER . Sobels proposed sale is even more worrisome to me than the ( aborted ) selling off of the Rose Museum , because the Rose collection is basically just an assemblage of various artworks by different artists , most of which have no integral connection to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution is an incredibly shabby legal loophole that in no way mitigates the moral offensiveness of the sale . I could tolerate a culling of several dozen mediocre works , but <p> You make good points if the four pieces selected really would inhibit the museums ability to mount coherent displays in the future . Your comment also seems to presuppose that the museum could not borrow back the sold works for a specific temporary exhibit , but it probably could by lending other works in return . As for the togetherness , well , even his widow sold works . <p> As long as Denver has decided to sell , it makes far more sense for them to sell partial titles than full titles . James Maroneys tenancy-in-common plan would get the four works back at the demise of their life estate purchasers ( this would be problematic if corporations or other perpetual institutions bought them , of course ) , while my own equitable servitude CoaccessionG method would let Denver get them back whenever the Still Museum had an exhibition , a research or conservation project , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partial title buyers could enjoy the paintings whenever they would otherwise be in storage at the Still . If other museums bought them , instead of private parties , the paintings might always be on display or in active cultural use , either at the Still or at the other museum . Actually , artists like Clyfford Still who want to keep their ouvre together could do that culturally with Coaccession , rather than having to keep full title to every painting . His widow might have felt much better about her actions if shed kept the ouvre intact by retaining Cultural TitlesG to those works , selling off only the conditional possession of Collector TitlesG . <p> Well , you know , it " is what it is " . If the letter of the will is that the work should only come to light when it can support a dedicated institution , then it should be in a warehouse now .

@@99220407 @3420407/ <p> The archaeologists say that dance may be the oldest art form . It seems likely that the first way we might be creative is with our own bodies . <p> But as a society , we are now strangers to our bodies . We do n't use them very much . Children used to hear often " now run outside and play . " They do n't hear that much anymore . Nowadays it 's more like sit in front of some screen . So of course our connection to our bodies is fading rapidly and as it does , we are just not as interested in seeing others use what we do not . Maybe it makes us feel guilty somehow . <p> I say " us " but actually , I dance . To go to a dance class is just as liberating and just as much a spiritual experience as going to the Metroplotian Museum , or my favorite church . When time goes by and I do n't dance , I find myself somehow depressed without really knowing why . Then I start stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to our bodies ! <p> Thanks for posing the challenge in " Is Dance a Lesser Art Form ? " If it 's true that audiences have become estranged from classical music when it went atonal , I 'd argue that dance lost audiences when it abandoned plotlines for people running around the stage to " Gymnopedies 4 . " <p> Somewhere along the way , it seems like dance became Art , without having the great popular works to maintain its accessibility at the mass level . You can trace opera from " La Traviata " to " Brigadoon " to " Rent , " and " Mona Lisa " to " Water Lilies " to those paintings of thatched-roof cottages by that guy who has galleries in shopping malls . But can most people name a single modern work of dance ? <p> I personally love what people like Paul Taylor and Garth Fagan have done , playing with the vocabulary of classical ballet . But I still think there 's probably a huge opportunity for some creative choreographer out there to do a full-length dance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gymnopedies 4 " and that god-awful sequence at the end of that movie Center Stage . <p> However -- you have directors of music videos moving to feature films ; what if a good music-video choreographer got to experiment with ballet dancers ? I think the best way for public schools to introduce students to the arts -- whether it 's dance , symphony orchestra , opera , what have you -- is to have lots of field trips , or have visiting performers . <p> In high school , the local opera came in and performed a mini-La Boheme in the school gym . As for dance writing -- well , it could be that dance is just tricky to write about and it has n't found its muse yet . Most reviews are so abstract -- " the eloquent footwork poignantly illustrated the oppression of parting , " or they talk about fouettes and arabesques . I think Joan Acocella at the New Yorker does a pretty good job . <p> I think one key is to work together more since there is strength in cooperation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing a programme . We covered costs and had a great time . The audience saw many styles and aesthetics and appreciated the variety . <p> Another key is technology . Framing dance so it can be seen in video and the internet . Drama and music have used technology to huge benefit in the last 100 yrs - music everywhere , movies etc - dance is behind in this area . For the survival of the art form we need to make more dance on screen . <p> In the end we are talking about the art of dance - not social or therapeutic dance - they are very healthy .

The decline can be gradual : the loss of control of our bodies , memories just out of reach , the death of loved-onesor it can happen all at once like it did just recently to my 99 year old motherthe stuffing went out of her and in a week she went from nosy little old lady to a pathetic rag-doll gasping for air in a hospice . But it is not sad Your problem is that it is all too far off for youthe indignity , the suffering .

@@99220416 @3420416/ <h> A hidden cost of classical music <p> One thing Ryan said left me thinking . He named ( almost- wistfully , I thought ) Ani DiFranco as an example of- an alternative rock figure with a small audience , and offered the hope that- classical music , too , could accept small performances for relatively few- people . <p> Which of course in a way it always does . <p> One quick ( and crude ) take on Ryans point might be that classical music , - compared to pop , is a niche genre , and that all its audiences , even the- largest , are n't  ( by pop standards ) very large. - But let that go . I understand what Ryan meant when he named- Ani DiFranco ( one of the most thoughtful and honest- figures in pop , someone who 's never worked with a major record label , and- controls her own releases ) , and I sympathize . <p> But I think there are instructive differences between her- and let 's say a string quartet that appears in the same clubs she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or downloads gigantically more . ( A pop musician who- sells 20,000 copies of a new album in a year would be toward the bottom rungs- of the business . A classical musician who sold 3,000 copies would be near the- top , at least in recording sales . Reverting to the CD model just for clarity , - though its speedily getting out of date suppose somebody makes $10 for each- CD sale . The pop musician , with a low-selling album , 20,000 copies sold in a- year , gets $200,000 for this album alone , plus money from sales of older- records . The classical musician , hardly able to believe his or her luck , sells- 3,000 , and gets $30,000 . These figures are meant only to be suggestive . They- ignore rather giant complications , like how much the CDs cost you , how- much record stores might get , and how you split revenues- with your record label , if you have one . ) <p> But then the musicians in the string quartet can teach , get- grants , get university residencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - none of which Ani DiFranco is likely to do . ( Shes- not about to show up as a guitarist on Madonnas next tour . ) <p> All this is fairly obvious , at least to people who know how- the business works . But now for the hidden cost that Ryan sparked me to think- of . Ani DiFranco never went to music- school . And if by chance she did , she did n't  have to , not to get where she is- right now . Most pop musicians learn music on their own . <p> But not the members of the string quartet ! Each one had- years of schooling private lessons , undergraduate music school , maybe a- graduate degree . The undergraduate and graduate schools are the most expensive- part of that . Who paid for it ? Some combination of the- musicians parents , the musicians themselves ( through student loans ) , and of- course the schools , with scholarships . But the schools could n't give- those scholarships and in fact couldnt exist without large donations. - Theyre raising money all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small classical performances . Go see Ani- DiFranco , and what you see is , pretty much , what she paid for . The costs of- her being there are mostly visible , or easy to figure out . ( She has to buy her- equipment and pay her band ; she has to travel to whatever- club you 've seen her in ; she needs a van ; she has to sleep somewhere . ) <p> But the string quartet ? Invisibly- present are all their years of education , paid for , in considerable part , by- donations to their music schools . <p> And now we 'd better ask where those- donations come from.From individuals , some of them very- wealthy . And why do they offer their support ? I 'm going to take a- speculative leap here , because I do n't  have data , but I 'll bet Im right . These- donors do n't  support Juilliard or Eastman or Curtis or Rice or Indiana University- or Peabody because they love seeing string quartets in clubs. - Or Pierre Boulez in Zankel Hall. - Or the Bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're impressed with the glory of classical music , which means major orchestras , - the Metropolitan Opera , and , in general , big concerts by glamorous mainstream- stars . <p> Which means that even small classical- performances ( at least right now ) depend on the big mainstream classical world. - And that 's an important point wed better remember , when we imagine what- classical musics future might be . If wed like to think that small- performances might survive even if the mainstream world goes belly up , well- have to figure out where the next generation of musicians will learn to play , - and who 's going to pay to keep them alive. - ( Even string quartets that play in clubs might make much of their- living directly from the mainstream , through grants and residencies , and , - conceivably , from its members freelance work . For a little more on this , see- my earlier post on- making a- living . ) <h> Related <h> Comments <p> Think of all the peripheral jobs that suffer when an orchestra goes belly up : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , music-school staff , symphony office staff , house staff , stagehands , parking lot people , parking lot owners , late-night snack joints , music copiers , outfits that publish and/or rent out the scores , advertising media ( such as newspapers ) , program printers , program publishers , public transit , and on and on , to enterprises we would n't even think of ( like people who clean the suits that get mussed when a patron goes to a concert during a rainstorm ) . <p> Add up all the symphony orchestras in this country and you have got what amounts to a multimillion dollar industry ( billions , maybe ? ) . As such , it could well be a gorilla in the American economy and entitled to a lot more support from the government than it has been getting . <p> The politicos put subsidies into a lot of lesser industries , but wo n't peel a grape for the orchestras . <p> Its time for the symphony biz to step up to the trough for a fair share of the pork . <p> Paul <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that they can backfire . Can anyone prove that an orchestra adds more to the economy than anything else that might spend the same money ? The St. Louis Symphony , right now , has ( I believe ) an endowment of around $100 million . Suppose that money were used to start a successful manufacturing business , or technology firm . Wouldnt these enterprises bring even more economic benefit than an orchestra does ? <p> Any successful entrepreneurial or freelance setup is going to need years and years of slavish labor at the beginning , either for nothing or with someone elses capital . Whatever DiFrancos costs were in time or money they were probably totally different to a string quartets , but why does that mean they 're any less significant ? <p> Maybe what you say here is probably more useful/true at the orchestra &amp; big arts organization level . <p> In time and money , the musicians in a rock band and the musicians in a string quartet put about the same amount into starting their enterprises . Though in one way , rock musicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had to be more entrepreneurial . Classical performers usually started ( again in past decades ) by impressing the gatekeepers who controlled entry into the field that is , classical performers would find management , or win competitions . Rock bands tended to work their way up from the bottom , getting their own club dates , and making their own records , long before they had management or a record label . <p> But the financial burden , direct and indirect , is much higher for classical musicians . They need music school , and ( as Paul Alter pointed out in his comment ) they need to buy expensive instruments . <p> At the highest level top orchestras , top rock stars I would n't be surprised to find that the direct financial investment is more closely comparable . A Chicago Symphony budget from a few years ago showed expenses and income of more than $60 million . If you count the income that top rock stars make ( and expect to make ) , I can imagine you 'd get into similar financial territory . <p> This prompts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue . <p> Classical music is n't really a teach-yourself niche : the instruments , the techniques and the repertoire were all developed in the context of intensive training through a network of guilds and later conservatoria . BUT ( and I 'd be interested in data on this ) it seems to be a relatively recent phenomenon that so many young classical musicians are spending so long cloistered in colleges and universities , esp . in English-speaking countries . <p> Is it really necessary that classical performance training be so protracted ( and thus so expensive ) ? And what does that mean for the future of classical music ? <p> Hi , Yvonne . And that 's a very good point . Classical musicians these days get undergraduate degrees , then masters degrees , and often even doctorates . Singers spend years in young artists programs . Is all this really necessary ? In the old days , musicians were more likely to serve something like apprenticeships . Im reminded of a story Regina Resnik told my wife , about her first performance as Leonora in Fidelio . Bruno Walter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . And took not a penny for it . Not that this issue is n't more complicated than that . I 'd be very curious to know how the present educational practices developed , and what deep need they serve . <p> Andre Previn wrote in one of his autobiographical books that shortly after he began playing piano in Hollywood studios as youngster one of the studio violinists asked him which piano trios he played . Previn asked him what a piano trio was . <p> Thereafter Previn went to the home of the violinist every week , where he learned the entire repertoire for violin , cello , and piano . <p> One of the initial points you make is that classical audiences are argumentatively smaller than pop audiences BUT , this spawns two adjacent arguments , 1 ) Pop artists have larger audiences at their performances because they are unique to their following and they perform only once a year in any given city or region , and 2 ) Based on point #1 , are orchestras providing too much " product " for their constituencies ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they played every weekend for 48 weeks out of the year ? I 'm sure it would get old after a while ) <p> Exactly.Many , many people who work professionally with orchestras think there 's too much product that orchestras give too many concerts . In the old days , that was n't a problem , because subscribers bought almost all the tickets . Thus , orchestras depended on people going over and over again , during the course of a season . If enough people did that , then the number of concerts in a season was n't a prpoblem . But since subscription sales have fallen notably over the past couple of decades , attendance is n't as dependable as it used to be , and the number of concerts can become a problem . <p> Or put it this way . ( And thanks for stimulating this line of thought . ) Pop music depends very simply on demand . Madonna tours once a year , approximately , because that 's what she can sell . Shes not going to give any concerts that there is n't specific demand for . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . Each concert has specific demand that is , the concert happens because the artist involved has fans , who want to go . <p> But many classical events , like orchestra concerts , do n't  work like that . A big orchestra plays just about every weekend during the season . The concerts do n't  respond ( most of the time ) to any special need . Its just assumed that there 's a general need to hear the orchestra , and that people will show up to do that . Obviously some soloists and even a few conductors have followings ( though very few do fewer than most of us would guess according to the marketers Ive talked to ) . And obviously some programs those with a lot of new music will be less popular than others . But generally orchestra concerts read simply as orchestra concerts , with a very generalized demand . Opera does better at least each opera has a particular identity . But the classical music world needs to look at this situation , and see what it can do to create events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy tickets for . And without any dumbing down ! I think its possible , but that would be another long discussion , one we ought to have here . <p> I did eight years of university study , and the honest truth is that I kept studying because I continued to be unable to win an orchestral job . Many of my friends have done the same , only to drop out of music altogether . So that actually adds ANOTHER cost because these donors that you speak of ( actually , they are governments in Australia ) are n't  just funding classical musicians who go on to careers , but MANY MANY MANY who go on to become anthropologists , physicists , lawyers <p> I wrote a blog entry dealing with some of this heres a bit : <p> In many ways we are locked into the classical traditions by virtue of the venues in which we perform . Our status as a full-time , professional touring group that relies on performance income to balance our budget restricts us somewhat . For example , we simply cant afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensembles who have found small but engaged and diverse audiences at clubs and pubs . Small venues such as these can barely cover even the costs associated with moving our percussion equipment . <p> There are other ways in which 8bb benefits by remaining a firmly " classical " ensemble . University residencies make up a significant portion of our salaries , enabling us to function as a full time group . Without our cred as an award-winning ( and did I mention , Grammy-nominated ) classical chamber music group , that would not be possible . <p> Hi , Tim . Good to hear from you , and thanks . I 'd suspect that one core reason for the extended study is exactly what you say . A student ca n't get a job or has n't  gotten one yet and so continues studying , because that 's an available option . It helps support the student for two or three more years ( or more ) , gives them a dignified way to account for themselves while they look for jobs , might put them in a better position to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ) , and in any case cant hurt . I 'm sure the schools benefit by having capable students around , so the system perpetuates itself , while also in some ways insultating students ( and , more generally , classical music ) from the realities of cultural life . As long as the schools keep raising money ! <p> Thanks for the continued clarification about how eighth blackbird survives . Its an important story , and all of your honesty I mean everyone in the group has been very helpful in teaching me to understand the financial forces that shape the classical music biz . <p> Well , maybe the millions in the SLSO trust fund could be invested in some start up fund and create a whole new business , but consider that the general success rate for new organizations is about one out of ten . So it might not be a particularly wise use for the money . <p> But , most important of all , shame on you ( picture finger wagging ) . It would most emphatically NOT be a BETTER use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new firm that uses up the few remaining resources we have in a world that is threatened by over-population and diminishing resources or a great art form that has provided great satisfaction for millions of people for several hundred years ? <p> The point is that the the symphonic orchestra , although it is ONLY an art form ( sarcasm , there ) , when joined with other orchestras in this country , is part of a major industry , employing many , many , thousands of people , and is thus , deserving of governmental support . ( I draw your attention to the WPA orchestras the government supported durin the depression to help support musicians , thus proving that , at one time , musicians were considered worth supporting . <p> But shortening the season is not a good idea . That would return us to the bad old days when musicians had to scramble to support themselves because the orchestras could n't , and the musicians suffered , and the orchestras were not as good . <p> Symphonic organizations have achieved a plateau , and we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to cave in and give comfort and support to the enemey by saying , " Well , yes , maybe we are being selfish , sol let 's give up all that we have fought for in the past . " <p> Everybody else is selfish , why should we be . ( That 's a rhetorical question . ) And was n't it the extreme right wing Ayne Rand , specifically that proposed that idea and other right wingers who supported it ? <p> Paul A. <p> So now there are thing were required to say or not say because we 've enlisted in a crusade , and we have to stay on message ? Paul , much as I like you , I cant accept that . We should tell the truth , and deal with the consequences . <p> I did n't  develop much my point about the economic argument for the arts . Other people have made it , quite beyond me . Its systematically taken apart in the MUSE report on arts support , written by the RAND Corporation for the Wallace foundation , and I hope still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes like this . We can say , if we like , that the arts are important because they do good in some way , like helping kids ( who take part in the arts ) to get better grades in school . But then someone else can always come along , and point to or propose a program specifically targeted to that goal , which would arguably achieve the goal better . Then we have to retreat , and say , " Well , we did n't  really mean the orchestra is important because it helps kids get better grades . We just wanted to say that , since the orchestra does exist , it also has these benefits , even for the vast majority of people who never go to its concerts . " Which is a much weaker argument . <p> As for the corporation I imagined could be started with the St. Louis Symphonys endowment money , why assume its going to be an evil one ? Suppose we take that $100 million , and start a company that sells low-cost solar heating to homeowners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing my heating bills this winter . What would be wrong with that ? <p> First of all , I have a friend who says that classical music is basically an art form that is subsidized by wealthy people for middle class white people who could pay for it but wo n't . He is a donor and believes this madness should stop , though he loves classical music . <p> Second point , at least in LA , more and more rock and pop musicians have had classical training in order to compete in the studio world , so I do n't  think there is such a huge difference as you outline in the post . This may change , however , with changes in the recording industry , but I do n't  think so . Its a competitive edge to be a great sight reader . <p> And finally , as for too much product being produced by orchestras , this has as much to do with classical musicians seeking full time jobs with security and benefits as anything else . In Orange County , the musicians play at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are salaried . LA has many more concerts , partly because they CAN with salaried players . <p> Kate , I 'd be interested to know how your wealthy friend thinks middle-class people could pay for classical music . TIcket prices at least at big institutions have increased far more than the inflation rate over the past generation . And in spite of that , ticket sales pay for no more than 1/3 of the costs of putting on concerts.What more could middle-class concertgoers pay ? <p> I can well imagine that the very few pop musicians who play studio gigs in LA benefit from classical training . As you say , sight-reading is a big plus . But this is a tiny part of the pop music universe . For another view , I could ask you if you 've seen " Juno , " an absolutely wonderful movie I caught up with this past weekend.The songs on the soundtrack ( many of them suggested , by the way , by Ellen Page , the actress who plays the title role ) are typical of one kind of alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  need classical training , and most of them surely do n't  have it . The same could be said about people in rock bands , people playing country music , hiphop musicians , or people creating dance music on their computers . <p> And you 're absolutely right , the full-season employment that the big orchestras offer their musicians is a consequence of union activism in the 1960s . I would n't want to see this reversed . A big part of it was to give musicians the same dignity and security in their employment that professionals with comparable standing in other fields would have . But still there are questions about how sustainable the full-season employment might be in the future . The answer , for me , is n't to cut back ( though some orchestras have done that ) , but to find a completely new model of what an orchestra is . Which is a long discussion , to say the least . <p> So you know , Ani di Franco is quite possibly my favorite musician ever , past and present . The fact that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel closer to her than say , Beethoven or Schoenberg ( both artists whose work I also admire ) . I did not randomly pull her out of a hat . <p> Thanks also for illuminating the larger economic picture . Although , I think hard figures would help clarify a lot . Even if Ani di Franco did n't  have to pay for music school ( I know she studied poetry at The New School with the late Seku Sundiata , so I 'm guessing she might have incurred some cost there ) , there are other pop musicians who studied in classical conservatories ; Tori Amos , for example ( the youngest student ever admitted to Peabodys paino program ; although I believe she was on scholarship until she proved too interested in other things to have it renewed : Good for us ! ) , and also , Joanna Newsome , who , as I understand , trained classically as a composer . <p> What is perhaps a larger conversation , deserving of yet another thread , is the role student loans are playing in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming them will determine the future of music . <p> We , as a society , have no business allowing prospective musicians to assume as much debt as some aspiring doctors and lawyers . It is simply absurd . <p> The student loan is a hidden cost that really should not exist in the arts at all . This is a skeleton that is certainly beginning to be exposed . <p> I can not propose an immediate solution , but I have ideas , maybe , as I said , deserving a post of their own . <p> Best , <p> Ryan <p> One thing this conversation is doing for me it makes me want to hear more Ani DiFranco . I really only know one song of hers , " You Had TIme , " which Nick Hornby talks wonderfully about in " Songbook . " ( His book of comments on some of his favorite songs . I usually assign his Ani DiFranco essay , which is also about Aimee Mann , to my music criticism class at Juilliard . ) <p> I think the number of pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely small , as a proportion of the total pop universe . Especially outside alternative precincts . Did the guys in Aerosmith or Guns N Roses have classical training ? Or Slayer ? I do n't  think so . Did Bob Dylan have it ? Or so many sidemen and producers and recording engineers . <p> It would definitely be helpful to have hard figures . I hope I 'll assemble some for the final version of my book . <p> Could we not make the same argument about scientific researchers enormous cost to society ? What about the cost of an athelete to a community ? <p> This site seems to portray Classical musicians as money-sucking babies who rely others for support of their unpopular and expensive habit . Nothing could be further from the truth . In the first place , some communities enjoy a sizeable economic benefit from Classical performances . We only need to visit some musical hot-spots to see this in action . Charleston , SC , for example , is teeming with people from all over the world during the Spoleto festival , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many symphonies perform in downtown areas that otherwise would hardly have a regular economic pulse of any kind . <p> Another way in which Classical music is " useful " to a community is this : most musicians are extremely involved and personally committed to the cause of local education . One could argue , that musicians , more than many others , are paying off any societal debt in this way . Many of us donate lessons and performances to those in need . <p> Lastly and ( perhaps most importantly ) , Classical music and all art has value exactly because it is about truth , compassion and the human spirit , not greed and dollars . Isnt it a positive thing , that some who have the most temporal possessions still value what is essential spiritual wealth of art ? This above all continues to keep music alive , and thank goodness ! Lara Sipols , Professional Vioinist and Educator <p> Lara , I respect the points you 're making here , and I certainly respect your passion in saying these things . But I think you 've misunderstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trying to say that classical musicians do n't  deserve to have all this money spent on them . That 's a separate issue . <p> What I was talking about was something else . As classical music faces financial challenges , it appears as if mainstream classical music organizations may be endangered , and at the very least may have to give fewer performances than theyve given in the past . <p> Some people people I respect a great deal think this would n't be all that serious a problem , because the number small classical performances has been increasing greatly in the past decade . So maybe these small performances could replace some of the big ones . <p> I like these smaller performances myself , but the one problem they have is that they do n't  make much money , and may not be able to ensure a living for classical musicians . So that 's really my concern here . How can classical music survive financially ? I stressed the cost of music education , because even the smallest , most informal , most innovative classical performance has in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musicians involved got their training . So if large music schools should have to cut back , that might make it impossible for some people even to learn to become professional classical musicians . <p> That was my point . I was n't trying to say that classical music gets too much money . ( Though some people do in fact think that , and I 'm not sure the classical music world as yet has a thorough answer for them . Thanks for offering yours ! ) <p> The basis for classical music has changed little in hundreds of years . It exists solely because of patronage by the wealthy . If you want to consider that a subsidy , it is the most traditional kind . Comparisons between classical music and popular music are useless because they appeal to completely different audiences who relate to the music in completely different ways . There is no accounting for taste . <p> Bruce <p> Bruce , I know that many people think the things you 're saying here , but some of it is mythical . There are many examples from classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Opera made a profit yes , a profit on ticket sales in the 1920s . Before World War II , almost every classical music organization in America ( certainly the largest orchestras ) made almost all their income from ticket sales . Now , granted , some proportion of those sales ( and at the Met , too ) were to wealthy patrons , but still the proposition involved was commercial . The performances took place , and ticket sales largely paid for them . Its a shock to learn , as I did over the past few years , that no major classical music institutions in America did any systematic fundraising until the 1970s . I 'm not saying wealthy patrons werent involved before that , giving money where money was needed , but in the past 60 years or more , there 's been a long-term evolution of the funding of classical music in this country , from reliance largely on ticket sales , to reliance largely on donations . <p> In the past , its easy to find examples of classical music as a commerical endeavor . Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurial impresarios , who rented opera houses and tried to make a profit . Almost any performance by 19th century virtuosos , like Liszt or Paganini . Handels opera companies in London , set up as profit-making corporations . Wealthy aristocrats invested in them , its true , but they expected ( or at least hoped ) to make a profit on their investments . <p> This list could be very greatly lengthened . The growth of the middle class in the 18th and 19th centuries greatly changed the economics of music , because it became possible to sell the middle-class audience all kinds of musical things pianos , concert tickets , printed music . Brahms made his fortune selling popular piano pieces , like his Hungarian Dances . <p> As for distinct audiences for pop and classical music , not so . Studies both here and in Europe has shown that the typical arts consumer ( forgive the phrase ) is an omnivore , paying attention to both high and popular culture . A recent European study failed to find any statistically significant percentage of people who only paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eastman listen to pop music , and some of them never listen to classical music . <p> The live concert audience is in many ways different . But then there are differences among various pop audiences as well . And among various classical audiences ! The opera audience is n't the symphony audience , the country audience is n't the hiphop audience , you 'll almost never see anyone black at a Bruce Springsteen concert , but when Luther Vandross was alive , youd hardly ever see anyone white in the audience when he performed . The alternative rock audience is n't the Joni Mitchell audience . Etc. , just about ad infinitum . <p> Besides , if classical music is losing traction in the modern world losing audience , even losing funding then it needs to gather more support , and that can only come from people who currently are n't  buying classical concert tickets . Theyre involved in pop music . So comparisons do start to matter though I have to repeat what I 've said to at least one other commenter here , namely that my comparison was designed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing of classical music meant that small classical performances might not be able to survive on their own , the way small pop performances can . I was n't saying this was good or bad . But I think its a fact . And it becomes an important fact if as some data seems to show funding for classical music starts to drop in the next decade or so . <p> If symphony orchestras made money in the past it was for one reason : the musicians in the orchestra subsidized the orchestra . <p> Musicians worked for less than a living wage . By doing so , they made it possible for orchestras to exist . <p> Who thinks we ought to revisit that paradigm ? <p> Paul A. Alter <p> ( Whose cousin committed suicide when sound films came in and the pit orchestra at the Fox Theater folded and he could no longer make a living and support his family . ) <p> Two points , Paul . <p> First : We cant let emotion get in the way of analyzing what 's going on . I never said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how that can be done . If there are difficulties , we have to see what they are , and face them . <p> Second : the increase in musicians pay is far from the only reason orchestras cant pay their expenses from ticket sales ( or , rather , come close to paying them ) . The increase in pay came in the 60s . By that time , the percentage of income from sales had already sharply declined from what it was in the 1930s . There are many reasons for the decline , but the most important one might be Baumols Dilemma , the economic principle that says service organizations are more expensive , over time , to run than manufacturing companies , because they do n't  show gains in productivity . Orchestras have always been cited as the classic example of this principle in action . The theory predicts that orchestras will become more expensive to run , over time , than the rest of the economy , and the decline of ticket sales as a percentage of needed income would appear to confirm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Modern Music , by Henry Pleasants ? His argument , reduced to its crudest essence , is " that which sells the best IS the best . " I consider that a line only a marketing schmoe could love . <p> The music which inspires me is in most cases music which has never attracted a wide audience , and it is not limited to classical music . I continue to believe that the commercial marketplace can do only so much when it comes to the arts before opportunities for musicians and audiences alike are foreclosed by claimed business necessities . Many of the musical business models are failing these days because they are based on inappropriate models themselves ( like a great deal of our economy , which is no longer dominated by farms or factories but you would never know it ! ) . <p> Popular music appeals as it does because of an identity processI do n't  really identify with classical composers in the same way I think popular music fans do with their favorites artists . I 'm a university trained musician and composer-aspirant who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably never will . I hold no animosity whatsoever toward those who do , but I believe it will continue to be a very specialized market until some of the national trends in places like Finland and , yes , Venezuela , begin to expand peoples tastes beyond the immediately accessible popular music . Which begs the question , are there such things as " unpopular music " or " unclassical music " ? I , personally , am not in search of an audience , and I do n't  wish to have my musical experiences heavily shaped by the " need " to appeal to an audience consistently , I just want more knowledge and experience as a musician . <p> Even your example of Brahms fails to take into account his drive to compose in older , outdated musical forms in a more absolutist approach that was clearly important to him and brought him criticism during his own time . His ability to write more " market-friendly " pieces like the Hungarian Dances is similar to , for example , what used to happen in the 1960s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop artists essentially capitalized more experimental and lower-selling musical artists . <p> But that model is now gone , apparently , and we are told we must combine many different musical genres in one concert in order to attract a wider audience . HmmmI do n't  think I 'd find a mix of Marley and Mozart very appealing , particularly if I 'm shelling out for the tickets . No offense to Mozart . = <p> So-called " classical " music developed from European folk music , but at some point became much more involved than that , the result of experimentation and daring by Vivaldi , Berlioz , Brahms , and a slew of others . I still believe it has always been a " calling , " whether one is a performer or composer . Its beyond the appeal of popular music at this point , and some of what were lead to believe is " modern classical music " ( a contradiction in terms ) <p> is even beyond all but the most academic audiences . <p> Sorry for my rambling rant , but I really think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Wall Street says . That 's why I prefer libraries to bookstoresmore selection ! <p> Bruce <p> Henry Pleasants a book that 's by now around 50 years old , more or less . I think we need more modern references . A lot has changed in the past few decades , as you yourself say . <p> Unpopular music ? A lot of what 's classified as " pop music " today is unpopular , in the sense that it does n't  sell very well . No serious person in the pop world would be surprised by much of what you say , except of course by the way you leave pop out of your commercial/noncommercial dichotomy . A lot of pop these days is noncommercial . The sooner the classical music world realizes that and stops imagining that classical music is the only noncommercial art music around the better . <p> How many times will I and others have to say that , before the classical music world catches on ? ( Of course , younger musicians already know this . ) <p> And if you do n't  want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't  go . ( Not that Ive ever heard of such a thing . ) But a simple fact , here there are many people who do want programs of at least certain kinds of classical and pop music combined on a program . There are enough of these people to make these programs a great success in both London and New York , and very likely elsewhere . So it might be best not to let your own taste lead you to prescribe things for the rest of the world . That 's good advice for everyone , of course , including me . <p> Well , my friend is n't actually wealthy though he does a lot of suppport for the arts . His position is really one of asking himself WHY he supports symphonic music ? That of course brings up questions about validity of programming , age of audience , cost of production versus income from tickets , etc. etc . The sheer expense of classical music does make the concert hall experience unattainable to many . I myself have to ask as a donor about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed by the elite few , when I could be supporting something else that serves more people and keeps the art form alive and growing . <p> Buyt what is that something else ? I completely and wholeheartedly agree with the perspective ( and my friend would too ) that it is time for a new model . And it is exciting to see it emerge in offerings such as those of the Brooklyn College of Music , and the concerts you mentioned in New York with indie music played alongside more standard ( ? ) classical compositions . It has not , however , arrived in the OC yet to my knowledge , though it might be more welcoome than some would believe ! <p> I am aware that the situation is different now . The question was " how did orchestras survive in the past " and my answer was that they were subsidized by the musicians that was then , this is now , and things are a lot different . <p> Take the orchestra that I know the most about the St. Louis SO . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Musicians got about $1500/season that 's for a years work . What would that be in todays dollars $15,000 to $30,000 ? <p> There were no assistant conductors ; the concertmaster was responsible for conducting when Golschmann couldnt . <p> There was no manager listed ; that job was taken care of by a guy whose main job was booking other events into town . <p> There was only one full-time percussionist ( apart from the tympanist ) . When more were required , men from the second violin section would move into the battery , which left the already barely nourished string section even smaller . <p> The orchestra gave its concerts in the Opera House of the Keil ( ne . St. Louis Municipal ) Auditorium , a pretty hall , with comfortable seating , and lousy acoustic . To make matters worse , on the other side of the back wall of the opera house stage was a sports arena , and musicians ( and , sometimes , the audience ) could hear the crowd noises from sports events . <p> Later , the hall decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , so it rehearsed in one of the meeting halls and played the concert in the opera house , making on-the-fly acoustic adjustments as it played . <p> Every year , Golshmann had to go to New York to find new players . He recruited people such as the first trumpet from the Radio City Music Hall Orchestra , a female trombone player who was the first woman to play brass in a major orchestra , a woman oboe , and the whole clarinet section of a Mexican mariachi orchestra that was touring through St. Louis . Then , at the end of the season , about 10% of the orchestra would move on ( there was a terrible drain of first oboe players ) , and Golschmann had to go fishing again . <p> It took some three to four concerts at the beginning of the season for the orchestra to cohere and reach concert pitch . So , the idea of programming the Beethoven ninth at the opening concert as many orchestras do today was out of the question . <p> Rather than driving people away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the orchestra would do this concert . Hey , would it really get through the concert ? <p> And , it did . Week after week , they concerts were worth attending and , sometimes , they were sheer magic . <p> But we could afford to take that chance , because the tickets started at less than two bucks per about what youd pay for a first-run movie on Saturday night . It was cheaper to go to the concert than it was to buy the equivalent recordings . <p> Orchestras tended to be threadbare operations in those days . It worked , but I do n't  want to go back . <p> Oh , and I do n't  intend my previous posting to be emotional . I only presented the facts as I saw them . Even my mention of Cousin Harry Brandts suicide was factual rather than emotional , showing that a career as a musician has always tended to be tough . In my lifetime , we 've lost movie-theater/vaudeville orchs , radio orchs , TV orchs , hotel orchs , restauranant ensembles , movie studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit orchs , etc , etc , etc . <p> Getting back to music schools for a moment , Ive come to loathe the word " training . " It reeks of indoctrination and automation , which is ( surprise ) what sometimes happens to students who enroll in such programs . Musicians do n't  need " training ; " they need to read , listen , and practice . I went to music school , and I 'd be lying if I said the theory and musicology requirements had no effect on me whatsoever , but the longer Im away from that environment , the more I realize that I 'm doing a better job of teaching myself than they did of teaching me . It takes something to get the ball rolling , but even just 4 ( well , uh 5 actually ) years of undergrad was too much . I spent the second half of those 5 years itching to get out of music school so that I could get to work on what really mattered to me . The lessons , on the other hand , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city with a half-decent scene , lessons of comparable quality can often be had for a fraction of the price ( my college tuba lessons , wonderful as they were , cost over $100 each , and only part of that went to the teacher , obviously ) . There are too many things that I found galling about music to list here , but on top of all of that , the lack of self-directedness among the general student body was pretty depressing . I do n't  know that there 's anything we can do about thatjust thought I 'd report my experience . I come from an academic and musical family , and would never say that musical training has no place in academia . I do believe , however , that what we have is in desperate need of reform . <p> One last thing . Somewhere above , I read this:Classical music and all art has value exactly because it is about truth , compassion and the human spiritI seem read a line very similar to this every single time I sit down to read something online ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ? <p> I 'll take a shot at that . <p> What people mean , I think , when they say such things is that classical music and other forms of high art have these values , but also and this is the crucial point that popular culture does n't  have them . Thus classical music and other forms of high art are crucial in our society . The statement , in other words , is really about popular culture , and not so much about the arts . 25395 @qwx885395 25409 @qwx885409 25393 @qwx885393 25408 @qwx885408 25394 @qwx885394 25401 @qwx885401 25400 @qwx885400 <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> @gsandow <h> Resources 25399 @qwx885399 25403 @qwx885403 25402 @qwx885402 25410 @qwx885410 25404 @qwx885404 
@@99220417 @3420417/ <h> Talk to me about running a dance company <p> In my absence , I 'm going to post a couple bonus interviews this week . Heres choreographer and Artistic Director Chase Brock of The Chase Brock Experience on ( not really ) being from the theater world , the importance of having a brand beyond the stage , and critics crossing genres . <p> Chase Brock is a 25-year old choreographer working in the areas of dance , theater , opera , television , film and music . Recently called " prolific " in The New Yorker , he is Artistic Director of The Chase Brock Experience , the New York City-based contemporary dance company he founded in 2006 . <p> You 're one of the few artists I 've ever met who 's ( just about ) as concerned with the aesthetics of you companys website , materials and merchandise as you are with that of your artistic work ! Why do you think presenting audiences with a complete , branded package is so important ? <p> In short , because that 's how I think we will survive and thrive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , especially downtown dance , to be far too insular and shortsighted in the sense of not reaching beyond the obvious audience base to try and speak to a larger and more diverse public , and as someone who is interested in reaching the broadest audience possible , I think its essential to consider branding and marketing very seriously . I want our audiences to feel that every aspect of their experience has been addressed with care and meticulousness , from their first glance at our ad and the subsequent visit to our web site , to the atmosphere when they arrive at the performance venue , to the content , programming , design and execution of the performance , to the post-performance interaction and communication we engage in with our audience members . <p> Further to that , have you ever been criticized by the dance press or by other choreographers for having cool merchandise and/or a great website ? If you 're spending so much time making things look nice and connecting with your audiences off-stage you 're not suffering for your art like you 're supposed to be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other choreographers criticizing those aspects of my work , thought its certainly possible . The web site has received almost unanimous praise , thanks in no small part to our incredible designer , Lisa Clayton of Starving Artist Web Design . I 'm so bored by the idea that my putting a bit of thought and energy and care into developing a visual identity for my company somehow automatically means I must be neglecting the dancing , or taking precious time and energy away from my work in the studio . The fact is , I 'm not taking time away I 'm adding it . When were preparing for a season , I get up at 6am and work in my office until about 9:15 , then I 'm in the studio by 10 . I usually have a series of afternoon meetings starting around 3 or 4pm , and then either return to rehearsal or to my office to work from about 6 to 10pm , followed by answering e-mails or reading until about midnight , when I go to sleep . Every artistic director , especially one leading a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous responsibilities that extend far beyond his primary creative work , and I 'm certainly not apologizing for that . I 'm celebrating the fact that we all somehow find the energy for it . <p> You come from the theater world , correct ? Do you think Broadway is currently undergoing a transformation , tapping modern dance choreographers like Bill T. Jones ( Spring Awakening ) and Karole Armitage ( Hair ) for productions rather than hiring choreographers who have made names for themselves in musical theater ( e.g. Kathleen Marshall and Susan Stroman ) ? If that is the trend , how can shows expand their audiences by using choreographers who are fresh to Broadway ? <p> I 'd like to clarify where I come from . I started dancing when I was 6 , and became increasingly serious about it as I grew older . At the same time , I also studied acting and performed in musical theater . When I was a teenager , I was studying ballet 6 days a week , with my dad driving me back and forth between schools ( and between states ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeschool , so that I could also find time to continue my acting and voice lessons . Dance was always my first love , but I kept having to choose between dance and theater . When I was offered summer scholarships to both Joffrey Ballet School and Broadway Theatre Project , I chose Broadway Theatre Project . In high school , when I had to choose between studying dance at Interlochen Arts Academy or moving to New York to train and audition independently , I chose to move to New York , and thankfully , Susan Stroman quickly cast me in her revival of The Music Man . So , even though I was dancing on Broadway by 16 , I do come from the dance world , first and foremost . <p> I certainly hope Broadway is currently undergoing the transformation you describe . I think that would be thrilling . My favorite Broadway choreography from the past ten years has been Matthew Bournes work on Swan Lake , Twyla Tharps work on Movin Out , Bill T. Joness work on Spring Awakening , Karole Armitages work on Hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Matthew Bourne and Stephen Mears work on Mary Poppins , and some of Twyla Tharps work on The Times They Are A-Changin , though I also particularly loved Peter Darlings work on Billy Elliot , and he is a more traditional theater choreographer . <p> Dance is the most primal , most basic , most visceral of the performing arts , and audiences recognize that when they 're confronted with first-rate dance . If Broadway producers and directors continue to reach out to quality choreographers and continue to challenge them to articulate their choreographic artistry and compositional skill in the theater , audiences are sure to take note . <p> Speaking of coming from theater , we were recently cracking up going through your press together : the writers just cant let go of you having worked on Broadway ! You ca n't change where you came from , as they say , and I suspect you are n't  planning on adapting your style to suit the press , either . But explain to us why contemporary dance critics seem to be immediately turned-off by Broadway credits . Why cant we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that I 'm very grateful to all of the critics who watch and write about my work , and for the consideration and coverage they continue to give my work . I think , in general , my work has actually been received quite well , however it is interesting to note that I do n't  believe my dance company has ever received a listing , feature or review that did n't  include the word " Broadway " at some point along the way . I do n't  know why this is the case . I 'm sure some writers mention it because they just find the work particularly theatrical , maybe others because they 're familiar with some of my background and are trying to give context to the reader , certainly others because they glanced quickly at my bio and noted the Broadway credits . I 'm sure there are a variety of reasons this happens , but it would be refreshing to open the paper and read a review that simply addressed the work at hand , and not the work , or presumed work , in my past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Edwin Denby and Arlene Croces criticism and essays are probabl y my favorite , and I also love reading Joan Acocella ( including her biography on Mark Morris ) . I love all of Susan Sontags writing , including her essays on ballet . Same goes for Jean Cocteau . The best , most expert writer on dance and certainly on the choreographic process is the great Agnes de Mille . I have all of her books in my library , and often return to Dance to the Piper , To a Young Dancer and Martha , her incredible biography of Martha Graham . Another favorite of mine is Doris Humphreys The Art of Making Dances . I think about her checklist every time I make a new dance . I also like Louis Horsts writing on composition and especially Twyla Tharps Push Comes to Shove and The Creative Habit , which have given me great comfort and companionship . <p> What are the main dance blogs ? In classical music , a lot of the critics have personal blogs where they provide additional or different coverage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wings of a performance , yet ? Tweeted on their iPhone while performing ? ( " just did good arabesque. partner @balletdude29 squeezing ribs too tight . " ) <p> Actually , I 'm not sure . The only blog I read obsessively is yours ! I 'm kind of new to the blog world , and would love to find a good dance blog . I know Doug Fox writes one called Great Dance , but I 'm not sure of others . I will do some research on that . I love your idea of Tweeting from the wings of a performance , and I 'm going to find a way to make that happen one of these days . If its already been done , I 'm not aware of it . <p> Ive been going through a phase of wondering why performing arts journalism is n't completely multimedia-based ; why do we write about performances when we could record video and audio and then provide personal insight while showing the actual event . Have you seen or experienced any interesting multimedia arts coverage in the dance world ? <p> You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album . If we can get music critics out to the performances at the Abrons Arts Center , how do you think theyll react ? Has The Chase Brock Experience ever been reviewed by a non-dance critic before ? <p> First , I 'd like to say that Gabriel is no doubt one of the brightest talents of our generation , and I 'm honored to be collaborating with him . I love the idea of music critics attending dance concerts , and think it could be lead to some fascinating criticism . Music is the primary impetus for my work as an artist , and I strive to create dances with the musical sensitivity , reverence and care that 's evident in the work of great choreographers ( and musicians ) like Balanchine , Graham , Mark Morris and Jiri Kylian . I would hope that a music critic would recognize the musicality of the dancing , and perhaps even hear the music more clearly or more fully as a result . I like the idea of using dance to awaken or reignite familiar , beloved or forgotten pieces of music for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may not have heard before , and I 'm certain that our upcoming performances will help to expand the audience for Gabriels music , which excites me tremendously . <p> If you could offer one piece of advice about how to brand a completely new dance company , what would it be ? <p> My advice would always be to start with the work , and to let that guide everything else . I did n't  necessarily know exactly what we were doing when we started this company , but as we began to work and as we 've continued to work regularly over the past three years , our artistic priorities and goals have become clearer , and I hope a sense of branding has emerged as an authentic , logical and fun expression of our mission . <h> Comments <p> hi i 'm 15 years old and would like to take dance futher , i dance once a week and have another show coming up with 3 dances 12th july . i 'm just wondering how do i start my career and at what age ? i have 1 year left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i finish . <h> Amanda Ameer <p> is a publicist who started First Chair Promotion in July 2007 .

@@99220418 @3420418/ <h> Demystifying Museum Acquisitions : A Model Exhibit , A Model Proposal <p> Since June 30 , the Wadsworth Atheneum has been showcasing recent acquisitions in a special show called The Museum Collects , which goes beyond- the practice some museums have of placing new acquisitions in a special gallery ( though I like that , too ) its out to explain why museums buy certain things . As Robin Jaffee Frank , the museums Chief Curator , told the Hartford Courant : <p> When you acquire a new work of art , its exciting , but it also has to contribute something to the understanding of works that are already here. - You have to justify how it enriches the collection , how it is filling a gap and enhancing the museums existing strengths , or maybe how it can take that strength in a new direction . It has to help tell a larger story about art and culture than the museum was already telling . <p> This helps demystify museums , explaining why they do what they do , and its a trend I applaud. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Conversations With Curators " - that explores these- decisions more deeply. - <p> The Courant article provides several examples , including- two- pieces of furniture in the exhibition one is a- cupboard " made in Virginia in the 17th century , " that the- Atheneum has owned for- a long time . " The other , a fall-front desk made around 1870 by emancipated slave William Howard , was recently acquired , " and Frank said- that Howard would have known of similar pieces , as he borrowed ideas from it . <p> When I wrote an article about acquisitions endowments for The New York Times earlier this year , the Minneapolis Institute of Arts provided me with the documentation used by its curators to propose several recent acquisitions . Although I 've been writing about museums for a long time , I found them enlightening .

When museum people talk about stirring up more interest in their permanent collections , sharing information like this should be on the list . <h> Comments <p> Interesting ! As I 'm sure you are aware , The Met itself has a program called Conversation with a Curator ( sometimes called Conversation with a Conservator depending on what the speaker does ) .

@@99220419 @3420419/ <h> The practical approach to board unity <p> I just had reason to revisit the wonderful writing of John Carver on governing boards ( you can find a useful summary of his work here , or read the book ) . And I was struck again by the clarity and consistency of his approach to an otherwise hazy endeavor . If you can get past his personal hubris ( one of his books calls him the " Creator of the Worlds Most Provocative and Systematic Governance Model " ) , you 'll find true insights into boards that focus , and boards that flail . <p> One of the most powerful elements of Carvers model is his principal of " One Voice . " We all know that governing boards work best when they can engage in honest and open debate , but then move forward with clarity and consistency . While other writing on board governance covers this ground in aspirational tones ( " cant we all just get along ? " ) , Carver crafts a practical approach to the challenge . <p> A governing board only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature offers no alternative . Its " one voice or none at all . " <p> In Carvers view , a governing board only speaks when it makes a decision following its accepted process ( a resolution put to a majority vote , usually ) . Up until that moment in all the conversations , disagreements , debates , and modifications its not the board speaking , only the board members . Says he : <p> The board speaks authoritatively when it passes an official motion at a properly constituted meeting . Statements by board members have no authority . In other words , the board speaks with one voice or not at all . The " one voice " principle makes it possible to know what the board has said , and what it has not said . This is important when the board gives instructions to one or more subordinates . " One voice " does not require unanimous votes . But it does require all board members , even those who lost the vote , to respect the decision that was made . Board decisions can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While the distinction may seem semantic , its extraordinarily powerful . It clarifies for board members that they have no individual authority over the organization , only authority as a collective . It clarifies for staff and leadership the difference between debate and decision only one of which should drive their work . During a two-hour board meeting , the board may speak only a few times even though the conversation has dragged on forever . <p> Of course , the " one voice " principal does require a lot of its board members that they avoid the post-game politics when a resolution does n't  go as they had hoped ; that they do n't  plot with sidegroups on the board to block the action despite the vote to move forward ; that staff does n't  collar individual board members to find a workaround that 's more to their liking . <p> Carvers approach still is n't easy , but at least its clear .

Fitting , I suppose , given Warhols condition . <p> Just kidding .

@@99220422 @3420422/ <h> Back to business models <p> Diane Ragsdale pulls on the broken business model thread in her Jumper blog , and triggers a bunch of interesting comments on the subject . She wonders what , exactly , her colleagues mean by a business model , and what specifically is broken about it . Its an essential conversation , and worth every moment of attention it gets ( even when we do n't  know how to focus that attention ) . <p> A key challenge in most business model conversations in the arts is that they almost immediately focus entirely on revenue streams , rather than the larger integrated system of a functional and vital business model ( of which revenue is certainly an essential part ) . <p> The best attempt to reframe a more coherent and systemic approach to business model discussion , analysis , and design is the book Business Model Generation , by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur . Its not specifically about arts organizations , creative enterprise , or nonprofits . But it sets out a useful definition of what a business model is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and focused attention to its many moving parts . <p> To start , the book offers a rather useful definition of what a business model is : <p> A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates , delivers , and captures value . <p> Then , it describes nine essential elements ( building blocks ) of any business model for-profit , non-profit , whatever that work together as a system to create , deliver , and capture value ( or not , as the case may be ) . These are : <p> Customer Segments : The one or more customer segments the enterprise seeks to serve . <p> Value Propositions : The problems the enterprise seeks to solve for those customers , or the needs it seeks to fill . <p> Channels : The communication , distribution , and sales channels used to connect customers to those value propositions . <p> Customer Relationships : The nature , tone , and intensity of relationships formed between and among customer segments . <p> Revenue Streams : The cash or other economic value generated when value propositions successfully connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop and deliver the elements described above . <p> Key Activities : The activities required to develop and deliver the elements described above . <p> Key Partnerships : The organizations , individuals , or resources outside the organization required to make the system work . <p> Cost Structure : The costs generated by the interconnection and execution of all the elements defined above . <p> While the above elements may seem overly focused on generating profit , the authors of the book are quite careful not to do so . They use value as they key issue , and specifically value delivered to a defined group outside the organization . In my ongoing conversations with arts professionals , I 've actually started to float the term value model rather than business model , as the latter almost always either derails the conversation into revenue , or disconnects the many for whom business is an uncomfortable term related to their work . ( The jury is still out on whether the alternate phrase is any better than the original . I 'll keep you posted . ) <p> In a future post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified in the book that seem most compelling to our work in the arts . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> I love this definition of business models ! Not only does it shift the conversation away from revenue to value , it also incorporates the balance sheet ( specifically , assets ) . In defining the value we create and deliver in the arts , we also need to explore what resources we truly need to support that value . Most nonprofit arts organizations are mis-capitalized , meaning they lack enough of the right kinds of money to adapt their programming and operations in response to changes in the environment and demand for their work . This flexibility is very much influenced by the composition of the balance sheet . In many cases , particularly in the arts , the fixity of assets impedes adaptability . Building the right amounts of liquidity takes a backseat to other priorities . Any conversation about business models should explore the relationship between value proposition and asset composition . <p> I 've used the Osterwalder/Pigneur business model canvas with arts organisations when looking at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting back to basics as well as detail . I think its good in creating a focus on what resources ( which might include assets ) are needed to deliver the value , which can lead to thinking through how you build those and sustain those and what investment is needed . For non-profits Ive added a section/conversation around mission though . Yesterday I was facilitating a session at Mission Models Moneys Culture Change conference at which someone said they had subsidy and then a business model alongside it , which illustrated for me the distance to travel , at least in the UK . <p> I appreciated this post . I understand the diverse elements that comprise a business model , and I think " value model " is a nice way of describing it philosophically . But non-profit arts organizations are still businesses that can not deliver value without capturing sufficient value in return to create and support their work . Several of the elements in the Osterwalder/Pigneur list are " levers " that when adjusted one way or the other , ultimately affect revenue , the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Diane Ragsdales great post , I pounced on revenue streams and key resources , because I think those areas are where the widest cracks exist . I liked Rebecca Thomas comment that there is a problem between value distribution and asset composition . Arts organizations often do n't  have the level of up-front or long-term capitalization comparable to for-profit enterprises . Second , traditional income sources ( tickets , gifts , grants , events ) that have sustained arts groups for years , are shrinking rapidly , for lots of different reasons . We need to adjust several of our " value model " levers in order to fix our revenue streams short-term , and build capacity to sustain arts organizations long-term . So many arts organizations are undercapitalized from their beginning , its difficult for them to weather an industrial storm like we are experiencing today . Its not necessarily any easier in the for-profit sector to open and sustain a business . Businesses open and close daily due to poor capitalization , management , rising competition , increased costs , a tough economy , etc . Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase revenue because the sources are becoming ever elusive . I keep coming back to shifting revenue streams and lack of key financial resources , but the " model " drivers for revenue generation are indeed much more complex . I 'm curious to read your further analyzis on this fascinating issue . <p> It is a well-known phenomenon that the present tends to favor , well , the present . Since the non-profit arts sector came into its own about a generation ( and small change ) ago , it has grown to supply value , relying on a basic assumption that institutionalized , subsidized , and tax-preferred structures would deliver a product that people wanted , but couldnt be sustained at the market rate or would n't be available to a broad audience at the going rate . It is very likely that 1+ generations down the road ( or maybe 1/3+ ) this model will be passe , and that large parts of the sector as we know it will disappear . If you need a point of reference , think USSR circa 1979 to 198- <p> Andrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of business model shortcomings . Disciplined measurement , disclosure and data supported decisions is woefully inadequate . Orchestra managers and boards need to know , but do n't know each product 's economics ; using cost accounting to allocate all institutional costs , earned and contributed revenue to each product . This is relatively easy . New products typically loose money initially , but hopefully attract new audience , whose value can be estimated using demographic data and customer lifetime value projections . This is more difficult , but important since there is considerable product experimentation . Hopefully your school teaches this . Daniel Lewis

@@99220431 @3420431/ <h> Bounce to Disc <p> One more thing about composing , since these theme columns tend to come in threes . <p> This is a guilty secret . When composing , I usually imagine more how the piece will sound on recording than in live performance . <p> There is , as we classical types all too seldom recognize , a difference . I love listening to Feldmans For Samuel Beckett on disc ; I can just melt into it . But I heard it live once ( John Kennedy conducting at Lincoln Center ) , and I felt nearly suffocated , sonically claustrophobic . Ten minutes into it I had an impulse to flee the hall but I did n't  . On the other hand , I do n't  think Feldmans Second Quartet would mean nearly so much to me if I had heard it only on CD , and not live . I had to live through it in real-time experience to fully get it . And those are two extremely different examples within the same composers output . In live performance I expect to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of drama . I tend to pick CDs to listen to more for ambience , based on overall consistency and a paucity of dramatic contrast . <p> And I have many reasons to imagine my music on recording . One is that 98% of the music with which I am extremely familiar I know from recordings , not from live performance . Opportunities to hear my favorite works live are extremely , extremely rare . I was in my 50s before I got to hear Thomsons Symphony on a Hymn Tune and Harriss 3rd live , and I 've loved them from high school . As for my own music , for every one person who hears it live , there will be 300 , or maybe 3000 , who will hear it on a recording . I think most of us are pretty much in the same boat here . <p> But the most important reason is that I like records . Let me amend that : I **38;1017;TOOLONG records . I started collecting records when I was 12 . ( I went down to Melody Shop in downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Threepenny Opera and Berliozs Romeo and Juliet . Heaven opened up to me . I still adore both pieces . ) Here is almost a third of my CD collection : <p> I appreciate the immediacy of live performance , and in some sense I realize Ive never really heard a piece until I hear it live , and many live performances have changed my life , but I have a lifelong love affair with records . Live performances are nervous-making , and almost never go completely the way you wanted . Becoming a critic was , for awhile , the perfect profession : most of the discs you see there were sent me free of charge . ( Its a fairly small collection by music critic standards , because your average living composer does n't  put out new discs nearly as often as jazz and straight classical musicians do . ) What would really , really make me feel like a composer , though , as I 've said before , would be to have my music on an RCA vinyl record with a clear plastic inner sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe Ormandy conducting , with , say , the Berg Violin Concerto on side 2 . That 's what composers were when I was a kid , and that would make me feel like I finally achieved composerhood . I do n't  expect to ever get it ( certainly not with Ormandy ) . <p> That is not to say that I put out CDs conceived as " records , " any more than most classically trained composers do . For some reason we keep writing as though for live performance . I have n't managed to put out " concept albums , " although some of my electronic works have tended that way , if I could get enough of them together on one disc . I think The Planets works well as a total CD because of its length and stylistic unity ; its my best record whether its my best piece or not .

Picked it up out of the machine , held it to the light , and it had a dozen or so pinpricks where the coating had , I du n no , fallen off or collapsed or something . I listened instead to the mp3s on my hard drive . Ive transferred most of those CDs to three hard drives , and hopefully will transfer those files to newer ones before the hard drives quit working .

Which has me thinking , if I , as someone who loves this music and knows a bit about it , have trouble enjoying myself , how is anyone else going to ? But as a composer , I 've been trained to think about putting on a concert as the end goal of the piece . So , I think focusing on recordings and putting out albums rather than just collections of pieces , is another frontier ripe for exploration if composers wish to stay relevant .

" For both a generation of classical composers who grew up unconcerned with pop-classical boundaries and who also grew up hearing things primarily in recorded form , the notion of the " album " may feel rather normal as a way of thinking about structuring work . As one example , Nonesuch just released Timothy Andress new hour-long piece for two pianos , which he states in the notes he very much conceived of as an " album for two pianos " ( though it can and has obviously be performed live ) . And as a corollary , there are many examples of composers who put together a rather different version of a piece in the context of the " studio recording " , as compared to what was played in live concerts . <p> I hope your future grandchildren DO want your vinyl collection my dad has a magnificent collection of vinyl and the only reason I could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he decides to downsize .

Both have their merits as distinct experiences of art . <p> Even those paper scores are going out of style as authoritative documents , as you 've written before . I 'm always immensely relieved when I can submit PDFs rather than hard copies . Hopefully this development allows us to think of the score in a more utilitarian way . Digital scores are certainly inherently more mutable , which would seem to alleviate the pressure of making them infallible . Also , another great thing about recording as the primary document over live performance is how it allows people around the world &amp; outside major metro areas to be engaged with what 's going on in new music .

What strikes me as odd , though , is when a composer indulges in a recording-dependent technique like multi-tracking , but then still sticks with the 19th-century classical ( romantic ) shtick of a wide dynamic range , such that I have to continually fiddle with the volume on my playback in order to hear the quiet bits .

His pieces are classic essays in the humanist tradition that goes back to Montaigne . They 're part personal memoir , part guide , part explanation , part appreciation , part conveyor of insight , whether it be practical , moral , political or philosophical . The essays are all very much in the voice of this Southern Methodist University literature professor and longtime editor of Southwest Review : elegantly phrased yet seemingly casual , bemused yet thoughtful . And , of course , literate and learned but not in an off-putting manner . Think of it as a likable donnishness . It 's that voice , that ruminative process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It succeeds so well in leading a reader along . <p> In his introduction , Spiegelman explains that he comes from cheerful stock . His outlook on life , as most of ours have , has been shaped by his genes . As he says in our televised conversation ( which you can see at Art&amp;Seek ) , he could do without these activities , these pleasures , and still be cheerful . This is one of the rare places in Seven Pleasures that I parted company with the likable don . <p> I think for many of us our pleasures are salvations . They 're redemptive , rehabilitative . They can make our miserable lives tolerable . For a time , they take us out of ourselves , which is the original meaning of the Greek , ekstasis -- to transport , displace , put into a trance .

" <p> As he goes on , Spiegelman occasionally does become transported . A little , anyway , he 's a thoroughly rational and grounded individual , but one of his pleasures , after all , is writing , writing what we 're reading , so inevitably his own pleasure comes through . The simple act of looking , he declares , can be life saving . " Swimming keeps me happy , " it lifts him into " a higher spiritual realm . " And as he points out in his essay on writing ( although the point pops up elsewhere ) , when done well , when done with a relaxed awareness , these activities can be meditative , illuminating .

A couple of weeks ago I got sick of not having a piano , and set up my 88-key MIDI controller with a sampler that has a pretty good piano sound , but I never have time to play anyway . I 'd been feeling drained lately from being wrapped up in school committee work and running the music department . I was weary of sitting on committees , of arguing with the administration , handling student crises , doing departmental paperwork , and answering carping e-mails complaining about my politics or my blog . <p> Then Tuesday afternoon my 4:30 student cancelled , and by some miracle I did n't  have a school concert or event to attend that night . I came home and found a package in the mail from Tom Johnson , composer and one of my predecessors ( before Greg Sandow ) as new-music critic at the Village Voice . It contained , among other things , a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite Tom Johnson piece . This is a very flat , 60-minute piece , quarter-note equals 59 all the way through , highly repetitive but in an irregular way , so that you never get to trust the sparkling 16-note grooves you settle into . It never deviates from the key of G , though some dissonant motives wash through from time to time . The pedal is held constantly , and 99 percent of the notes are in or just above the treble clef . <p> As best I could without a page turner , I played through the entire thing on my electric piano , nonstop . It was like meditating . It absolutely focused me , and school seemed a zillion miles away . By the time I played the final measures an hour later I was in a healthier and completely altered state of mind . Much piano music could have the same effect on the pianist , but if you 're playing a Beethoven sonata there are difficult parts and easier parts , and a continual change of scenery , so to speak . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricky passages , and there 's a lot you memorize in the process . If you want to practice most modern music like Webern or Stefan Wolpe , there 's a different kind of mental work involved . But in An Hour for Piano there 's really nothing you can memorize because the returns of former figures are too unpredictable , and there 's almost no measure more or less difficult than another . The piece requires constant attention to the page , but requires little of your fingers aside from that they keep moving . Its an amazing piece , and I do n't  know of anything else like it . I made a copy to keep at school , and whenever I have 15 minutes to spare , I start playing it . Afterwards , I 'm always refreshed , and the noise in my mind has been turned off for awhile . <p> Perhaps An Hour for Piano is the perfect paradigm for the postclassical instrumental piece . Much of the 18th-century music we cherish and put up with today was written for home performance , but our home life has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its also masterfully written in an understated way , with ideas , motives , and note complexes that keep coming back again and again when you least expect them , like a symphony or novel delivered in a quiet deadpan voice , or an expert comic monologue . You could base a whole new school of composition on this 1973 piece , a new kind of meditation music quite different from Pauline Oliveross , and no ones done it yet . Tom also sent me a compact disc of his Bonhoeffer-Oratorium , his two-hour oratorio on texts of Dietrich Bonhoeffer on the Deutsche Bank Bauspar AG label . If An Hour for Piano is the Waldstein Sonata of the postclassical era , the Bonhoeffer-Oratorium is its Carmina Burana : the rhetorical cliches of choral music embraced and repeated until a kind of innocent and infectious joy accumulates . Tom proves , as others have , that its not so difficult to write great music : just set something beautiful in motion and then get out of the damn way . <p> You can order the score to An Hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . And , if you play the piano , I recommend it . There 's also a Lovely Music recording of it by Frederic Rzewski , who does a wonderful job .

Today we would have to call him a socialist or worse , because there is no major political party with ideas remotely as democratic , liberal , and left-leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and voted against his pocketbook , he was kind of a minor George Soros of his day . And yet , ludicrously , his reputation , now based more on innuendo than fact , has become such that musicians routinely bring him up as a parallel to Wagner , as someone whose music one can only like despite his personal failings . <p> Antonio Celaya writes to remind me that when Lou Harrison had a nervous breakdown and needed several months hospitalization , John Cage applied to Ives , who paid Lous expenses ; and that he did this knowing Harrison was gay , which Lou was never secretive about . The biography Composing a World : Lou Harrison , Musical Wayfarer , by Leta E. Miller and Fredric Lieberman , confirms this . In 1942 Harrison frankly told the draft board that he was gay , yet Ivess relationship with Harrison in the late 1940s was affectionate , writing him humorous letters to " Lew Harry Son , " and treating him much as a son . Lou spent years editing Ives manuscripts , and I remember him referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does this sound to you like Charles Ives was a homophobe ? Do you know of someone whose information on the subject would be better than Harrisons ? <p> And let me repeat , because it may have gone out of currency , a story about Ives told by one Charles J. Buesing , who worked for Ives at the Ives &amp; Myrick Agency , and who was interviewed by Vivian Perlis for her splendid oral history project . In 1969 , Buesing said , <p> We worked a half-day on Saturdays . We would rarely see Mr. Myrick , but Mr. Ives would be there many Saturdays . One man came by me one Saturday afternoon , and he had tears in his eyes . As Mr. Ives went out the door , this fellow said , " There is a great man . " And he told me this story . He had had the experience for the past few months of not making any sales at all . Since we were wholly on a commission basis , if you did n't  sell , you just did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he thought he looked rather dejected so he said , " Charlie ( his name was Charlie too ) , do me a personal favor . Will you take out your wallet ? " And he did . " Now , " he said , " you open it . " Then he said , " Will you point it toward me ? " The wallet was empty . Charles Ives said , " I thought so . No one can ever make a sale of anything with an empty wallet . Now , I want you to take this as a business loan . I know you 'll have so much confidence with what I am going to put in that wallet that you will pay me back , and I do n't  want any I.O.U . or anything else . " And he put fifty dollars in there . It was after the 1929 stock market crash , and this man had fifty dollars in his pocket . He had n't  seen that much income in the past couple of months . It made a big difference with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . <p> And this is the kind of story that people used to tell about Ives before Maynard Solomon ( author of a passable Mozart biography and a really sucky Beethoven biography ) wrote a nasty article accusing him of trying to pump up his reputation , an article whose assertions have been completely discredited by subsequent scholars . Yet ever since that article people have practically broken their legs trying to climb on the bandwagon of the Ives-despisers . Yet there are many laudatory comments in Perliss Charles Ives Remembered , by friends and coworkers and musicians remembering what a kind , generous , unpretentious man he was . He volunteered as an ambulence driver during World War I , but was turned down on account of his heart condition . His family had been fervent abolitionists , and his parents adopted a poor Black boy . Unlike so many musicians , Ives was devoted to his wife , and she to him . He bankrolled musical projects by Cowell , Slonimsky , and others , and almost single-handedly kept new experimental American music alive during the Depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished music award , and replied , " Prizes are for boys , " giving half the money to Harrison and the other half to Cowells New Music Edition . Truly we can say of Ives as W.H. Auden said of Mozart , <p> How seemly , then , to celebrate the birth <p> Of one who did no harm to our poor earth , <p> Created masterpieces by the dozen . <p> And yet , unfathomably , Ives has become one of those composers that people can hardly speak about now without reference to his alleged failures as a human being . Its shameful , an example of Wagnerphobia missaplied and run amok . Did Ives have faults ? Sure he seems to have been a little strait-laced , and went into business partly because he could n't handle the Bohemian lifestyle that many musicians lived . I think less of him for that , but I keep up a rather middle-class lifestyle myself , and am perhaps more like him than I like admitting . Hed get choleric and fire off nasty insults at music critics and orchestra conductors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , have I ever done anything that awful ? Are these sufficient basis to hang a permanent cloud of moral suspicion over him ? As one correspondent noted , Ives was such a great man and such an incredibly innovative composer that people cant deal with him , and they have to whittle him down to size to digest him . <p> Why do I get so exercised about it ? For three reasons : <p> 1 . Because I 'm a music historian , and I prefer that people believe things about music that are true ( the reason for which I am similarly always defending Mozart against that wretched Amadeus film ) ; <p> 2 . Because Ives is my favorite composer , and more than anyone else the source of my musical ideas and aesthetic attitudes , and I feel a personal stake in his reputation ; and , <p> 3 . Because if someone as selfless , generous , well-intentioned , and full of integrity as Ives can be saddled with a scandalous reputation after his death by an evil cabal , or perhaps by just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then not one of us is safe from the machinations of hate-mongering slanderers . I do n't  flatter myself that I have as many excellent qualities as Ives did , and I shudder to think what 22nd-century Maynard Solomon will lie in ambush to attach to my name unfounded charges of racism , wife-beating , or whatever post-postmodern thought-crime for which no word has yet even been coined . <h> Comments <p> Post is old , but I just stumbled over it ( again ) and this time had to forward it to my four Ives-loving friends .

That 's the first roadblock pulled out of a hat to rationalize " why not . " <p> I have heard this particular roadblock deployed many times , including in response to the advocacy for a special form of assistance to help schools without any certified arts teachers locate and hire these teachers . We were we told : " if we did that , we would have to do it for every subject . " <p> I have even heard this presented in regards to calls for restoration of previously existing funding lines . <p> It presents a great challenge for any advocate , and in some respects its the sort of thing that must be dealt with successfully in order for arts education to advance . In other words , how does one advocate successfully with the policy makers , when they tell you something you know is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could take issue with that particular roadblock ? What 's false about it ? Well , I would propose that based upon experience and observation , that this particular argument is sophistry . Its the presentation of a specious argument in order to deflect or deter . <p> Let 's look at the STEM initiatives as a frame of reference . Something special for Science , Technlogy , Engineering , and Math , do n't  you think ? Were those proposing STEM initiatives told it couldnt be done , for it would have to be done for all the other subjects ? Let 's face it , STEM is deeply embedded with Race to the Top . It was an engine within Race to the Top . Did anyone tell the USDOE or the state applicants you cant do that ? <p> And as an aside , there 's a lesson here too , about STEM , the arts , and the desire to create STEAM . Many people feel that there is promise in adding the arts to STEM . Its a good idea , and I support it . You read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to likelihood : the STEM express has very likely left the Race to the Top station and the arts did n't  have a ticket . STEM did n't  just happen overnight . We were very late to the table , and late to join forces with the successful advocates such as The STEM Education Coalition . <p> Okay , I digress . <p> How about the Common Core standards ? Did anyone mention to the National Governors Association and the Chief Council of State School Officers that you could n't do this for ELA and Math , if you did n't  for all the other subjects ? And wait , its more than simply the standards . Its a also a giant national initiative as part of Race to the Top , to develop the next generation performance-based assessment for the standards . Its all a web of policy and eventual practice , that many see is the entire web of education policy and practice , and it is based upon two subjects : ELA and math . <p> Okay , let 's look at another example : providing incentives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do it for math , should n't you be able to do it for the arts ? <p> I could go on , and on , and on , but the point should be well taken by now . <p> Is there a teachable moment for this field , in light of what I am blathering about ? <p> Personally , the issue exists as a microcosm for what holds our work back . The strategies , tactics , and identity that will enable us to successfully overcome this particular roadblock are key to the success in advocacy within the field of arts education , and possibly the arts overall . <p> Are we there yet ? No . But spending time thinking through how to break through is a good part of what we need to be working on . <h> Richard Kessler <h> Dewey21C <p> is a blog dedicated to the belief that the arts are part of our genetic code .

A month off from work followed that last post , and as were blowing through September , I have started a new chapter in my career as Dean of the Mannes College The New School for Music . <p> Its not all that often that one gets a month off . It was a month that I viewed as time to leave behind the past seven years at The Center for Arts Education , while clearing my mind for the very new challenge of leading a music conservatory that is part of a fairly unorthodox university ( The New School ) . It did n't  hurt that one of the founders of The New School , and father of its initial educational design was none other than John Dewey . <p> There is so much that I want to share about these early days in my tenure . I thought it would be a good call to start with something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as arrived at The New School . <p> In K-12 , the pathway to college is and has been for many years the brass ring . Ten years ago it was simply getting students to college . For arts educators , we were being asked what we were doing to increase the high school graduation rates , with the presumption that graduates would move along to college at increasing rates , in addition to simply ensuring a higher high school graduation rate and all that it implies . Slowly it became about college and career readiness , which is the key frame for the Common Core Standards . What should a student know and be able to do in college and career . - One way or the other , K-12 policy has been about getting more and more students to college , even if remediation rates are alarmingly high . <p> At the very same time , higher education is under fire . In almost every respect higher education is being challenged , whether its on the basis of cost , design , relevancy , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others question the value of the degree altogether . Its too expensive . Its too abstract . The model is busted . There is no accountability . There is no data . It is hand cuffed by tenure and unions . Freshman enrollment is down . Students are taking longer to graduate . <p> Naturally , the above includes just a few issues in common with K-12 . <p> You have to admit , at the very least , how fascinating it is to witness a sort of accountability movement in higher education , one which at time calls to question fundamental value , while at the very same time , most of K-12 policy continues to triangulate on moving students to college . <p> For me , at my new position , there is one particular question from K-12 that I find to be the perfect lens to peer through : what should a graduate know and be able to do . It is through that particular frame that I believe assessment and improvement is possible at my new job .

During the summer , when a lot of bands are touring , I shoot as many as four concerts a week . I probably average four to six bands a week for the entire year . <p> What has been your favorite concert to shoot so far , other than all of the Wordless concerts , obviously ? <p> I short of fell into it . I 've always loved music but photography is a recent passion . PlaybackSTL , a music magazine from my hometown of Saint Louis , Missouri needed a photographer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just about the sickest concert photographer alive , recommended me for the job . After a few back and forth emails with the editor , I jumped in head-first . Twenty bands and five days later I was hooked . <p> I think you have an amazing ability to capture the moments of a concert in your photographs ; do you think that ability comes from training as a photographer or a passion for music/performance ? <p> Aww thanks ! Actually , its neither . I 'd love to tell you either that I 'm an amazing photographer with years of training or that my dedication to music took me to Juilliard but I cant . The truth is , I have n't had any training and although I love music , I 'm constantly humbled by the passion of others for performance . If there 's one thing that helps me " capture the moments , " I 'd say its my obsession with detail . I have very specific ideas about how to take photos and when to take them . I think my work is basically what you get when you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill and put her/him in the front row . Okay , I 'm being overly modest , but I do think that some of the best concert photographers are lovers of both but masters of neither . <p> What are some of the obstacles to getting " the perfect shot " ? I remember once you said some girls legs were in your way <p> Wow , where to begin . While its true that the various body parts of the audience are often in my way , it would be closer to reality to say that I am actually in the way of the audience . I 'm extremely conscious of my adverse impact on the concert-going experience and its actually the continual state of " being in the way " that is a big impediment to getting the best shots . I prefer to shoot at venues with a barricade so I can avoid pissing people off . Outside blocking an audience member with my camera , the main obstacles are lighting and the time limit . <p> Getting to shoot for three songs is becoming generous these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is totally insane . I understand completely that artists and fans do n't  want a horde of 20 photographers spoiling their show , but if things continue as they are , there simply wont be any iconic images to remember current music by . Artists and management want more control over image these days . To them , a documentary photo showing that the concert took place is sufficient . I seriously doubt Annie Leibovitz or Kevin Mazur would agree . Consequently , over half of the images in my portfolio were taken after the first three songs . <p> Lastly , lighting is a huge factor . To put it simply , no one has any right to complain about crappy photos if the lighting designer uses strobes or a dim red wash during the first three songs . Next question please , I 'm getting depressed ! <p> From what you 've seen of classical music photography , do you think there 's a lower standard for live shots at those concerts ? That is , do you think people might assume an orchestral concert will be less exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pictures ? <p> Its more that the standard is different , not necessarily lower . I think the classical music experience is stuck in a sort of cultural prison that I readily ( but unfairly ) associate with expensive tickets , double-breasted blazers and hours of sitting in silence . Those associations are pretty ugly but I 'm not sure that your typical producer of a classical music concert has figured out how to attract a younger audience without losing the existing fanbase . To answer your question , I think that the people who photograph classical music are hired by producers trapped within the old visuals the image of an expansive orchestra , uniformed and faceless with an old white man in front . <p> Whether the photographer is capable of more exciting photos or not , the client determines the final presentation . One of the main reasons I love working for Wordless is the lack of tradition and abundance of experimentation . I hope my photos are a reflection of this . <p> Do you think more interesting live concert photographs could make classical music more accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think a series of photographs from each sections perspective ( including the conductors ) during a concert would be cool , though I realize that would be difficult to make happen during a performance . <p> Certainly . I think interesting photography combined with unconventional writing and promotion are key to bringing classical music to a wider audience . Dynamic images , particularly of avant-garde contemporary classical musicians , have the ability to capture the attention of a more diverse audience than is normally associated the genre . I think the classical musicians who are willing to take an unconventional approach to their image will benefit from a wider fan base and greater name recognition . There 's no reason a photo of Cameron Carpenter totally killing it on the Trinity Church organ ca n't be as compelling ( if not more ) than a photo of Jack White in a plain red t-shirt . Image and public perception are not a talent show . <p> I think photos from the perspective of each section is an interesting idea , albeit impossible to execute at anything more than a dress rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holiday when the photographer takes pictures of Audrey Hepburn all day with a cigarette lighter camera ? Do tiny cameras exist that an orchestra could attach to music stands to take photos while each member was playing a certain movement or something ? I would love to see some shots like that displayed in lobbies or used for advertising materials . Thoughts ? What can orchestras do to make their photographs stand out ? <p> The technology to photograph each musician from the stand certainly exists . I think its just a matter of demonstrating the value of the concept . I 'd personally love to see video of each performer . As far as what an entire orchestra can do to make their performance photographs stand out , I love the visual idea of acrylic music stands and chairs . Lines of sight are a huge problem for photographers and videographers having fewer things to compete with the performers expressions is key . <p> What can soloists do to make their photographs press shots and live shots stand out ? <p> For press shots , I 'd say anything that defies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails , leave the viola at home , take cues from fashion photography , heavy metal , whatever the goal should be to create a compelling image that tells some sort of story . You do n't  need to have the instrument in the photo or be wearing a cummerbund to convey that you 're an artist leave that to your publicist/manager . <p> We have a bit of an " epidemic " ( footnote , MusicalAmerica.com ) in classical music : critics are being let go left and right . Do you think more photo-based and less content-base sites are the way of The Future ? <p> That critics are being canned is a shame and a waste of talent . I tend to think that people still care about criticism but are also looking for the photos , news bits and dynamic media that allow them to create their own opinions . I would also argue that critics need to publish for the web . To have a page consisting entirely of long paragraphs of text with no photos or other media these days is inexcusable . Its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . <p> Is your website actually a blog platform ? I notice folks can comment on the photos you post ; why do you have that option ? <p> Yes . My website is built on a WordPress blog . Ive been too busy shooting recently to update it as often as I 'd like but I prefer it to having a HTML or Flash site for the advertising value and ease of modification . A lot of photographers have portfolio sites that are great for showcasing work convey nothing about their personality or how they work . Having a blog as my homepage allows potential clients ( as well as fans and other photographers ) to get to know me beyond the images . Allowing these people to comment gives me valuable feedback , helps me interact with my visitors and creates a miniature community for people who subscribe to my updates via RSS . Anything that breaks down the social barrier of having to email a complete stranger is a good thing . <p> Do you have any advice for a venue/orchestra/musician for finding the right photographer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling me ! Seriously , finding the right photographer is a lot like finding a good hair stylist . You need to love their portfolio , they need to have the right equipment for your type of hair , you should dig their personality , and a few good referrals never hurt . Likewise , hiring the cheapest one is almost always a bad idea . <p> That is a lot of music you get out to see !

@@99220446 @3420446/ <h> Traits of Successful Orchestra Managers <p> I am often asked what I believe are the most important traits or qualities for a successful orchestra executive director . Sometimes I 'm asked that question by board members who are conducting a search for one , sometimes by young administrators hoping for a successful career , and sometimes by interesting outsiders . In the 45 years that I have been involved with symphony orchestras , I have certainly seen many administrators come and go , some successful , some not so much . Here are some of the qualities that I believe are essential ingredients in the successful executive director . <p> Empathy : This to me is the most important one . An orchestra manager deals with a huge range of stakeholders and constituencies--far more than the corporate CEO . ( That has been confirmed to me by major corporate CEOs who served as board members or chairs at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . ) Empathy is not to be confused with sympathy . Empathy means that you really hear and understand other people , even those with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reasons behind someone 's position can help lead you to a solution that may meet their needs even if it is n't the solution they proposed . When board members of the Chicago Symphony were resisting the major renovation that I knew Orchestra Hall needed , I did n't just try to persuade them by repeating myself louder . I asked myself why they did n't understand the need--and I realized that they truly did n't realize how much music had changed since the hall was built . When I switched from saying " but you know , this hall was built in 1904 and has been basically unchanged since , " to " you know , this hall was opened seven years after the death of Brahms , " jaws dropped . It changed their entire perspective on the need . And the thought came from my realization of just what perspective they were or were not bringing to the issue . <p> Passion for music and those who make it : You do n't need to be a musicologist ; you do n't even need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess the next trait ( see below ) . But you must believe in the power of our music to transform those who experience it , and you must believe in the importance of music in our communities ' lives . Managing an orchestra is hard , and without that belief you are more likely to veer from the mission . It is easy to get caught up in your day-to-day budget or operational or fund-raising issues . But you must remember what the budget , the fund raising , or the operation supports--the music . When I do seminars for young managers , I usually begin by reminding them of this one central fact of the career they have chosen : No one will ever buy a ticket to see you manage . Dealing with orchestra committees and unions can be frustrating , as can dealing with some conductors or soloists or composers . ( And I suspect they would all say the same thing about managers . ) But you must remember that it is about them , not about you . Never get like the classic librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books because it wears out the pages ! <p> Knowing what you do n't know : This to me is one of the most important characteristics in any profession or endeavor . No one knows everything about everything ( even if we 've all met people who seem to think they do ) . Know what it is that you do n't know , and find expertise around you--whether among your staff , your board , your community , your volunteers , or your musicians . <p> A thick skin : Working in an art form with emotional artists , and working with such a huge range of stakeholders , it is inevitable that at times you are going to be criticized , in less than flattering terms , and perhaps even unfairly . In fact , that is quite likely . Or perhaps other people will take credit for something that you actually did . None of it matters . You keep your eye on the ball--that is , on the mission and vision of the organization--and you do n't let yourself get shaken by the criticism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criticism . Depending on the circumstances , you can respond , and even directly . I once stopped a New York Philharmonic musician in his tracks as he was screaming at me--I had , indeed , made a mistake in judgment--by shouting his name at him when he took a breath , and then by calmly asking him if in all his years at the Philharmonic he had even once played a wrong note . He admitted that he certainly had . I asked him if he would appreciate my yelling at him the same way the next time he played a wrong note . " That 's a really good line , Henry , " he said . The battle was over . And that leads to the next trait . <p> A sense of humor : I happen to think that you need one to successfully navigate life , not just orchestra management . <p> A business head--but not too much : I am always amused by board members who say that they 're looking for an executive director from the corporate world because they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few businessmen should be particularly proud of the business and corporate world these days ) . Of course we need a certain amount of business sense in our orchestra administrators . But orchestras are not businesses , any more than banks are orchestras . ( I 'll bet that no banker would think I could come in from my background and run a bank . ) In his tract From Good to Great and the Social Sectors , Jim Collins is very clear about the differences between the corporate world and ours , and about the need to have orchestra administrations headed by people who understand the difference . <p> The ability to think quickly and to multi-task : Sometimes in our world of performances , things happen quickly and need a quick , intelligent response . And often you find yourself dealing with many things at once . You need the ability to see ahead , to see the impact of a decision , and sometimes you do n't have a lot of time to make that decision . <p> I would n't claim that this is a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses these qualities will be very likely to succeed . <h> Categories : <h> 5 Comments <p> What is facing the modern orchestra manager is the way people in the community get their music and what they are listening to . iPods , popular music trends and what they expose their children 's ears to all go into the mix . I always believed that working with the schools is an integral part of fostering the present but assuring the future , since the young listeners are listening in a different way from our times and our parents ' time . Do you believe that the way programs are structured , and how repertoire is offered may alter slightly in time ? I do n't mean ' dumbing down ' , but changing the order and structure in a way , of the orchestra program ? Might there also become interactive school programs ? Can students in public or charter schools work with composers-in-residence at the orchestras to create new short works for the orchestra to perform ? How can we involve the children so they may feel part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of composers past and present ? <p> Thank you for the comments . I have come to believe that orchestras must hire on their staffs some young people who truly understand the internet in ways that us old fogeys do n't ( or at least I do n't ) , in order to properly take advantage of the various possibilities for promotion . I 'm beginning to think that this should be a sub-division of all marketing departments . Henry <p> Why would someone want to manage an orchestra unless they had the passion for music and those who make it ? <p> We have a tendency today , esp . in America , to hire bean-counter types , people with " quantified " experience , eg , a master 's degree in a technical field , feeling we can measure their effectiveness in the job . Someone who just " loves music " or has been involved in the arts all their life has credentials that are too nebulous for a society obsessed with measurable qualifications . ( Not to beat a dead horse , but again , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to pass . ) Thus we get people running movie studios who have MBAs from ivy league schools and successfully ran bottling distribution enterprises or aircraft part manufacturers but know nothing about a movie and privately think Citizen Kane and Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia are " dull . " But they increased sales at their last job by 30% , so there 's no doubt they can go from bottle distribution to picking the movies you 'll most want to see next year . <p> Henry , this is a great post . Love the " wrong note " story . Also agree so much about what you say regarding having a " business head . " Plus , we 're seeing now that " business head " is n't working so well even for the business sector , as I 'd always suspected . ( See a very good book on this subject , " Education 's End , " by Anthony Kronman . If you have n't read it you should . ) Also , you 've no doubt heard the famous story about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Symphony to his efficient expert , and the report he got back the next morning that completely missed the point . A classic so many managers should take to heart . <p> Since I 'm actively looking for a job these days , I 've been reading many job announcements . I am amazed at how many say " Knowledge of classical music would be helpful " or " Knowledge of music is preferred . " <p> Why would someone want to manage an orchestra unless they had the passion for music and those who make it ? 
@@99220448 @3420448/ <h> The myth of classical music superiority <p> Aka a new book riff , or half of one the first half of the chapter in the book that fights the idea that classical music is better than other kinds of music . And especially that its better than pop . <p> ( I can imagine the outrage ! Maybe well have another visit from AC Douglas , showing us why he needs to do some work on anger management . ) <p> Not that everyone is n't free to think , on a personal basis , that classical music is the best music , which in the end means the best music for them . But to argue that its the best music that exists , as if such a thing could be proved that 's where the trouble lies . <p> And its not just that attempts to make this argument are in inherently highly suspect , for all kinds of reasons ( as I explain in the riff if you make the right assumptions , you can prove that any kind of music is superior ) . Its also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little about other kinds of music that their attempts fall dead , with quite a loud splat . Which then raises all kinds of fascinating questions . Here we have intelligent and cultured people neglecting to inform themselves about subjects they in some cases write entire books about . What kind of deep distress leads them to do such a thing ? <p> But that will be in my next riff . One question for now would be why this debate is important . Why does it matter , if some people think classical music is the best music there is and , along with that , make a great point of how bad pop music is ? <p> Especially since , out in the world at large , not many people believe in this myth . Almost everyone is an omnivore ( to use the favored sociological term ) which means that we like culture of all kinds , high and low . ( These terms are obsolete , I think , and I 'm using them only for convenience . ) <p> But inside the classical music world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , right in this blog , in the comments many people who think , often angrily , that classical music really is superior . Which often then leads them to angry denunciations , not just of pop music , but of all popular culture . <p> Which then puts classical music in a very bad position . Are we now to go out in the world , and find a new audience by telling people that the music they currently listen to is crap ? That 's plainly not going to work . Are we going to tell people that their lives are incomplete , their emotional development is stunted , their thinking is shallow , all because they listen to pop music instead of classical ? <p> That wo n't work , either . And the worst thing is that none of this is true . Pop music is entirely respectable , musically , artistically , and culturally , and the people on the classical music side who denounce it typically do n't  know the first thing about it . <p> Which then puts classical music in a dramatically ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this way , it undermines all arguments not just for its superiority , but for its value on any terms . Because it now seems apparent that too much indulgence in classical music undermines at least for some people a wide and tolerant view of the larger world . And also undermines any substantial knowledge about it . <p> There are two books published in recent years , about the value of the classical music Lawrence Kramers Why Classical Music Still Matters and Julian Johnsons Who Needs Classical Music ? As you 'll see when you get the second part of this riff , both these books suffer from the problems I 've just outlined . As does a classic of the genre , Roger Scrutons The Aesthetics of Music . Which shows , I think , how deep-seated many of these problems are , and why I need to spend some time refuting the myth . <p> ( I know that this is a complex discussion , and that many other writers besides the three Ive just mentioned have entered into it . I 've picked these three as representative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've written the only substantial current books that defend the value of classical music , and for that reason loom reasonably large in current debates . In any case , in the end what interests me more than the debate itself is the stance of the people who want to believe classical music is superior what seems to motivate them , since , as you 'll see from my next riff , many of them are n't  just intent on proving their point , but are also quite angry about it . ) <p> One other quick note : <p> I 've realized that , if I want to write this current chapter properly , it would help if I 'd already written the chapter on pop music , which was supposed to come later . So I 'll revise the outline of the book , to put the pop music chapter directly after chapter three , which shows how classical music has grown distant from our larger culture . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> I think the issue , the anger if you will , is the fact that if we accept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are perforce giving up classical . We are letting the media conglomerates know that , all things being equal , the only music they need to sell to us is the pop music that sells 1000 times more than the classical we crave , because , well , they 're " equal " are n't  they ? <p> All too often those of us who have found something that really screams quality to us , some art ( even within the popular culture ) that has utterly gripped us , only to find the media empires take it away from us because " it did n't  sell " . No second season , no sequel , no second album because the group disbanded after the label terminated their contract . We strive so hard to find stuff that grips us , that we feel is " better " then the seemingly mindless stuff out there mass-marketed for our consumption , product that solely treats us as consumers and not conossours . <p> To have to accept that this same product through which we so easily see the redundancy , the duplicitousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needs more electronics than IBM has to sound anywhere close to in tune , the insane obsession with sex overwhelming the entire package , and all of the other aspects of culture that just make it seem so vulgar ( to use the Latin root of " common " ) is a very bitter pill to swallow . <p> You can look at many things in life as a glass half full , or a glass half empty . The classical world is full of defeats of quality work , things withdrawn or canceled because they did n't  sell . And in popular culture , things of top quality continued year after year after year , album after album after album . <p> And when you talk about the power of big conglomerates an easy , somewhat cheap shot are n't  you neglecting the rise and force of the entire indie world ? In film and music , for instance . <p> A fact to ponder . Here in the US , public TV is supposed to be the height of quality , free from commercial pressure . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious about what it presents . <p> HBO , on the other hand despite being part of a huge international conglomerate consistently creates and presents edgy dramatic shows , which put public TV to shame . <p> But the most important point would be this . Even if we decide pop and classical music are , at bottom , of equal quality , we still have to make quality distinctions within each genre . We want good pop , we want good classical . And it strikes me that defining classical music as such as inherently better than pop has a disadvantage I had n't  thought of before . ( Thanks for inciting me to think of it ! ) It can make us lazy about classical music , more inclined to accept routine classical performances because , after all , every one of them is better than pop . <p> This is n't an argument , and its certainly not a " riff . " You say things like " That wo n't work , either . And the worst thing is that none of this is true . Pop music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the people on the classical music side who denounce it typically do n't  know the first thing about it . " <p> This is so knee-jerk silly it barely qualifies as nonsense , a noble word : in the first place , you 're hardly in a position to call other folks mere opinion as not true and secondly , I know so many folks who played in bands whove moved on to classical , that your pretending that you do n't  is an insult to readers intelligence . ( Typically is the usual copout word for people who are constructing half-truths . ) <p> Your arguments not only do n't  hold any water ; they 're also just not very bright . <p> " Outrage " ? You flatter yourself . <p> Why are you so angry ? <p> " Typically " is a useful word , often found in dictionary definitions . Its a way of acknowledging that something is n't true in every instance , even when one is sure its true far more often than not . <p> So do people in classical music who denounce pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , about pop ? In my experience , yes . And in the written record , also yes . Ive been debating these issues for , I do n't  know , more than 20 years , and over and over and over , either in private conversations or in public forums , people in the classical music world denounce pop music to me , and in the course of their denunciations say things that are so wildly incorrect its clear they do n't  know the subject . Or I might ask them to give me examples from the work of people in pop who are taken seriously by critics , and they cant do it . Often they cant even name any pop musician apart from whoevers in the headlines that year . <p> The written record is equally clear . Though I 'd love you to correct me here , because it would help me a lot . If you can find writing by someone in classical music who denounces pop and really knows a lot about pop , I 'd be thrilled to see it . Either post the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When you talk about people who were in bands who moved to classical music , are you talking about people who were in bands in high school , in music school , or professionally ? I cant think , offhand , of any classical music who abandoned a serious pop career to do classical music , though of course we all know famous examples of top pop musicians who love classical music , and have written classical pieces ( Rufus Wainwright , Elvis Costello , Paul McCartney , Jonny Greenwood , Glenn Kotche , Billy Joel , and more . ) <p> I also know two prominent cases of top classical orchestral players a percussionist with the Chicago Symphony and Mark Gould , principal ltrumpet at the Met opera who quit classical music to play pop . But I would n't use them as proof of anything , because they seem like isolated examples . I do n't  see any large-scale exodus from classical music into pop . <p> But , first , this subject is the thesis of a thread at **25;1119;TOOLONG . <p> So , I just bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had a sort of pen pal relationship which started after I responded to a piece he wrote for the KUSC monthly newsletter . I was a member after WNYC tossed out music . He put me on his email list and we had some correspondence . I was to meet him on my next trip to visit my daughter and her family in L.A. The last exchnage we had was me making him two DVDs of the Great Performances piece on Dudamels premier in L.A. Alas , he died before we could meet . But I always enjoyed reading him and the fact that he would bother with a peon like me . So , I bought the book . <p> On page xxix of the hard cover , he gives a link to a Frebruary 2004 Alex Ross piece , " Listen to This " at LONG ... Alex starts , " I hate classical music:not the thing but the name . " <p> And , what to we find there in II paragraph 1 ? <p> None other than a link to this blog , artsjournal.com/sandow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that we partisans of the classical need to speak more from the heart about what the music means . He admits that it is easier to analyze his ardor than to express it . " So , Ross . <p> So , I thought that was a cool set of twists , Rich , Ross , and back to Sandow . <p> Aside from the groups penchant for incorporating folk/indigenous music into their programming , Joseph Horowitz told me that he coined the term " post-classical " for the Post-Classical Ensemble because of the elitist connotations that " classical " has carried for so long . Their September program is " Russian Gershwin . " You do n't  get much more of a pop/classical crossover than with Gershwin ! <p> Joe Horowitz , for all his many virtues , does n't  pay much attention to current pop . And in 2010 , Gershwin is n't a useful example of classical/pop crossover or fusion . You 're talking about something that happened 70 and 80 years ago ! <p> The current examples of fusion would be classical composers who are strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds and rhythms into their music . For instance Mason Bates , composer in residence next season with the Chicago Symphony . <p> I 'm not convinced that you 've done justice to the arguments of classical music traditionalists . Surely your book ought to address the best and most sophisticated possible arguments ? I have n't read the books by Johnson or Kramer , but I read Finebergs Classical Music Why Bother ? and was less than impressed by the quality of argumentation . <p> ( Roger Scruton , by the way , is less anti-pop than you make him out to be in his aesthetics book , he is extremely negative about mainstream British pop groups of that era , such as Oasis and U2 , but his other writing , including his recent book Understanding Music , reveals him to be an intelligent commenter on other forms of pop music . ) <p> The argument for the special status of Western classical music would refer to the things that make it special ( a literate tradition of transmission , the privileging of large-scale forms and long-range development ) , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic transmission , generally small-scale forms ) or world folk musics ( oral transmission , usually either small-scale forms or longer static/sectional forms ) . Such music clearly must be judged by different standards than that of pop music ; itll appeal to different part of the brain , and will be used in different settings in differing times and places . <p> The argument would continue by pointing out that Western " classical " music is not only a unique tradition , but its also the historical tradition of our culture meaning , the culture of North America and Western Europe , that also gave us our tradition of painting , creative writing , jurisprudence , and representative democracy . Because todays modern classical music is contiguous with that tradition , it connects us with that past a connection which is desirable because it makes us aware of the ultimate foundations of our political and social order . Pop music , by contrast , has entirely different aesthetic aims . You might say that pop music is to classical music as hypertext fiction is to the traditional novel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is clearly distinct , employing different aesthetic aims and different media . Pop and classical music are clearly complementary forms , serving different purposes , but its equally clear that the older form has a greater historical cachet and deserves a privileged status . <p> If put this way , the argument for Western " classical music " does not need to argue that its simply better than other styles , which is clearly meaningless . Rather , its a frank admission that there are different kinds of music with different cultural roles , requiring different kinds of support . <p> This is an argument I find convincing , and to my mind this is the line of argument to which you 'll have to respond if your book is going to be fully comprehensive . <p> Your last point is one of the main theses of my book . But then what wed debate is what the cultural role of various musics might be , and what kind of support they might deserve . <p> In my last riff , you might have read that classical musics historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the other half being its developmental nature ) . But this , I hope you 'll agree , is a double-edged sword . It can be argued as Susan McClary does , for instance that classical music of the past carries within it attitudes towards women ( for instance ) that we 've gotten past in the contemporary world . And also that classical music in the past was the music of colonialism , and of philosophy in which the mind had too much dominance over the body . <p> All these balances have been redressed in recent decades , but classical music has n't  played much part in that . You can talk all you want about classical music conveying the fine ideas that underly our civilization , but still its true that major league baseball had black players years before the Metropolitan Opera had black soloists . <p> all the great musicians ive ever met or known about the truly great ones , classical or otherwise have always been lovers of great music before limiting themselves to any one category . in that sense , the claim that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on real stages you always find a mix of influences , either directly or indirectly . Be it Yoyo Ma collaborating with Bobby Macferrin ; Renee Fleming singing rock ballads ; Keith Jarrett playing Bach ; Sting recording John Dowland ; Or Bartok integrating folk and " street " music into classical compositions . <p> But i 'm not talking only about cross overs . There 's something deeper than that : its the endless curiosity and enthusiasm about rhythm and pitch , that seems to be common to all musicians i consider great . and these rhythms and pitches can come in all styles and forms . cross overs are just an example of such curiosity . let critics and academics decide how they want to call it . in the end , who cares what it is called : great music is great music . <p> Well , of course classical music is superior ! I can listen to new age music and enjoy it , but classical music is on a completely different level ! Certainly a little pop song by whatever group is current is not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youve written some interesting things , much of which I agree with . I 'm a classical musician . I stopped getting irked by arguments such as yours , until I read the extract of your book . <p> The trap you fall into is that you assume classical musicians are unable to play with real freedom , to play with sponataneity , with awareness . You imply , assume , that it is n't an option for them . Moreover , that in playing from parts , especially in music they 've played often , things are pre-ordained . And with a conductor apparently dictating everything , its even worse . <p> This couldnt be further from the truth . You misunderstand , deeply , the way that classically-trained musicians think , feel , and perform . <p> Not one single bar I ever play feels preordained , predestined . Not within myself , nor with the musicians I 'm priviledged to play with . THIS is the myth of those who choose to misunderstand classical performers . Every event can , and often does , go in one of many possible directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness around him or her as , say , a jazz player because anything can happen , and sometimes does ( but they do n't  have the luxury of sponaneity , in the eyes of the public , to hide behind if it does n't  work out ) . <p> And there 's pop which is fine . But only that . I love a lot of it , in the broadest sense . But with pop , we 've lived , for some time now , in the world where everything is so over-produced and acoustic-free and has been for some time . Its devoid of any kind of originality of sound , of connection with the performer , on the whole , and of any consistency on the live , public stage . <p> If classical orchestras , opera houses , ensembles and soloists of the world performed with such an alarming lack of awareness , or accomplishment , as do many pop artists , then they would vanish . Please note : I 'm not referring to the session-booked players , but to the names themselves . <p> Before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered look at the average " classical " musician and not admonish them for their lack of awareness , freedom , and flexibilty . Most I know can play , anything , in any way , as they 're asked the same ca n't be said for all musicians . <p> Your book is about the moral superiority of " classical " music . If you 're so quick to denounce the potency of the average , classically-trained musician , then think again . They are the bedrock of so much more than you think . Please do n't  ever disrespect the way musicians work of whatever genre , or training . <p> Carlos , if I 'd actually said what you accuse me of saying , you 'd have every right to be angry . I 've worked in classical music ( if you count my student days ) for 50 years . I 've performed as a singer , and composed , and had my works performed , and been close friends with classical musicians of all kinds , and worked with them professionally in numerous contexts . Not to mention teaching , and working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course there 's freedom in playing classical music . <p> Heres what I actually wrote : <p> A veteran orchestra player once told me how delighted he 'd get , when one of his colleagues " playing a piece that they 'd all played together many times " would do something new , inflect a phrase just a little differently , emphasize a note that had n't been emphasized , surge over a gorgeous melodic arch with just a little more passion than ever before . When this happens in chamber music , where just a few musicians are playing , inspirations like these change a performance , as the other musicians immediately respond . Which means they do what Max Roach described . <p> ( The same thing might also happen in an orchestral performance , but because so many musicians play the same music together " and because they have a conductor , who controls much that goes on " there 's less room for it . ) <p> Seems to me Im saying much the same thing as you are , though without as much emphasis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because yes , I do say that the presence of a conductor can set a limit on how much spontaneity orchestral musicians can have . Of course , that varies with the conductor . Some encourage spontaneity , implicitly or explicitly , some do n't  . <p> And for so many years , I 've heard so many orchestra musicians ( including many from top orchestras ) complain about conductors . So I 'm a little surprised at your vehemence . <p> Once , at a private conference involving a dozen or so orchestras , I led a discussion ( along with Bruce Coppock , former executive director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra ) on why musicians do n't  look happier onstage when they play . Participating in this were musicians from a variety of big and middle-sized orchestras . What was the first thing the musicians said in their defense ? That they could n't be expected to look happy when they played , because the conductors were so terrible . <p> And please do n't  take this to mean that I think all conductors are horrible , and that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent argument to a point that I do n't  think is actually the underlying issue in the superiority debate . That is , I think perhaps you 're not analyzing what people are really saying when they invoke classical musics superiority . Perhaps this is what 's coming in the next riff ? <p> In any case : my feeling on this is that what kind of music you like functions ( at least in the minds of those who vilify pop/extol classical ) to some degree as a class marker . There are many markers by which someone telegraphs class good manners , well-connected friends , dresses well , well groomed , etc. means one thing . Being a slobby pothead telegraphs something else . ( And even if someone does n't  actually belong to the economic class s/he is communicating , one can use those markers to become accepted within it . ) <p> This of course extends into matters of taste . We do n't  expect to walk into the home of , let 's say , Bruce Kovner ( chair of Juilliard ) who is a superwealthy hedge fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a giant Thomas Kinkade painting hanging on the wall . <p> So why is that ? Well , someone who has become knowledgeable about art , who has cultivated particular tastes , studied a bit , can objectively compare an individual work by Kinkade with an individual work by Monet and find the former wanting . That person has likely never encountered a teacher , tastemaker , or peer who professes to like Kinkades work . But a person who has not become knowledgeable in that way , who has not cultivated a learned taste in art , may see a Kinkade picture in the gallery in the mall and find it speaks to them and they take it home and put it on the wall . And as far as Im concerned , that 's a good thing what 's important about art/music is that people enjoy it and derive spiritual value from what it says to them , NOT how other people may judge it . <p> The challenge with this analogy comes because there I 'm comparing a specific work to a specific work ( Kinkade/Monet ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixth next to Justin Biebers " Baby " and I 'm comfortable saying , objectively , the formers " better " by most ( but not all ) assumptions you want to put on for comparison . ( But that does n't  mean that people who like Justin Bieber are bad people . ) But when you pull out the focus from specific works to the genres of " classical " versus " pop , " you 've pulled out so far as you cant make distinctions that mean anything . <p> There 's a simply enormous amount of mediocre to bad classical music out there , most of which rarely saw the light of day beyond a few years after its composition . ( I mean , we do n't  see much Christian Cannabich or Franz Abt on programs these days . ) What we think of as " classical music " by non-living composers amounts to , realistically , what : maybe 10,000 pieces ? I 'd hazard there 's more than 10,000 pop songs of qualityand hundreds of thousands that are n't  . <p> The problem , though , comes from saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad because what you 're really saying is " people who listen to classical are like me and have good taste like I do " and " people who listen to pop are uneducated about music and ignorant and have poor taste . " This is not a winning argument . Its less about the music itself as who listens to it , and what group one wants to be in . Just read any of Jay Nordlingers weird stuff about classical music online at National Review and you 'll get the essence of this . <p> That 's how your point above about Indian classical music gets explained : it falls outside this thinking , because it does n't  telegraph class . It just telegraphs ethnicity . " People who like Indian music " are , in the mind of someone who thinks Western classical is the best music , generally Indian not " musically uneducated " or " people with no taste . " And because its so different from Western music farther afield from Mozart in sound/harmony/structure than is Justin Bieber it does n't  flag as something to compare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat to those who feel classical is superior you 're right , its apples and oranges . <p> But pop does pose a threat . Pop seems to also be an apple because its working off the same scales and harmonies . That threat is that " people with bad taste " are overwhelming " people with good taste , " regardless of whether the specific music were talking about in either genre is good or bad . <p> Sorry to be longwinded making the point . But I think people get vehement and angry because they see the distinction and understanding of classicals " higher quality " as a means of grouping the good people with them and the bad people in the other camp . When you argue classicals not " superior " it means their taste is on equal footing with the taste of those horrible uneducated people who like hip-hop or Britney Spears or whatever . And they know in their hearts that ca n't be true . <p> The irony is , of course , its not true its the wrong argument for them to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anyway , its very late and I 'm probably not terribly coherent with thishope it makes some sense , anyway <p> Makes perfect sense , David . And I 'm going to some of those places ( certainly the class marker ) in the next riff . <p> This was very stimulating to read ( both the post and the " riff " on pdf ) . I had n't  encountered classical musicians for some years who claimed superiority of classical music over pop but this year has brought a number of people into my path with extremely strong views on this . In all cases , I scratched the surface and found profound ignorance of popular music , and an assumption that harmony was everything ( eg. claiming that everything in popular music was done in classical music in the early 19th century as Eno said to a similar claim , how does that account for Elvis ? ) . <p> Great to read well-considered arguments that come from the perspective of loving classical music . <p> I like Lady Gaga too . But if I were stranded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathleen Ferrier . And let 's face it , so would you . Why ? <p> So glad you know what I 'd take to a desert island . <p> And I fear you 've stepped into a trap , one I frequently see people step in when they make this argument . You offer two choices the latest mass-market pop craze , vs. two very great classical figures . ( Though Schwarzkopf never did much for me ; that 's another discussion . ) If you put someone I like in pop , Lucinda Williams , maybe , against Ferrier , I 'd take Lucinda Williams . <p> Not that the desert island test proves anything . The best exploration of it is a classic book of rock criticism , " Stranded , " edited by Greil Marcus , in which rock critics pick the albums theyd take to a desert island . Good reading for anyone who thinks pop music is trivial . <p> The superiority of one genre X over another Y is , as I see it , determined by one X being able to incorporate Y , while Y is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of jazz incorporated into one kind of Euro-classical music ; and ELPs Pictures at an Exhibition shows Progressive Rock incorporating Mussorskis work . One might argue that each incorporation leaves out the essence of the other genre , such as " order and simplicity " versus " rebellion and emotional devastation . " <p> But I would say that if aspiring jazz musicians study Euro-classic music but classical musicians do n't  study Miles or Coltrane , then classical music wins that bout . <p> First we have to define what we mean by music . One definition is , music is whatever someone thinks is music . On that basis , for a majority of people , no doubt , pop/rock music is the best music . <p> For me , pop/rock is not music , rather , it is noise , a hideously rebarbative noise . As art is supposed to operate on our emotions , I presume that the emotional reactions elicited in me by pop/rock are not to my liking , to put it mildly . <p> It is of interest that classical music was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of past cenrturies , whereas pop/rock was &amp; is composed for the masses . Read into that you what you will . <p> So you , my friend , are the measure of all things ? Your reactions are the standard by which all things should be judged ? <p> I think , before you comment further on this subject , that you should learn something about pop . The idea that all of it is now created for the masses is wildly incorrect . Would you stand for someone making equally ignorant statements about classical music ? <p> In my riff , I noted that many people who take the view that classical music i superior do n't  actually know much about the musical genres its supposed to be superior to . Here we have a perfect example of what I meant . <p> The problem with improvisation is not that great moments of music are not made , but that they are rarely made . Much of the noodling around is the prelude to ( one hopes ) finding that one transcendent moment . This is worth having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detracts from its value as finished art . For those who esteem process above product , I say , Go play and do n't  make me listen . That being said , the transcendent bits can be so splendid as to obviate any criticism of the form . <p> Classical musics " superiority " has much to do with its complexity : counterpoint , unexpected but worked-through harmonies , melodic lines that are fresh and long . As to spontaneity , any very good performance has some ; that 's why I may own more than one recording of a great piece of music and still attend a live performance of it besides . But many performances are not so good , and yes , Beethoven is a better composer than Glazunov . I prefer listening to a first-rate pop or jazz performance , or piece , to a second-rate classical one . The question of who is first-rate and who is not is part of what makes any discussion of any art exciting and probably endless . The idea that classical music is superior to other forms is probably defensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance from conception that you can start having a serious discussion , and by doing that you are pretending that music is something on a page and not in the ear . <p> Pop is a ringer here . While there are some terrific musicians in the pop field , virtuosi of their instruments ( including voice , in a few cases ) , the crucial difference is that a song is not music : it is music and lyrics combined into a single art form , which is a different art form . I have written a bit on this myself , trying to codify and perhaps create an essential vocabulary for some of the issues involved in how music and lyrics fit together into a unified form , but the specifics are very complicated indeed . Musically alone , most pop lacks depth and complexity ; as a wholly distinct art , that is of no importance , but strictly as music it will be hard to defend its standing . <p> By all means carry on , but please remember the above as you continue . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have written pop songs and chamber music , performed in coffee houses , cocktail lounges , and orchestras ) , I have nothing but respect and admiration for those who succeed in making musical art in any of them , as clearly you do , too , and there we are surely in agreement . I look forward to further thoughts on the matter . <p> Seems to me you 're harsh about improvisation , as if ( for instance ) Charlie Parker had never lived . Even if most improvisations worked the way you describe and jazz improvisations from Parkers era , by their nature , cant work that way we should judge them by their best examples , should n't we ? That 's the premise you 're working from in other areas , if I understand you . <p> In pop music , the musical text is the performance , not the notation . And so pop performances are going to emphasize things that in classical music are considered secondary sound , groove , emotional nuance ( in performance , I mean ) . To look for counterpoint in rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What you do get , in rock , is fabulous heterophany , with many things layered on each other . The rhythmic interplay can be a lot more complex , in its way , than counterpoint which , for what its worth , is one of the few things about composition that can be taught ( even , in my experience , to people who are virtually tone-deaf I actually did that in a solfege class I taught , decades ago ) . <p> But these are big topics , as you say . Subject to very long discussion . <p> " Why not have both ? types of music " was the way John Cage simply answered the question at Wesleyan in 1968 when wrangling factions of music academics were arguing over the future of curriculum at the university and turned to the Great Man for his take . <p> More recently , in Venezuela , Jose Antonio Abreu answered this question of genre hierarchy by pointing out that with Western classical music there is a canon by which to measure performance quality . If ones goal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lidless , why not get them started in orchestras that can be evaluated against the success of other youth orchestras internationally ? Anti-popular music ? No way just ask Gustavo Dudamel whose dad was a salsa brass player . In his hometown , I witnessed first chair players in the orchestra sliding over onto lead string instruments in extraordinary jaropo combos when they werent playing Beethoven . El Sistemas got it right regarding class , music and sonic sociology . <p> In follow up to your response to the last comment , Greg : you mention that in pop the musical text is the performance , not the notation . I think its worth pointing out that this perspective is taking greater hold among academic composers and younger theorists ( and even some older ones , i.e. Richard Taruskin ) . I think that emphasizing the performance as text as opposed to the notational artifact breaks down many theoretical barriers that have plagued " classical " music and the thinking of " classical " musicians in the 20th-century . I also think that the increased popularity of this idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations respect and understanding of pop music ( as well as many other kinds of music ) . As in science , progress ( ? ) in the arts is made by replacing one paradigm with one that more clearly answers more questions . <p> Moving on , it occurs to me that perhaps what we are facing in this informal discussion ( and often in the larger cultural discourse concerning classical music ) , is the inability for many to embrace a critical theory that adopts tenets ( ? ) of post-modernism in the face of the more popular tendency to search for objective meaning , and in this case , " superiority " . Despite the history of this blog and all of your intelligent ( and public ! ) writing on the subject of popular music and classical music , many comments are still filled with defensive claims that either explicitly or implicitly suggest that classical music is superior and that other genres are inferior . <p> I have much more to write on this subject , but need to return later when I have more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing you 've read the aggressive ( if hilarious ) review of them by Richard Taruskin ( originally in The New Republic and now anthologized in The Dangers of Music . ) Your argument that false dichotomies are easy to construct and very satisfying to readers who are already convinced is also an important part of Taruskins piece . ( And that 's not a criticism of your writing , obviously . ) <p> But the arguments of Julian Johnson et . al . are all so unnecessary , as Lisbeth Salander pointed out above . Johann Strauss II is conventionally thought of as a classical music composer , but really he was a writer of popular waltzes usable dance music played by a salon orchestra for use at balls and social occasions . Brahms was his good friend , but as far as I know , Johannes B. never said to Johann S. " Why do n't  you take that enormous talent for melody and orchestration and write us a great symphony ? " Instead he wrote the Liebeslieder Waltzes . Brahms appreciated the dance tunes . <p> Several of Papagenos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the popular theater , as are a lot of the French opera comique tunes of the 18th and early 19th centuries . As are several of the tunes in Webers Der Freischutz . As are . <p> So without arguing that popular music is always ennobled when it is imported into classical genres ( and why would a good composer start a classical piece with inferior materials ? ) , the proponents of the superiority of classical music are left arguing for a dubious , mythical purity in art music that never existed ( except , perhaps , relatively recently within academia ) . <p> Classical musicians , like other musicians can be omnivorous . Not every composer wants to use all these inputs in his/her own music , and not every performer wants to play every kind of music . But cross-pollination happens so often as to be a hugely important thread in musical history . And it would be nearly unremarkable if we had n't  committed ourselves to hard and fast distinctions between " high " and " low " , " classical " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't doing " crossover , " he was doin what comes naturally . <p> Thanks for your response , Greg . I 'm glad we agree at least on the big philosophical question ie : that classical and pop music are different in ways that matter , and that the goal is to find ways to appreciate and reconcile their different functions and excellences . <p> You mention changing attitudes to things like colonialism and feminism as problematizing the historical status of classical music . Firstly , nothing I wrote implies that we must endorse all the attitudes of Euro-American cultural history only that were stuck with their results , that its implications continue to work themselves out even now , and that we will have a better chance of solving todays problems if we understand ourselves as part of a broader tradition . <p> Secondly , though , issues of colonialism et al . are hardly unique to music the same issues come up in literature and the visual arts , and practically every other area of human life . In other words , the problem is n't unique to classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more than five years ago , and can therefore be ruled out as a cause of classical musics unique problems . ( Indeed , there would probably be more interest in classical music , not less , if people thought that it related to political and social conflicts my impression is that many people avoid classical music because they think it is too abstract and complex for them to understand . ) <p> I suspect that we disagree on some other points as well , but I 'm very interested to see how your book project plays out . I have a related post here , if you 're interested . <p> Not to disappoint , re , your , " I can imagine the outrage ! Maybe well have another visit from AC Douglas , showing us why he needs to do some work on anger management " <p> The way you 've set up your , um , thesis is fundamentally meaningless , and rife with straw men arguments . In comparing pop music ( by which term I include such populist musical genres as pop , rock , punk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical music , its NOT a question of " best " or " better-than " . Its a question , rather , of comparing the artifacts of two essentially incommensurable aesthetic hierarchies which can " no more be compared than one can compare , delectable-wise , the proverbial apples and oranges on the same delectability continuum of **42;1146;TOOLONG , " as I 've elsewhere put it . <p> Also , as I 've elsewhere written ( on S&amp;F ) , there 's another culprit at work here . <p> To quote myself , <p> Postmodern dogma " which is , at once , both a horrific and risible reductio ad absurdum of Sixties cultural thought , and which " seeks a dissolution of all hierarchies , both natural and culturally determined without distinction " as we 've written previously elsewhere " is another culprit here , and its as wrongheaded and boneheaded as it could possibly be . Hierarchies are essential to the well-being of Homo sapiens , and there 's just no getting around that . Its in our DNA as its in the DNA of all living things , also as we 've written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of life is doomed , ultimately , to abject failure , and the attempt itself certain to leave by the wayside scores upon scores of unnecessary and regrettable casualties . <p> <p> We 've no argument with , nor objection to , the artifacts of popular culture per se . What we argue against , and lodge objection to , is the growing absence of a fundamental aesthetic distinction between , and separate hierarchies of aesthetic value for , such artifacts and the artifacts of the realm of high culture ( so-called to distinguish it from the popular sort ) . Contrary to the pernicious equalitarian conceits of postmodern thinking , there is such a distinction ; a self-evident and inarguably real one and no meaningful aesthetic continuum connecting the artifacts of the two realms can be constructed except on the merest technical and taxonomic grounds . <p> This is all covered in some detail in my 2006 S&amp;F post , " A Call For A Return To Hierarchal Sobriety " , which can be read here . <p> Oh , and as to my " anger management " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its gathered against and focused on the great cultural enemy of our era : postmodern equalitarian and relativist thinking . <p> De Gustibus Non Est Disputandum . Ca n't we all just get along ? Let classical be classical and let Pop be Pop , or Rock , Jazz or whatever . <p> There 's no use judging classical music by the standards of Jazz or Pop music etc . <p> Myself , I prefer classical . But I 'm not a snob . <p> If other people are fans of other kinds of music , that 's fine with me . But I just wish that people would n't knock classical music for not being like other kinds of music . <p> Classical music is different from other kinds of music , very different . Its not meant for casual entertainment , excpet for some of the simpler types of of it , such as the divertimentos of Haydn and Mozart etc . <p> It requires active listening and often requires repeated hearings before a listener can grasp it . You do n't  listen to classical music the same way you would listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And often , unless you 're listening to a short piece , you need to have a good attention span , or your mind will wander . <p> Personally , I just get infinitely more out of a Bruckner or Mahler symphony , or a Wagner opera , etc , that I could out of pop music . <p> It has a profundity and emotional power that no other kind of music provides , for me and some others people , at least . <p> But if other people enjoy Madonna , Britney Spears and Michael Jackson , who am I to argue with them ? <p> But at least I 've actually heard Pop music , Rock and Jazz , etc . The problem is that too many people reject classical music before theyve even given it a chance . What a pity . <p> I wonder if it is worth drawing a distinction between classical musicians and classical music critics/enthusiasts . As others have mentioned in this forum , rarely do you find a classically trained musician who does not listen to and/or perform other genres of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seems to me that those of us that are actually working as performers do not have such a harsh criticism of other music types such as pop , rock , motown , hip-hop , etc . It would be interesting to poll those who have slammed pop music to see what role they actually play in the music industry . Likewise , you may want to tread lightly when you insinuate that classical musicians are ignorant to other art forms . I would tend to think that this is not the case . <p> Now , someone will tell me I 'm tilting at windmills , that no one these days would dare argue that western music is best . <p> And maybe that 's true . But people do insist that ( western ) classical music is better than pop . <p> To be fair , Ive come across many people , both in the classical and pop world , and read many pieces comparing/constrasting Western vs non-Western musics , which have said Western music is best whether they 're arguing for Western Classical or Western Rock/Pop ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Western popular music genres than the classical musicians with their classical music ) . <p> And there are always exceptions and the hardliners are almost invariably always going to defend their own turf . <p> I just played an engagement party for Lebanese and Spanish family last weekend and I would n't be surprised if they said Arabic music is better than Western Classical or Western Popand as excited as they were to be able to sing and dance to us I would believe they really felt what they were saying was the absolute truth . <p> What I think is interesting , however , is that there are generational as well as ethnic/ingroup divides . <p> At a Persian Naw Ruz ( Persian New Year ) party I played back in March , I had a conversation with one of the other performing musicians , a fantastic Santoor player and builder , who was bemoaning the fact that there are fewer and fewer people that appreciate " good music " ( we were talking about Classical Persian music ) and that the younger generation just wants to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the younger kids was playing over the sound sytem at the begeinnning of the evening ) and American pop ( making a distinction between two different kinds of popular music ) . It was reminding me of a conversation I had had with his brother and Zarb player ( they perform with each other often ) last year about Googoosh ( the Persian pop diva ) and how he poo-pooed on her relevance as an Icon of Persian music . <p> Point isits going to happen that ingroups will disparage outgroups and privilege members or representatives of their own no matter what the group . Some are vehement about it , some less vocal and more private about it . Any " solution " for it will likely be one that works for mediating relations between any ingroup/outgroupand I 'm a little skeptical about finding those solutions . <p> Other point is , ingroups whose musical culture are Western Classical and Western Pop are n't  often aware of the idea that their argument is already privileging a much larger ingroups musical culture and that other ingroups are having these kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously mentioned comments about Persian Classical/Persian Pop/American Pop issue illustrates . <p> Personally , and this is only tangential to this whole discussion , I do still feel like Western Classical AND Pop are generally treated as " superior " to all the rest and is often the backdrop through which musical debates like these all over the world are being framed . <p> Ok , I 've rambled on again as usual , GregIronically , given what I 've just said , I must go practice some Goth Rock tunes for an upcoming " Dark Arts Festival " I have to play over the 4th of July weekend <p> I 'm curious to know if you are arguing for a totally relativitic idea of aesthetics . You may think classical music as a genre is not superior to pop music as a genre which makes sense given how broad each term has the potential to be but what about within pop ? Your ideas defending popular music seem to suggest that some critics of popular music simply do n't  know enough about certain " good " artists within pop music see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that argument is the idea that some rock musicians are better than their three-chord counterparts . This seems to conflict with some of the more egalitarian ideas also present in your book , which seems to suggest that all music is of equal value . Is that what you really mean to say ? <p> It is really true that no one has used the words " money " or " power " yet ? ! ! <p> Do we need to return to the foundations of " classical music " and its aristocratic legacy and the economic point of view of art ? <p> If we say " classical music is not superior " we can spend all the " classical music " money on something else : philanthropists and governments ( well let individual ticket holders decide for themselves . . . after seeing how much an unsubsidized ticket costs ) . <p> If we say " classical music is not superior , " all the politicians and related power gatekeepers can focus their energy on things that are more important ( following the example of many educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music has largely been attached to specific status groups associated with power and money . Many people arguing that " classical music is superior " have a vested interested in the art form for status , power , or money . <p> Hello again , I recall when you published an email I wrote you a while back when I was in college , and seeing this lively exchange of words and ideas has persuaded me to put my small bit in again . <p> Its amazing how much offense people take when you state that the idea of classical musics inherent superiority is more just a construct than objective truth . And frankly , it may just be a lack of imagination to think of other music as just music than something less than music . <p> I used to hold that view as a child , but that has mellowed out tremendously when I starting hopping frequencies on my radio as a teen , and now , I 'm pretty open to many sounds , though I still have my favorites . <p> Interestingly , my post-college musical journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already beginning to feel burnt out from trawling CDs from the fine arts library . Boredom and Youtube has now led me to my current musical interest : Late Showa Era Japanese Popular Music . <p> Its a strange leap , but for some reason the genre seem to click to me , and I know why . I was basically a melody and tone oriented listener , and what usually is popular now places more emphasis on riffs , beat and rhythm than a tune to sing along to , so my interest in Western Popular music diminished after going through the 1980s . Hearing the Japanese that seem to continue writing songs with flowing tunes and rich arrangements seems like they were lagging behind the West when compared contemporaneously , but I still enjoyed it , even if I cant understand a single word being sung . <p> What is interesting though is that through my exposure and exploring along with the language barrier , I was only listening to the musicality of the songs , how it was sung , how the backing was used ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the music is doing without the singing ) . I was thinking about the music much like I would when I was listening to classical music . <p> Of course , this was still music from agencies with singers only there to look pretty and a modicum of talent , so to speak , but that does n't  really matter . Sometimes it is also worth looking into who wrote the songs and compare in that vein to better understand how their style evolved or what their musical ticks are , which in itself is another fun adventure . That is one thing people from the classical world tend to overlook when thinking about pop , in that there is more than just the performers and who their label is , what about the songwriters , lyricists , and arrangers ( for those performers who strictly are just that ) ? <p> To tie this all up and keep it from rambling , it might do music better to remember that there was n't this dramatic hierarchy in culture like there is today . Back in the day , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what others are available were part of the household music world along with more popular fare . It made little difference , that society sang and played together . <p> So I do n't  see what 's so wrong if more venues started mixing up their lineups to show what is great from other genres . Just make a theme of it , or even be random . Will the concert experience really be adulterated if after an overture some guy with a guitar walks up and sing folk tunes ? <p> Hi , Andrew . Glad to see you back . <p> Your final question is a good test on where people stand , on all these questions . Some people will quickly answer yes ! But if the guy with the guitar was , for instance , Elvis Costello , I 'd think hed elevate the concert . One of my peak musical experiences was hearing him do his entire " Spike " album with just his own acoustic guitar as accompaniment . Shorn of all its elaborate ( and terrific ) production , the album was , if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on . <p> I think the commentary following Greg Sandow 's article thus far ranges from reasonable to the just plain idiotic . For the most part I am uninterested in the particulars of people 's justification that classical is better than Tuvan throat singing is better than Miles is better than Son House is better than St. Vincent . Who cares ? Good music is good music . Ellington said it , Stravinsky said as much and Berg set Gershwin 's mind at ease upon their meeting in Vienna with the same sentiment . <p> I do take exception with Bruce C. Meyer 's pseudo mathematical justification of classical music 's superiority . To make the assertion that classical music wins out ipso facto because jazz musicians study Euro-classic ' musics and classical musicians ignore jazz and all other types of popular music , is well , stupid . Why does the supposed willful ignorance by the practitioners of one genre makes it inherently superior to the next ? This is a confusing line of reasoning and can hardly be taken seriously however , I feel like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly untainted literature he seems so determined to elevate . <p> I think if you look through the contemporary classical literature you will find a good many examples of Jazz , Pop , Classical , Folk , etc. artists studying outside the confines of their own genre . Ravel was fascinated with jazz , Charlie Parker used to blow over his recording of the Rite of Spring , Indie rockers love 60 's minimalism , young classical composers seem to be enthralled with indie rock , jazz artists make third-stream records and Yo Yo Ma and Edger Meyer seem to be making all kinds of music to say nothing of the ECM and Winter and Winter record labels genre bending catalogues . On and on goes the great cross pollination of genres . People who make music are generally more concerned with making music than deciding who has a seat at the top . <p> To think that classical musicians only listen to classical music is laughable as well . I think you will find a very diverse set of tastes if you surveyed the record collections of your average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jazz , folk , and pop artists . As you may notice the reasoning is flawed not to mention it is inaccuracy . <p> Jazz harmony is a direct result of the harmonic innovations of the last century so it stands to reason that jazz is incorporating classical music in a major way . If classical musicians as you say are not ( and this is actually untrue ) studying Miles than who is integrating who and how does that jive with your formula ? <p> @ Carlos , Bruce C. Meyer , D Shapiro- Leave jazz out of the discussion . What 's the point of dragging it in only to say remarkably i 'll informed things about it ? Unless it is to exhibit your ignorance publicly . <p> Carlos- most classical musicians can not play jazz , maybe they might be able to play rock or pop without a piece of paper in front of them , but then again maybe not . Anyone who says something like <p> " A good classical performer needs at LEAST as much awareness around him or her as , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does ( but they do n't  have the luxury of spontaneity , in the eyes of the public , to hide behind if it does n't  work out ) . " <p> has never played jazz on any kind of a level that would be required to know that . No one who can actually play jazz would claim the ability to hide behind spontaneity . Its not enough to have listened to jazz or played in a jam session once on a blues . You may have even done this before and been under the false impression that you were successful in your attempt . You may have fooled 80% of your audience , but you would n't fool someone who really knows . <p> Second of all anything ca n't happen . The bass section ca n't all of a sudden decide to modulate , or substitute different roots , or superimpose a metric modulation on top of the original tempo , or segue into a new tune entirely , or play spans of time free of chord changes but following the form only to rejoin the original changes at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best jazz performances . <p> @ Bruce C. Meyer- Your argument is self-defeating . If jazz musicians are studying classical harmony and not the other way around then who will be doing the incorporating ? Certainly not the willfully ignorant . Are you aware of the Bill Evans compositions Twelve Tone Tune and Twelve Tone Tune Two , just to name two examples of jazz incorporating classical harmony ? <p> @ D. Shapiro " The problem with improvisation is not that great moments of music are not made , but that they are rarely made . " <p> Remove improvisation from that sentence and insert any genre you please . Your gripe seems to be that either there is bad jazz out there or you are only able to appreciate small portions of jazz . I would argue that the fact that you can appreciate some moments in jazz should be your window into a wider appreciation for the genre not an excuse to dismiss it entirely . <p> I grew up studying classical clarinet and played in numerous honor groups , won several solo competitions , and played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my major at the New England Conservatory of Music . I have great respect and admiration for classical musicians . Many of my mentors including my grandfather ( an orchestral cellist ) are classical musicians . I am aware of the gap between my clarinet ability and that of a professional orchestral player . My fervent wish is that more classical musicians would take a jazz improvisation class and discover not only how much they do n't  know , but how much they do n't  know they do n't  know . Then , maybe , they would be more humble in their claims about jazz and jazz musicians in addition to gaining a higher level of appreciation for Americas original art form . <p> Pop music makes vast amounts of money and has huge audiences . If classical musicians and classical music lovers admitted even for a moment that pop music was n't totally inferior to classic music , well , theyd have to come face to face with the brutal fact that their concerts do n't  get anywhere near the audiences that pop concerts do . <p> And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something that classical composers or performers or promoters are not doing . Intolerable . Therefore unthinkable . And impossible . <p> If you look at how the typical pop musician promotes hi/rself , its just astounding how much more adroit and savvy they are . They use Twitter , YouTube , MySpace , Facebook , they give away sample tracks as teasers , they come up with both regular and deluxe " enhanced " versions of their albums , they offer remixeseverything that classic composers and performers could do to get attention and generate excitement , and do n't  do . <p> Above all , the pop musicians produce exciting dramatic gripping music . Classical composers could really learn something from that . At the end of the day , though classical composers and audience squirm and wriggle at the thought , music involves entertaining the audience . It invoves grabbing people by the throat and compelling em to listen . Does n't  matter how you do it , and you neednt do it the same way pop musicians dobut you must do it . Unless your motto is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davidson is completely ignorant of what I do ( or do not ) know about pop music . This is from a man who thinks that bands haircuts are part of the *music* . Davidsons ignorance is so profound he s not even aware he is ignorant <p> One dimension I 'm yet to see articulated in this discourse involves the physiological and anatomical effects of the respective musics under debate . In numerous scientific experiments from the 1960s onwards , rock music ( and to so some extent pop as well ) has been shown to be deleterious to physiological well-being . One experiment even demonstrated that plants exposed to long periods of rock music will shrivel and die as a result . Conversely , experiments have confirmed that children listening to so-called classical music such as Mozart are likely to develop enhanced intelligence . Moreover , we have an epidemic of deafness spanning several generations of rock- and pop-listeners ; the same can not be said of classical-music aficionados . <p> In this respect , science has OBJECTIVELY demonstrated the inherent superiority of one genre ( classical ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply , and quite literally , toxic . <p> The myth about superiority of classical music over the other " genres " or " subgenres " it is not a myth it is a FACT beyond tastes and of course it can be proved . Proving this " MYTH " like proving the Gravity Law it will be impossible of course . <p> For this purpose , any starting point should not consider any cultural background nor personal tastes during analysis . The Object is " The music genre " . <p> For overall approach to this matter we should first agree about the meaning of " superiority " . Analysis should be made defining Superiority on many aspects of each genre : History , composers , artists(interpreters) , music structure ( musical elements analysis ) , musical innovation , popularity , music education , etc . <p> This analysis will force to reach to some undeniable facts and conclusions in regards each music genre.I will not attempt to make such analysis because maybe this question would be a matter of a Doctoral Thesis . I will simply write some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I think Western Classical music as a " Superior form of art " in regards to the other music genres . <p> Classical music is the main actor of historical facts in the history of western music.From classical music genre , the mainstream of musical evolution is found:Musical concepts and innovations of the majority of musical elements used to make music . <p> The concept of " Music concert " and " Concerto " has his origins in classical music also . Liszt again , was the classical composer that made the piano a definitive concert instrument . <p> The violin , the cello , the clarinet , the trumpet and other instruments.reached the status of concert intruments because of Western classical music composers . <p> Choral music and vocal music reached the most significant developments in Western classical music . <p> Orchestration , have had their greatest developments in Western Classical music . <p> Electronic music , was originnally promoted by Western classical music composers and conductor ( Busoni , Schillinger , Varese , Cage , Stockhausen ) <p> Let 's talk , as an example , aboutimprovisation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite Improvisation is what mainly diferentiates Jazz in regards to other genres , Improvisation have been used , before jazz , in Classical Music . The great Johann Sebastian Bach was an skillful organ improviser . We could say that Bach was one of the first Jazz musicians . There is also lots of accounts of Beethovens , Chopins , Liszts.improvisatory skills on the piano . <p> Well It must be clear for anyone that Western classical music history is the most influential and the one that deserves more pages in Western music history books . <p> 2. -Popularity and audiences ; Artists and composers. - <p> I must say that classical music is much more OBJECTIVE . All classical music technology favors almost exclusively the music and only the music .

But folk music is generally very simple forms in regards many music elements . <p> This simplicity can be heard and feel . Local people from some region let 's say a very local " Brazilian people " will like a very good Samba much more than let 's say Villa-Lobos " Rudepoema " Because samba and his compelling dancing rhythm and its Carnaval letters invite to dance and sing along the musicto feel as part of the music . It does n't  matter if you need to do something else while listening . <p> If you need to cook for lunch , turn on the radio and listen to samba .. perhaps it will make cooking easier . It does n't  matter too much if the radio sound is bad . <p> This fact is completely understandable taking in mind cultural aspects.There is nothing wrong to prefer a " samba music " because classical music can not fill the place that " Samba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Indeed , all music genres have their proper places and occasions ; values and qualities .

Bachs Inventions and Sinfonias are one of the most notables samples of music created for education and training but also very attractive for listening . Bartoks Mikrokosmos also aims instruction and technical training . <p> There is no pop-music or rock music composed strictly for rock or pop music education purposes . <p> Some additional comments. - <p> Mediocre music and good music are present in all music genres ; as bad and good books from notable writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical music , one of the most notable composers like Mozart is full of mediocre music output , but it must be recognized his outstandings music masterpieces like his Sinfonia concertante or his Symphony No.41 to mention some . <p> We do not need to be demagogic and , comfortably , keep saying that there is no such a superior music because it relates to cultural backgrounds and personal tastes . This is a misguided position.The debate has nothing to do with tastes and cultural background . Fake intellectuals keep saying that there is no " superior art " .. that is an absolute lie.Yes , there is superior art in many forms like classical music is much more superior in harmonic issues than American folk music . I do not mean that because this superiority , American folk music is not valuable.In this sense ; Pop music , Rock music are also only simplest forms of music(Art) because they have a much more simple approach ( strictly musical approach ) than classical music . <p> There is some interesting thoughts in Greg Sandows writings I will criticize some : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical music is better than classical Indian music .

It would be fair then to ask them how much they know about Indian music . Can they hear what 's going on in it ? Can they hear what people in India hear ? " <p> This demagogic criteria says nothing about anything and the question is set in very wrong terms . Indian music might be better for most of Indian people and other people ( western people include ) But despite the very complex music system of Indian classical , the music itself HAS NOT by far the complexity of Western classical music . I repeat , Western Classical music is much richer in elements of music than Indian , Tunisian , Bolivian , Mexican , et.etc.etc . <p> Indian music have very interesting elements and has qualities and values that surely are not found in Western Classical music , Raagas and Taalas for example . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western classical music has that Indian music does n't  ? ? ? ? ? Indian Classical music has a quite different approach than Western Classical ; there is no score . Music itself is monotextured that is , it follows one single melody line and is played by one person and sometimes <p> two or small ensembles ; also the use of dynamics and modulation as elements in Indian Classical music are not present . Despite there 's many different and complex rythms found in Indian , each music follows one single rhythm pattern . <p> Two : <p> " Can they follow the rhythms of Indian music , which in many ways are more complex than the rhythms that westerners know ? And can they " moving now beyond Indian musichear the complex rhythms in African drumming ?

African Drumming results in the richest music over the world.Indian rhythms are very complex.So Indian music is the most complex in the world . Again I repeatrhythm , notes , sounds , . are combined in Western classical music in such a fantastic and complex shapes that are not found in Indian , Chinese , Tunisian , <p> African .. music . <p> Three : <p> " Improvisation lies at the heart of jazz .

This kind of assertions do n't  contribute anything to this debate . <p> " But improvisation , we might say , if we were fierce jazz partisans , is essential for music . It keeps music honest ..

Everybody arouses everybody else ; it becomes a kind of public onanism . My emphasis " <p> Improvisation is a very interesting element in Jazz music ( but not exclusive ) . However we have two extremed opinions above : one that suggests that jazz is the most honest music because improvisation and gives improvisation almost a religious character . The other contrary opinion ( Pierre Boulez ) say that improvisation is a trash . <p> Both opinions are exaggerated.The first one because Improvisation in jazz performance is prepared , is planned is not " absolutely spontaneous " it is not something like " the Holy spirit of improvisation descended and suddenly , the performer started to improvise " . It also suggests that you can not do anything " deeper and better and bigger " in music if you do n't  improvise.And , again , suggests that Jazz performers are the " Most honest musicians in the world " . These opinions should make part of a " Handbook of music nonsense " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad music " . That assertion is partially truth and so , partially untrue . The main challenge during improvisation is performers musical contribution to the music he is improvising over . <p> Despite anything , the presence of improvisation in jazz certainly is by far not enough to say that " jazz is the superior " and it is not a " guarantee of quality " of music as much as the abscense of it results in inferior music . <p> " Classical music will never die ; blessed all by the voices of God and angels , cursed all that can not hear . " <p> What you said , Kennymany classical musicians would like to think they understand what it means to play jazz , when they really , really do n't  . But , then again , many classical musicians ( including some of the pompous gits here ) seem to think they 're superior to the rest of us mere mortals by virtue of their classical training . All the gas-baggery here makes this " classically-trained musician " ( barf ) want to go blast some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of previous comment on the subject.Please erase that(august/11) and post this . I received your e-mailnice to have feed-back . Thanks and sorry again . <p> The myth about superiority of classical music over the other " genres " or " sub-genres " it is not a myth it is a FACT beyond tastes and of course it can be proved . Proving this " MYTH " like proving the Gravity Law it will be impossible of course . <p> For this purpose , any starting point should not consider any cultural background nor personal tastes during analysis . The Object is " The music genre " . <p> For overall approach to this matter we should first agree about the meaning of " superiority " . Analysis should be made defining Superiority on many aspects of each genre : History , composers , artists(interpreters) , music structure ( musical elements analysis ) , musical innovation , popularity , music education , etc . <p> This analysis will force to reach to some undeniable facts and conclusions in regards each music genre.I will not attempt to make such analysis because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thesis . I will simply write some points <p> of view on the aspects mentioned above that explain why I think Western Classical music as a " Superior form of art " in regards to the other music genres . <p> Classical music is the main actor of historical facts in the history of western music.From classical music genre , the mainstream of musical evolution is found:Musical concepts and innovations of the majority of musical elements used to make music . <p> The concepts of " Concert music " and " Concerto " have origins in classical music also . Liszt again , was the classical composer that made the piano a definitive concert instrument . <p> The violin , the cello , the clarinet , the trumpet and other instruments.reached the status of concert instruments because of Western classical music composers . <p> Choral music and vocal music reached the most significant developments in Western classical music . <p> Orchestration , have had their greatest developments in Western Classical music . <p> Electronic music , was originally promoted by Western classical music composers and LONG ... <p> Let 's talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical approach mostly adopted in jazz music . Despite Improvisation is what mainly differentiates Jazz in regards to other genres , Improvisation have been used , before jazz , <p> in Classical Music . The great Johann Sebastian Bach was an skillful organ improviser . We could say that Bach was one of the first Jazz musicians . There is also lots of accounts of Beethovens , Chopins , Liszts improvising skills on the piano . <p> Well It must be clear for anyone that Western classical music history is the most influential and the one that deserves more pages in Western music history books . <p> Popularity and audiences ; Artists and composers. - <p> I must say that classical music is much more OBJECTIVE . All classical music technology favors almost exclusively the music and only the music . <p> Composer , artists ( or interpreter ) , Conductor/Orchestra or ensembles and audiences are almost completely focused in music during performance . <p> The importance remains mainly on how the music was played and audiences or cd buyers are guided to music appreciation.Here the music matters.The age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to second , third , fourth.levels . <p> There is no great shows or fancy artists in classical music ; or beautiful women in short dresses singing the " Ode of Joy " ; there is nothing that could distract from strictly music appreciation . <p> Classical music audiences , listeners and cd buyers are so " picky " , they are concentrated on music details , they compare interpretations , they research over reviews from music critics ; they keep sometimes two or more recordings , <p> they want to listen the whole music or the whole movement from the beginning to the end not fragments of it , etc . <p> So , it is easy to conclude that music appreciation from classical music audiences is superior in regards to other " western audiences " . <p> Music structure and music elements <p> Classical music make use of much more quantity of music elements and its variations : dynamics , rhythm , tone colors(timbre) , pitch , tempo , scalesHarmony , melody lines , .etc.etc.etc . <p> combining these elements in such a different ways ; contrasting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to fast , from short to long , from small to big , from consonant to dissonant ; from complete silence to full sound , <p> from single instrument to full orchestrationresulting in music with the largest expressiveness scope in regards to music of other genres.Such a expressiveness it can be found-and frequently found- in one single piece of Western classical music . <p> Most of pop music are monorhythmic ( or very few rhythm variations within the music ) , make little use of Dynamics , with very simple harmonic writing ; Most of folk music is very simple also , most rock music the same .

Eventually the boredom of playing the same chord sequences over and over started to drive me crazy . As regards pop I am a sort of Rip van Winkle , I really went into a sulk when the Beatles split in 1970 . I now have a new girlfriend who knows an amazing amount about pop ( in the broadest sense : BBC Radio 6 plus Late Junction ) and I 'm trying to educate myself from scratch .

Pop it seems to me many of are blind to what so much of it has in common : three basic chords , very four-square phrasing , dominance of an almost martial 4/4 time. , and a tendency to a mawkish , quasi-Romantic expression I mean , in comparison to all the other world musics not to mention the commercial way all music has to be marketed . Amateur music-making has not got a look-in on this thread except briefly to be mocked . <p> I think you are looking at this wrong people who are into classical music simply think that pop music is just all around less skilled which in my experience is true I myself started out In music learning my favourite pop songs and then switched to classical/jazz . The fact is that instrumentalists are generally so good at what they do because they are constantly striving for a bigger challenge to make themselves become even better than they are currently for example piano man will only keep you busy for so long I mean its a great song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace either and I know there are some impressive pop stars there like Eddie can Halen and some others who are pretty virtuoso but nothing in the pop world will compare in difficulty to something like Rachmaninov piano concerto 3 that thing is like am hour of solid hardcore playing weather the music is " better " or not I cant say but I deffinately think if you are taking musicians solely on there playing skills and not there writing skills classical soloists would win by a landslide compared to pop musicians . 25395 @qwx885395 25409 @qwx885409 25393 @qwx885393 25408 @qwx885408 25394 @qwx885394 25401 @qwx885401 25400 @qwx885400 <h> Archives <p> Archives <h> @gsandow <h> Resources 25399 @qwx885399 25403 @qwx885403 25402 @qwx885402 25410 @qwx885410 25404 @qwx885404 
@@99220449 @3420449/ <h> The Music Director 's Place <p> There has been a growing trend over the past ten or fifteen years , more prevalent in small or mid-sized orchestras than in the largest ones , but true in some of those as well . This trend has been to change the " reporting structure " of symphony orchestras . The traditional structure , still in place in the majority of orchestras , is that the music director and the executive director ( that latter title may in some places be " president , " " managing director , " or something else ) both report to the board , usually through the board chair ( sometimes called " president " - am I confusing you yet ? ) . The new trend is to have the music director report to the executive director . I presume this has come about because boards and their chairs feel they do n't have the professional competence , experience , and/or knowledge to " supervise " the conductor . Another reason , perhaps , is that the conductor is often out of town guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guest managing , so the executive director tends to be " home " year-round . <p> The problem with the trend is that I do n't believe it - or at least , I do n't believe that it means what it says . In management parlance , one employee reporting to another means that the supervising employee has the freedom to hire or fire that employee . Certainly a smart executive director will bring certain board members into the process of hiring , let us say , a development vice president . But their role will be advisory , consultative . And if the executive director feels that the development vice president is doing a bad job , he will fire the development VP and take sole responsibility for that decision.But if you believe that an executive director has sole power , or even substantial power , in the hiring and/or firing ( or non-renewal ) of a music director , I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you . The hiring is done with a search committee , which a capable executive director will surely influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not imagine an executive director in the orchestra field making that decision and merely informing the board of directors . <p> Without those crucial elements of a supervisory relationship , how can it be said that music directors now are more commonly reporting to executive directors ? They simply are not , and I do n't care what any piece of paper , or computerized management flow chart , may say . <p> On the other hand , it must mean something . Why would this change have happened if it had no meaning ? Perhaps the meaning is subtle and largely psychological - to give the executive director a bit more power in the relationship , to balance out the strong personality of a conductor/music director . Perhaps the meaning is that the board now thinks it is off the hook . But I do n't see how it is . <p> I am sometimes asked , usually by less experienced orchestra administrators , some variant of the following : " If I and my music director can not agree on an issue , at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve ? And should that be the whole board , or just the chair or executive committee ? " My answer is always the same : " If you are at that point , the chances are all is lost . " The relationship between a music director and executive director is not often written or spoken about in public , though it is a constant thread of management professional-development seminars , orchestra conferences and meetings , etc . It must be a pure partnership - one like a marriage . My wife and I may disagree on occasion - but our friends do n't know when , and over what . We find a way to resolve it . Privately . So it is , or should be , with executive directors and music directors . They must find a way to resolve those issues , without going to the board for arbitration . Once that starts , it means the relationship is doomed . <p> And the interesting thing to me is that that has always been true - both in the traditional reporting structure where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new structure where , on paper , the music director reports to the executive director . I continue to be a bit befuddled , because I continue to not see that the changed structure has any substance to it at all . <h> Categories : <h> 4 Comments <p> I visited many orchestras this season , and have worked with many during these searches . My findings say that , depending on the budget size of the orchestra and the staff size , this situation has varied . Some EDs have a specific personality that lends toward their being involved in either a large role , or , allowing a board to vote on new MD choices . Some EDs are more hands-on , more agressive in a positive way , or less so . Some allow the powers given to those to do specific tasks . When there is no General Manager , or Director of Ops , or Artistic Admin , the ED carries a double duty , which renders him/her with more power to assert in other areas , including MD searches . I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new MD and should , therefore , be permitted to vote in certain situations , unless it is that orchestra 's laws for the ED not to ( are there such ' laws ' ? ) In my opinion , aside from a voting committee , search committe etc , if there is one for a particular orchestra , those who will work closest with a new music director should be permitted to be part of this process of voting for someone they will work closest with . <p> On the special relationship between executive director and music director , I am reminded of a quote from Sir Rudolf Bing in " 5,000 Nights at the Opera " : <p> " A thousand aspects of life are involved in theater management . There is no artistic decision that is not at the same time an economic one , no financial decision that does not have bearing on artistic standards " and every decision involves human elements . " <p> I also recommend a recent article in the Detroit Free Press about Leonard Slatkin 's view of his duties at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the organizational structure and responsiblities of the artistic staff beyond the music director ? ( Or does such a need even exist ? ) If the music director in town for only 12 , 13 , 14 weeks of the season , what role should the staff pops conductor , **28;1190;TOOLONG conductors , composer-in-residence , and even concertmaster play " in loco magister " ( in place of the maestro ) ? <p> By the way , does a professional athlete " report " to his coach ? The coach has the authority to tell him what to do on paper , but that 's not always the case in reality . And in any case , the coach has no power to hire or fire the player . Maybe it 's yet another interesting parallel between the sports and music worlds . <p> Long ago and far way I held the very post that you describe . I was the first to hold the post in the manner you suggest . I was the imported staff President to a major company with a resident , and highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at first to be a somewhat arbitrary act by the hiring panel . In all my jobs previous to this I was either equal or , more typically , I worked at the will of the artistic leader . <p> In my everyday workings I worked to support the interests of the organization which I found almost universally in sync with those expoused by the artistic leader . Over time I learned how important the authority reversal could be . Not in the daily activity but in public perception , and even more dramatically in donor relations . <p> It was acceptable , even somewhat sexy , for the artistic leader to be aggressive and challenging . They can demand of the organization items that might be difficult to deliver . The Board and donor 's social relations with the artistic leader could be cordial even if the challenges were unattainable . <p> The Board recognized the relative functional power but the greater funding community was willing to suspend belief and give the altered structure a try . I could bring a rational argument to our cause and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whims . For that to be credible I had to win occasionally , and in reality it gave the institution the air of good governance and management . <p> Donors were more willing to trust us with their resources knowing that there was someone else watching with the authority to act . They could retain their comfort zone with the artistic leader . Perception become reality as often as not . <p> P.S. For the record this was not a Symphony , but that part of the point is n't relevant to the story . Also for the record the venture involved moved away from that model several leaders later . When in the end the community lost faith in the executive it closed the company , not through bankruptcy , ( though that might have been inevitable had it continued ) but through a simple decision to cease operations . The trust had been broken and the support dried up . <p> Henry , I kind of like the concept of " guest managing " but ... seriously , in your opinion , when there is a music director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search committee ? If yes , should the e.d. be a voting member ? <p> You write : " The hiring of a music director is done with a search committee , which a capable executive director will surely influence but hardly exercise strong power over . " If the e.d. feels that the committee is going to make a major hiring mistake , why not exercise strong power ? Assuming that the e.d. has significant musical and/or orchestral experience , is n't that his/her job ? <p> In my opinion , the executive director must be a complete resource to the search committee - meaning he/she is present and fully participating in all discussions . My own view about whether or not the e.d. is a " voting " member is that it is almost an irrelevant question . If a Music Director is hired by a plurality or majority of one , it is the wrong choice ! I frankly think it makes sense for the executive director to vote - he/she is one of the leaders of the institution . But in practical terms it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Henry 
@@99220450 @3420450/ <h> Considering the Arts Administration degree <p> There are plenty of opinions about the place , purpose , benefit , or consequence of graduate study in Arts Administration . I 'm of a certain opinion , as you might guess , since I direct an MBA degree in that very thing . But I 'll be first to claim its a complex question . <p> To engage the question , Ron Evans invited me to be a guest panelist for his National Arts Marketing Project NAMPRadio podcast , which is now on-line . Give a listen . <p> If you have n't got time to listen all the way through , here 's the gist : Graduate study in Arts Administration can be a powerful **29;1220;TOOLONG experience when it fits what you need , and you find the program that fits how you learn . Its not the only path to a successful career in arts and cultural management . But its a path with particular utility for people who want to rethink and reframe the way the business works . <p> Thanks to Ron and his co-panelists Matt Campbell and Maris Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Comments <p> I completely agree that studying arts administration is a worthwhile pursuit , especially when changing career paths . I started out in music education and taught for a number of years before realizing that I wanted to change fields . Without my graduate study in arts admin. , it would have been very difficult to switch gears . After completing my coursework ( still working on the ol thesis ) , I was able to secure a job in the arts marketing field one that I would have otherwise never been qualified for . <p> From my perspective ( working in the UK and mainly in visual arts ) I recognise this questioning of the value of arts **25;1251;TOOLONG degrees . I wonder whether it stems from a lack of respect for arts managers as opposed to the more glamourous business of being a curator or artistic director ? Personally having worked as a curator , then later in arts management ( and briefly teaching on an undergraduate arts management course in London ) I think running arts organisation is increasingly complex and difficult . Accredited degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these challenging and important roles- but equally significant is continuous professional development . Sadly , we are also really bad at valuing ( or paying for ) that too in my country ! <p> As a teacher of arts administration and as a former arts administrator , my perspective is simply that I am turning out graduates who already know much of what I had to learn through trial and error ( which implies a lot of error ) . My previous field was creative writing , also widely criticized for decades as " unteachable . " Its true that we cant make administrative geniuses out of average students , but we can certainly offer skills , ways of thinking , problem solving patterns , and the like the same thing other professional degree programs such as business , law and public administration offer . Perhaps arts administration seems an inherent oxymoron to many , though the ironic truth is that artists are better managers of their own careers and lives than are most other folks . Arts administration degrees enable the best of these natural managers to become truly empowered . 
@@99220451 @3420451/ <h> How to advocate the arts ( 2 ) <p> Time to grapple with this . Continuing from my last post on arts advocacy <p> 3 . What we should do <p> Well , first , what we should n't do . We should n't talk as if the arts are better than popular culture , or as if they 're the sole or main source of meaning in our society . First , those things are n't  true . ( See two previous posts , here and here . ) <p> Second , attacking popular culture aka what other people like would n't exactly be a productive way to bring people to our side . " Hi ! Support the arts ! They 're far better than all that crap you like . " An approach like that whether its explicit , or only implicit in the assumptions arts advocates might make wo n't work , for reasons that should be more than obvious . <p> But how often in , for example , the Dana Gioia commencement address that I linked to in an earlier post do arts advocates more or less say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts alongside popular culture . Try , in fact , to erase any hard and fast distinction between the two , as most younger people do today . I know people in their 20s , who work in classical music , and go back and forth , in their lives , between pop music , art museums , classical concerts , movies , TV shows , Broadway musicals , literary novels , poetry . Why wouldnt they ? I do the same . <p> So : no distinctions . We have one culture , which we all share , even if we parse it differently . <p> And so people in the arts should welcome triumphs in popular culture . Example : When Aretha Franklin sang opera arias ( the most memorable example is here ) , opera companies throughout America should have publicly praised her , saying something like , " Well , of course we do it differently , but were thrilled that such a great singer loves our music . " And then invite her to sing opera from the stage of the Met . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream classical music , have no trouble doing this . When the Metropolitan Museum in New York had a show about how superhero costumes have influenced fashion , that 's precisely the kind of thing I 'm talking about . Or when Tom Stoppard wrote his play " Rock &amp; Roll , " which among other things is about how important a love of rock was for dissidents in Communist Czechoslovakia . Art and popular culture , moving side by side . <p> What else ? If you 're talking about the value of the formal high arts art museums doing shows without a direct connection to popular culture , classic literature , classical music , dance , we know what else goes on this list then do n't  talk in lofty abstractions about how important the art in question is . Instead , talk specifically about what some specific piece of art does . ( Or , if you 're talking about a museum show or a classical music festival , evoke the power of the whole thing by using specific examples . ) <p> One model for that , as I 've said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a great humane psychiatrist and scholar let 's ordinary Springsteen fans say in their own words what Springsteen means to them . Surely we can do that with any art . Henry Fogel , former CEO of the Chicago Symphony and former president of the League of American Orchestras , loves to tell a story of a bus driver ( I think it was ) on an orchestra tour , who fell in love with Mahlers Fifth Symphony . If we had some thoughts about Mahler in the drivers own words , so much the better . <p> Or here 's conductor Benjamin Zander , on Mahlers Seventh : <p> Of all Mahlers works , it may well be the astonishingly " modern " Seventh Symphony that most fully expresses the mayhem of living in the contemporary world . It lays out the conflicts and contrasts , then offers a kind of alternative refugedream-like , entrancing night music. In the end , though , it is in this world , not some remote afterlife , that this symphony finds its true victory . It seems to say : " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it square in the face , and win . " <p> Or here 's me , telling a friend last night what the difference was , in my opera singer days many years ago , between singing Scarpia , in Tosca , and Iago in Verdis Otello . Singing Tosca is a little like imagining myself acting in a fabulous old movie . Its terrific theater , a little over the top , with tasty characters you can have a lot of fun playing with . In his music , Puccini gives you not just the script , but quite a lot of the direction and the cinematography . And now its up to you as a singing actor . What can you do with the character Puccini sketches so delightfully , against such a rich and evocative background ? <p> Iago works much differently . In that role , I felt that Verdi had gotten there ahead of me , that in addition to giving me the script , direction , and camerawork ( to continue the film analogy ) , hed also done the acting , and that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until perhaps I 'd lived with the role for quite a while . So my first job was to find precisely the tone , the color , the subtext , and the timing everything involved with meaning and with consciouso and unconscious attitude that Verdi had built into the role , After I 'd absorbed that thoroughly and , much harder , was able to bring it to life in my own performance ! could I think of adding anything of my own . <p> This did n't  in the least mean that Verdi made me wear a straitjacket . Just the opposite . Verdi gave me a very high kind of freedom , the freedom to touch something greater than myself , and transcend myself in it . <p> You get the idea . We need to talk about the meaning of art in terms of our genuine experience with it . If some work traditionally labelled art turns out to be deeper , higher , more comprehensive , more deeply moving than many things ( or even most things ) in popular culture , then the truth of this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm happy to tell anyone what Antonionis Lavventura means to me , and has meant from the moment I encountered it when it was first shown in the US around 1960 . <p> There " s first the observation of undercurrents , in body language and emotion , that comes from Antonionis camera , the way he moves around people , the way he follows them , the way he puts them ( well , especially his star and later lover , Monica Vitta ) against a background that shows us their entire being or rather ( this is part of his subtlety ) the entire being that they 're showing at that moment , showing both consciously and unconsciously . That there 's more to them we take for granted , because Antonioni , in other moments , shows us that . <p> And then there 's the compassion in the movie , the unblinking eye ( or unblinking camera ) that Antonioni puts on people who are <p> nt making sense , who are damaged , who damage other people . Here we all are . ( The people shown are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts off some who see the film , who think the things were shown are trivial . For me , what Antonioni shows is so deep that it resonates far beyond its setting , but I understand the objection . Just as I understand people who think that the detailed , drawn out things he does with his camera are way too slow , too boring , way too self-indulgent . I do n't  agree , but this kind of work is n't to everybodys taste . ) <p> So at the end , when a terribly flawed and deeply unreliable man hurts Monica Vitti , and in the films unforgettable final scene , she comes up behind him where he s slumped on a bench outside in the dawn , and reaches out his hand , and touches him , this is a moment of redemption , just possibly , for us all , though its to Antonionis credit , I think , that we do n't  know , and do n't  need to know , whether the redemption is Monica Vittis , or the mans , or whether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former love for him , and can feel pity because she 's free , and sees him for what he is . A strength of the scene is precisely that it could have many meanings . And I know it struck me to the heart when I was in my teens , and has remained with me ever since , as a revelation of how flawed we are , how badly things can go wrong , and yet how still there 's hope . <p> You get the idea , I hope . I do n't  need to say that Lavventura is better than Watchmen , a pointless comparison . I just try to let it stand there on its own , with my gloss on what it means to me , so that others with whom my evocation resonates can try it for themselves . If some things in art ca n't support themselves in the market place , and need special funding ( whether from government or private donors or both ) , we can make that case , but again by describing the power , value , and meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that we try to draw , and hope that others will accept ) that these art works need to be available for all of us , even if they 're expensive , and even if not all of us make use of them . <p> People understand , I think I 'll end with this that there are valuable things in life that they themselves might not make use of . I wont hesitate to argue the worth of art like Lavventura , which in fact many people do n't  like at all . ( As I 've said before , I like a lot of things that are n't  exactly popular . ) What 's crucial , I think , is to admit that its not for everyone , but that it still has an important meaning , an important function in our lives . <p> A big part of that as dramatically opposed ( I think ) to the Johnny Mathis approach ( " Wonderful , Wonderful " ) I made fun of in my last post is that art exists in part to challenge us . Not everyone needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that purports to put a challenge forward , but we can make a case that the challenge is important , as Caroline Levine does in her book , which I cited in my previous post . I might also talk about art as an experimental laboratory for life and culture , a place where new attitudes and thoughts and new emotions are tried out , as well as new ways of **27;1278;TOOLONG about/embodying new things . One key point is that we do n't  need to know , in any work of art , what these new things are , or what the artist means in showing whatever she might show , or in doing whatever she might do . The very form of new art might surprise or shock or bother us , or be , at least at first , entirely incomprehensible . <p> But we can learn , as we know ( or ought to know ) we always need to do in life . We in the arts could provide examples of things learned from art , of art that taught us new ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed beyond most normal experience that later was wildly influential . ( Popular culture understands this perfectly . Look , for example , at the joke that 's regularly made about the Velvet Underground : " When their first records came out , only 15 people listened to them . But all 15 were inspired to start path-breaking bands . " ) <p> But that 's a shallow if still perfectly valid way to do it . Its more powerful , I think , and more true to the nature of art , to say that we do n't  know what role a new art experience may pay in our or anybody elses later life , and that this precisely is a part of arts value , that it can bring us something new without either we or the artist needing to know what benefit well ever get from it . The experience itself and the openness to new experience should be reward enough . <p> It goes without saying , of course or it ought to that all of this can happen in popular culture as well . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact ) immediately places me in a netherland that maybe is n't fully recognized , by those who make decrees like this , as art . Next time I write about things like this , I 'll talk about Beckett instead . Or Webern . Or Morton Feldman . <p> And I do n't  mean to say we make our case just by talking in the ways I 'm outlining . To get support for art , we have to make every case we can an economic case , an argument that art helps kids learn , whatever . But we cant pretend , as many music advocates seem to do , even without meaning it , that art music is the only kind of music that kids can learn from , or that can enrich anybodys life . And our economic and practical arguments need to be grounded in our unabashed talk about the value of our art something , I fear , that if we really did it faithfully and honestly would blow a lot of hot air out of the present concept ( and practice ) of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep artistic truth that all of this is supposed to be about . <h> Related <h> Comments <p> In so many ways , I agree with what you say . Almost all of it , in fact . And this in spite of my personal view that some aspects of culture are , intrinsically and perhaps even demonstrably , of greater value than others . But let 's set that aside , for it strays from the point I want to make . <p> I was asked to judge an advertising awards thing recently , and one of the entries was a really excellent pastiche of the Apple iTunes TV ads . It featured ballet dancers wearing iPods silhouetted against bright , changing colours while dancing to the Act IV finale of Swan Lake . The purpose ? To attract a new managing director for one of the UKs leading arts organisations . The brief , apparently , was for this person to come in and help attract younger audiences . And as soon as I saw the ad , I thought of your views on advocacy . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't brilliantly executed , or it failed to communicate its message effectively , but because of what it represented . To me , this pastiche smacked of dumbing down ; of cynically piggybacking on a popular cultural icon to try to convince someone that they should come on board and use similar tactics to promote classical music to young people . It seemed to me as pathetic and cringeworthy as your dad trying to engage your friends in conversation when you were a teenager . <p> This is n't , as far as I can see , the way to attract new ( younger ) audiences . Not when box office figures show that younger people are already more inclined to go and hear difficult contemporary music than most of the ageing classical music elite who stick rigidly with Beethoven , Brahms and Mendelssohn then complain the artform is dying . No , we need methods of engagement that are culturally relevant and this is why I agree with so much of what you say . Only trouble is , I 'm a closet cultural snob a fact of which I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . <p> FK <p> Thanks for sharing your thoughts with such honesty . We should all hope to be as self-aware as you are , as discerning , and as honest . <p> Its more powerful , I think , and more true to the nature of art , to say that we do n't  know what role a new art experience may pay in our or anybody elses later life , and that this precisely is a part of arts value , that it can bring us something new without either we or the artist needing to know what benefit well ever get from it . The experience itself and the openness to new experience should be reward enough . <p> I just asked my singers to answer some or all of a set of questions about why they sing , when they began , etc. for inclusion on our Facebook page . I was struck by how many of them emailed me and said , in effect , " I do n't  know why I sing I 'll have to think about it and get back to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Like ? I like doing this I guess . Why do we do this ? It 's hard , stressful , exhausting , with almost no tangible reward . Somehow I 'm hooked . I just have to do it " its importance rank seems all out of proportion when I think about it rationally . Some kind of intangible thing in my right brain hemisphere Truth ? Beauty ? Beer ? Hard to put my finger on it " <p> We are all overflowing with art , and the need to create it . If people do n't  have conventional outlets , they take to unconventional ( and some might say antisocial ) ones , like tagging , or rap . I think that perhaps our job is to find a way to reconnect people with that yearning for beauty in their lives . In that sense , the recession might almost be viewed as our friend in times like these , people , after they get over the initial whining stage , often begin to seek what is really important in their lives . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be there in ways they can relate to . <p> Sorry if this is incoherent . I know exactly what I want to say , and do n't  know how to say it . Which is why we need art to help us express the unexpressable . <p> I think this is completely clear and coherent , Rebecca . And I loved it . Hiphop ( whatever anyone thinks of it ) is a perfect example of what I think you mean . It burst out among some of the most disadvanged people around , and proved a powerful means of self-expression . Not just the lyrics , but the very complex moves involved in making the music . Especially at the start , when it was all done by finding passages on LP records to repeat many times , using two turntables at once . <p> One of the sad things about classical music today is how removed from creativity most of the audience is . Not only are they sure they do n't  have enough training to create music for themselves , they 're often even hesitant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know enough . Compare the audience for most kinds of pop music , full of people many of whom ( just for a start ) have been in bands themselves . <p> I guess I 'll have to read Dana Gioas address now . I 'm not sure how I missed that . <p> But Im surprised that he would diss popular culture , even while I know he promotes so much of the " old " . I took a poetry workshop with him and an attendee harped on about rap and how it was horrible and not music and Gioia took the defensive on that one . <p> Hmmm . Sorry that does n't  have much to do with all you write above . <p> I do n't  think its just those of us who happen to really love " classical " music who tend to thumb our noses at that which we do n't  " do " . I think its fairly typical for any who are obsessed with something to come across that way . I 've seen popular music snobs too . It just kind of happens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to win the affection of the masses . I 'm not arguing . Just sort of tossing out a thought or two because its more fun than making an oboe reed . = <p> Oh and one other thought . I think symphony orchestras do attempt to " embrace " popular culture at times . And fail miserably . Because someone at the top decides that embracing it means playing horrible arrangements of popular music , or we attempt to be jazzier when some folks do n't  have a clue how to relax or swing , or we pull in some old performer who *was* popular but certainly is n't any more . And someone thinks this is embracing popular culture ? Meanwhile we still do the same old same old with our demeanor and formality , and the men in the orchestra still wear their silly black ( alienating ? ) tails . And then younger people laugh at us ? No wonder . <p> Sorry rambling and much is probably either silly or wrong . <p> But look how long I 've avoided reeds . <p> That all made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog entry by responding to these comments , so you and I are joined in procrastination . <p> If I 've read Dana Gioia wrongly , I 'm really sorry . I 'm glad that , in person , he was more accepting than he seems to be in his commencement speech . To my eye , he seemed to be saying there that people these days know nothing about the arts ( as formally defined , so hiphop is n't included ) , and that as a result our society is crying out for the thoughtfulness and creativity that the arts can bring us . Well , maybe he thinks hiphop is creative , but in a limited way , and " real " are is better . Does n't  sound like he was saying that in the workshop you describe , though . <p> And you 're so right about the way orchestras try reach out to popular culture . Its so often pathetic , in all the ways you describe . <p> I like your comments ( as always ) , but it highlighted another problem , I think . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people know what the arts mean to us so that people can compare it across styles and across genres and make up their own mind what they like . <p> The problem is , though , what do you do when there 's barely anybody who can explain your art form in words that people unfamiliar with the art form can understand ? <p> For instance , you quoted Benjamin Zander , but seriously , if you were to buy a Mahler CD or read a program at a Mahler concert , would you find comments like that in the booklet ? No , not really . Youd be confronted with a whole stack of stuff about tonality and Mahlers experiments with polystylism ( a word that you 'd be left to figure out its definition on your own ) . <p> Also , as someone who does n't  have a strong musical training , I feel terrified to come out with my own comments on music too much , in case Im proven to be incorrect or not academic enough . Are we frightening away the popular advocates of our art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed ? <p> Why will we go to great lengths to mount economic arguments for music rather than simply speak about our art form in words that people who are unfamiliar with it might understand ? <p> So , to sum up , I think you 're quite right . We do need to share our experiences . But are there many people out there who can do that ? <p> Yes , yes , yes , and yes . This is a problem I and others have talked about a lot . For some of my thinking about it , go to the website for my Juilliard course , http : **30;1307;TOOLONG , and scroll down to this weeks class , dated April 8 . You 'll see that Ive assigned some of my blog posts on this subject , including some examples of how I think we ought to talk about classical music . <p> But especially take a look at or rather listen to " The Ring and I , " a show that ran on WNYC , NYs public radio station , about Wagners Ring . Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely contemporary and comprehensible way . <p> Many people Ive talked to think program notes are unfortunate . And a few changes have been made . They 're chattier than they used to be . But still I think they hold the music at a distance . And you 're right they intimidate listeners , and make people feel that their opinion ca n't possibly be worthwhile , because they ca n't talk the way the program notes talk . I 've found , actually , that ordinary listeners often have quite a lot to say , once they start to feel that their views are worthwhile . <p> And you know , it strikes me that this is a human problem , not just a problem in advocating art ( or anything fancy like that ) .
