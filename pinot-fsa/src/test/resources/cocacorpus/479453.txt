The company also performed the first flight tests of a pre-production air-to-air radar for SAA , called the Due Regard Radar ( DRR ) , making it the first radar of its kind designed for a RPA .

" A functional flight test of GA-ASI 's SAA system " which includes automatic collision avoidance and a sensor fusion capability designed to provide the pilot on the ground with a clear picture of the traffic around the aircraft " occurred September 4 , 5 , and 10 at GA-ASI 's Gray Butte Flight Operations Facility in Palmdale , Calif. onboard a Predator B RPA . During the test , Predator B proved the functionality of ACAS XU during collision avoidance maneuvers against ADS-B and transponder-equipped aircraft executed automatically onboard the RPA with the pilot ready to override the system . Automatically executing collision avoidance maneuvers will enable Predator B to maintain safety in the National Airspace System in the unlikely event of a loss of the command and control data link . ACAS XU is specifically designed to be interoperable and backwards compatible with Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System ( TCAS ) II , which is the worldwide collision avoidance system used on most commercial transport aircraft .

" The entire RPA system was successfully tested from start to finish , including flying a real-world representative mission with significant loiter time , and then returning to base . " <p> During the flight , Predator B ER demonstrated its ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the utility of a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance amongst all fuel sources , including the external tanks , the wing , and the fuselage .

AWI also improves climb out performance and fuel efficiency . <p> Additional testing will be conducted into 2015 to validate other mission profiles and aircraft configurations . <p> GA-ASI introduced Predator B ER in April 2012 in an effort to extend Predator B 's already impressive endurance and range greatly while increasing its operational flexibility further . The aircraft first took flight in February of this year , and the company is currently under contract with the U.S. Air Force to build 38 Predator B/MQ-9 Reaper- RPA under the ER option that optimizes the aircraft for Intelligence , Surveillance , and Reconnaissance ( ISR ) missions with a projected increase in endurance from 27 to 33-35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings and heavy-weight landing gear to accommodate an increase in maximum gross takeoff weight . At the same time , GA-ASI is using Internal Research and Development ( IRAD ) funds to develop an add-on ER option that optimizes the aircraft for multi-purpose missions with a projected increase in endurance from 27 to 42 hours for ISR-only by replacing its current fuel-filled 66-foot wings with 79-foot wings .
