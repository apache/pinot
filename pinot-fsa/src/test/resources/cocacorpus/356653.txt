At last lifts ( 3.30pm ) a load of us had planned to meet at the top of the T-bar to watch the sunset , so we all grabbed a few beers and headed up there . It was awesome at the very top of the mountain , especially as there was such a big group of us ! Afterwards a lot of the crew headed back to their apartments but a few turbo-ed over to the park to have a few runs on the kickers and exploit Keepo 's photography skills to the max !

Unfortunately , Lucy had a bad fall when she was hit by a snowboarder so she headed into Kelowna to get checked out in the afternoon but thankfully , nothing was broken and she just needed a few days to rest . There was a gig in Sam 's at night so loads of SnowSkoolers had a good night out and next morning , there was photographic evidence of all that dancing on the tables ! <p> A lot more teaching practice on Tuesday in preparation for the exams next week and it was great to see all the students getting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her broken wrist and Sunny was back riding given his shoulder is well rested !

Most of the students went out for a couple of warm-up runs and then spent the morning teaching down at Happy Valley . Loads of the crew headed to The Bakery for lunch to escape the cold and the snow , and then returned to Happy Valley for more teaching practice .

Some of the students were up riding at 8.30am to get a few runs in before lessons , especially as so much of this week has been spent teaching and not so much bombing around the mountain at serious speeds . The nerves were kicking in a bit but all the students have been working hard and have seen so many awesome changes in their skiing and snowboarding in the last few weeks . We had burger night at The Deli for dinner and then most people headed home to chill out in preparation for the final day of tuition before the Level 1 exams next week ! <p> We woke to a real white-out on Friday but all students put on their instructor helmets and headed out to lessons .

I remember being out with Doug hand shaping banks with my snowboard as he pushed snow around . That pretty much was the start of it . I remember going up under the Bullet chair which may have been called the Easter chair back then and excavating a small pipe in 1990 . This was located on that last Mogul pitch on International ... <p> If you look at the terrain- you can still see the scar- we left there on skiers right . <p> We got a section of trees on Woodpecker right next to the Easy Street Ski Race Centre in my return to Big White in 1995 . This pointed you down the small lane section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next big expansion was the takeover of the Easy Street Ski Race lanes in 1996/97 to build our Ski and Snowboard Cross course , or Snowcross as we refer to it now . <p> This was a major event in the Big White terrain park evolution . The long time standing fun ski course lane was given to us so we could start developing snowcross and we did very successfully . <p> - <h> This- marked a change in ski resorts as we see them today . <p> Skiing was fading and snowboarding was booming , and the use of terrain was being looked at differently .

After our Big White Super Park article in the pages of Snowboarder magazine in 1997 we had hit the big time . A blistering 25 pages of coverage of Big White on one of the worlds biggest magazines . <p> - <h> Next up for Big White was- TELUS Park . <p> In 2000 Big White fully committed to the terrain park program , installing an 1800 foot long double chair right up and over our old runs Woodpecker and Easy Street . We cleared out 50 acres of trees and built two half-pipe dirt structures , one small and one big . All that was left was to add lights and speakers and we were away . <p> TELUS Park opened on a Saturday and the crowds were massive I will never forget all the visiting pros .
