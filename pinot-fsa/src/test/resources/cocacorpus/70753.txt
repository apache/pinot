The attack ceased after about 40 minutes . <p> The second attack , which began an hour later , involved high altitude bombing of the Royal Australian Air Force base at Parap , which lasted about 25 minutes . The two raids killed about 235 people and between 300 and 400 were wounded . Twenty military aircraft were destroyed . <p> There were twenty-seven ships in the harbour that day , as well as two Sydney Harbour ferries , a dozen 21 ton pearling luggers and ten auxiliary vessels under 120 tons .

The Japanese were preparing to invade Timor ; they bombed Darwin to neutralize it as a Naval and Air base . After the war it emerged that the Japanese Army had rejected the Navy 's plans to invade Australia . <p> The Australian government announced initially that only seventeen civilians had been killed in the town . Over the following days newspapers reported on the raids , although the majority of reports were incomplete and inaccurate . Later that year Movietone released a newsreel clearly showing a devastated Darwin . <p> The Lowe Commission was established by the Government to determine the extent of the damage , and on 31 March , less than six weeks after the raid , the Prime Minister announced that no more than 240 people had been killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which time the Japanese had bombed Darwin sixty-four times .

Just over 93% of the total was returned to successful punters in the form of winnings . The balance - termed the player expenditure - was used to meet the costs of supplying these services , including the profits earned by the producers .

The informant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indictable offence in which he alleges that the defendant , who is the Commissioner for Police for the Northern Territory , has abused the authority of his position by providing malicious advice to the Queensland Police Service regarding the informant and thereby causing detriment to him . The conduct is alleged to be a crime contrary to section 82 of the Criminal Code . <p> 2 . The parties have consented to the offence being dealt with summarily . <p> 3 . On 30 November 2010 an application for a stay of the proceedings was filed on behalf of the defendant . The application is made pursuant to section 21 of the Criminal Code . Section 21 permits a judge or a justice of the peace to stay proceedings that are before him or her on the basis that they are vexatious or harassing . <p> 4 . The stay application contends , inter alia , that there is no evidence of either an action fitting the elements of the alleged offence or of culpable intent . When the matter was before the court on 1 December 2010 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I allowed an adjournment of the application in order for the informant to respond to it and to the affidavit that was filed in support of the stay application and directed that he provide a copy of the brief of evidence on which he intended to rely at a hearing of the charge . The charge under section 82 is one within the summary jurisdiction of this Court . It is the procedure of this Court for the brief of evidence to be provided in advance to a defendant in contested criminal matters in order for the defendant to consider the evidence that will be relied on at hearing and for the efficient conduct of hearings . <p> 5 . On 17 December 2010 I raised with the parties the issue of whether a Police Commissioner could be found guilty of an offence under section 82 given the requirement of that section that the person must be " employed in the public service " and took submissions from them on 20 December 2010 . <p> The Offence <p> 6 . The offence created by section 82 provides : <p> 82 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being employed in the public service , does or directs to be done , in abuse of the authority of his office , any arbitrary act prejudicial to the rights of another is guilty of a crime and is liable to imprisonment for 2 years . <p> ( 2 ) If the act is done or directed to be done for purposes of gain he is liable to imprisonment for 3 years . <p> 7 . It follows that to prove the commission of an offence contrary to section 82 the following elements are required . The defendant must : <p> a. be employed in the public service . <p> b. do or direct to be done <p> c. in abuse of the authority of his office <p> d. an arbitrary act <p> e. prejudicial to the rights of another . <p> 8 . Section 4 of the Criminal Code defines the phrase " employed in the public service " as including " employed in an Agency under the Public Sector Employment and Management Act , as a police officer or to execute any process of a court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provides three instances of employment that would satisfy the definition ( though not apparently limited to these ) . <p> a.In an Agency under the Public Sector and Employment and Management Act <p> b.As a police officer <p> c.To execute any process of a court of justice <p> Is the Commissioner of Police employed in an Agency under the Public Sector Employment and Management Act ? <p> 9 . The office of Commissioner of Police is created by the Police Administration Act . Section 9(2) provides " The Commissioner , a Deputy Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner appointed under this Part shall not be an employee for the purposes of the Public Sector Employment and Management Act . " Clearly then , a Commissioner of Police can not fall within the first limb of the definition of employment . <p> 10 . Mr Isles however contends that Mr McRoberts is , notwithstanding that provision , an employee within the public service because he has been appointed as a Chief Executive Officer ( " CEO " ) of an agency pursuant to section 19(2) of the Public Sector Employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Northern Territory Government Gazette No G7 of 17 February 2010 showing that appointment . The instrument for which notice is given in the Gazette , actually appoints Mr McRoberts as the CEO of the Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service . Even if I were to accept that the appointment is one that created employment under the Public Sector Employment and Management Act it would not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the present charge under section 82 of the Criminal Code . As I have noted in 7 above , that offence requires that the person must do an act " in abuse of the authority of his office " . The charge laid by Mr Isles alleges abuse by Mr McRoberts as Commissioner of Police . That is the office from which the correspondence that is alleged to constitute the arbitrary act was sent . It was not sent in his capacity of CEO of the Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service , consequently employment as CEO of the Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service ( even if found to exist ) would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any event , even if there was an instrument purporting to create employment of the Commissioner of Police as a CEO , it would not , in my view , be effective to do so . An instrument can not override a specific provision of a statute and section 9(2) is in absolute terms that the Commissioner of Police is not an employee under the Public Sector Employment and Management Act . <p> Is the Commissioner of Police a person " employed as a police officer " or otherwise " employed in the public service " ? <p> 12 . There is a legal distinction between employment and the holding of office . The distinction most often arises in the context of actions for wrongful or unfair dismissal . The distinction is determinative of a persons rights and responsibilities . The distinction is often blurred by the use of the term " office " in relation to those who actually perform work under contracts of employment ( " employees " ) . Not all those described as " officers " either by the statute that creates the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at law , an office holder . Rather , notwithstanding the title , they may be an employee , that is , a person working under a contract of employment . <p> 13 . The distinction may have significant consequences . Relevantly , the learned authors of The Law of Employment1 note2 <p> " an employee charged with the offence of larceny or embezzlement by a person employed in the public service might seek to argue that , being an officer he or she was not " employed in the public service " and therefore could not be guilty of such an offence . " <p> 14 . Section 82 of the Criminal Code is itself drafted in terms that illustrate the way in which the distinction between employment and the holding of an office can be blurred . Section 82 is entitled " Abuse of Office " and refers to an act being done by a person " in abuse of the authority of his office " . However , in my view , the use of the expression " office " in this provision is simply a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The requirement that the defendant be " employed in the public sector " ( emphasis added ) is in my view a clear requirement that the person charged is one employed under a contract of employment distinct from a person who is an " officer " within the strict meaning of that term . I do not think that it evidences an intention on the part of the Legislature to include in the offence persons holding statutory office alone . <p> 15 . I take that view following consideration of the offences that comprise Part IV , Division 2 of the Criminal Code . Statutory provisions are to be read not <p> in isolation but in the context of the statute as a whole . Part IV of the Criminal Code is entitled " Offences against the administration of law and justice and against public authority " . Division 2 of Part IV provides for offences of " Corruption and Abuse of Office " . The term " employed in the public sector " is used in the majority of the offences created by Part IV , Division 2 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82 and 86 ) and as I have noted , is defined according to the inclusive meaning given by section 4 . <p> 16 . Two provisions in Division 2 point to the view that the expression " employed in the public sector " is intended to be confined to those who work under a contract of employment . <p> 17 . Section 77 creates the offence of official corruption in these terms : <p> " 77 Official corruption <p> Any person who : <p> ( a ) being employed in the public service or being the holder of any public office and being charged with the performance of any duty by virtue of such employment or office , not being a duty touching the administration of justice , corruptly asks for , receives or obtains , or agrees or attempts to receive or obtain , any property or benefit of any kind for himself or any other person on account of anything already done or omitted to be done , or to be afterwards done or omitted to be done , by him in the discharge of the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives , confers or procures , or promises or offers to give or confer or to procure or attempt to procure , to , upon or for any person employed in the public service or being the holder of any public office , or to , upon or for any other person , any property or benefit of any kind on account of any such act or omission on the part of the person so employed or holding such office , <p> is guilty of a crime and is liable to imprisonment for 7 years . " <p> ( emphasis added ) <p> 18 . If the phrase " employed in the public service " was intended to include those holding statutory office other than as employees , there would be no need to add to this offence the phrase " holder of any public office " . <p> 19 . That the Legislature intended a distinction between employment and the holding of a public office in providing for offences relating to corruption and abuse of office is further illustrated by section 80 . Section 80 provides : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character or with special duties <p> ( 1 ) Any person who , being employed in the public service and being charged by virtue of his employment with any judicial or administrative duties respecting property of a special character , or respecting the carrying on of any manufacture , trade or business of a special character and having acquired or holding , directly or indirectly , a private interest in any such property , manufacture , trade or business , discharges any such duties with respect to the property , manufacture , trade or business in which he has such interest , or with respect to the conduct of any person in relation thereto , is guilty of a crime and is liable to imprisonment for one year . <p> ( 2 ) For the purposes of subsection ( 1 ) , private means undisclosed to the head of the department of the service in which he is employed or to the minister responsible therefor . " ( emphasis added ) <p> An office holder performs the duties of the office to which he or she is appointed and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . <p> 20 . Taken as a whole , Part IV , Division 2 of the Criminal Code illustrates an intention to distinguish between those offences for which employment in the public service is a requirement and those for which holding office may also be a requisite element . In my view then , the phrase " employed in the public service " can not be interpreted broadly to include office holders but is limited to those who work under contracts of employment in an Agency or otherwise as part of the " public service " or under a contract of employment as a police officer . <p> Is the Police Commissioner employed as a police officer or otherwise employed in the public service ? <p> 21 . Having determined that the defendant as Commissioner of Police is not employed in an Agency under the Public Sector and Employment and Management Act the remaining issue is whether he is " employedas a police officer " or otherwise is employed in a manner that would satisfy the description " employed in the public service " . <p> 22 . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or services are established by statute . The terms of those statutes are not in identical terms ; consequently it can not be assumed that because in one particular force or service the Commissioner works under a contract of employment that this would necessarily be the case elsewhere3 . In the Northern Territory the Police Force is established by the Police Administration Act . Section 7 of the Police Administration Act provides that the Administrator may , by commission , appoint a person to be Commissioner of Police or a Deputy Commissioner of Police . It is therefore a statutory office , the terms of which are to be determined according to the provisions of the Police Administration Act . Section 9 of the Police Administration Act provides for the remuneration and terms and conditions of the office of the Commissioner of Police . These are to be determined by the Administrator from time to time . Sections 10 and 11 deal respectively with retirement and resignation , both of which are matters that require acceptance by the Administrator of the Northern Territory . These provisions are in my view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they place matters that would normally fall to the responsibility of an employer , or to the terms of an industrial agreement governing that workplace , within the hands of the <p> Administrator of the Northern Territory . Significantly , section 9(4) provides that " Where the Commissioner , a Deputy Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner ceases to hold office other than by reason of his death or resignation or his retirement under section 10 , he shall be paid compensation to be determined by the Administrator " . The provision is strongly suggestive of the Commissioner holding " office at pleasure " and appears to negate any ability for a Commissioner removed from office to seek an assessment of damages for a wrongful dismissal , which would be a cause of action that would be open to a Commissioner on removal from office if he or she were an employee . Rather the question of compensation on early termination rests entirely with the Administrator without recourse it seems to challenge as to adequacy in whatever might be the relevant circumstances . <p> 23 . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police and other members of the police force . It is the Commissioner who appoints members of the police force and has power to determine the rank and periods of probation and promotion and dismissal ( see Part 2 , Division 3 ) of those members . The provisions of the Act that deal with police members appear to me to be clear in terms of those persons being employees . For example section 4 defines " dismiss " as " in Parts IV , V and VI , in relation to a member , means to terminate the employment of the member because of a breach of discipline " and " retire " as " in Parts IV , V and VI , in relation to a member , means to terminate the employment of the member otherwise than by dismissing the member " . Similarly , unlike the provisions dealing with the appointment of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner , other provisions refer specifically to the employment of members ( see sections 16AAA , 27 , 84E , 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioner of Police is not a person " employed as a police officer " nor is the person appointed to that office employed in some other capacity in the public service . The provisions to which I have referred are consistent with a Commissioner holding public office and not working under a contract of employment . <p> Conclusion <p> 25 . That being the case , the requisite element of the offence created by section 82 that the person charged was " employed in the public service " can not be satisfied . Mr McRoberts is charged in his position as Commissioner of Police . That office is not one of employment in the public service of the Northern Territory within the meaning to be attached to that phrase in the Criminal Code . <p> 26 . Consequently , there is simply no prospect that the present charge could be found proved whatever might be the factual evidence of an arbitrary act sought to be relied upon . There is no need for me to consider that question in terms of the stay application . <p> 27 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings under section 21 of the Criminal Code would not be the appropriate order . As a matter of law a charge under section 82 against a person in his or her capacity as Commissioner of Police can not be found to be proved . That being the case there is no purpose to the matter proceeding further to a hearing . <p> 3 For example , the Police Act 1990 ( NSW ) provides " The employment of the Commissioner is to be governed by a contract of employment between the Commissioner and the Minister " . The question of the Commissioner being an employee in that jurisdiction is without doubt .

The Dundee is believed to be named after the popular 1988 film Crocodile Dundee . <h> Durack ( Suburb ) Palmerston <p> This suburban area was left unnamed when Palmerston was divided into suburbs as the area was set aside for a University . <p> With urban development of this area in 1996 , it became necessary to give the area a name . The suburb is named after the Durack family , pastoral pioneers of the Northern Territory and the Kimberleys . <p> The Durack brothers in 1883/84 drove four mobs of cattle ( 7500 head ) from Queensland to their Kimberly properties . <p> By 1886 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had applied to secure Auvergne Station in NT from McCartney . This began the 6000 sq mile ( 15,500 sq kms ) pastoral empire on the Western Australian/Territory Border . <p> Michael Durack sold most of his properties in 1950 at age 85 years and a monument was erected at Argyle to his pioneering kinsman , dying at Perth on 3 September , 1950 . Dame Mary Durack Miller , born in 1913 , was the eldest of " MP " Durack 's family travelled and gained distinction as an author of " Kings in Grass Castles " and " Sons in the Saddle " . She died in Perth in early 1995 . <h> E <h> Earhardt ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This undeveloped area on the western side of the upper reaches of the Middle Arm of the Darwin Harbour proposed to be named after aviatrix Amelia Earhardt is being incorporated into the adjoining Blackmore locality . <h> Eaton ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> This Darwin suburb takes in RAAF Base Darwin and the airport . Eaton is named in commemoration of Group Captain Charles Eaton ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diplomat and Soldier . Charles Eaton OBE , AFC , MID was born in London in 1895 and came to Australia in 1922 and joined the RAAF in 1925 . He first came to the NT in 1929 to find the missing " Kookaburra " . In 1938 he inspected northern defences and in 1939 was appointed OIC Fannie Bay . <p> In 1940 with the completion of the new RAAF aerodrome , he was appointed Station Commander of RAAF Darwin . After the War he was appointed Australian Consul in Portuguese East Timor and later Acting Australian Consular General at Jakarta . <h> East Point ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> East Point , Lee Point and Point Charles all appear on Goyders original plan of Port Darwin in 1869 . This point , the easterly extremity of the entrance to Darwin Harbour has been used for a variety of purposes , including gun turrets and anchor for the submarine net during the War ( 1942-46 ) , a post war golf course and currently a recreation reserve . <h> Eva Valley ( Locality ) Coomalie <p> This locality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Miles Road to the south west of Batchelor . The area was originally known as Banyan Farm , in the 1950s , when owned by Boyne Litchfield . When purchased by the Childs family , who held the land during the 1960s and 70s , the property was renamed Eva Valley after Eva Childs , wife of Bill Childs who were joint owners . Following the sale of the land by the Childs family and subsequent subdivision , the area has continued to be known as Eva Valley . <h> F <h> Fannie Bay ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> Fannie Bay is believed to have been named by the surveyors of Goyder 's expedition to found the present day Darwin in 1868 , after Fanny Carandini , a popular opera singer of the time . <p> Fanny Carandini was the daughter of an exiled Italian Count , Count Gerome Carandini , tenth Marquise of Saranzo , who came to Hobart , Tasmania , in the 1840s and married Mary Burgess who became a noted opera signer . Madame Carandini and her daughters Fanny , Rosina and Lizzie formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In 1868 the Carandinis held concerts in Adelaide a monthbefore the South Australian Surveyor-General , George Goyder , and his party set out in the ' Moonta ' to found Palmerston ( the present day Darwin ) . One of the concerts was a benefit night for ' Fannie ' Carandini and some of Goyder 's surveyors would almost certainly have been there . <p> The reason for the difference in the name ' Fannie ' or Fanny ' is unclear . In his book Australasia and the Oceanic Region published in 1876 , William Brackley Wildey wrote of the Palmerston of 1874 - " PALMERSTON is laid out in 1019 half-acre allotments , and extends nearly three miles across to Fanny Bay , so named by the surveyors after Miss Fanny Carandini - this is prettily and healthily situated , facing the ocean , about four miles from town , a little beyond the town boundary ..... " <p> However , Hoare , one of Goyder 's party on the expedition to Palmerston , wrote in his diary " March 1 ( 1869 ) : Public Holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talc Point . Got some specimens of shells , talc and coral . I made a sketch of Fannie Bay , Point Emery ..... " Also , in the early maps of Darwin the spelling ' Fannie ' was used . <p> One explanation for the confusion could be that the Carandinis changed the spelling of their names for promotional purposes . Although Fanny Carandini 's death certificate reads ' Fanny ' , in newspaper reports and advertisements in her singing days the spelling ' Fannie ' is used . Her mother appears to have done the same , changing her name from ' Mary ' to ' Marie ' . Goyder 's surveyors would possibly have taken the version ' Fannie ' name from a program or a poster advertising the Carandinis ' concerts in Adelaide . <h> Farrar ( Suburb ) Palmerston <p> This suburban area was originally part of the Gunn when Palmerston was divided into suburbs in 1984 . <p> However the development of Palmerston 's eastern suburbs did not proceed in the 1990s as designed in 1984 and therefore the suburb of Gunn of 1998/9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 to allocate a new name to the area of Gunn between the old and new Stuart Highway alignments . <p> The suburb is named after John Farrar , a pastoral pioneer of the Northern Territory . <p> John Samuel Farrar was born in Yorkshire ( perhaps Bradford ) , England in 1838 and came to Victoria , Australia , with his father ( an ex-cavalry officer ) circa 1856 . Little is known of the earlier years , but they both gravitated to New South Wales . <p> John Farrar eventually moved to Queensland where he worked as a stockman and drover on stations , such as " Kyabra " , owned by John Costello who was one of the first settlers on the Bullo River . Farrar was associated with the Burke and Wills Expedition , not as an explorer but guided the party through the Diamentina country to Cooper 's Creek . <p> After his father 's death in 1874 , Farrar is believed to have returned to Yorkshire to deal with his father 's estate there . He returned to " Farrar 's Creek " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and by 1880 had moved into the Northern Territory , managing Lake Nash for Costello for a number of years . When Costello wound up his affairs in the NT in the bleak 1890s , Farrar moved to Hodgson Downs . Farrar with his sons Robert and William Ernest held pastoral leases at Nutwood Downs and Mainoru . John Farrar spent some 14 years at Nutwood Downs ( of some 1800 sq miles ) after the turn of the century and at one time held Elsey Station . Although speared twice , he was well liked by Aboriginal people . In 1916/17 , the Farrars left the Territory to retire at Ferney , nine miles from Maryborough , Queensland , where he was later joined by his sons Robert and John . Mrs Farrar , aged 70 , died on 24 December 1917 while John Samuel Farrar died on 18 November 1918 , aged 80 . <h> Finniss , Hundred of Coomalie <p> This Hundred is named after Boyle Travers Finniss who was born at sea , off the Cape of Good Hope , on August 18 , 1807 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sandhurst , he had been paid out of the military by 1835 . Finniss was an Assisiant Surveyor to Colonel Light when the foundations of the City of Adelaide were laid in 1836 and became Deputy Surveyor General after the death of Light in 1839 ; a Police Magistrate and the Commissioner of Police . He was commissioned to form a Cabinet in 1856 , but after many changes he sat in the first Parliament in 1860 and retired in 1862 . <p> The Ayers Ministry appointed Finniss to found a settlement at Escape Cliffs in the Northern Territory in 1864 . The relative failure of the expedition to establish a capital for the Northern Territory led to the abandonment of the settlement in 1866 . Finniss died in Adelaide in December , 1893 . <p> The Hundred of Finniss was gazetted in 1871 after the initial surveys were carried out in Darwin 's hinterland . <h> Finniss Valley ( Locality ) Coomalie <p> Finniss Valley is named as the stream , Finniss River flows through the locality . The Finniss River was named by Litchfield to perpetuate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B T Finniss . <h> Freds Pass ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> What is today called the Stuart Highway was until the 1930s , Fred 's Pass Road , the main road leading out of Darwin from the Daly Street Bridge through Freds Pass , in the Daly Ranges , to the Town of Daly and Auld'sLagoon . These features take their names from Fred Litchfield and Patrick Auld who in 1865 explored the area today known as Litchfield Shire . The Freds Pass Reserve was created in the post Cyclone Tracy period ( 1974 ) on the original Freds Pass Road and adjoining land as a major recreation area for the Shire . The locality is centred on the Reserve , which is recognised throughout the Shire as Freds Pass . <h> Fly Creek ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This locality takes its name from Fly Creek which was applied by William Harvey when surveying sections of the Hundred of Cavenagh . As there were no members of Goyder 's party with that name , it is assumed that Harvey was worried by flies in the area . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locality ) Litchfield <p> This locality derives its name from Girraween Lagoon , a name given to a lagoon in Section 254 , Hundred of Bagot , when in 1967 it was found to have been incorrectly shown as McMinn 's Lagoon . The name " Girraween " is of Aboriginal origin and is derived from Australian Legendary Tales as meaning " the place of flowers " . The locality is generally based on the Girraween Subdivision being developed by the Churcher Estate . <h> Glyde , Hundred of Glyde Point ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> The Hundred of Glyde , lying south of the Bynoe Harbour and east of Fog Bay , was named the SA Government after Lavington Glyde a long serving Minister . <p> Gylde Point , adjacent to Gunn Point , is named after the point of the same name , which was named in the 1860s and is believed to be named after Lavington Glyde . <p> Lavington Glyde who was born in Exeter , Devon in 1825 and emigrated to SA in 1857 . He entered the SA Legislative for East Torrens and Yatala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was Commissioner for Crown Lands on four occasions from 1863 to 1868 and was Treasurer again for the Blyth ( 1873 ) and Bray Ministries ( 1885 ) . Under his Ministry for Lands , he issued freehold titles for the NT as the result of Goyders survey . <h> Goyder , Hundred of Coomalie <p> This Hundred lying west of the Stuart Highway , takes in the area around Batchelor and north to include Rum Jungle . <p> The Hundred was one of a group named by the South Australian Government in 1871 . It is named after George W Goyder , Surveyor General who led the expedition which carried out the survey of Palmerston ( Darwin ) and its hinterland in 1869 . <p> Born in Liverpool in 1826 , Goyder was educated at Glasgow and joined an engineering firm and trained in surveying . He emigrated to NSW in 1848 , moved to Adelaide in 1851 where he married Francis Smith of North Adelaide . He became Surveyor General in 1861 . His Goyder Rainfall Line was a task he undertook successfully to define the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmerston in 1869 was one of his greater tasks in defining the capital of South Australia 's new northern Province of the Northern Territory . In 1889 he was awarded the CMG and died at Warrakilla in 1898 . <h> Gray ( Suburb ) Palmerston <p> This suburb is named after William Henry Gray who was born in London in 1808 and who after becoming interested in the Wakefield Scheme of colonizing South Australia in 1834 , arrived in Adelaide aboard the John Renwick in 1836 . Gray was among the first colonists to purchase land in the new Colony . He bought large tracts of land in Port Adelaide , Palmerston ( now Darwin ) , Southport and surrounding hinterland . He established his farm near Adelaide at the Reedbeds . He set up a Voluntary Military Force known as the Reedbeds Mounted Rifle Company in 1859 . <p> He came to Palmerston in 1870 not long after its founding , the SS Bengal with John McKinlay and others who were seeking some investments in the north when Captain Bloomfield Douglas was the Government Resident . Grays lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislative Council and was at one time Attorney General in the Cockburn Government of 1887 . Gray was connected with E H Bakewell of the pastoral firm and the three men held titles in the area now occupied by the new Town of Palmerston . Gray died in 1896 and left a large estate to his family , with interests which have been held by them until recent post-war years . <h> Gregory , Hundred of Coomalie <p> The area south of the Hundred of Finniss and between the Hundred of Blyth and Waterhouse was left unnamed until September 1953 when it was official named Hundred of Gregory , commemorating the explorer Sir Augustus Charles Gregory . <p> Gregory was born in Nottinghamshire in 1819 and came to Western Australia as a child in 1829 . His early survey career in the west led him eventually to take on the task of leading the North Australian ( Scientific ) Expedition to the Victoria River District in 1855/56 . He was later to become the Surveyor General of Queensland in 1859 ; a member of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1882 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1905 . <h> Gunn ( Suburb ) Palmerston <p> This suburb is named after Mrs Jeannie Gunn who was born in Carlton , Melbourne as Jeannie Taylor in June , 1870 . She studied literature and history with her sisters and later the three Taylor sisters opened their school Rolyat ( Taylor spelt backwards ) at Hawthorn in 1889 . <p> Miss Jeannie Taylor met Aeneas Gunn , a librarian at Prahran , in the 1890s and they were married in December 1901 , arriving at the Elsey in 1902 . The Gunns came to Port Darwin on the " SS Guthrie " . Aeneas Gunn had previously spent time in the Territory with his cousin Captain Joseph Bradshaw in 1890 . Aeneas died in March 1903 and Jeannie Gunn returned to Hawthorn . Her book " We of the Never Never " , about life and the Territory people at Elsey Station became known Australia wide and in 1939 George VI awarded her the Order of the British Empire . She died in Melbourne during June 1961 . <h> Gunn Point ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This locality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peninsula of land on the coast between the mouths of the Howard and Adelaide Rivers . The point gets its name from Lieutenant G S Gunn who , in 1886 with Captain McClear , carried out a coastal survey of the area in HMS Flying Fish . The peninsula , until the mid 1990s , was the site of the Gunn Point Prison Farm . <h> Guy , Hundred of Litchfield <p> This Hundred is named after Michael Stewart Guy , who had joined the Royal navy at the age of 14 and had served on the Rodney &amp; Stromboli in the Black Sea during the Crimean War . He was afterwards engaged in marine surveying , arriving in the Colonies at Tasmania in 1861 . He came to South Australia under Commander Hutchison on the HMS Beatrice when he made his first trip to the Northern Territory . He died in North Adelaide from inflammation of the lungs on 4 July 1869 aged 29 years . The Hundred takes in the coastal plain area west of the Adelaide River and contains the 1954 Humpty Doo Rice Project area and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> H <h> Hart , Hundred of Coomalie <p> The Hundred of Hart , north of the Hundred of Blyth , was surveyed in 1869 and named after the SA Premier John Hart . <p> John Hart was born in 1809 , went to sea becoming a captain in the merchant service . He established a whaling station at Encounter Bay in 1833 , before Adelaide was founded in 1836 . He left the sea in 1846 and started flour mills . He joined the SA Legislative in 1857 for Port Adelaide where he started his mills . He was Treasurer in the Baker Ministry ( 1857 ) , Chief Secretary in the Dutton Ministry ( 1863 ) and three times Premier between 1865 and 1871 . The Hon John Hart was created a CMG and died suddenly in Adelaide in 1873 . <h> Helpman ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This proposed locality on the western side of the Adelaide River , near the rivers mouth , perpetuates the name of Benjamin F Helpman , Mate of the HMS Beagle , who in 1839 had explored the River mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wife of William IV . He had much faith in the river 's potential and John McDouall Stuart was aware of his plan and work when he set out to cross the continent from Adelaide to the north coast . <h> Herbert ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This new locality , in the vicinity of Benham and Benjamin Lagoons , has previously been considered part of Humpty Doo . In order to contain the size of Humpty Doo , it was decided to establish a new locality to the north of Pioneer Drive . The locality name commemorates the Herbert Brothers , who settled at Humpty Doo ( 1908 ) and Koolpinyah developing an agricultural/pastoral enterpriseover the ensuing 70 year period . Oscar Herbert and his brother Evan both died in 1974 and are buried in simple graves at Koolpinyah Station . <h> Holmes ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> This Darwin suburb is based on Holmes Jungle , named after Felix Holmes , a prominent Northern Territory citizen in the 1920s and 1930s . Holmes owned a butchery , ice works , cordial factory and power station and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Litchfield <p> This new locality to the north of Palmerston , including the Armys Robertson Barracks , commemorates Maurice William Holtze who arrived in the Territory in 1878 as Government Gardener and set up the Experimental Gardens which later became Darwins Botanic Gardens . Holtze held land around from 1883 to 1917 and was engaged in an early agricultural enterprise at Jungle and Palm Creeks . This Jungle was known as Holtze Jungle , but in post war years the area was secured as a Forestry Reserve known as Holmes Jungle after Felix Holmes , a butcher , who in 1917 owned and raised cattle in the Jungle . The name of MW Holtzes son Valdemar ( known as Wallaby Holtze ) is perpetuated in a road on the south boundary of the locality . <h> Howard , Hundred of Coomalie <p> This Hundred is named after Commander Frederick Howard , RN who served under Commander John Hutchison on the survey schooner HMS Beatrice . <p> Commander Frederick Howard , RN was the youngest son of Edward Howard and joined the Navy in 1848 , the HMS Herald in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Howard then served on HMS Beatrice and in 1864 served as hydrographer on the northern survey at Escape Cliffs in South Australias Northern Territory and thereafter as its Captain . His work on the north coast to 1866 filled in and complemented the work of Captain P P King of the HMS Mermaid in 1818 . <p> The Howard River was named after him in 1865 by W Patrick Auld with the Finniss Survey party and consequently the Howard Springs , the feature and Howard Springs , the locality in the rural freehold south east of Darwin bore his name . <p> He became Commander in 1883 after being recalled to England after completing the survey of the coasts of South Australia . He was later a Hydrographer on the NSW Harbours and Marine Dept and worked on mapping the Macleay River . He retired to North Sydney and died at Milsons Point in September , 1892 at his old home since demolished to make way for the southern approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge . <h> Howard East ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This locality east of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Authority , as a bore-field . <h> Howard Springs ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> Howard Springs is so named after the stream which contains the Springs at its headwater . W P Auld of Finniss Party named the Howard River after Frederick Howard in 1865 . Captain Howard was the master of the small topsail schooner HMS Beatrice which carried out exploration work from the Escape Cliffs settlement in 1864 . He charted , as a hydrographer , the mouth of the Liverpool River and the coastline between Cape Stewart and Port Essington . In 1939 , Howard Springs ( at one time called Worgan Springs ) became the first major water supply area to service Darwin . With the war approaching , Manton Dam was constructed and took over the role of supplying water to Darwin . <h> Hughes ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This locality derives its name from the war-time airfield which was named after W A Hughes , the Director of Mines in the Northern Territory before the war , who had inspected the site with US Army Colonel Sverdrup in early February 1942 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hundred of <p> The Hundred of Hughes lies between the Hundreds of Milne and Cavenagh and contains the range which forms the headwaters of the Rivers Charlotte and Annie . <p> This Hundred was named in 1871 after W W Hughes ( 1803-1887 ) , a prominent SA businessman . <p> Walter Watson Hughes was born in Pittenween , a village in Fife , Scotland on 22 August , 1803 and educated at Crail . He went to sea to the Arctic and later as Chief mate of a sailing vessel to calcutta . He purchased a brig called the Hero sailing between China and Calcutta and first went to South Australia in 1842 . He settled down there to pastoral pursuits to the east of Adelaide . To him belongs the honour of discovering and developing the copper mines of Moonta and Wallaroo found on the Hughes and Duncan property in 1859-61 . Whilst the mariner could not be persuaded into State politics , he did serve in the Adelaide City Council .

This was supposed to be an English language corruption of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Committee has been unable to ascertain the origin of the name other than Oscar Herbert called his homestead Umpity Doo in 1910 and this gave rise to the Humpty Doo of more recent years . <h> Hutchison , Hundred of Litchfield <p> Named after Commander John Hutchison who died in the prime of his life at North Adelaide in July , 1869 . Entering the Royal navy in 1842 at 13 years , he was engaged on the English and Irish coasts on the HMS Herald under Captain Wolfe . He spent some time in the exploring and survey departments and went to the Pacific and the Arctic in 1852 . He was appointed a Commander in 1861 in charge of the Admiralty Survey of the South Australian colony . He proceeded with Captain Frederick Howard on the survey schooner HMS Beatrice to the Northern Territory of South Australia accompanying the Col Finniss Survey Party to Escape Cliffs in April , 1864 .

In 1964 , Douglas Lockwood recommended that a number of tribal names be used for neighbourhood units or suburbs of Darwin . Karama and Garawa were listed , but Karama was preferred although Welfare authorities felt that Garawa was more correct . Karama is pronounced with the emphasis on the first syllable . <h> King Creek ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This proposed locality takes its name from the feature of that name which was applied by W P Auld in 1865 after Stephen King Snr to the upper reaches of the Creek whilst Auld was traversing from Escape Cliffs to Port Darwin . <h> Knuckey Lagoon ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> This prominent lagoon or lagoons was named by Surveyor General G W Goyder during the Survey of the Port Darwin and Environs in 1869 after Richard Randall Knuckey , his Senior Surveyor , who took a leading part in the survey . Knuckey also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Born in Cornwall ( England ) , Knuckey was educated in Kadina ( SA ) , trained as a surveyor in Adelaide and served in the Northern Territory . <p> This locality was removed from the Berrimah suburban area in the " City of Darwin " . <h> Koolpinyah Litchfield <p> The original grants in 1908 to the Herbert Brothers were for leases at " Umpty Doo " and " Koolpinyah " . They later combined their operation at Koolpinyah . Their homestead was near a waterhole called by the aboriginals " Gulpinyah " , which was interpreted for their station name as " Koolpinyah " . The Herbert Brothers , the sons of Justice Herbert , continued on their property until their deaths in 1974 . <h> L <h> Lake Bennett Coomalie <p> Lake Bennett is named after the dam and reservoir - Lake Bennett which is the main feature in the area . The dam was constructed by George and Ken Bennett in 1980 , having purchased the land in July 1979 . <h> Lambells Lagoon Litchfield <p> Surveyors Daniel Daly and Gilbert McMinn surveyed Sections 560 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showed two lagoons on their diagram . Goyder 's Survey of Port Darwin and Environs indicated that the name Lambells Lagoon had applied in 1869 . Lambells Lagoon is named after the young Accountant and Postmaster at Fort Hill , J H Lambell , who kept the accounts and looked after the mail for the survey groups . Lambell issued instructions on behalf of Goyder , recalling parties etc when required . The Lambells Lagoon area and the adjoining Black Jungle to the west is a joint conservation area , whilst the Lambells Lagoon locality contains good soil and is being developed as a horticultural area . <h> Larrakeyah ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> The suburb gets its name from the original Aboriginal tribe when Darwin was founded by G W Goyder in 1869 after early abortive attempts by South Australia at Escape Cliffs . The Larrakeyah and Woolner tribes were known to and assisted the survey parties . Aboriginal camps were apparent in the area covered by the suburb to the west of the city . Larrakia ( current orthography ) are a group of Gulumirrigin speaking Aboriginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no meaning . <h> Leanyer ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> The name Leanyer was in general use for the area at the time of development and first appeared on 1869 survey plans . The origin is not known , but is presumed to be Aboriginal . <p> The roads within this suburb are generally named after coastal features and rivers in the northern part of the NT or pastoral properties owned by the developer of the subdivision - Hooker Rex . <h> Lee Point ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> The name of this yet to be developed suburb is derived from the point Lee Point which appears on Goyders 1869 Plan of Port Darwin and probably dates back to Stokes examination of the Harbour in 1839 . <h> Livingstone <p> This locality derives its name from the war-time airstrip which was named after John D Livingstone , Jnr , who was born in 1915 in Clarksburg , West Virginia , USA . On 4 April 1942 , Lieutenant Livingstone was apparently wounded during action over Darwin , but managed to fly to the newly completed 34 Mile airstrip where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was buried at The Gardens Cemetery the following day . The 34 Mile strip was later named Livingstone in his honour . <h> Lloyd Creek ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> Lloyd Creek is one of two creeks in the area which were named by the Finniss Party in 1864/5 and later incorporated in the Goyder surveys of the Hundreds in 1869 . <h> Ludmilla ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> Ludmilla , as a suburb , derives its name from Ludmilla Creek , believed to have been named after Ludmilla Holtze by Gustav Sabine , who was a Government Surveyor , and who carried out a survey of that particular area in 1893 . As the name did not appear on any maps prior to this survey it is pretty certain to have been Gustav Sabine ( Sabine Road , Millner ) . Not very much is known about Ludmilla Holtze herself other than she was the only daughter of Maurice and Evlampia Holtze who migratedto Australia from Hanover in 1872 , together with Ludmilla and her three brothers . Both Maurice Holtze as Government Gardener ( 1878-1891 ) responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Nicholas ( Ludmilla 's brother ) through his untiring work from 1891 when he took over from his father until his untimely death in 1913 aged 45 , are credited with the variety of species and beauty of the Botanical Gardens as they are today . <h> Lyons ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> Lyons is named in commemoration of Tommy Imabulg Lyons , a Larrakia traditional owner ( Greater Darwin Area ) and senior man for the Danggalaba clan , who was a member of the " Black Watch " and worked as a Police Tracker . Tommy lived most of his life on the Cox Peninsula , Dum-in-mirrie and Indian Islands in Bynoe Harbour . He died in 1978 . Prior to gazettal on 7/7/2004 ( NTG 27 ) the area comprising Lyons was part of the suburb of Lee Point . <h> M <h> Malacca Creek Litchfield <p> Fred Litchfield 's diary of 5 June 1865 refers to the crossing of the Adelaide River at the Narrows and encountering Malacca Creek on the western side of that River . Also , W P Auld uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin . Whether its origin lies in the shady malacca tree of Melaka or derives its name from the Straits of Malacca or a naval ship which perpetrates the city 's name , it can be said this creek name was first applied in 1865 . The erroneous name Melacca Creek was applied in post-war years . <h> Malak ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> Named after the Aboriginal tribe who came from the Daly River area who have totemic groupings , ( eg turtles , crocodiles , lizards etc ) . Alternative spellings have been Mallak , Mulluck Mulluck . It seems also to be an alternative name for the Gubabiungui who now live at Milingimbi . Although the naming intended in 1965 to have the tribe pronounced Mulluck , its name has been pronounced in a variety of anglicised forms . <h> Mandorah ( Locality ) Cox Peninsula <p> This locality on the Cox Peninsula , across the harbour from Darwin , is named after " Mandorah " , a guest house built in the area by Allan Hartwig . <p> The name was first officially recorded as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department in May 1948 . Mr Allan Hartwig held Occupation Licence No. 242 of about 20 acres . <p> Although the name appears first in 1948 , the name could have been applied during or just after World War II . <h> Manton ( Locality ) <p> This locality derives its name from Manton Dam , Darwin 's first wartime water supply . B T Finniss , commander of the Escape Cliffs settlement named the River after his second-in-charge of the expedition , James Thomas Manton , who later took over the abortive survey task , and was recalled in 1866 . Manton was a surveyor , an engineer and architect , who had built lighthouses in SA and also the Tapley Hills Road before taking on the NT task in 1864 . He died in Adelaide in 1899 . <h> Marlow Lagoon ( Suburb ) Palmerston <p> Named after Joseph Marlow who came to the Territory at the age of 21 year in about 1917 from the Malay States . He was a fettler on the Railways at stages , but had an interest in Agricultural Lease No. 213 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area jutting into East Arm of Darwin Harbour between Berrimah and Palmerston . It is believed that his occupation of this lease led to the use of the name Marlows Lagoon ( for the waterhole ) on pre-war plans . <p> In 1935 , Joseph Marlow married Ellen Mary Flynn , daughter of Nellie &amp; Tom Flynn of Rum Jungle on 26 February and they had two children . On 27 September 1940 Marlow ( recorded as Joseph Marler ) died at Parap ( aged 46 years ) . <h> Marrara ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> The swamp between the suburb and the Darwin International Airport is shown on Goyder 's original surveys of Darwin in 1869 , but it , like Leanyer , is believed to be derived from an Aboriginal name for the area . The suburb derives its name from the swamp and includes the residential area and the sporting complex between the airport and McMillans Road . <p> The streets in the residential area of the suburb are named after golf courses at he request of the Darwin Golf Club who developed the residential subdivision in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> McMinns Lagoon appeared on Goyder 's plan of the Survey of Port Darwin and Environs in 1869 . It was probably applied by George McLachlan who surveyed this area , after his colleague surveyor , Gilbert McMinn , if not by Goyder himself . McMinn migrated to South Australia in 1850 and on leaving school , took up surveying . Prior to coming to the Territory as a Senior Surveyor under Goyder in 1869 , he was at Escape Cliffs in 1864 with the B T Finniss expedition . <h> Micket Creek ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> Although the name Micket Creek in various spelling forms has appeared on maps and plans since 1869 when Port Darwin and environs was surveyed by members of the Goyder expedition , the origin of the name is unknown . <p> As the name appears on the same plan as Leanyer and Marrara Swamps , the posibility of the name being of Aboriginal Origin can not be discounted . <p> More recently the Micket Creek Shooting Complex has been built in the locality , bringing various shooting clubs into the one complex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically derives its name from the ridge of fertile upland country jutting out as a " middle point " into the open plain country on the edge of the coastal plains of the Adelaide River .

He left Scotland in 1839 to emigrate to the Province of South Australia . Milne took over the wine business of Patrick Auld in 1857 and joined the SA Parliament in 1857 representing Onkaparinga until 1868 . In 1869 he was elected to the Legislative Council and knighted . It was his support for the Torrens Real Property Act and a Bill for the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line which obviously persuaded the SA Government to recognise his contribution by naming the Hundred of Milne after him in the NT in 1871 . The Hon. William Milne became President of the Legislative Council in 1875 and died in South Australia in 1895 . <h> Mitchell ( Suburb ) Palmerston <p> The suburb of Mitchell and nearby Mitchell Creek are named after Surveyor A J Mitchell who was a Senior Surveyor with Surveyor General G W Goyder during the surveying of Palmerston and surrounding hinterland in 1869-70 .

Beaumont Moulden was for seven years President of the Australasian National League . He was a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Furriers , London , and a Freeman of the City of London . In 1900 , in recognition of his political services , he received at the hands of Lady Cecil , the Grand Star of the Primrose League of England . <p> It was in the earlier years that Moulden became involved with W H Gray as his solicitor in acquiring land near Darwin and , in 1871 together with Gray 's son , F J Gray , and E H Bakewell , Moulden held an interest in Section 83 Hundred of Bagot near to the present suburb of Moulden . <h> Muirhead ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> Muirhead is named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Commissioner into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody , barrister , Supreme Court Judge , and Administrator .

Murrumujuk is of Aboriginal origin and relates to the Whale Dreaming . <h> N <h> Nakara ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> One of Darwin 's northern suburbs just established before Cyclone Tracy in 1974 . It derives its name from the Aboriginal tribe who occupy the coastal area of Boucaut Bay , west of the Blyth River in northern Arnhem Land . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nakara are mostly named after early residents of the Territory . <h> Narrows , The - see The Narrows <h> Nightcliff ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> Night Cliff appears on Goyder 's original plan of Port Darwin ( 1869 ) , but could have originated between Stokes ' examination of the harbour in 1839 and that time . Many people believed , incorrectly , it came from a misspelling of J G Knight 's name , but he arrived in 1873 . <p> When Nightcliff became a Town for land title purposes in 1948 , the Nomenclature Committee of the day agreed to the conjoint name Nightcliff . The new Progress Association of the 1950 's before Local Government arrived in Darwin applied the floral and shrub names to the suburbs streets . <h> Noonamah ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> The name was applied by the Army in 1941 , when the Military Board ascribed a series of names to new military depots and camps in the NT .

He died aged 86 in Adelaide on 17 September , 1950 . <h> R <h> Rapid Creek ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> Rapid Creek derives its name from the fast flowing stream in the Wet season which flows from the Marrara Swamp to the sea at Casuarina Beach . It was first settled by the Jesuit Mission under Father Strele , but was abandoned before the turn of the century . After Nightcliff expanded as a seaside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rapid Creek . <p> Rapid Creek prior to the war was a favourite day trip / picnic area for Darwin people , along the bush track which was to become Bagot Road and McMillans Road . <p> The streets in Rapid Creek are mostly named after Police Officers . <h> Rosebery ( Suburb ) Palmerston <p> This suburb is named after the Fifth Earl of Rosebery who was born in London as Archibald Philip Primrose and was to become a British statesman including the Prime Minister of Britain . <p> It was during his overseas visit in 1884 that the South Australian Government decided to name additional Counties in the Top End . After the initial group of Palmerston , Gladstone and Disraeli , the County of Rosebery was gazetted in 1885 , together with the County of Malmesbury . Rosebery covered the area north of Pine Creek with Malmesbury being to the west over the Daly River area . <p> The Place Names Committee in conjunction with the Palmerston Development Authority decided to perpetuate the Rosebery name as the County of Rosebery fell into disuse and was cancelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Coomalie <p> The jungle and adjoining land gained its name from an incident around March 1873 , when John Lewiss teamsters , whilst carting stores from Southport , a small port town across the harbour from Palmerston ( now Darwin ) , to the mining fields around Pine Creek , tapped a cask of rum and delayed the team for several days . The jungle , 38 kilometres south of Southport was used as a teamsters camp because of the availability of good spring water and grass . The name Rum Jungle has been used since 1873 with the reporting of the death of Patrick Flynn at Rum Jungle . David Lithgow built and opened a hotel on a rise overlooking the creek and jungle in 1874 and with the construction of the railway from Palmerston ( Port Darwin ) to Pine Creek in the late 1880s , a gangers camp was established nearby . By 1890 the hotel ceased to be licensed and by the early 1900s all that existed to remind travellers of the existence of the hotel were footings and the rubbish dump . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of uranium in Australia . Mr Jack White , a local Batchelor prospector and farmer , having viewed a BMR brochure on radioactive minerals reported the occurrence of uraniferous minerals in August 1949 .

The bay was named because of its shallowness . <h> Southport ( Locality ) Town of Southport Litchfield <p> This locality is based on the Town of Southport . During Goyders Survey of Port Darwin and Environs in 1869 , four small satellite towns were surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these satellite towns was pegged at the junction of the Blackmore and the Darwin Rivers and soon became the commencement point for overlanders to the Pine Creek goldfields . When , in 1885 , the rail link between Palmerston and Pine Creek bypassed the town on a more direct route , Southport slowly declined in status . Wells , floor slabs and other relics are all that remain from the once prosperous town which was larger than Palmerston . The old Cemetery contains some 60 people who died at Southport during those early years . Only in recent years have people again begun to reside on the freehold lots of this old historic Townsite . <h> Stapleton ( Locality ) Coomalie <p> This locality takes its name from the Stapleton Creek which was named by Surveyor G McMinn after James L Stapleton , a field operator during the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line and later Officer in Charge of the Port Darwin Telegraph Station , during 1871 .

He was Premier in 1868 to 1870 and contributed greatly to the events of this period which led to the Overland Telegraph Construction for the Colony . Goyder felt that his work as Premier and Attorney General earned him a name in the " Hundred of Strangways " in the Northern Territory . The Hundred stretches from the Stuart Highway south to Girraween . <h> Stuart Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of Parap after the Army had left in 1946 and a number of Sidney William hutments remained . The Parap Parish Hall between Westralia Street and Charles Street existed in 1949 , but was not named until 1954 . When Administrator Driver was making the first moves towards local government , local Progress Associations were set up , including Stuart Park in 1950 . It is believed that the park or camp area , formerly part of Parap , got its name as a separate unit from the park/camp area near the Stuart Highway which in turn is named after McDouall Stuart . <h> T <h> The Gardens ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> This suburban name is derived from the Botanic Gardens which began with the appointment of Maurice Holtze as the Curator in 1878 and has grown to have one of the largest known collections of palms .

It is the aboriginal word used for the people of Melville and Bathurst Islands which lie some 50Km to the north of Darwin . <p> Bathurst and Melville Islands are known collectively as the Tiwi Islands . <p> Tiwi simply means " people " being the plural form of the islander 's word for an island man ( Tini ) and women ( Tinga ) . <p> The streets in Tiwi are mostly named after pastoral stations . <h> Tortilla Flats ( Locality ) Coomalie <p> The Tortilla Flats locality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The origin is derived from John Steinbecks book Tortilla Flats , 1963 , as it was thought at the time Steinbecks characters were matched by those working on the farm . <p> The Experimental Farm commenced in 1958 with the view to cattle rotation , rice and pasture growing experiments . The farm was sold at auction in 1990 . <h> Tumbling Waters ( Locality ) Litchfield <p> The locality derives its name from the town which was named after the rapids " Tumbling Waters " where Mr R C Burton discovered gold in 1869 whilst prospecting for minerals on behalf of Goyder .

The townsite was located on the Elizabeth River . These two names appear on Goyder 's plan the Survey of Port Darwin and Environs , but their origin is obscure . It is believed that only one title was issued on the waterfront in this area . Many of the original street names have been applied toroads in the area and Virginia Road now gives access to the main freehold blocks surveyed by McLachlan in 1869 . Virginia has been used as a name for the area since the 1870s , following the subdivision of the original sections . <h> W <h> Wagaman ( Suburb ) Darwin <p> One of Darwin 's northern suburbs built before Cyclone Tracy struck in 1974 .

This is distinct from the standard of proof that is required .

Others use the words " is reasonably likely to " .

Please refer to the NT Archives Service standards and advice . <p> Disposal freezes Records subject to a current disposal freeze generally relate to groups of records relating to a particular topic or event that has gained prominence or provokes controversy . While the freeze is in place , no records relating to the topic or event can be destroyed . For more information please refer to the NT Archives service advice on Records Disposal Freezes . <p> Please note : It is an offence to delete or otherwise dispose of a record as stated in Division 5 , s145 of the Information Act - Mishandling records . <h> Authority <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information Services ( NT Records Service ) under s 131A(c) of the Information Act . <h> Legal and regulatory framework <p> the Records Management Standards for Public Sector Organisations in the Northern Territory . <h> Acknowledgement <p> The NT Records Service wishes to acknowledge the use of material produced by Queensland State Archives , State Records Authority NSW , National Archives of Australia , Public Records Office of Victoria and the NT Archives Service . <p> The most common method used to determine the retention or destruction of records is the records disposal schedule process . This involves a thorough and systematic analysis of the business activity of an organisation and an assessment of the records that are produced as a result of that activity . A records disposal schedule is then produced which permits a public sector organisation to retain or destroy its records in accordance with the Information Act . <p> Records retention decisions must be based on : <p> the current and future business needs of the organisation <p> compliance with legal and governance requirements of the organisation <p> the current and future needs of internal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's records/information manager should be aware of the existence of records disposal schedules that apply to the organisation 's records . <h> Sentencing <p> Sentencing is the process of applying the provisions of a records disposal schedule to an organisation 's records by determining the part of a records disposal schedule that applies to an individual record and assigning a retention period consistent with that part . <p> When records have been sentenced as temporary , in accordance with an approved records disposal schedule , there is a set minimum retention period for which they must be retained . <p> Please note : if this step is not initiated by the records manager/information manager , ensure they are aware that records are being evaluated and sentenced so the decisions made can be checked . <h> Use of external consultants <p> There are a number of issues an organisation needs to consider when engaging a contractor to perform the records sentencing process . <p> Implementation of the provisions of a disposal schedule ( sentencing records for destruction or retention ) needs to be systematic , planned and documented . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good understanding of the business to which the schedule relates . <p> NT public sector organisations must adhere to the requirements of this standard . Organisations must ensure all staff are aware of the provisions of this standard , and adhere to them in the normal conduct of business . Organisations must also ensure security provisions are incorporated in contracts with contractors to ensure compliance with the Information Privacy Principles . <p> In general , contractors will need to be adequately supervised by a person in the organisation with sufficient knowledge of the organisation 's functions to be able to provide guidance in the sentencing process . There will be a lot of consultation involved and this person will need to coordinate all the queries which will arise and know who in the organisation has the functional knowledge and authority to advise the contractor . They will also need to quality assure the sentencer 's work , and it is recommended they examine every fifth record sentenced . <h> Secure destruction of records <p> Records must always be destroyed securely , with commensurate level of security that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records should be performed by an officer of the agency or by an authorised contractor if destruction has been contracted out . <h> Sensitive records <p> Sensitive records contain information which , if released , could have a detrimental effect on people or organisations . Information that may be regarded as sensitive can fall into a number of categories : <h> Methods of destruction <p> In keeping with today 's environmental practices , all records should be destroyed in an environmentally friendly manner whenever possible . <h> Paper <p> Paper records should be shredded and pulped . Security provided by shredding is dependent on how the paper is treated afterward . Shredded paper should then be pulped as modern technology allows reconstruction of shredded paper . <h> Electronic records <p> Public sector organisations should ensure electronic media that contains records in electronic formats are properly destroyed after the expiration of their minimum retention periods . Processes should be enacted to ensure that the information contained on the media is effectively irretrievable . <p> Please note : destruction of media should follow the NT Governmentstandard . For information on destroying digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government ICT Standard - Media Destruction . A copy of this standard can be obtained from the contact details below . <h> Destruction services <p> If utilising a destruction service through a commercial arrangement , the public sector organisation responsible for the records should ensure that all documents/records are securely stored and transported to the destruction site . A certificate of destruction is required from the service provider and retained permanently by the public sector organisation for accountability purposes . <p> The following methods do not meet all the destruction objectives and should not be used as a means of record destruction . <p> Deletion : Simply deleting records from a hard drive or USB device does not permanently erase them and they can easily be restored for some time after deletion . <p> Dumping : Dumping of records does not result in their destruction and security can be easily comprised . <p> Burying : Records can be uncovered within hours of burying , thus security can not be assured . <h> Documenting the destruction of records in an organisation 's control system <p> The Records Management Standard for Disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sector organisation 's records needs to be clearly documented and captured in the metadata in the corporate records management system . <p> Evidence of the destruction of records must be retained permanently by the organisation . At a minimum this must include : <p> unique record identifier <p> the number and version of the approved disposal schedule <p> class reference ( for example , destroy five years after action completed ) <p> date of disposal <p> authorising officer . <p> Public sector organisations should keep a destruction register that links individual records destroyed with consignments sent for destruction . Should the destruction be performed by a contractor or service provider , this will strengthen the evidence that records have actually been destroyed . <p> The certificate of destruction should be contained on a file together with all other destruction documentation . The destruction certification should note : <p> description of records <p> date of destruction <p> method of destruction <p> individual performing/supervising destruction . <p> Please note : NT public sector organisations are not required to notify the NT Records Service if the record is destroyed in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short Term Value ( excluding class 1.10.1 ) . <p> corporate records management systems correctly apply disposal actions as specified in approved Records Disposal Schedules and these decisions are reviewed by a qualified or experienced person before any destruction takes place <p> staff carrying out sentencing activities have adequate training , especially in compliance with the principles of consistency and objectivity <p> all sentencing decisions are recorded by the agency , the fate of every record is recorded , and the records detailing record history are retained permanently . <h> Forward documentation to the records service <p> Following destruction of records a public sector organisation is required to notify the NT Records Service .

The Chief Minister asked the Inquiry to investigate concerns about serious child sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities . The Inquiry was established to find better ways to protect Aboriginal children from sexual abuse . <p> What the Inquiry was asked to do The Inquiry looked at the problem of sexual abuse within Aboriginal communities and possible solutions . Rex Wild QC and Pat Anderson co-chaired the Inquiry , assisted by a small team of staff . Rex is a former Northern Territory Director of Public Prosecutions and senior lawyer . Pat is an Alyawarr woman who is well known as a strong supporter of disadvantaged people and has many years experience working with Aboriginal people , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> study how and why Aboriginal children were being abused , focusing on unreported cases <p> identify problems with the way the government responds to and attempts to protect Aboriginal children from abuse <p> look at how government departments and other agencies can better work together to protect and help children <p> look into how the government can better support and educate Aboriginal communities to prevent child sexual abuse . <p> In cases of sexual abuse , the child is often removed from the community ( to be taken to a place of safety or to be interviewed ) . This can lead to the child believing they have done something wrong , and make families reluctant to report as it is the child who is removed rather than the alleged perpetrator . From a submission to the Inquiry <p> How the Inquiry worked The Inquiry collected information by listening , learning and drawing on existing knowledge to find better ways to protect Aboriginal children and support their families . Handling such a sensitive issue was challenging for the Board , so they created settings where people felt safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territory , the Inquiry gathered feedback from more than 260 meetings with individuals , agencies and organisations , and visited 45 communities to talk with local people . The Inquiry received 65 written submissions . <p> An Expert Reference Group was appointed to assist the Inquiry . The Reference Group was an important resource to the Inquiry , offering valuable advice and support . <p> What the Inquiry learned The Inquiry gathered and reviewed a vast amount of information that was shaped into 97 recommendations for the Chief Minister . Underlying the Inquirys findings was the common view that sexual abuse of Aboriginal children is happening largely because of the breakdown of Aboriginal culture and society . <p> Important points made by the Inquiry included : <p> Child sexual abuse is serious , widespread and often unreported . <p> Most Aboriginal people are willing and committed to solving problems and helping their children . They are also eager to better educate themselves . <p> Aboriginal people are not the only victims and not the only perpetrators of sexual abuse . <p> Much of the violence and sexual abuse occurring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing social problems which have developed over many decades . <p> The combined effects of poor health , alcohol and drug abuse , unemployment , gambling , pornography , poor education and housing , and a general loss of identity and control have contributed to violence and to sexual abuse in many forms . <p> Existing government programs to help Aboriginal people break the cycle of poverty and violence need to work better . There is not enough coordination and communication between government departments and agencies , and this is causing a breakdown in services and poor crisis intervention . Improvements in health and social services are desperately needed . <p> Programs need to have enough funds and resources and be a long-term commitment . <p> It is impossible to set communities on the path to recovery from the sexual abuse of children without dealing with the basic services and social ills . It is our hope that no Aboriginal child born from this year on will ever suffer sexual abuse . Rex Wild QC and Pat Anderson , Inquiry Co-Chairs <p> What the Inquiry recommended Child sexual abuse is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated and collective action from the entire community . The Inquirys recommendations are intended to offer advice to the Government on how it can best support and empower communities to prevent child sexual abuse now and in the future . Many opportunities for significant change have been put forward . The Board highlighted a number of action areas which hold the key to success . <p> Education Education is the key to helping children and communities foster safe , well adjusted families . School is the way to keep future generations of Aboriginal children safe . Getting children to school every day is essential because : <p> children are safe when they are at school <p> school is a venue for educating children about child sexual abuse and protective behaviours <p> education provides opportunity , empowerment and achievement and offers a way to overcome the social and economic problems which contribute to violence <p> children can confide in their teachers . <p> The Inquiry urged the government to improve Aboriginal education systems , including local language development , to make education more effective for Aboriginal children . <p> A range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about : <p> child sexual abuse and what to do about it <p> mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse <p> the impact of alcohol , pornography and gambling on communities , families and children <p> the value of education , and encouraging a culture of parental and community commitment to sending children to school . <p> Alcohol Alcohol remains the gravest and fastest growing threat to the safety of Aboriginal children . There is a strong association between alcohol abuse , violence and the sexual abuse of children . Alcohol is destroying communities . The Inquiry recommended urgent action be taken to reduce alcohol consumption in Aboriginal communities . <p> Family and Community Services ( FACS ) and the Police Both need to work more closely with each other and with communities . It is important FACS and the Police build the trust of communities so everyone can work together to combat child sexual abuse . The Inquiry has also proposed an Advice Hotline so anyone who is concerned about possible child sexual abuse can call someone for confidential information and advice . <p> Family support services Family support services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this will help to strengthen families and keep children safe and healthy . <p> Empowerment of Aboriginal communities Communities can take more control and make decisions about the future . The Inquirys report suggests ways in which this can happen including the role which men and women can play , the introduction of community justice groups and better dialogue between mainstream society and Aboriginal communities . <p> Commissioner for Children and Young People The Inquiry recommends that the government appoint a senior , independent person who can focus on the interests and wellbeing of children and young people , review issues and report to Parliament . <p> The future There is hope for safe , happy generations of Aboriginal children provided serious attention is given to the Inquirys findings and appropriate steps are taken to help communities .

While scanning of records produces obvious business benefits , it is important agencies recognise the record keeping issues that result from scanning records . <p> Original hard copy records can be disposed of after scanning if the conditions detailed in the NT Government Disposal schedule for temporary records which have been digitised have been met . <h> Decision to scan <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scanning . There are a range of considerations which may affect the decision to scan hard copy records including : <p> the likely usage or retrieval rate of the records . Records that are routinely scanned typically have a high rate of retrieval , require access from more than one site , and often require rapid access <p> whether the records being considered for scanning are likely to be added to or amended in the normal course of business . Records that are likely to be changed over time may not be suitable for scanning while they are still in use <p> the period for which the records will be required for current business . Records which need only be retained for a short period , i.e. six months or less , may not be worth the expense of scanning <p> the physical attributes of the records . Some forms of records provide a challenge for the scanning process . Large format records or bound volumes may be more difficult to scan effectively because of their size . Photographs , maps and plans can pose challenges , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading to a large size for each image . Any records that are physically damaged may not survive the scanning process . <p> The decision to scan is to be based on business requirements and an information risk analysis . <p> Once a record has been scanned , the scanned record should become the record relied upon for business , with the original hard-copy being either archived or destroyed . Simultaneous use of both hardcopy originals and digital copies is not good practice and is likely to lead to error . <h> Evidentiary value of the scanned record <p> As stated in Records Management Advice No 4 " Records as evidence , there are no definable legal situations or processes that require that original documents must be released to a court of the NT . This does not mean , however , that any document that has been scanned will be admissible in a court . It is almost always up to the discretion of the court as to whether the production of original documents is required or whether a copy would suffice . <p> In order for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy it is important that the scanned format can be proved to be good evidence . This involves establishing , and being able to prove , good record keeping practices and procedures that are able to withstand possible judicial scrutiny . <p> Agencies need to ensure that all scanned images have the same degree of authenticity and integrity necessary to meet the same purpose as the original hard copy . Consideration needs to be given as to whether the scanned image can perform the same function as the hard copy , bearing in mind current and future use of the record . If not , scanning should not take place . <p> It is also crucial that the scanning process itself takes place within a framework that observes stringent quality control procedures ( see 5.3 Quality Control below ) . <p> The next step in this ' good evidence ' process is for agencies to comply with the provisions of the NT Government Records Management Standards . Records that are identified in , and produced via routine defined business processes are likely to provide better evidence of that business than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hard-copy records that have been scanned . <p> Fundamental to such compliance is the use of a compliant records management system . According to the NT Government Records Management Standards , all NT Government records should be registered into a records management system that records the standard set of information categories essential to the integrity , management and retrieval of the records . This will satisfy certain evidential requirements of the records in question by guaranteeing that business rules exist for their management with regard to : <p> capturing records <p> allocating a unique identifier <p> application of standard classification terms <p> security of the records <p> managing and recording access to the records <p> managing the records ' disposal process . <p> If a scanned record is captured into a records management system , the above rules will go some way to being able to prove that it is ' good evidence ' and be admissible in court . For this reason , it is essential that scanned records are captured into an electronic document and records management system . The ability of an EDRM to prove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access history is essential so that the integrity of a record can be verified in situations where they are required to be produced as evidence . <h> Disposing of hard copy following scanning <p> Regardless of the evidentiary value of a scanned image in court , there are legal implications for the destruction of NT Government records . Destruction of original hard copies should not be in breach any legislative or regulatory requirements to retain the originals . If in doubt , seek legal advice . <p> The hard-copy originals can be destroyed if all conditions under the Disposal Schedule for Temporary Records that have been digitised have been met ( 1 ) . There are several categories of original documents that , even when scanned , are not able to be destroyed under this schedule . These are summarised below : <p> original contracts under seal , Powers of Attorney , public documents , charters , testimonials and intergovernmental agreements or treaties <p> documents of a legislative or administrative character , including written regulations , rules , by-laws , orders , determinations , proclamations and awards <p> documents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an Act <p> original artworks , photos , maps , illustrations and drawings are not to be destroyed but transferred to the NT Archives for assessment as state archives <p> no original records to be destroyed if legal action current , pending or likely or if an FOI application has been lodged <p> hard-copy originals must be kept for records that have no approved retention schedule authorising destruction <p> hard-copy originals of records assessed for permanent retention can not be destroyed if a decision to scan them is made . The hard copy will ultimately be transferred to the NT Archives Service ( 2 ) <p> records created prior to 1 July 1978 ( self-government ) are not to be destroyed after digitisation , but referred to the NT Archives Service for appraisal ( 3 ) . <p> Under s 145 of the Information Act ( the Act ) , it is an offence for a person to abandon or delete or otherwise dispose of a record unless done in compliance with a relevant practice or procedure , a relevant standard or otherwise in compliance with an Act or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the Act is to dispose of records in accordance with an authorised records disposal schedule . <p> Originals should be retained until all quality control checks have been made and any required re-scanning carried out . A minimum period of three months is required under the schedule ( provided all quality checks have been performed within this period ) , however , legal or business needs may require retention for a longer period . The investigation of fraud , in particular , may require the retention of original signed documents . Fingerprints are also obtained only from original documents . <p> The imaged version becomes the de facto of the original and must be managed accordingly . For record classes of temporary value that have an approved retention schedule , the scanned image needs to be managed for the full period of retention as specified on the applicable schedule . This may require the periodic migration of images from both hardware and software platforms that have been superseded to current platforms to keep the records accessible and readable . <h> Document scanning procedures <p> This section outlines factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality control measures that surround it . ( 4 ) <h> Process summary <p> The process of digitisation must be authorised and documented . Standard written workplace procedures on the scanning process are required . The scanning process should form part of a defined business process with scanned records always being created at the same point in the process and being handled and maintained in the same way . <p> Staff engaged in the digitisation process must be trained and familiar with procedures . <p> Procedures must include measures to verify that the image copies are accurate and complete reproductions of the originals . <p> Standard image formats should be used . Suitability of image format should be verified by testing with samples sets of target documents against quality criteria . <p> System documentation , including testing documentation and logs , should be retained in a compliant electronic document and records management system ( EDRM ) . <h> Document preparation <p> Some preparation of documents prior to scanning will be required and will vary with the nature of documents to be scanned . Typically , preparation includes the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation of documents prior to loading the scanner . Document preparation procedures should in no way impair the capture of information from the document . <p> If batching of documents is part of procedure , batches should be in record class groups that have the same retention periods . In particular , do not mix any permanent originals with batches of temporary records . Batches should be clearly identified and retained in their batches to allow for retrieval of original record if required . <p> A system of management for scanned originals must be in place to facilitate their retrieval and eventual disposal . <h> Quality control <p> The scanned record needs to be a complete and accurate reproduction of the hard copy . <p> If there is a risk of litigation it may be necessary to certify each and every scanned record as a true copy with an additional certification process . <p> To ensure correct operation of digitisation equipment , the equipment should be regularly tested . Test target images should be captured into the EDRM as both proof of testing regime and correct operation of equipment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should follow manufacturers ' recommendations . <p> A sample set of documents representing the document types to be scanned in production should be assembled to evaluate and refine scanner settings . Examples of poor quality documents should be included in this sample set . <p> Visual inspection of 100% of scanned images for image quality is recommended . Inspection of a set proportion of scanned images is also acceptable , though should be no less than 5% . Visual inspection must be a part of any quality assurance process for digitised records . <p> The object of digitisation is to render a true and accurate copy of the original record . Following the digitisation process digitised images should be checked for : <p> image resolution check all text and detail on the image is legible , in particular fine or small size text , punctuation and decimal points <p> Clear and properly oriented images will also aid in any Optical Character Recognition ( OCR ) processes that may be applied to the scanned image . <p> Once the digitised representation , or image , of the original has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually the next step in the process . The procedure for the capture of images into the EDRM should be documented . <p> This may be batch-wide via an import process , or individually on a document by document basis . In all cases a check to ensure all images have been loaded and that all relevant metadata has been captured must be made . <p> Any system log files , in the case of batch imports , should be captured into the EDRM as proof of successful loading of documents . Once captured into EDRM , images will then be subject to system audit logging processes . <h> Digitisation specifications for temporary records <p> Standard image formats should be selected and documented for use with particular record classes . A number of recommended technical specifications for image formats can be found in the references listed at the end of this advice . ( 5 ) <p> Sample sets of documents should always be test scanned as part of the process to develop and verify technical specifications . Resulting images must be an accurate and complete representation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image is carried out , the test batches should be subjected to this further processing also . The accuracy of OCR processes is never 100% . However , images with sufficient resolution and correct orientation will improve the performance of OCR software .

@@72309508 @1009508/ <h> Privacy <h> Overview <p> The Privacy scheme in the NT Information Act is about making sure that NT public sector organisations respect your privacy when they collect or handle personal information about you . <p> The rules for protecting your privacy are set out in 10 Information Privacy Principles ( IPPs ) that appear in the Schedule at the end of the Information Act . The requirements of the IPPs can be divided into four categories : <p> The Information Act recognises that it is often necessary to find a balance between the privacy interests of the person whose information is collected or handled and the legitimate interests of good government and other people . <p> The IPPs set out general rules for organisations to apply . But those rules are subject to qualifications and exceptions that recognise those other interests . <p> Examples of those qualifications and exceptions are : <p> IPP 1.4 requires that information about a person only be collected from that person , so long as that is reasonable and practicable . This recognises that there can be cases where obtaining information directly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might prejudice a covert police operation . <p> IPP 2.1 prohibits use and disclosure of information for a purpose other than the purpose it was collected for , but then sets out a number of exceptions . This recognises that it can be in the public interest to use or disclose information that was originally collected for one purpose for other purposes , for example , for law enforcement purposes . <p> IPP 6.1 provides a general right of access by an individual to his or her personal information . But it also lists cases in which access to particular information can be refused , eg. , if providing access would unreasonably interfere with the privacy of another person . <p> Sections 69-71 of the Information Act provide for exclusion or variation from the IPPs in relation to some functions , including court proceedings , law enforcement activities and research ( see the Special rules for some information and organisations page for more ) . <h> Information Privacy Principles <p> Collection ( IPPs 1 , 7 , 8 , 10 ) <p> Personal information about you- <p> can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation ; <p> must be collected in a lawful , fair and not unreasonably intrusive way ; <p> must be collected from you , if that is reasonable and practicable . <p> There are special limits on collection of sensitive information , identifying information and unique identifying codes ( eg. , driver 's licence numbers ) . <p> Use and Disclosure ( IPPs 2 , 7 , 9 ) <p> Personal information can be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected . The IPPs limit the other purposes ( secondary purposes ) for which personal information can be used or disclosed within the organisation or outside the organisation . Use or disclosure for secondary purposes is allowed- <p> if you consent ; <p> if it is required or authorised by law ; <p> for some purposes related to the primary purpose <p> for some law enforcement and health and safety purposes . <p> There are also limits on transferring information outside the Territory and on use and disclosure of unique identifying codes ( eg. , driver 's licence numbers ) . <p> Management ( IPPs 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to - <p> ensure that personal information is accurate , complete and up to date ; <p> protect personal information from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access , modification or disclosure ; <p> destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed for any purpose . <p> Openness ( IPPs 1 , 5 and 6 ) <p> Each organisation must- <p> make available to you on request its privacy policies and details about personal information held by it ; <p> take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of certain information at the time your personal information is collected ( eg. , the purpose for collection ) ; <p> allow you to seek access to your personal information ; <p> allow you to seek correction of inaccurate , incomplete or out-of-date information . <p> If you want to complain about a breach of privacy , obtain information , or you are concerned about why or how your information has been collected or handled , you should contact the organisation concerned . <p> If you have trouble contacting the right person in the organisation , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happen after 1 July 2004 , you will be able to complain to the Information Commissioner about a breach of the IPPs or other interference with your privacy , so long as you have requested the organisation to take action and you have not received a satisfactory response . <p> The Information Act does not apply to Commonwealth agencies or private organisations . There is a Commonwealth Privacy scheme that applies to Commonwealth government agencies and some private businesses . You can contact the agency or business concerned , or the Federal Privacy Commissioner to see whether they are covered by a Privacy scheme . <p> The website of the Privacy Victoria has a lot of useful information .

@@72309514 @1009514/ <h> Standard 5 Disposal <p> Records must be disposed of systematically and accountably . <h> Policy statement <p> NT public sector organisations must dispose of records in accordance with the provisions of the Information Act and be able to prove such action has been performed with due regard to the business , legal and governance requirements as well as community expectations toward the retention and disposal of records . <h> Explanation <p> The Information Act provides that a public sector organisation must not dispose of a record unless it is done in compliance with a relevant practice , procedure , standard , or in accordance with legislation or a court order . ( 37 ) <p> Although there are many pieces of legislation that require records to be created , there are few that actually stipulate the length of time a record needs to be retained before it can be destroyed . A few exceptions include : <p> taxation legislation , which requires that generally , records need to be retained for five years ( 38 ) <p> the Workplace Relations Act , which states that employers must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ( 39 ) <p> the Workplace Health and Safety Regulations , which state an employer shall maintain a record of certain information for not less than 30 years . ( 40 ) <h> Records disposal schedules <p> The most common method used to determine the retention or destruction of records is the records disposal schedule process . This involves a thorough and systematic analysis of the business activity of an organisation and an assessment of the records produced as a result of that activity . A records disposal schedule is then produced that permits a public sector organisation to retain or destroy its records in accordance with the Information Act . ( 41 ) <p> Records retention decisions must be based on : <p> the current and future business needs of the organisation <p> compliance with legal and governance requirements of the organisation <p> the current and future needs of internal and external stakeholders , including the wider community . ( 42 ) <p> The schedules are approved by the chief executive officer of the public sector organisation responsible for the function to which the schedule relates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archives service . <h> Implementation advice <p> The records disposal schedule process involves in-depth consultation between business unit managers and records managers from public sector organisations . The records service provides advice and assistance on the development and implementation of records disposal schedules . <p> Implementation of the provisions of a disposal schedule ( sentencing records for destruction or retention ) needs to be systematic , planned and documented .
