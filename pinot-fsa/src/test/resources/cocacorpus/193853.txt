All surgery carries some uncertainty and risk <p> Over the years , factors such as pregnancy , nursing , and the force of gravity take their toll on a woman 's breasts . As the skin loses its elasticity , the breasts often lose their shape and firmness and begin to sag . Breast lift , or mastopexy , is a surgical procedure to raise and reshape sagging breasts " at least , for a time . ( No surgery can permanently delay the effects of gravity . ) Mastopexy can also reduce the size of the areola , the darker skin surrounding the nipple .

Before you decide to have surgery , think carefully about your expectations and discuss them with your surgeon . <p> The best candidates for mastopexy are healthy , emotionally stable women who are realistic about what the surgery can accomplish .

However , if you 're planning to have more children , it may be a good idea to postpone your breast lift . While there are no special risks that affect future pregnancies ( for example , mastopexy usually does n't interfere with breast-feeding ) , pregnancy is likely to stretch your breasts again and offset the results of the procedure . <h> All Surgery Carries Some Uncertainty and Risk <p> A breast lift is not a simple operation , but it 's normally safe when performed by a qualified plastic surgeon . Nevertheless , as with any surgery , there is always a possibility of complications or a reaction to the anesthesia . Bleeding and infection following a breast lift are uncommon , but they can cause scars to widen . You can reduce your risks by closely following your physician 's advice both before and after surgery . <p> Mastopexy does leave noticeable , permanent scars , although they 'll be covered by your bra or bathing suit . ( Poor healing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure can also leave you with unevenly positioned nipples , or a permanent loss of feeling in your nipples or breasts . <h> Planning Your Surgery <p> Skin formerly located above the nipple is brought down and together to reshape the breast .

Every patient " and every physician , as well " has a different view of what is a desirable size and shape for breasts . <p> The surgeon will examine your breasts and measure them while you 're sitting or standing . He or she will discuss the variables that may affect the procedure " such as your age , the size and shape of your breasts , and the condition of your skin " and whether an implant is advisable . You should also discuss where the nipple and areola will be positioned ; they 'll be moved higher during the procedure , and should be approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon should describe the procedure in detail , explaining its risks and limitations and making sure you understand the scarring that will result .

You 'll also get specific instructions on how to prepare for surgery , including guidelines on eating and drinking , smoking , and taking or avoiding certain vitamins and medications . <p> While you 're making preparations , be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home after your surgery and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Where Your Surgery Will Be Performed <p> Your breast lift may be performed in a hospital , an outpatient surgery center , or a surgeon 's office-based facility . It 's usually done on an outpatient basis , for cost containment and convenience . If you 're admitted to the hospital as an inpatient , you can expect to stay one or two days . <h> Types of Anesthesia <p> Breast lifts are usually performed under general anesthesia , which means you 'll sleep through the operation . In selected patients " particularly when a smaller incision is being made " the surgeon may use local anesthesia , combined with a sedative to make you drowsy . You 'll be awake but relaxed , and will feel minimal discomfort . <h> The Surgery <p> Mastopexy usually takes one and a half to three and a half hours . Techniques vary , but the most common procedure involves an anchor-shaped incision following the natural contour of the breast . <p> The incision outlines the area from which breast skin will be removed and defines the new location for the nipple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipple and areola are moved to the higher position . The skin surrounding the areola is then brought down and together to reshape the breast . Stitches are usually located around the areola , in a vertical line extending downwards from the nipple area , and along the lower crease of the breast . <p> Some patients , especially those with relatively small breasts and minimal sagging , may be candidates for modified procedures requiring less extensive incisions . One such procedure is the doughnut ( or concentric ) mastopexy , in which circular incisions are made around the areola , and a doughnut-shaped area of skin is removed . <p> If you 're having an implant inserted along with your breast lift , it will be placed in a pocket directly under the breast tissue , or deeper , under the muscle of the chest wall . <h> After Your Surgery <p> After surgery , you 'll wear an elastic bandage or a surgical bra over gauze dressings . Your breasts will be bruised , swollen , and uncomfortable for a day or two , but the pain should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relieved with medications prescribed by your surgeon . <p> Within a few days , the bandages or surgical bra will be replaced by a soft support bra . You 'll need to wear this bra around the clock for three to four weeks , over a layer of gauze . The stitches will be removed after a week or two . <p> If your breast skin is very dry following surgery , you can apply a moisturizer several times a day . Be careful not to tug at your skin in the process , and keep the moisturizer away from the suture areas . <p> You can expect some loss of feeling in your nipples and breast skin , caused by the swelling after surgery . This numbness usually fades as the swelling subsides over the next six weeks or so . In some patients , however , it may last a year or more , and occasionally it may be permanent . <h> Getting Back to Normal <p> Healing is a gradual process . Although you may be up and about in a day or two , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , depending on how you feel . And avoid lifting anything over your head for three to four weeks .

You may be instructed to avoid sex for a week or more , and to avoid strenuous sports for about a month . After that , you can resume these activities slowly . If you become pregnant , the operation should not affect your ability to breast-feed , since your milk ducts and nipples will be left intact . <h> Your New Look <p> Your surgeon will make every effort to make your scars as inconspicuous as possible . Still , it 's important to remember that mastopexy scars are extensive and permanent . They often remain lumpy and red for months , then gradually become less obvious , sometimes eventually fading to thin white lines .

If you 're physically healthy and realistic in your expectations , you may be a good candidate . <h> Types of Implants <p> The choice of implant filler , implant size , shape and other features will be determined based on your breast anatomy , body type , and your desired increase in size . Your lifestyle , goals , and personal preferences , as well your plastic surgeon 's recommendations and sound surgical judgment , are also determining factors . Implant manufacturers occasionally introduce new styles and types of implants , and therefore there may be additional options available to you . <p> Breast implants are medical devices with a solid silicone , rubber shell . The implant shell may be filled with either saline solution ( sterile salt water ) or elastic silicone gel . Both saline and silicone gel breast implants are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Approval means that an implant has been rigorously researched and tested , and reviewed by an independent panel of physicians for safety . <p> The size of a breast implant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of the saline or silicone filler .

Saline or silicone implants may be recommended at a younger age if used for reconstruction purposes . <p> You should be aware that breast implants are not guaranteed to last a lifetime and future surgery may be required to replace one or both implants . Regular examinations for breast health and to evaluate the condition of your implants are important whether you have chosen saline or silicone breast implants . <p> The breast implant may be inserted directly under the breast tissue or beneath the chest wall muscle . <h> All Surgery Carries Some Uncertainty and Risk <p> Breast augmentation is relatively straightforward . But as with any operation , there are risks associated with surgery and specific complications associated with this procedure . <p> The most common problem , capsular contracture , occurs if the scar or capsule around the implant begins to tighten . This squeezing of the soft implant can cause the breast to feel hard . Capsular contracture can be treated in several ways , and sometimes requires either removal or " scoring " of the scar tissue , or perhaps removal or replacement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive bleeding following the operation may cause some swelling and pain . If excessive bleeding continues , another operation may be needed to control the bleeding and remove the accumulated blood . <p> A small percentage of women develop an infection around an implant . This may occur at any time , but is most often seen within a week after surgery . In some cases , the implant may need to be removed for several months until the infection clears . A new implant can then be inserted . <p> Some women report that their nipples become oversensitive , under sensitive , or even numb . You may also notice small patches of numbness near your incisions . These symptoms usually disappear within time , but may be permanent in some patients . <p> Breast implants do not generally interfere with a woman 's ability to breast feed , or present a health hazard during pregnancy to a woman or her baby . However , pregnancy and the associated changes to a woman 's body may alter the results of any breast surgery , including surgery to place breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options of breast implant surgery with your plastic surgeon if you are interested in becoming pregnant and breast feeding in the future . <p> Occasionally , breast implants may break or leak . Rupture can occur as a result of injury or even from the normal compression and movement of your breast and implant , causing the man-made shell to leak . <p> After surgery , breasts appear fuller and more natural in tone and contour . Scars will fade with time . <p> If a saline-filled implant breaks , the implant will deflate in a few hours and the salt water will be absorbed and naturally expelled by the body . <p> If a silicone-gel filled implant leaks or breaks , the elastic silicone gel may remain within the implant shell , or may escape into the breast implant pocket ( a capsule of tissue that surrounds the implant ) . A leaking implant filled with silicone gel may not deflate and may not be noticeable except through imaging techniques such as an MRI . For this reason , a woman with silicone breast implants is advised to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning well . An ultrasound exam or MRI screening can assess the condition of breast implants ; after 3 years it is recommended that all silicone implants be properly screened . <p> Following the placement of breast implants mammography is technically more difficult . Obtaining the best possible results requires specialized techniques and additional views . You must be candid about your implants when undergoing any diagnostic breast exam . In many cases , an ultrasound exam or MRI may be recommended in addition to mammography . <p> While the majority of women do not experience these complications , you should discuss each of them with your physician to make sure you understand the risks and consequences of breast augmentation . <h> Planning Your Surgery <p> In your initial consultation , your surgeon will evaluate your health and explain which surgical techniques are most appropriate for you , based on the condition of your breasts and skin tone . If your breasts are sagging , your doctor may also recommend a breast lift . <p> Be sure to discuss your expectations frankly with your surgeon . He or she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risks and limitations of each .

Be sure to tell your surgeon if you smoke , and if you 're taking any medications , vitamins , or other drugs . <p> Your surgeon should also explain the type of anesthesia to be used , the type of facility where the surgery will be performed , and the costs involved . Because most insurance companies do not consider breast augmentation to be medically necessary , carriers generally do not cover the cost of this procedure . <h> Preparing for Your Surgery <p> Your surgeon will give you instructions to prepare for surgery , including guidelines on eating and drinking , smoking , and taking or avoiding certain vitamins and medications . A mammogram may be recommended prior to your procedure to ensure breast health and serve as a baseline for future comparison . <p> In addition to explaining your surgical procedure , you plastic surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a patient . You will also discuss where your procedure will be performed . You will be asked to sign consent forms to ensure that you fully understand the procedure you will undergo and any risks and potential complications of your surgery . There may be a waiting period of several days or weeks from the time of your consent to the day of surgery . <p> While making preparations , be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home after your surgery and to help you out for a few days , if needed . <h> Where Your Surgery Will Be Performed <p> Your surgeon may prefer to perform the operation in an office facility , a freestanding surgery center , or a hospital outpatient facility . Occasionally , the surgery may be done as an inpatient in a hospital , in which case you can plan on staying for a day or two . <h> Types of Anesthesia <p> Breast augmentation can be performed with a general anesthesia , so you 'll sleep through the entire operation . Some surgeons may use a local anesthesia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be relaxed but awake , and may feel some discomfort . <h> The Surgery <p> The method of inserting and positioning your implant will depend on your anatomy and your surgeon 's recommendation . The incision can be made either in the crease where the breast meets the chest , around the areola ( the dark skin surrounding the nipple ) , or in the armpit . In addition , a saline implant may be placed through an incision at the navel . Every effort will be made to assure that the incision is placed so resulting scars will be as inconspicuous as possible . <p> Working through the incision , the surgeon will lift your breast tissue and skin to create a pocket , either directly behind the breast tissue ( submammary or subglandular placement ) or beneath the pectoral muscle and on top of the chest wall ( submuscular placement ) . Once the implant is positioned within this pocket , the incisions are closed with sutures , skin adhesive , and/or surgical tape . A gauze bandage may be applied over your breasts to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to complete . You 'll want to discuss the pros and cons of these alternatives with your doctor before surgery to make sure you fully understand the implications of the procedure he or she recommends for you . <h> After Your Surgery <p> You 're likely to feel tired and sore for a few days following your surgery , but you 'll be up and around in 24 to 48 hours . Most of your discomfort can be controlled by medication prescribed by your doctor . <p> Within several days the gauze dressings , if you have them , will be removed , and you may be given a surgical bra . You should wear it as directed by your surgeon . You may also experience a burning sensation in your nipples for about two weeks , but this will subside as bruising fades . <p> Your stitches will come out in a week to 10 days , but the swelling in your breasts may take three to five weeks to disappear . <h> Getting Back to Normal <p> You should be able to return to work within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your job . <p> Follow your surgeon 's advice on when to begin exercises and normal activities . Your breasts will probably be sensitive to direct stimulation for two to three weeks , so you should avoid much physical contact .

The procedure can dramatically reduce the appearance of a protruding abdomen . But bear in mind , it does produce a permanent scar , which , depending on the extent of the original problem and the surgery required to correct it , can extend from hip to hip . <p> If you 're considering abdominoplasty , this page will give you a basic understanding of the procedure " when it can help , how it 's performed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of your questions , since a lot depends on the individual patient and the surgeon . Please ask your surgeon about anything you do n't understand . <p> Skin is separated from the abdominal wall all the way up to the ribs . The surgeon draws underlying muscle and tissue together and stitches them , thereby narrowing the waistline and strengthening the abdominal wall . <h> The Best Candidates for Abdominoplasty <p> Abdominal skin is drawn down and excess is removed . With complete abdominoplasty , a new opening is cut for the navel . Both incisions are stitched closed . <p> The best candidates for abdominoplasty are men or women who are in relatively good shape but are bothered by a large fat deposit or loose abdominal skin that wo n't respond to diet or exercise . The surgery is particularly helpful to women who , through multiple pregnancies , have stretched their abdominal muscles and skin beyond the point where they can return to normal . Loss of skin elasticity in older patients , which frequently occurs with slight obesity , can also be improved . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postpone the surgery . Also , women who plan future pregnancies should wait , as vertical muscles in the abdomen that are tightened during surgery can separate again during pregnancy . If you have scarring from previous abdominal surgery , your doctor may recommend against abdominoplasty or may caution you that scars could be unusually prominent . <p> Abdominoplasty can enhance your appearance and your self-confidence , but it wo n't necessarily change your looks to match your ideal , or cause other people to treat you differently . Before you decide to have surgery , think carefully about your expectations and discuss them with your surgeon . <h> All Surgery Carries Some Uncertainty and Risk <p> Thousands of abdominoplasties are performed successfully each year . When done by a qualified plastic surgeon who is trained in body contouring , the results are generally quite positive . Nevertheless , there are always risks associated with surgery and specific complications associated with this procedure . <p> Post-operative complications such as infection and blood clots are rare , but can occur . Infection can be treated with drainage and antibiotics , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of blood clots by moving around as soon after the surgery as possible . <p> Poor healing , which results in conspicuous scars , may necessitate a second operation . Smokers should be advised to stop , as smoking may increase the risk of complications and delay healing . <p> You can reduce your risk of complications by closely following your surgeon 's instructions before and after the surgery , especially with regard to when and how you should resume physical activity . <h> Planning Your Surgery <p> After surgery , the patient has a flatter , trimmer abdomen . Scars are permanent , but will fade with time . <p> In your initial consultation , your surgeon will evaluate your health , determine the extent of fat deposits in your abdominal region , and carefully assess your skin tone . Be sure to tell your surgeon if you smoke , and if you 're taking any medications , vitamins , or other drugs . <p> Be frank in discussing your expectations with your surgeon . He or she should be equally frank with you , describing your alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , your fat deposits are limited to the area below the navel , you may require a less complex procedure called a partial abdominoplasty , also know as a mini-tummy tuck , which can often be performed on an outpatient basis . You may , on the other hand , benefit more from partial or complete abdominoplasty done in conjunction with liposuction to remove fat deposits from the hips , for a better body contour . Or maybe liposuction alone would create the best result . <p> In any case , your surgeon should work with you to recommend the procedure that is right for you and will come closest to producing the desired body contour . <p> During the consultation , your surgeon should also explain the anesthesia he or she will use , the type of facility where the surgery will be performed , and the costs involved . In most cases , health insurance policies do not cover the cost of abdominoplasty , but you should check your policy to be sure . <h> Preparing for Your Surgery <p> Your surgeon will give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines on eating and drinking , smoking , taking or avoiding certain vitamins , and medications . <p> If you smoke , plan to quit at least one to two weeks before your surgery and not to resume for at least two weeks after your surgery . Avoid overexposure to the sun before surgery , especially to your abdomen , and do not go on a stringent diet , as both can inhibit your ability to heal . If you develop a cold or infection of any kind , your surgery will probably be postponed . <p> Whether your surgery is done on an outpatient or inpatient basis , you should arrange for someone to drive you home after your surgery , and to help you out for a day or two after you leave the hospital , if needed . <h> Where Your Surgery Will Be Performed <p> Many surgeons perform both partial and complete abdominoplasties in an outpatient surgical center or an office-based facility . Others prefer the hospital , where their patients can stay for several days . <h> Types of Anesthesia <p> Your doctor may select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Other surgeons use local anesthesia , combined with a sedative to make you drowsy . You 'll be awake but relaxed , and your abdominal region will be insensitive to pain . ( However , you may feel some tugging or occasional discomfort . ) <h> The Surgery <p> Complete abdominoplasty usually takes two to five hours , depending on the extent of work required . Partial abdominoplasty may take an hour or two . <p> Most commonly , the surgeon will make a long incision from hipbone to hipbone , just above the pubic area . A second incision is made to free the navel from surrounding tissue . With partial abdominoplasty , the incision is much shorter and the navel may not be moved , although it may be pulled into an unnatural shape as the skin is tightened and stitched . <p> Next , the surgeon separates the skin from the abdominal wall all the way up to your ribs and lifts a large skin flap to reveal the vertical muscles in your abdomen . These muscles are tightened by pulling them close together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmer abdominal wall and narrows the waistline . <p> The skin flap is then stretched down and the extra skin is removed . A new hole is cut for your navel , which is then stitched in place . Finally , the incisions will be stitched , dressings will be applied , and a temporary tube may be inserted to drain excess fluid from the surgical site . <p> In partial abdominoplasty , the skin is separated only between the incision line and the navel . This skin flap is stretched down , the excess is removed , and the flap is stitched back into place . <h> After Your Surgery <p> For the first few days , your abdomen will probably be swollen and you 're likely to feel some pain and discomfort which can be controlled by medication . Depending on the extent of the surgery , you may be released within a few hours or you may have to remain hospitalized for two to three days . <p> Your doctor will give you instructions for showering and changing your dressings . And though you may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking as soon as possible . <p> Surface stitches will be removed in five to seven days , and deeper sutures , with ends that protrude through the skin , will come out in two to three weeks . The dressing on your incision may be replaced by a support garment . <h> Getting Back to Normal <p> It may take you weeks or months to feel like your old self again . If you start out in top physical condition with strong abdominal muscles , recovery from abdominoplasty will be much faster . Some people return to work after two weeks , while others take three or four weeks to rest and recuperate . <p> Exercise will help you heal better . Even people who have never exercised before should begin an exercise program to reduce swelling , lower the chance of blood clots , and tone muscles . Vigorous exercise , however , should be avoided until you can do it comfortably . <p> Your scars may actually appear to worsen during the first three to six months as they heal , but this is normal . Expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scars flatten out and lighten in color . While they 'll never disappear completely , abdominal scars will not show under most clothing , even under bathing suits . <h> Your New Look <p> Abdominoplasty , whether partial or complete , produces excellent results for patients with weakened abdominal muscles or excess skin . And in most cases , the results are long lasting , if you follow a balanced diet and exercise regularly . <p> If you 're realistic in your expectations and prepared for the consequences of a permanent scar and a lengthy recovery period , abdominoplasty may be just the answer for you .

If the neck needs work , a small incision may also be made under the chin . <p> In general , the surgeon separates the skin from the fat and muscle below . Fat may be trimmed or suctioned from around the neck and chin to improve the contour . The surgeon then tightens the underlying muscle and membrane , pulls the skin back , and removes the excess . Stitches secure the layers of tissue and close the incisions ; metal clips may be used on the scalp . <p> Following surgery , a small , thin tube may be temporarily placed under the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there .

They 're likely to include these suggestions : avoid strenuous activity , including sex and heavy housework , for at least two weeks ( walking and mild stretching are fine ) ; avoid alcohol , steam baths , and saunas for several months ; above all , get plenty of rest and allow your body to spend its energy on healing . <p> At the beginning , your face may look and feel rather strange .

Heredity and sun damage can accelerate these changes . Each year , more than 100,000 women and men choose blepharoplasty to improve the way they look and , in many cases , how they see .

Most are 35 or older , but if droopy , baggy eyelids run in your family , you may decide to have eyelid surgery at a younger age . <p> A few medical conditions make blepharoplasty more risky .
