It was therefore useful for booting computers such as routers which did not have any data storage devices . It is still used to transfer small amounts of data between hosts on a network , such as IP phone firmware or operating system images when a remote X Window System terminal or any other thin client boots from a network host or server . The initial stages of some network based installation systems ( such as Solaris Jumpstart , Red Hat Kickstart and Windows NT 's Remote Installation Services ) use TFTP to load a basic kernel that performs the actual installation .

I 've tried booting computer to windows xp safe mode with networking allowed but still no joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VersionCheck = 1 " value to 0 and then hit Enter a couple of times to go to new lines and add in the following : <p> SpecialFlags <p> Debug = 1 <p> 6 .

The firmware application window will open . Right click on the title bar of the firmware update window ( Blue , green or gray in XP , Transparent in Windows 7 and Vista ) and choose Debug ( D ) . The resulting window will pop up : <p> 9 . Make sure the options in your window are checked exactly as shown above **NOTE** : You can also choose " Delete User-Config " To restore settings on the unit through the updater . You can also choose " rebuild partition table " to completely format the unit during the update . If you wish to format and you have noformating = 1 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 10 . Click OK <p> 11 . Click Update <p> How ever right clicking on the LSUpdate title bar never does bring up the sreen shown , I did however get the update to format the drive , it said that is was writing the firm ware , but how do I know that it work ? Is there something else I need to be doing ? <p> Hi . v1.53 is the latest version of TFTP boot load software , as described in FAQ(3of5) TFTP boot procedure . I need to run this first as NAS will only load to EM mode due to lack of firmware . After running this the NAS device can be seen by NAS navi &amp; LS updater . I 'm then using LS updater v1.6 to try &amp; flash the firmware to 1.6 but get error message saying " Could n't confirm a response from LS-CHL-V2-EM6F7 " <p> Sorry mate , nas EM mode has nothing to do with the TFTP procedure and TFTP is not used for EM mode fixes . <p> Unless , you get a E06 Error message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say the Nasnavi sees the LS you have an IP address , try pinging the IP of the LS , first , <p> Download the Firmware from the buffalo site , unzip it and try it , use the FAQ 2of 5 , since you have to modify certain stuff , as it is clearly illustrated , I would suggest youconnect the LS directly to your pc via LAN and change the IP range of your PC to match the LS s range , again it is explained clearly . <p> hi . thanks for the reply . After turning NAS on the red error light blinks rapidly 6 times , pauses briefly &amp; then repeats , i think this is the E06 error code you referred to . The only way I 've managed to get NASnavi to see it is after using TFTP boot procedure .

@@77980498 @6680498/ 12602 @qwx632602 12610 @qwx632610 <h> Setting up WebAccess on a Buffalo LinkStation <p> WebAccess is a feature of many Buffalo devices that allows you to create a personal cloud for easy remote access and file sharing with anyone , anywhere over the Internet . Your data remains securely stored in one place on your home or small office network , but you can access it quickly from any computer or mobile device over the web . <p> Almost all home or small business networks employ a firewall of some kind to separate computers and other devices on the local network from the Internet . This is necessary to help prevent unwanted users from accessing private user systems , which could result in user data loss or corrupted devices . <p> In order to enable WebAccess on a LinkStation , it is necessary to allow limited communication from the Internet through the firewall to the LinkStation . This is done by opening a port ( a kind of virtual door ) on the firewall for this specific service . The " door " will have a specific label known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet side , and a different label ( port number ) on the inside ( internal network side ) . The device that contains the firewall , usually a wireless router or ISP ( Internet Service Provider ) supplied modem/gateway will need to have specific instructions on how to handle this virtual door . Those instructions are called " port forwarding " . <p> Essentially it says " when internet traffic/requests come in directed to this specific port number then forward that traffic to this internal IP address on this specific port number " . This enables WebAccess traffic to pass through the firewall without exposing the entire LinkStation to the internet at large . For this reason any device with WebAccess enabled should have strong , secure passwords set for all users ! <p> For more information on setting up port forwarding on a Buffalo AirStation , see here . <p> Connect the LinkStation to your network with an Ethernet cable and power it on . <p> Launch a web browser and enter the LinkStation 's IP address into the address bar to access Settings . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use NAS Navigator to access Settings instead . <p> Click on the " Advanced Settings " tile . You will be asked to log in .

If you wish to use another DNS service select the option to disable buffalonas.com registration . <p> To determine what external ports are available in your environment , contact your internet service provider ( ISP ) . You will need to configure port forwarding on your router in order to use WebAccess . Please see the user 's manual for your router for instructions on setting up port forwarding . If you have a Buffalo router you may be able enable the UPnP ( Universal Plug and Play ) setting to automatically configure port forwarding . For more information on setting up port forwarding on a Buffalo AirStation , see here . <p> It is recommended to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent loss of access due to a change in the IP address of the LinkStation . For instructions on setting a static IP address on a LinkStation see here . <p> In this dialog box you have the option to register a name with BuffaloNAS.com to access your LinkStation or you can use a different DNS provider . You can also determine which external and internal TCP ports will be used by the WebAccess service and whether multiple sessions will be allowed . With some routers you may be able to configure the ports using the UPnP ( Universal Plug and Play ) feature of the router . This feature is not implemented identically in all router brands so it may or may not work . If it does not work you will need to configure the ports and port forwarding manually . Once all the settings are correct click OK . <p> If the following notification appears , click OK . <p> Return to Settings and click the slide switch to enable WebAccess . <p> WebAccess should now be enabled . Log out of Settings and close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BuffaloNAS.com and enter the name you assigned . You should be taken to the WebAccess interface for your LinkStation . If this does not work , it is likely either port forwarding settings in the router are incorrect , or you are attempting to use an external port that is blocked by the ISP.

At the heart of a NAS system is its ability to grant users access to stored data 24/7 wherever an Internet connection is available . However , the always-on , always-ready operation puts a strain on the internal storage drives and increases the likelihood of drive failure over time . Interruption or total stoppage of service can result in lost profits , frustrated clients or missed opportunities .

@@77980533 @6680533/ <h> Booting into EM Mode <h> Introduction <p> " What is EM and why is it not documented in the user manual ? " EM is known both as Engineering Mode and Emergency Mode . The simplest answer that I can give is to help recover the NAS device to its original function . The reason it 's not documented is because if you 're unsure of what you 're doing you can , in fact damage your NAS to the point of non-functionality . In lieu of this being said I will note now : Engineering Mode is for NAS firmware recovery purposes and is not to be utilized to let your NAS limp to its death . You may attempt booting into EM for data recovery purposes but it is not guaranteed to allow you to access your data if corrupt firmware is involved or not . <h> List of Devices Covered in This FAQ <h> LinkStations <p> Pro ( LS-GL and LS-XHL LS VL ) <p> Live ( HS-DHGL and LS-CHL ) <p> Pro Duo ( LS-WTGL and LS-WXL LS-WVL ) <h> TeraStations <p> Live ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TS-HGL and TS-RHGL ) <p> TS III ( TS-XL , TS V series ) <h> How Do I Tell if my NAS is in EM Mode ? <p> The most surefire way to tell if your NAS is in EM mode is by looking at the NAS Navigator . Since the NAS Navigator is a universal program which allows it to see multiple products ( i.e. you do n't need a different NAS Navigator program to see a LinkStation Pro Duo and a TeraStation Pro II ) you do n't need to download a separate application for each NAS . An alternate method ( for those units equipped ) is to look at the front LCD readout ( commonly on the TeraStation series ) and see if the unit has an IP address . More to the point within the NAS Navigator program next to the hostname of the NAS you should see " -EM " . Sometimes when you attempt to put a NAS into EM the NAS Navigator will not show " -EM " . This is acceptable if your goal is to attempt to update the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being seen on the network . <h> How to put a NAS into EM <p> Each NAS will vary whereas some will be similar in the process of being put into EM . So we 'll start with the LinkStation series and work our way to the TeraStations . <h> LinkStation ( HS-DHGL and LS-GL ) <p> Make sure that your NAS is powered off <p> Hold down the RESET/INIT button on the NAS ( should be located on the back of the NAS ) <p> While continuing to hold down the RESET/INIT button power the NAS on ( a little tune or chime will signal a successful EM boot attempt ) <p> Release the RESET/INIT button <p> It will take approximately 1 minute for the device to boot and acquire an IP address <p> NOTE : If you still do n't see the device on the NAS Navigator after 60 seconds then I would suggest checking out the possibility of performing a TFTP boot here .

The length of the Disk Check can vary depending on the NAS size . If a Disk Check continues for more than 24 hours then I 'm afraid due to the age of this unit that a TFTP option is not available and would suggest seeking the assistance of a 3rd party data recovery professional . <p> Once the NAS shows up on the NAS Navigator you may attempt to access your data or re-flash the firmware <p> Open the front door that allows access to the Hard Disk Drives ( you will need your key to do so if you do n't have one and you 're in the USA or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Hold down the INIT button ( Red button on newer units ) on the middle underside of the LCD display <p> While continuing to hold down the INIT button power the NAS on ( a little tune or chime will signal a successful EM boot ) <p> If the LCD reads " System EM Booting " then you may release the INIT button <p> After 120 seconds the NAS Navigator should not only find the unit , but the LCD display should show a link status ( i.e. IP address , Hard Disk space used , etc ) <p> NOTE : If you still do n't see the device on the NAS Navigator or the LCD display still shows " System EM Booting " after 120 seconds , then I would suggest performing a TFTP boot . <p> Once the NAS shows up on the NAS Navigator you may attempt to access your data or re-flash the firmware <h> TeraStation Rackmount ( TS-RHGL ) <p> Make sure the NAS is powered off <p> Carefully pull the front face plate of the NAS off ( you will need your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in the USA or Canada you can contact our Technical Support 24/7/365 at 866-752-6210 ) <p> Hold down the INIT button should be a small protrusion located on the left underside of the LCD display <p> While continuing to hold down the INIT button power the NAS on ( a little tune or chime will signal a successful EM boot ) <p> Release the INIT button <p> After 120 seconds the NAS Navigator should not only find the unit , but the LCD display should show a link status ( i.e. IP address , Hard Disk space used , etc ) <p> NOTE : If you still do n't see the device on the NAS Navigator or the LCD display still shows " System EM Booting " after 120 seconds , then I would suggest performing a TFTP boot . <p> Once the NAS shows up on the NAS Navigator you may attempt to access your data or re-flash the firmware <p> In closing , most things do n't go according to plan and these NAS devices are no exception to that rule .

Bittorrent supports UPnP so check your router if UPnP is enabled .

@@77980552 @6680552/ 12602 @qwx632602 12610 @qwx632610 <h> Configuration and Usage of iSCSI Volumes on a Buffalo TeraStation <p> iSCSI , which stands for Internet Small Computer System Interface , works on top of the Transport Control Protocol ( TCP ) and allows SCSI command to be sent end-to-end over local area networks . iSCSI works by transporting block-level data between an iSCSI initiator on a server and an iSCSI target on a storage device . The iSCSI protocol encapsulates SCSI commands and assembles the data in packets for the TCP/IP layer . Packets are sent over the network using a point-to-point connection . Upon arrival , the iSCSI protocol disassembles the packets , separating the SCSI commands so the operating system ( OS ) will see the storage as a local SCSI device that can be formatted as usual . <p> Examples iSCSI Usage <p> Here are some instances where iSCSI can be used to provide a useful storage alternative : <p> 1 . Adding storage to an existing server . <p> In this case , you may be running short of space on an existing server and do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what path they use to access the existing server . Connecting a RAID backed iSCSI volume will allow you to add terabytes of storage to an existing server without shutting it down or adding physical drives . This is especially useful if the server lacks bays to add additional drives . <p> 2 . Providing storage with domain-level file and folder permissions . <p> If you have a need for volumes with NTFS permissions at the file or folder level , a standard TeraStation can not provide this . By using iSCSI volumes attached to a Windows server , the volume can be formatted with an NTFS file system and administered the same as any other Windows volume . <p> 3 . Providing storage for a cluster . <p> Depending on the OS used on the clustered hosts , you can use iSCSI volumes on a TeraStation or another WSS NAS to provide storage for a high availability cluster . For VMware ( ESXi ) hosts , any TeraStation that supports iSCSI can provide storage to a cluster . If you need to run a Windows cluster ( for applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need host the iSCSI target on a WSS based unit . <p> Rules for iSCSI <p> While iSCSI can provide a useful and efficient supplement to straight NAS functionality , there are some hard and fast rules that must be followed as well as some recommendations to increase performance and manageability . <p> 1 . Do not connect multiple Windows hosts to a single iSCSI volume . <p> This is the biggest mistake many users make with iSCSI devices . Windows uses the NTFS file system , which is not designed to be shared between hosts . Remember that iSCSI provides a block-level storage device to the host . To the OS it appears as a physical drive installed in the system . The only time that multiple Windows hosts should be connected to the same iSCSI volume is when the volume is providing storage for a failover cluster . For Buffalo devices this is only possible with a WSS-based NAS . <p> If you connect multiple Windows hosts to the same iSCSI volume without the benefit of MS Cluster Services to arbitrate disk access , it will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of open files , reads , writes , or changes to the master file table . It 's not a matter of if data corruption will occur - it 's a matter of when . <p> One way to ensure that only one host is allowed to connect to the volume is to configure CHAP authentication , either one way or mutual . A link to an article explaining how to set this up is included at the end of this document . <p> 2 . Always use the correct startup and shutdown sequence . <p> Try to avoid having the iSCSI target ( storage device ) shut down while the server is still accessing it . Imagine disconnecting a hard drive from a computer in the middle of a write operation . The result will often be data loss or data corruption . When shutting down , always shut down the server(s) first , then the storage device and the switch(es) last . When starting up go in the reverse order : switch , storage , server . Make sure that each device is fully booted before moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all components are connected to a UPS to prevent connection loss due to a power outage . If the storage device has multiple power connections , such as the TS7120 , it is recommended to connect each power supply to a different power source if possible . <p> NOTE : In the event that an iSCSI volume gets disconnected/reconnected from a Windows server that has shared folders on the iSCSI volume , restarting the " server " service in the services.msc snapin should re-activate the shares . <p> 3 . Do not team or trunk ports used for iSCSI . <p> Because of the way that iSCSI sessions are created and managed , NIC teaming or trunking will reduce the performance of iSCSI . Instead of teaming set up multiple NICs and use MPIO settings in the host 's iSCSI initiator to configure multipath options . This will result in overall better performance and better utilization of multiple network paths . <p> 4 . Segregate iSCSI traffic from the rest of the LAN . <p> While not required , it is recommended to segregate iSCSI to a separate LAN segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically separate switches . The nature of iSCSI generates a tremendous amount of network traffic and keeping the iSCSI traffic separate will increase the performance of both the iSCSI LAN and the regular LAN . <p> 5 . Optimize switch configuration <p> It is recommended to have flow control and RSTP enabled on all switch ports used for iSCSI . <p> 6 . Jumbo frames <p> Enabling jumbo frames can increase performance in iSCSI environments but is not a panacea . If you are seeing very poor performance in your iSCSI environment , enabling jumbo frames will not be likely to improve performance and may degrade performance even further . The use of jumbo frames can increase performance in environments where performance is already good and all other parameters are optimal , but in some rare cases it can actually degrade performance in an otherwise well-performing environment . <p> Rules for using iSCSI volumes as shared storage in a clustered environment <p> While iSCSI can be extremely useful as shared storage for a cluster , there are some rules you need to keep in mind when planning/configuring the cluster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCSI-3 persistent reservations on iSCSI volumes . This is a requirement to pass the validation tests on a Windows cluster . If you need to create shared storage for a Windows cluster you will need to use a TeraStation running WSS ( Windows Storage Server ) instead of a standard TeraStation . <p> 2 . VMware ( ESXi ) clusters can use iSCSI volumes on a standard TeraStation . <p> If you are planning an ESXi cluster for a virtualized environment , you should have no problem using iSCSI volumes on any TeraStation products to provide the storage . Because ESXi uses VMFS ( VMware File System ) for datastores there is no need for persistent reservations . VMFS is a shareable file system and all attached hosts can lock the parts they are currently accessing to prevent other hosts from making changes and causing data corruption .

@@77980621 @6680621/ <p> Airports are busy places and the operational needs of specialized , executive airports are no less challenging than those at airports that serve everyday travelers . Surveillance systems are needed to secure runways , hangars , terminals and offices . And the video collected from those systems supports billing and operations , as well . <p> It was natural that when an executive airport in suburban Houston went in search of a partner to integrate its on-site cameras into an overall high-capacity video monitoring system , EOS Digital Services would get the call . Based in Houston with a long track record of quality installations supported by strong customer service , EOS Digital Services was founded on the goal of making audio/visual connectivity easy and affordable to Houston businesses . <p> The Challenge <p> The airport was looking for a system to connect its previously installed cameras to a fully integrated solution that would monitor and record everything from security and access to the movements of corporate jets in and around the hangars and runways . Video of movements in the hangars was also necessary , in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying who was working on and near them . <p> " The client came to us to take over the project , maintain the cameras , and provide the storage solution , " said Ilan Saadia , owner of EOS Digital Services . " They have some pretty expensive jetsLear Jets and GulfStreamsin huge hangars there . Security is an issue . It was very important to them to have reliable surveillance , " said Saadia . <p> Just as important as surveilling hangar activity , was gaining a video record of the comings and goings of the jets for billing purposes . By documenting jet traffic , the tail numbers on each plane can be documented , thereby designating ownership so the appropriate charges can be recorded . <p> " It was crucial to their operation that they get recordings with the tail numbers , " said Saadia . " The main thing we were looking for was a reliable piece of technology that could store video records . We 'd looked at different storage solutions . In the end it was a function of cost-effectiveness , ease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Buffalo 's pre-sales support for guidance . A Buffalo sales engineer worked closely with EOS to review the airport 's needs and specifications and identify a solution to meet the client 's requirements . <p> " Basically , the client was looking for a storage solution to store all the video files , and they wanted to keep this video a long time , " said Saadia . " They needed something that would allow them to go back six months . That 's why we went with generous storage . " <p> EOS selected a 24 terabyte TeraStation 7120r Enterprise NAS solution . Not only does it possess the capacity , the TeraStation offers the level of fault-tolerance that the airport required . It supports hot-swappable hard drives so that , in the event of a disk failure , the defective drive can be removed and replaced without powering down the entire system . This allows operations to continue uninterrupted . It also employs RAID ( Redundant Array of Inexpensive Drives ) technology . <p> EOS installed the airport 's new TeraStation 7120r in the default RAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of available storage , also equipping it with redundant power supplies to provide continuous power and allow operations to continue in the event of a power supply failure . All Buffalo TeraStation NAS solutions ship pre-configured in a default RAID mode to ensure efficient deployment and operation . <p> The 2U rack-mountable TeraStation also allows the system to scale to future needs if additional storage is needed at a future date . It easily installs into an equipment rack that can accommodate additional rack mountable units and can be secured in a communications or server room . And because the TeraStation is Linux-based , there are no operating system licensing fees ; maintenance was also minimized as compared to Windows-based servers , there are relatively few system updates and patches . <p> EOS integrated the TeraStation 7120r into the airport 's existing network system , including a SAN hosting the surveillance video management system . Eighteen high definition IP surveillance cameras , including two cameras with dual day-and-night lenses in each hangar , record on detected motion around the airport . The networked cameras not only capture and process 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do virtual pan and zoom as they access images from either the console or from their mobile devices . All are powered off of a multi-port POE switch and write video to the TeraStation 7120r where the video images are archived . <p> Results <p> Houston served as a pilot project for another executive airport outside of Austin . Because the TeraStation is essentially a storage appliance , it can be plugged in , turned on and ready to store data with minimal set-up . Complete installation took only a couple of days . <p> " The main thing we were looking for was a reliable piece of technology that could store video records . We 'd looked at different storage solutions . In the end it was a function of cost-effectiveness , ease of use and reliability .

This suggests a similar utility would be feasible for Buffalo storage products . Furthermore , it is not stated in product specifications or knowledgebase articles what differentiates Buffalo products so that a similar utility can not be provided . <p> We purchased the DriveStation HD-CX500U2 .

I found everything in this excellent device and really appreciate that you took to consideration all claims from customers of your competitors like DLink and Iconbit : LS421DE is silent , powerfull , with good software for DLNA ( TWonky 7 ) and torrents ( BitTorrent ) . There are only two things that disappointing me and highly demanding in future firmware updates : - support for external USB HDD other vendors except yours ( it was unpleasant surprise to found out it - neither documentation nor specification declared this limitation ) .

It was therefore useful for booting computers such as routers which did not have any data storage devices . It is still used to transfer small amounts of data between hosts on a network , such as IP phone firmware or operating system images when a remote X Window System terminal or any other thin client boots from a network host or server . The initial stages of some network based installation systems ( such as Solaris Jumpstart , Red Hat Kickstart and Windows NT 's Remote Installation Services ) use TFTP to load a basic kernel that performs the actual installation . " <p> TFTP in this case is used for replacing a failed boot image on the NAS . When the NAS is first booted and gets an E04 , E06 , or stays at " system now booting " for a while , it sends a request to the IP address 192.168.11.1 to replace blocks of data for the missing boot image . This is usually a last resort to getting a NAS to work when these errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Performing a TFTP boot : <p> A TFTP boot requires a little bit of finesse and a tiny bit of luck . 9 times out of 10 when a NAS constantly says " System Now Booting " , E04/E06 ( or 4/6 DIAG light flashes depending on the NAS ) or does n't show up on the NAS Navigator after a long period of time after an EM boot attempt , then chances are that you need to perform this method . So , without further delay let 's get to it . <p> 3 . Set your computer 's NIC ( Network Interface Card ) to a static IP address of 192.168.11.1NOTE : If you do n't know how to change your IP address on your computer you can find out how to do that for Windows ( XP , Vista or 7 ) . <p> 6 .

If you do not see " listening On : 192.168.11.1:69 " in the terminal , then you will need to restart the program ( possibly your computer , too ) . <p> 10 . If you have a unit with only a Function button ( i.e. X and V series units ) , press and hold that button for 5 seconds ; otherwise , skip this step . <p> 11 . Your terminal should now show two lines ending in " Blocks Served " - if they do not , then you will need to reboot your computer and your NAS and repeat the TFTP boot process . <p> After you see blocks of data being served the NAS typically boots to Emergency Mode at which point you can perform a force firmware update following FAQ 2 of 5 <p> You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found by the NAS Navigator .

On one of your PC 's in your network have the Nas Navi utility installed . That utility is used to get the IP address and some basic info from the unit . Once it locates the IP address there is two simple ways to get to the Nas . First to map the drive to make it show up as a HD in " my computer " , " computer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Start-&gt;'Run ' . In the Run box type 192.168.11.150 where 192.168.11.150 is the IP address of the NAS . Or , In the Run box type HOSTNAME where HOSTNAME is the Hostanme of the NAS . This will open a window with the shares . Right-Click on the share you wish to map and select Map Network Drive . You will then have the option to choose a drive letter . Make sure the box is checked for reconnect after logon . Once you have done so , click ' Finish ' . <p> To get to the Admin Web Page to set up all your Configurations you can do the following . <p> In the Run box you can type in //ipaddress of nas . <p> Open your web browser and type in the IP address of your NAS in the address bar . The username/password should be admin/password unless you have changed it .

@@77980693 @6680693/ <p> Heartland Technology Solutions has been taking care of business in the nation 's Midwest for more than 26 years . As one of the nation 's fastest-growing managed service providers specializing in solutions for small to mid-sized businesses and K-12 educational institutions , the company sprung into action in May 2011 to help companies get back on their feet after an EF5 tornado devastated more than 500 businesses in Joplin , Missouri . <p> The Challenge <p> This natural disaster dramatically illustrated the effects of catastrophic data loss and the need for effective backup and disaster recovery strategies . Studies have estimated that nearly half of the small to midsized businesses which suffer catastrophic data loss stand to go out of business within five years . But even the loss of a single file can interrupt business processes and result in costly downtime . Heartland engages in ongoing efforts to identify and implement better and more effective ways to ensure data integrity through any kind of disaster . <p> Later in 2011 , Heartland embarked on what became a year-and-a-half evaluation of hardware and software to identify more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients ' dataand its own . The dedicated backup and recovery system that Heartland had been using had begun to show its ageand its limitations . Cost , capacity and scalability were key considerations ; upgrades to the old system required the purchase of an entirely new hardware . <p> Action Taken <p> Heartland opted for a combined solution , choosing Buffalo Americas for hardware and StorageCraft Technology Corp . for software . Heartland selected Buffalo 's TeraStationTM WSS NAS Appliance and StorageCraft 's ShadowProtect and ImageManager as its backup and disaster recovery software . Because the TeraStation WSS runs Microsoft Windows Storage Server software , it proved to be an ideal platform for ShadowProtect and ImageManager , which are designed to run on Windows-based systems . The TeraStation WSS uses industry-standard RAID 5 technology to provide the fault-tolerance that is necessary for data back-up solutions . <p> Heartland was so impressed with the performance of the combined offering that they not only began replacing backup-and-recovery systems at each client site with the new solution , they implemented it as the backup solution for their data center as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering . <p> Heartland serves a number of rural clients in tertiary markets where high-speed Internet connections are often unavailable , and clients sometimes struggle to achieve even a 512 Kbps upstream connection . Using ShadowProtect , Heartland creates an initial " seed " image and stores it on an external device , such as a USB hard drive . That device is shipped to Heartland 's data center to be replicated on the server . <p> By shipping the disk with the initial seed image , the client avoids having to upload gigabytes of data over its Internet connection . The incremental backup can transfer at its own pace so the backup is n't throttled by their Internet connection . It will run even if their Internet connection is down and can transfer the incremental updates when the connection is restored . <p> The client 's Windows-based servers , running applications such as Exchange or SQL , use StorageCraft ShadowProtect to back up data to the TeraStation WSS that is located on-site . StorageCraft ImageManager , which runs on the TeraStation at the client site , sends incremental changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to update the off-site image . Heartland uses multiple TeraStation WSS units at their data center to store their clients ' ShadowProtect images . <p> ShadowProtect not only backs up data , it creates an image of the entire operating system and all applications , settings and data files . Everything that is on the server is contained in the image . In a disaster recovery scenario , the image data can be used to quickly restore an entire servereven to different hardware . The image can also be restored to a virtual machine to minimize downtime . When clients want to recover , they do n't have to go to a web portal and download a file ; they can just pick the files they need and restore them on the fly . <p> For their own use , Heartland reversed the process used for their clients . Since Heartland 's data resides at its data center , the backups are made from the data center to TeraStation WSS devices located in their offices . <p> " We were looking for something that would allow us to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution scalable to a variety of needs . " <p> - Derek Kuhr NOC Manager , Heartland Technology Solutions <p> The protected data is always accessible because it is continually backed up . In turn , the backup is archived off-site at the data center , ensuring a prompt recovery if disaster strikes . " It just works ! " said Kuhr.

Why the crappy webinerface with less functionality than my Linkstation Pro Duo ? <p> I 'm in the same boat . Backup to usb copies everything to a folder named the current date .

@@77980731 @6680731/ 12602 @qwx632602 <h> Why ca n't I set file-level permissions on my TeraStation ? <p> NOTE : This article does not apply to 3010 or 5010 series TeraStations . These units do allow NTFS style permisstions at a subfolder level . <p> We have a number of customers who want to be able to assign file and/or folder level permissions on a TeraStation share the same way they would on a Windows share . The reason this is not possible is because those permissions are stored in the master file table ( MFT ) as part of the NTFS file system . NTFS is a file system developed by Microsoft for use with Windows NT based operating systems . <p> All TeraStations run an operating system based on a Linux kernel and use the XFS file system . Windows compatible SMB network shares are created using Samba . This setup is not compatible with NTFS permissions . <p> Permissions for TeraStation are set at the share level and can be assigned to users or groups . You can assign either a user or a group either read-only or read/write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a share full access is assumed . <p> If desired the TeraStation can be integrated into an Active Directory domain and share-level permissions assigned to domain users or groups . <p> If you wish to store data on a TeraStation and must have the ability to set NTFS permissions on folders and/or files we recommend that you use the iSCSI feature of the TeraStation . By creating an iSCSI volume and attaching it to a Windows host you allow Windows to create and utilize an NTFS volume but keep the actual data stored on the TeraStation.

If possible , I 'd prefer to hear from you first before applying any update .

@@77980740 @6680740/ <h> Author Topic : Q total number of antennas internal + external in the WZR-600dhp ( Read 2845 times ) <p> hello ! just like the title says i want to know how many antennas are in the wzr-600dhp i have n't been able to find a clear answer on the internet i know there 's 3 in the wzr-300hp is the same in the wzr-600dhp ? <p> You have to understand MIMO arrangement before asking such a question because its not as simple as just seeing physical antennas and making a count of what you see . the wzr-600dhp is a 2x2 MIMO arrangement , so is the wzr-300hp . The 300hp may have 3 antennas , but only 2 of them really do anything , thus the reason there is only 2 of the fold out antennas on the unit , and the 600dhp is the same way - other than the fact that it has dual radios , a 2x2 mimo unit , so it 'll only have 2 antennas per radio that will actually do anything , even if the 2.4Ghz radio has 3 antennas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So for that unit - it has 4 antennas - 2 for each radio . <p> thank you buddee for answering but I 'm a bit confused now , you said in the end it has 4 antennas is it 4 physical antennas or 2 antennas shared between two radio ? if so does that affect the performance compared to the 300hp which has only one radio ? and what is the use of the 3rd antenna in the 300hp ? i read somewhere that the 300hp has an amplifier for all 3 of his antennas why Buffalo cared to put an 3rd antenna inside and an amplifier for it if it was going to be useful ? <p> It has 2 ( active ) antennas per radio , the 2 fold out external ones are connected to the 2.4Ghz radio , the 5Ghz radio has 2 internal PCB board style antennas . <p> As far as why buffalo , or any other manufacturer arranges antennas the way they do , that would be something for you to ask them , i 'm not a spokesperson on how and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , you need to understand how MIMO arrangement works first , then you would better understand . <p> thank you very much for your help it 's much clearer now , I see that you are very active here I was looking around and found this thread where drmemory said that the 3rd antenna in the wzr-hp-300nh was a PIFI antenna I tried google but could n't find what it is , I only found results for PIFA antennas which are used in mobile phones and they are significant enough so i assumed PIFI means PIFA-Wifi or something like that , this is just an assumption please correct me if i am wrong , if that is the case then I assume the 2 antennas for the 5Ghz radio are also PIFI , I also looked up MIMO and found that it basically means that you can combine multiple antennas for sending and receiving but you ca n't have multiple users or multiple radios inputting and outputting from that setup in other words it ca n't be shared between 2 or more users or radios i think the antennas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood you well the wzr-600dhp has 2 internal and 2 external antennas this was all I wanted to know but I did learn quite a few things.thank you again budde for your help and please correct me if i am wrong about anything , everything i said here is based on a few google searches and a lot of assumptions which is not very reliable . <p> i do n't see the middle antenna being a PIFA based antenna . The middle antenna is a PCB etched style antenna , not PIFA , atleast it is when i take apart my own routers , and this is with either the 300 or the 600 series . <p> With PIFA - there would be some kind of antenna in the case that the middle antenna connector would be hooked to , if you look at internal board pics you 'll not see such , only a PCB etching that ends of onto the board , no wire from the etching to connect to any kind of antenna . If it is infact PIFA , it would have to be from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bother , an etched style antenna into a board will give hardly any gain , and even with the worst PIFAs you 'll get atleast 1.52dBi gain - and this is with a physical PIFA antenna . With no physical PIFA - i would n't see no more than .2 dBi gain - so like i said , why bother .. <p> The middle antenna is the least of your concerns though , as i said , it really does n't work . But why it does n't work is a bit more technical . It functions as a Rx antenna only , but your 2 end antennas have both Tx/Rx streams , thus fitting a 2x2 MIMO , the one in the middle could only be used if you had a 3x3 MIMO adapter because you could n't get the 3rd stream with a 2x2 adapter , and here another issue , the router itself is only a 2x2 unit , so hardware limitation wise , it could n't use the 3rd stream anyhow even if it wanted to - hardware was n't designed for it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antenna is a PCB etched style with no use ... <p> And for the record , its not just buffalo units that are arranged like this , i have an asus RT-N16 that is exactly the same , except those guys even went out on a limb and even tossed in an actual physical external antenna that does ( guess what ) absolutely nothing , and this was even tested within the dd-wrt forum and proven , changing the middle antenna on it did nothing , changing the left and right ones gave great gain in the overall signal .

@@77980756 @6680756/ <p> I have tried using Active Directory for the Network Type and also Workgroup and Delegate Authority to External SMB Server . Neither of those options are allowing us to set file ownership and permissions on directories or files . <p> We 're having a similar problem . We recently bought a TeraStation PRO to use on a mixed Linux/Windows network . The Windows set up was easy but we have spent a lot of time trying to set it up with Linux . I must say that the omission of any reference to Linux in the manual is somewhat disappointing ! Also , the Network - Workgroup/Domains page seems to be very Windows and Apple centric ; where is the option for sharing on Linux ? If there is someone from Buffalo listening , is there a missing Linux manual somewhere ? : - ) <p> One of the main reasons we invested in the TeraStation was to use it to house our CVS respository . Setting this up has proved to be very time-consuming . The CVS service runs on a Ubunutu box which has the TeraStation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform chmod operations on the repository but it ca n't as the ownership of the TeraStation directory is set to nobody:nobody and whenever CVS attemps to perform an operation , it returns with an " operation not permitted " error . We would like to use the Terastation with our regular Linux users/permission . Alternatively , is there a way to set up users/groups on the TeraStation which would mirror our regular Linux users ? <p> I have tried altering the share permissions in the TeraStation web interface but to no avail . I also wondered whether the permissions problem might be related to the CIFS mount ; is it possible to mount the TeraStation as NFS ? <p> Well ... if this can be any help to anyone , I 've figured out a way to hack it so permissions stick . I noticed the permissions always reverted to the anon user ( arh ... what use is that for secure storage ? ) , so I figured there must have been some default setting in the firmware . It runs a custom linux ... hummm . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's perl , with japanese comments . And I 'm lazy . : ) So I figured a way through the linux startup scripts instead . Not for the faint of heart ... some linux familiarity using NFS and vi is required . <p> This was done on : <p> Model Name : TS-RHTGL/R5 <p> Firmware Version : 1.33 NFS <p> a ) install latest firmware ( works with 1.33 NFS ) , configure your tera and make sure to configure your NFS folders and perms . You might want to make sure the clients can map it first . ( You need a samba front-end for the permissions to stick properly , so your clients should consist of samba services mapping those shares , themselves mounted via NFS ) <p> b ) get telnet access to your terastation box using one of those exploit tools you can find on the web ( nas-central is a good pointer ) . Login into your box using telnet and the user root . I was a little impressed at the ease of doing this . But he , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a virus infected user network , works for me. ( hint hint ) Make sure to activate the telnet service at startup , I trust you can figure this one out . Otherwise , no sweat , telnet turns off on the next reboot and you need to re-hack it if access is needed . <p> c ) ... here 's where it gets sketchy ... I noticed the /etc/exports file gets overwritten on nfs service starts by a compiled binary . Argh. so , modify /etc/init.d/nfs.sh , as follows , to , ahum , ditch the firmware overwrites of your NFS exports config. ( which means you got to manually edit the file to remove the allsquash feature , you can also adjust your anon ids to your likings ) . <p> ... snippet ... /etc/init.d/nfs.sh <p> # START of selt modification to be able to modify NFSD startup options <p> echo " making a copy of /etc/exports , selt hack " <p> cp /etc/exports /etc/exports.swapping <p> # follows is an original line from the tera script . <p> nasconfiggen -c nfs <p> echo " swapping back orig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then <p> cp /etc/exports **26;2365;TOOLONG <p> cp /etc/exports.swapping /etc/exports <p> echo " orig exports file swapped back ! " <p> else <p> echo " failure to swap , perhaps the /etc/exports file was not there ? <p> fi <p> # EOF of selt modifications <p> echo -n " Starting RPC portmap daemon : " <p> ... end of snippet ... <p> look for the last line in the snippet to locate the modification location . <p> d ) edit your /etc/exports file to your likings ( man exports ... ) <p> - remove the allsquash option ( this squashes the perms to the anon user , your first pain ) <p> - remap the anon IDs to yours ( 99 is what it is ? wouah ... old style ! ) <p> e ) /etc/init.d/nfs.sh restart Your permissions will now stick ! : p <p> AS LONG as you use the data through a NFS-mapped-to-Samba share . Accessing the NFS share through unix will mess up the permissions ( still have n't figured out why , probably that busybox/blackbox software or something with the ldap-posix user mappings on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I successfully constructed a pair of domain controlers with a centralized terastation for the user 's roaming profiles , with proper permissions and quite redundant , without any sort of heartbeat or ip aliasing . Works great from openbsd-samba-openldap setups , getting that to integrate with Linux should be the same . <p> Hint to the terastation developers ; you should figure out how to integrate the openldap tools in your boxes , it would allow better integration of user accounts from samba-ldap setups . ( And you can bypass the DC stuff entirely by polling the auth from ldap directly ... ahhh .... ) <p> ALSO ; concerning chown and chmod ; they do not work . ; ) even with the above hack . I suspect the blackbox software is busy getting confused with the userIDs ... they end up skewed when writing files over the NFS protocole . But one way around that is to create the root shares on your NFS partition using the proper permissions in the first place . ie ; from your NFS client box ; <p> mount the drive and then sudo/su @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so will the files created by the target users ( through windows at least ) .

There are some benefits to using SFP+ , such as if you are going through several hops across multiple switches , the SPF+ will have less latency . <p> Buffalo specifically choose to use the 10GBASE-T because their devices are purposely designed for small to medium sized businesses who will likely only utilize one switch and thus negating the added cost for SFP+ to enter 10GbE networking .

I am trying to boot using TFTP and the blue light never stops blinking after the blocks are served . <p> My model is LS-CH2.0TL .

I am using Win7 , safe mode , firewall off , correct IP , LS-CHL 1.06 software . I believe the hard drive is unformatted ( at least unallocated , according to Windows Disk Management ) . The TFTP program seems to run fine ( is anything supposed to display after the two files transfer ? ) , but the light on the link station just keeps blinking and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn it off and the light still never stops , so I eventually pull the power .

I was unable to find anything about replacing the hard drive , so I figured something the same size should work . <p> Once I used this , it worked fine . I did n't try this at first because I did not think mine was one of the applicable units and it was not listed by Net7 as such . But desperation led me to try , and it worked ! I did also need to follow some of the directions at LONG ... to get the firmware to load after the updater lost connection to the LS ( IP address issues ) . <p> Hopefully this may help someone else out there trying to figure out a similar problem after replacing the hard drive in an LS-CHL . <p> He states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher its kirkwood . The reason he states this is because there are 2 LS-CHL models , One that uses Kirkwood and one that is n't . That why he did n't  list it since its not always a dead give away that yours is the v2 LS-CHL . Its really if your unit was using the white/blue User interface its not a kirkwood firmware unit . If it is using a Red/black and its a linkstation then its a kirkwood . So for everyone else do n't  assume yours is a kirkwood unit just because its a LS-CHL . Please check <p> I forgot to mention , for those not interested in looking it up or opening the unit to find out , the easiest way to find if your unit is a Kirkwood variant is to go to the BuffaloTech.com site , visit the download 's section and see what the latest firmware release is for your unit by typing in your model number for your unit and hitting search , if the date is 7/12/2013 and the version of 1.65 , then it SHOULD be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , just different Product Identification numbers ) <p> Logged <p> Units I own : TS-XL , TS-WXL , LS-WVL , TS-RXL , TS5400 , TS-RVHL , <p> I do n't work for Buffalo but i do love there products enough to help people <p> Update : I have done the TCTP method several times now with the same result . when the TCTP program is running , 2 files are sent and the unit restarts .

I am using 650GB of the 1TB and want to increase the amount of storage available to me . I have another Pro Duo on order but wo n't be here until the middle of next week . In the mean-time I desperately need to increase my storage capacity for reasons that will take me too long explain , so let 's just assume it 's a matter life or death . I want to delete the RAID 1 ARRAY but keep the data intact . Then I want to format one drive meaning I have and extra 1TB of storage available to me . <p> There are three ways of doing this as far as I can tell : <p> 1 ) Using the web console delete the RAID 1 ARRAY . - This appears to be the least favourable as all data will be deleted which is of no use to me . <p> 2 ) Also using the web console go to System &gt; Restore/Erase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button there is an instruction which says : " Reset LinkStation to factory default values .

So I am not convinced that this will work and need to see if someone has tried it before and if the data is in fact still there but the RAID 1 ARRAY now gone ( as RAID 0 is the default for the device ) . <p> 3 ) The last option as far as I can figure is to power down the device . Remove one of the 1TB Disks , drop it in a Chassis/Enclosure and hook it up to a computer via USB . Check to make sure the data is intact on the removed drive ( which is now in a Chassis ) . Format the drive still in the linkstation and remove the RAID1 ARRAY . Pop the removed drive back in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with 350GB free ) and a blank 1TB drive . Then pop these into a RAID 0 array if possible . <p> Any advice , suggestions or experience that anyone can spare the time to share would be greatly appreciated . <p> The only way to get more space is to delete the RAID array . If you remove one of the disks and delete the data and put the disk back in it will not give you access to this space , it will just show you a RAID error . <p> What do you mean destroy the RAID 1 ? If the RAID 1 is still on the unit and you insert a blank disk then it will just ask you to rebuild the RAID array and not give you access to the storage of the 2nd disk . You need to delete the array . This is the only way .

Giving you software that 's not the current version and you like it . Means you want support . Novastor wont support unless you on the latest version so you have to pay . They do n't have to give you anything and people sell the units for the same price with out the software . Though you can download it with the S/N . Either way i know Novastor 's rules and policies and they just said that to throw the heat off them . quoting you here " bundled with 5 free licenses of NovaBACKUP Professional " . Not paid or comes with 5 licenses . But they clearly state 5 free licenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as gift ... unless the world has change this . <p> Also using ford is a horrible comparison . Did buffalo make the software no ... did ford build the engines ya .. You purchase a product that did what it was suppose to . Storage data or backups . Your data is there and the unit is working . Linkstation stores data ... that 's its purpose .. Novastor is an alternative backup they gave you . Clearly they are 2 different pieces of a pie . This is n't Buffalo 's issue . Its Novastor 's . Novastor made a secure way to make sure your data was not to be recover so easily . But its also a double edge sword apparently . If you are going to backup till your pc crashes you need to do a disaster recovery . A backup is not a recovery for a disaster . Its a backup for storage . <p> In all honesty , you choose to use novastor . Buffalo did n't tell you to though they did give you the software so if you dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . even manually do it but you choose novastor . A Nas is a Nas . Its simple as that . A back up software is a backup software . How you go about backing your stuff up . Is up to you . You can not blame a company for things that are in your control . Novastor told you what to try .

@@77980809 @6680809/ <p> I 've been using an LS-CH1.0TL-AP link station for some time ( I bought it new in August 2009 , but the build date on the box is 2008.08.27 ) , and one of its features is an ability to add a USB-connected HDD to it . I have just bought an HD-LB1.5TU2-A3 drive station ( build date on box 2010.11.03 ) and connected it that way ( to the link station USB port ) . <p> The link station manual makes it clear that for correct management of an attached USB drive , it should be formatted via the link station , so I logged into the link station web admin page and tried to do that . The usbdisk on boot reported an existing FAT format on the new drive . Selecting disk management , usbdisk1 and XFS ( which I understand allows re-construction of data after a power failure ) which was the only format option presented , and then I applied it , answered the pin code check and proceeded . Within about 15 seconds , the admin page reported a format failure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shut down the link station , and powered it back on after about 30sec , waited until the start process was finished and then logged in . The data reported on usbdisk1 showed a FAT format , so evidently the error generating the message did not damage the disk data . I selected disk management and re-tried the format procedure . Same result . Restarting showed the same FAT details . I left it at that point to check other features that should - but might not - work . <p> Subsequently I was able to create a new share for the attached usbdisk and have the attached PC assign a different drive letter to that share . Read and write to both the shares ( link station and drive station ) work OK . <p> The link station firmware version is 1.12 . The current buffalo website linkstation firmware downloads are only for a V2 linkstation , and ( by trial and error ) its clear the latest nasnavigator ( v2.31 ) is n't backwards compatible with the ealier version link station hardware , so the navigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the query is , why wo n't the link station allow me to format the newly connected usb drive from the admin page ? <p> This drivestation should work just fine with the Linkstation . There is a 1.07 firmware available on the buffalo site . I would try and follow FAQ 2 of 5 to flash your unit to that version . I have never heard of 1.12 , so it could be an issue with the firmware . I 've seen where the units will report a strange firmware version if the firmware is having issues . <p> I upgraded the firmware from 1.07 to 1.12 ( downloaded from the website ) about 6 months ago on a recommendation from the forum for a different issue . Unfortunately the text files with the download look like config settings rather than notes about the issues the release is targetted at . <p> FYI , reviewing my posts on this forum ( search on davidk ) the reason for upgrading from 1.07 to 1.12 was that with 1.07 selecting the web admin button in nasnavigator did not start the admin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.12 fixed that . <p> I 've consulted a friend who runs 3 linkstations on his LAN . It seems that one of those also failed a format ( of the linkstation drive itself ) in much the same manner ( would not format the drive but did not damage the pre-existing FAT format structure ) . Probably the first one , as he 's bought several over a period and they just worked . ( His advice was pivotal in my choice of these devices ) . So , he just lived with it - even tho FAT on MS data is n't an optimum structure for large disks like these - and has n't had a problem over an extended period of 24/7 operation . Since upgrading to Windows 7 he has n't re-loaded nasnavigator so is not able to advise the firmware levels of his devices . <p> Living with it seems to be the name of the game . It does work , but certainly does n't inspire great confidence in data survivability if something does go wrong in an environment where that characteristic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear that the linkstation firmware - possibly thru several versions and hardware platforms - may have a drive format problem in some situations in generating the most reliable drive structure for NAS application . One hopes the moderators will sool the product boffins on to this . . . . <p> From what Ive seen any drive that has preloaded software will not work . On this drive that you have it has the Eco Manager on it along with a few other software programs . Also it could be due to the drive being 1.5tb . There is no acutal number of the size you can use but I have also seen it where the size of the USB drive can not exceed the size of the Linkstation . <p> Thanks a million for that . I was n't expecting any software to be pre-installed , and the whole intention of getting the HDD was to work with the drivestation anyway , and to minimise any possible incompatibilites by using the same brand of device . So I just followed the quick setup to plug it into the drivestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere does it indicate limits for any attached USB drive , which if true is an undocumented feature which should be ( documented ) . <p> The extracted ' drivenavi ' has 8 bits of software and manuals in multiple languages for each in a 200mb compressed self extracting file . Fortunately , the product window allows viewing before installing . It all looks intended for a PC , and as a result at the moment none of it is installed . With one exception , there 's nothing that looks remotely like something usable when attached to a LAN drive station , and covers the standard tools that are on a self respecting PC , or in the case of eco manager , the link station NAS to which it is attached . <p> The exception is the drive formatter . Several questions on this . <p> 1 . the manual for the drive station it says the default format is FAT32 , but the link station web management page says that the usb disk is just FAT . Can that be clarified ? ? ? <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package be used to format the usbdrive ( on the LAN via a share ) separately ? ? ( note that here I 'd intended to include a 51Kb jpg image of the drive structure which includes the shares and what 's on the top level of the USB drive share , but all the insert/edit image button above will allow is a url address . bummer . can someone advise how to do that ( simply paste an image in ) ? ? ) . <p> The link station format issues for an attached USB drive that are relevant to this are on pages 25 and 27 of the link station manual . <p> Ordinarily , formatting a drive past the ' are you sure ' bit ( or equivalent ) is brute force and will auto destroy the data on it . Clearly , in this case the pre-installed software is tagged somehow so that does n't happen . If I remove ( copy then delete ) the drivenavi stuff ( the pre installed software ) , eg to a CD or DVD , is there a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed properly - at least so I can test the limited drive size idea , and know that any failure is the result of something else like size , not marked data ? . <p> Y'know , if had I just went down to the local PC shop and bought any old USB drive , it would come formatted but clean - no pre-installed software to **bleep** up the installation with the buffalo prime product ( the link station NAS ) . Would have been cheaper too . I 've had incompatibility problems before - who has n't - and once bitten is enough . It surely seems like this is a case of same manufacturer = more incompatibilites , not less , and to compound it all the new USB drive from the same stable as the link station has no advice on NAS connections at all . Amazing . Simply putting the software on a CD with a formatted bare drive like most vendors do does seem to be an easier way . . . . <p> Following up a late thought - just checked the windows properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that the format of the shares on the network ( NAS and the usbdrive ) are both NTFS . Talk about confusing ! ! ! 
@@77980810 @6680810/ <p> Terastation Pro TS-1.6TGL/R5 with 1.04 firmware which I flashed last year sometime ( &gt; 3 years old with original hard drives ) <p> Woke up one morning to beeping and dreaded E04 ( ca n't load kernel ) error message with no link to my network - access light for hard disk #3 was steady green . After several reboots eventually got hard drive failure error message for drive #3 . <p> Replaced drive #3 ( original WD40000KD-00NAB0 , 400GB ) with new retail Seagate ( ST3500641AS-RK , 500GB ) drive . On reboot system gave RAID error message but network link was now available . I connected through web interface and rebuilt RAID ( took 6 hours ) array but then I got operation mode I12 ( degrade mode ) error message . Several random checks of files seems to indicate all is OK but I re-scaned RAID array ( another 6 hours ! ) anyway and still received the Operation mod I12 ( degrade mode ) error message on re-boot . E-mail message from system indicates RAID maintenance was finished ( but with no indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear this error message ? Do I really still have RAID errors or is there some system reset I need to do to remove the operation mode I12 error message ? Are different drive sizes ( 3 x 400GB + 1 x 500GB ) source of operation mode I12 error message ? <p> At this point I know I will only have access to 400GB of the new Seagate drive . However , I intend to replace , one-by-one all old WD drives with new 500GB to upgrade to max storage ( 4 x 500GB ) for Terastation Pro ( with RAID rebuild after each hard drive replace ) . <p> System was on for 3 days ( since 6/29/09 ) and the message ( I12 degradation mode ) never went away . Went away for the long weekend so I shut the system down . Started up this morning ( 7/6/09 ) and same behavior ( beeping with I12 degradation mode message during kernel loading ) but , in addition , I 've now lost network link ( " link speed , no link " message ) and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be working as access lights flickered on and off as normal during booting . <p> Try holding the Reset button as you power the unit on , it will display EM Mode Booting and then you can let go of the reset button . <p> Turn the unit off and take out drive 1 , turn the unit on . See if you can connect to it , if no- turn unit off put in drive 1 and take out drive 2 ... continue down the line . I want to guess that it will boot normally if you take out drive 3 , but check all of them so that we can see if there is a difference . <p> Is the replacement drive 7200rpm ? <p> Once you can get the unit to boot ... <p> Log into the web interface&gt; Maintanance&gt; Initialization&gt; Restore to Defaults ( resets all settings and does not touch the data ) . <p> After my last message this morning I starting in EM mode ( holding down reset switch ) and same result ( no link and I12 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 minute , reinserted power cord and then network cable and restarted normally . Result is that I am still in I12 mode but now I have my network link back ! I am now trying to get all my data off this unit ( I have another terastation pro II ) as quickly as possible because I suspect something else besides original hard drive failure is going on here . <p> Good news : I transferred all data off the TS so no data loss as far as I can tell now . <p> Bad news : I downloaded firmware and followed instructions to force the firmware update . Everything seemed to be going OK until the restart of the TS during the process . The firware update changed the name of the TS to " TS-TGL-EM " so when the updater waited for the TS to restart I got a timeout error . Now the TS is no longer accessable over my network . <p> The messages on the TS display now are as follows : <p> TS-TGL-EM <p> 192.168.11.150 D <p> -------------------- <p> -------------------- <p> Date Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other observations for the firmware update process : <p> 1 ) originally , the updater ( NASUpdater.exe ) could not find the TS on the network . Only when I changed the nasupdate.ini file to the following was the updater able to find the TS on the network and begin the process ( the name of my TS on my network is " TSP-ATLHOME " ) : <p> 2 ) when the updating process started I got the following message ( even after checking the " Ignore Current Version " box ) : <p> " TSP-ATLHOME 's boot version is same as writing boot version(1.23) <p> Boot update is skipped <p> 3 ) After the restart of the TS during the firmware upgrade process I received the following message : <p> " TSP-ATLHOME ca n't respond for 100 seconds - Retry again ? " I clicked " retry " and after another 100 seconds I got same message . I next clicked " cancel " and the message indicated that firmware upgrade was not successful . This left the TS in the state as I described above ( link speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my network via ping or web interface ) . <p> Where do I go from here ? As I said I 'm happy I got my data off the TS but now I want to get this thing operational again . And I 'm now very concerned about my other TS-ProII - if something goes wrong there in the future the recovery process better be more straightforward than this or I 'm in deep .... <p> Turned off TS and booted back into EM mode ( holding down reset switch ) . Turned off TS and booted again ( without holding down reset switch ) . This time TS came back up on my network with 192.168.1.105 ( evidently it used DHCP and my router assigned the 105 address ) . Now I can ping the box but web interface is not working . NASUpdater.exe and TsClient.exe both see the box but both show " - " in the firmware field . <p> Noticed that the " Version check " flag is set to " 1 " in the nasupdater.ini file - should this be set to " 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try again with firmware upgrade process unless I hear otherwise from someone . <p> Using debug mode I checked all boxes ( " Ignore Current Version " , " Format Completely " , " Clean User Area " ) . ***Warning : it appears that these settings delete all data , and sets Raid array to spanning mode - only do this if you have first transferred all your data to another location off of the TS . <p> The firmware process started without issues . At the first restart of the TS I got the " TS-TGL-EM ca n't respond for 100 seconds - Retry again ? " error message . This is because after restart the IP address on the TS was for some reason set to " 192.168.11.150 " . I manually restarted the TS ( in EM mode with the reset button ) and the TS now rebooted to " 192.168.1.105 " ( evidently router assigned by DHCP ) . <p> I then clicked the " retry " button in the NASUpdater.exe application and the firmware upgrade process continued . The large file ( 40 MB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restart of the TS . After restart the TS is yet again set to IP " 192.168.11.150 " and the name has been changed to " TS-TGL261 " . Of course , I get the same " TS-TGL-EM ca n't respond ... " error message ( name change and IP address change ) . I maually restarted the TS ( in EM mode ) again and the TS rebooted to " 192.168.1.105 " - but this time the TS was now web interface accessible . <p> However , when accessing the TS ( " TS-TGL261 " with IP = 192.168.1.105 ) all the webpages are in Japanese ! No - I ca n't read Japanese - I just was lucky to have another TS which I could refer to to figure where to change the language settings . On the basic page ( 2nd in the list on the left ) I changed : <p> 1 ) name : to " TS-TGL-EM " <p> 2 ) display language : English ( 2nd item in the drop down list ) <p> 3 ) windows client language : CP437 ( 2nd item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " apply " button ( bottom of page ) all Japanese characters changed to English so that I could at least read the configuration pages again . <p> Now that the TS name was again set to " TS-TGL-EM " I went back to the NASUpdater.exe application and clicked " retry " . This time the application found the TS on the network and reported back that the firmware update was successful . So - forced firmware upgrade complete but with some workarounds ! <p> Going back to the web interface I reset all my configurations ( static IP address , name to " TSP-ATLHOME " , etc . ) . I also found that the RAID array 1 was reset to spanning mode so I deleted the RAID array 1 and reconfigured all four hard drives into a new RAID 5 array . <p> As I write this the TS is now going through the process of scanning the newly created RAID array ( all drive access lights flickering and display shows " I17 RAID array 1 resyncing " message - probably will take hours to complete this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . I can access the TS though my network ( ping and web interface ) and the I12 degrade error message that started this whole thread no longer appears in the display . Of course I will still have to transfer all data back up to the unit when the RAID array setup is complete . <p> I hope this is the last you will hear of this problem . I do n't know if what I observed is typical or is symptomatic of a problem that is still lurking in the background . If something is still wrong I 'm sure I 'll be back with more questions . <p> Thanks to all who helped get me this far . I hope what I experienced was not entirely unique so that it may help others who may have problems with their TSs.

Forward and reverse <p> Now here is where I got confused . In the NAS/ network settings when you are setting it up for Active Directory you must enter the correct informationNetBIOS Name . Here you want the NetBios Name of your domain not the NAS . For example if the Domain is Acme.com then the NetBios name is ACME . Google how to find NETbios name of the domain if you are not sure . Then DNS NAME : Again here they want to knwo the DNS NAme of the Domain not the NAS so in our example it would be Acme.Com <p> Finally the name of the domain controller . This should be on the same network segment as the NAS but I have not tested in on different segments .

The problem is that when he is up/downloading anything , it dominates the bandwidth . I can watch the throughput drop to almost nothing for my downloads when he switches it on and begins to download files . ... and yes , I have literally had him sitting on the couch with me in order to verify that is the case . I made sure to turn down all other equipment before I did this in order to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit the amount of bandwidth the Kindle uses while it is active on my network and downloading files ? Can I turn it off completely ? I 've looked at the QoS IP and MAC settings and tweaked around with no improvement . What do I need to do ? Thanks , Oskaar <p> First off i would hit their downloads support site and get a more up to date build . I believe you should have 19154 available to you , QoS before 17990 was rather hit and miss , after 17990 is much better . After you upgrade , i would then assign a static DHCP lease IP to the aformentioned devices - then enable QoS and enter your up/down values , remember - only use 80% of each up and down . After that , in the IP section , then have an entry for their ip that you assigned to the devices and assign priority to bulk . Bulk will ensure that they will only get bandwidth if no other person is doing something else on the network . If someone else is doing something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandwidth . Good for P2P apps and bandwidth hogs in general . I also say use the IP and not the MAC because when you use the MAC it adds much overhead to the shaping process , thus eating up alot of CPU cycles to perform , when you use the IP it eliminates this overhead . <p> Thank you buddee , I will upgrade the build and roll in the settings you suggest . I 'm upgrading my bandwidth this Thursday so I will be able to make the changes while I have everything disconnected . I 'll echo back here once I have rolled the changes into production . <p> OK , so after what was a couple of weeks worth of delays , I 'm all upgraded ( which happened the same day as Buddee 's advice ) to the latest Buffalo version of ddwrt .. My bandwidth upgrade took longer due to several issues in getting the cable actually pulled underground to my house . Let 's just say that TWC had to do some serious repair and upgrades to get my bandwidth SLA met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down my AT&amp;T DSL line . I 'll be tweaking the routers with the QoS settings . I 'm thinking that because my roomate has 3 devices I should isolate them on a VLAN in order to apply the QoS setting , only I 'm not so sure how to do that using two routers . Should I set this up differently , or should I stick with WDS ? <p> I was wondering about that after reading the FAQs on Setting up a Wireless Bridge and Setting up a Guest Network ( thank you for the additional helpful posts in the Guest Network thread ) . Baji seems to have a good step by step process on his blog , but I noted that he posted a response to a comment from another poster about less than successful QoS and Traffic Shaping with the settings as described in his process . The traffic shaping I understand ; we use Riverbed devices for traffic shaping in each of our global offices and it 's still not perfect . But , I wonder with simple up/downstream traffic ( video , NNTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaping I need . <p> In any case , based on the two WZR-HP-G300NH2 routers now at revision 19154 which scenario would be best suited . I do n't stream Netflix , Hulu , etc , nor do I stream music , webcasts or the like . I 'm an old-school NNTP , FTP and usenet guy with a metric F-LOAD of storage and I run XBMC , with Sickbeard and Couch Potato to manage my shows/movies . I 'm now on TWC 50 Mb/s down , 5 Mb/s up and am about to embark on an unfettered orgy of NNTP downstream traffic to catch up on shows I 've been putting off for too long . <p> Well , mainly sticking with your original post , i would assign the room-mate 's kindle fire a QoS rules only - you could leave your devices out of the QoS table altogether , from step 1 i would figure out the wireless MAC of that device , easy to find as it should be in your router 's DHCP table , then i would use DNSMasq/DHCP in services to assign it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it accordingly with the max up/down values for WAN , then add an entry for that IP you assigned into IP Netmask and assign that device to bulk priority , that will make sure when you have other devices using the internet , that the kindle device would only get the bulk of whatever bandwidth is left after the other devices usages.

I posted a detailed explanation of the situation over a month ago , and no one even responded . <p> While updating the firmware on my LS-WX1.0TL/R1 the thing completely died ( no power issues , no network issues or anything during the update - the update just failed ) and virtually bricked the unit . After several weeks of wrestling with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boot files and go into EM Mode and " apparently " be recognized by NasNavigator , and LSUpdater . <p> NasNavigator , and ( sometimes ) LSUpdater see the NAS but whenever I try to run LSUpdater , it always says it ca n't find the NAS , popping up a window that says : <p> " No response from LS-WXL-EMC64 . Please check your network settings . The LS-WXL- EMC64 and your computer should be on the same subnet . Temporarily disable firewalls and try again . " <p> I do n't have any firewalls on , I 'm in Windows 7 ( 32 bit ) in " Safe With Networking " mode . <p> I have tried to change the subnet in my NIC to 255.255.0.0 . No joy . I also tried changing the subnet to 255.255.0.0 AND the IP address to 192.254.164.118 ( and also 120 ) , to see if that made a difference . Again , no joy . <p> How can the PC see the NAS , let it pull the TFTP Boot files , have it show up in NasNavigator AND LSUpdater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when LSUpdater starts ? <p> I just went through the same issue . When the drive rebooted , it was still connected directly to my PC and was not able to pick up an IP address from DHCP . I plugged it back into the network , did the TFTP thing again and when it reboot to solid blue , it had a good IP . I flipped my system back to DHCP and it found it . I then was able to update it . Hope this helps <p> I ran lsupdater using your suggested options and the array appears to set up correctly . But when I open web setting I get a page in japanese ( I think - anyway , it sure ai n't  ' English ) . I can enter admin and password but I get another japanese page . How can I change the default language back to english ? I just noticed on the array folder infojapanese . I guess I need to get english from somewhere . <p> After a power outage I 'm getting the notorious 7 blinking lights . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I added the appropriate flags to the ini file . I 'm trying to restore the firmware since it seems to be missing in the lsupdater " --- " . However , I would like to restore the firmware while retaining my data and partitions , the reason I bought a raid capable nas in the first place . I added NoFormatting = 1 to the ini file and unchecked the rewrite partition option in debug mode but it still warns me that it will format all data on the Target when I click update . Is this expected behaviour ? Can I pull out one of the drives just in case it formats the existing drive so I can restore my data from the drive I remove ? The model version is ls-w1.0tgl/r1 Thanks <p> I finally found the soluiton . Rip the HD out of the Linkstation and use UFS Explorer to pull the content off onto another NTFS Raid solution . Do n't think I would have been as pissed had I been able to use NTFS in the first place and there had been a NAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , just wanting to double check the procedure really . If I run the updater ( which I currently ca n't as it says it is up to date ) hence the force an update link I ended up here with . I 've had a problem with DLAN saying firmware is updating , support mentioned it may have failed and I needed to force an update hence the question here . <p> Was just wondering If I alter the file to force through the update will it format the drives and erase any data I have on it ?

The error message is the I11 bad sectors error . I did a disk check using the built in disk check utility , but it comes back with " Disk Check has completed successfully . " I 've reformatted and still get the I11 error message popping up . Does anyone know what this error is ? Is it serious ? How do you turm off the repeated pop up ? <p> Had a similar problem with my 1TB Linkstation Live where the NAS Navigator screen showed the following message with a question mark on the linkstation Icon " I11 : The bad sectors of disk 1 reaches emergency level . " Also had the yellow light flashing ( flash , flash , pause , flash , pause , flash flash , pause .. and so on ) did n't know what this means and could not find any more details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change . So discovered the ' restart ' function in the System , Maintenance , section and restarted the linkstation . This seems to have sorted the problem ( for now at least ) . The blue light is back and all seems to be okay . Do n't know how long it will last . Does anyone know how you deal with bad sectors ? The drive is only three months old . Is it a problem that 's permanent ? Would I be covered by the guarantee ? <p> Hi - I got the same message this weekend on my Terastation ( Bad sector warning I11 / Drive 1 ) . My Terastation is about 2 years old . I rebooted and the error message is gone , but it was worrisome because when the error message was showing up , some files were not accessible .

I 'm assuming it 's a 250GB SATA drive . <p> you would purchase a drive that is the same size as the other 3 drives , also at 7200 RPM 's . To swap the drive you would need to power down the unit and remove the defective drive , than place in the replacement drive and boot the system back up . Upon booting within the admin web GUI under disk mgmt select " Rebuild Raid Array " and let it do its things <p> For rebuilding the array as long as you verify the disk you replaced is the disk that you need to check in the administration interface , than select the option to rebuild the array and let it do ots thing and you will be good , no data will be lost

Restarting the whole linkstation <p> 2 . Enabling and disabling " automatic update " under the MediaServer tab <p> 3 . Pressing " refresh now " under the MediaServer tab <p> 4 . Pressing the " Restart Media Server " button under the MediaServer tab <p> 5 . Pressing the " Update DTCP-IP Function " button under the MediaServer tab <p> 6 . Changing the " Media Server Folder " under the MediaServer tab <p> 7 . Waiting for several hours for the " refresh " interval to come and go several times .

NAS navigator was showing an IP address of 169.254.32.248 and a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 both of which were not within the range of my network . I tried updating the firmware , the updater reported no drive found . I connected the drive directly to my PC and changed the IP address to a static one - no change . I tried changing the range on my router to match that of the NAS- no change . Factory reset achieved nothing except I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - flashing blue , centre - flashing red 6 times , bottom - green -flashing as if to indicate disk activity .

Both drives appeared formatted and partitioned correctly.I would like to try and fix this NAS and am looking for suggestions for a possible cure . Would installing another new drive restore things as the firmware would no longer see a damaged drive or shall I just throw it in the pond ?

Apparently the " check for updates " in the GUI does n't work , as it was not showing pro-v3.0 <p> I 'm trying the steps gatorparrot has provided -- I just do n't seem to have the timing right with my WZR-600DHP .

If that is true , what sell these as DD-WRT compatible routers ? ? ? <p> So I then tried the TFTP thing for a couple of hours and nothing . I did both the special Arp MAC and the device MAC . I 've tried all the timing and resetting . Nothing . Read the Wiki , forms , tried all posted items - I never see the tftp client take . The router boots into normal mode . I 've done power cycles and hard resets . Just nothing . <p> So why is it so hard to upgrade a DD-WRT compatible router to DD-WRT ? ?

When I disable , initialize , and enable the Bittorrent , the speed goes back to normal . Unfortunately , I have to reload the torrent trackers to the queue , and Bittorrent has to recheck the files before resuming downloads . <p> Had exactly the same problem today after updating to firmware 1.60 . I then found out that it is only magnet links that do n't  work - torrent files still work OK . I went back to version 1.56 by forcing it to downgrade but still got the same problem . So maybe it is not due to the 1.60 firmware . <p> I remember that magnet links originally did n't  work in the Buffalo bittorrent .

When I do check , should it be enabled or disabled ? <p> I 'm having the same types of issues with two LS410D units on the same network . <p> One is currently only a DLNA server . <p> The other runs BitTorrent and serves as the backup to my main backup unit ( an older Buffalo drive ) and as a backup for the DLNA server . I also use it for video file conversion - the file to be converted and the converted file are stored there while another machine on the network does the conversion . <p> The DLNA server will randomly quit serving . Sometimes I can reconnect to it immediately ( using Roku ) , sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to come back up . The Roku and the rest of the network is hardwired - NOT using wireless . Sometimes the Roku reports file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the file plays fine . The units are all set to static IPs ( MAC binding on the Roku ) . <p> ( I have eliminated the Roku as the issue , I have 2 different Roku versions , both on static IPs and neither using wireless , and DLNA failure happens with both and in the exact same way . ) <p> The BT/backup unit does the same thing - randomly goes offline . It sometimes happens during backups . It sometimes happens when files are being accessed or moved . It sometimes happens when a video is being converted . There is no pattern . Sometimes I can convert videos for 12 hours straight before it quits , sometimes 10 minutes . Sometimes there 's nothing going on at all and I try to connect and it just is n't there . Keep in mind I do n't have something like video conversion going all the time on this unit , just sometimes , and even then the box that handles that is running an old 100 mb ( not gigabit ) network card so it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in any case . It should be perfectly capable of handling 1000% of the traffic I throw at it , and there are no other users on the network . <p> Both units are showing to be using firmware 1.34-0.95 , although oddly the " check for update " does n't seem to work because one was using outdated firmware for a long time and always said there was no update . Finally it said there was an update when I logged in , but I had been prompted to install the update to the other unit a full month prior and had logged in many times on both units . In any case , the firmware updates did n't solve the issue . <p> To answer your questions , on my units the following settings:File Sharing : both running SMB , one also running FTP . No special users or groups have been set up.Services : one unit running DLNA only , the other nothingApplications : non-DLNA unit running BitTorrent only and only sometimes , other unit nothingBackup : DLNA unit backs up to the BT unit ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleep timers offAlso , frame size on the network lan settings are both set to 1500 <p> These units are n't really doing anything special and are n't used as office file servers . They see very little traffic except for when videos are being converted or watched via DLNA , and even then it 's only one user . Nothing special is going on with them , but they constantly and randomly have this same issue . <p> Since one is running some services/apps and the other is not ( or neither is running it ) , and they 're having the same issue , it would seem the following can be eliminated as issues:1. backup2 .

The customer just informed me they get a notice about the latest firmware and to update . I am going to do this tomorrow . If it does not resolve the problem , I am going to have to honor my business commitment and replace the device .

The machine disappears from the network , and then usually comes right back up but sometimes requires a reboot . If you 've ever had to update network card drivers on an office full of machines , you know what I mean . <p> They 're acting like the network cards are resetting or something similar is going on . <p> Sometimes it returns to the network on its own within a few seconds.Sometimes it returns to the network on its own in about 30 seconds.Sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can't.A few times I 've tried the GUI and the page comes up blank and wo n't load anything but the gray background , and refreshing does n't help.I do n't use NAS Navigator.Sometimes it will stay up for a full day.Sometimes it dies again in 10 minutes . <p> Ok , I will update the firmware and report back . It 's important to note that the units are still reporting that there is no firmware update from the GUI . <p> Also , when I was messing around in the GUI on my DLNA unit , I noticed that the attached device list had my Sonos speakers listed . So I unchecked them and tried watching something on the Roku . It made the DLNA unusable . It crashed and reset about every 2-3 minutes . I went back in and re-checked the Sonos speakers and it went back to crashing every 20-30 minutes . <p> I unplugged all Sonos components to see if it made any further change , but it did n't - the unit still crashed as before .

The option to Start or Not Start this application when windows is started can be changed by selecting the " Menu " dropdown , then removing or adding the check mark next to the item " Launch NASNavigator2 on startup " by simply left clicking on the text . I typically have this disabled and do n't launch it unless I need it .

On my system , the nassvc.exe file loads at PC boot time and the NAS Device starts up about the same time as the Windows Login Screen appears . I do n't have to login to get the device file to load and send the start up signal to the NAS Device . The NAS Device will start up and continue to run until I power off the PC or login to Windows and kill the process in Task Manager . The NAS device will shut down within about a minute or so of this process being terminated by killing it in Task Manager or after the last PC on the network that is running the nassvc.exe file is shut down or disconnected from the network . <p> As for nassche.exe , I have not yet discovered what the purpose of this file really is yet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all I can find is that its a " NAS Function Scheduling Application " . Scheduling what task ?

I have disabled it in Task Manager and nothing appears to happen . The NAS Device seems to run just fine without it , so perhaps an official Buffalo Tech Support Rep can tell us specifically what its purpose is , or if it is a left over file from an earlier version of the NASNavigator bundle of files , and whether or not its needed any longer . Anything I can do to minimize the number of files loaded at start time is a benefit , and I would really like to know what this one does and whether or not I need to keep running it . <p> Is anyone still trying to turn their NAS drive on from outside their network ?

I purchased two of these routers to use with Hawkin HAO14SDP antennas for a point-to-point network between me and a neighbor . <p> After setting up the router it worked fine for most of the day , but then suddenly , after adjusting some wireless settings , it started to drop packets like crazy and my internet speed slowed to a literal crawl ( I 'm on a 20mb/10mb plan , and it was transferring at 3.5kb/s , no exaggeration ) . Wheras normally my pings to the gateway of my ISP average between 6ms and 10ms , it would now jump between anywhere from 40ms to 2000ms , often dropping multiple pings in between . Clearly this made the router all but useless for me . <p> I tried flashing to the latest official Buffalo DD-WRT firmware ( Build 14998 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing to the " user friendly " Buffalo firmware , and that DID solve it , but , frankly , that firmware is confusing and a mess , and not an effective solution for me . Unfortunately , when flashing back to DD-WRT the flash failed mid flash and bricked my router ( no amount of attempts with TFTP worked to fix this ) . <p> I replaced the router with the second WHR-HP-G300N I had bought , and again saw that it was having the exact same issues , ruling out a problem with the hardware . After much experimentation , I found that the latest beta build of DD-WRT for the device ( build 15962 ) solved the problem . Trying different versions of DD-WRT showed that somewhere between the last official Buffalo DD-WRT build and the latest beta the issue had been resolved , although I 'm not sure exactly when . Brainslayer may be able to she 'd light on this . <p> So , in summary , here is what is proven by me : <p> * The issue only shows up when using a Static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when using Automatic ( DHCP ) mode. * The issue is resolved in the latest beta build of DD-WRT ( 15962 at the time of this post ) . * The issue does not show up when using the official " user friendly " firmware by Buffalo for the device . <p> I hope this information is useful for any other owners , or potential owners , of the device out there who have been experiencing the problem , or for any developers who may have solved the issue unwittingly and are interested to see this . <p> As a final note , I apologize for not taking screen captures of my pinging results in between trying different solutions , but my level of frustration was higher than my interest in documentation last night . : smileyhappy : <p> Thank you so much for this post . Can you include instructions on flashing to the beta build ? I have been waiting for buffalo to release a new version for months , however they do n't  seem to care about customer woes ... <p> Flash to the buffalo-to-ddwrt webflash firmware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , after that has been flashed , flash to the normal firmware file at that link . Make sure to " reset to default settings " with each flash . <p> A word of caution : once you flash to standard DD-WRT like this , you will be unable to restore to official firmware files without a very long , complex , and unguaranteed process . I am currently running this build on two routers just fine , and do n't plan on going back to the official any time soon , but still , it is something to keep in mind . 
@@77980926 @6680926/ <p> The same question was asked a few days prior on the forums . As of current time is OSX 10.7 is still in the beta stages there is no formal support for this OS yet . As with all betas there are a series of bugs floating around the operating system that will cause limitations with connections and functionality with various devices . The best source of information at this point will be from other users within the forums , either from Buffalo or from Apple forums . <p> AFP no longer works in Lion because Apple has dropped support for for DHCAST128 authentication for security reasons . Manufacturers like Buffalo would have to support newer and more secure DHX2 standard to make their drives work again in 10.7 <p> I tried connecting via FTP ( I 'm using Lion , with non-existent AFP or SMB ) . The Terastation mounts , but the Terastation ( Pro I ) is read only . I tried all sorts of things , including spending an hour with Tech Support ( Buffalo ) but no progress . 
@@77980927 @6680927/ <p> I 've owned a Buffalo Linkstation 210 model LS210D0301 ( ie : 3TB , single drive ) for just under 2 yrs when I suddenly could no longer access the files and noticed that the red LED was blinking 2 long flashes and 2 short flashes . I powered down , and back up the unit and it now consistently has 7 short flashes of the Red LED . <p> My understanding is 7 blinks indicates " Problem with the RAM , Ethernet Controller , or IDE Host Controller . " Does this mean that the contents of the drives is recoverable ? I do have a backup of the critical documents on the drive , but I do n't  have one for the media ( music , shows , and films ) and would like to recuperate it as much as possible . <p> I 've already talked with tech support , and I 've received the instructions on manually flashing a software update to see if I 'm able to recuperate the unit . I wont be able to try it till tomorrow night , but in the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update does n't  render my NAS accessible , I see three possibilities : <p> 1 ) RMA the unit , get a replacement drive but loose the media files on it . 2 ) RMA the unit , get a replacement drive and pay Buffalo $$$$ to retrieve the data . 3 ) Disassemble the unit voiding the warranty , but allowing me an opportunity of dropping the drive into a desktop and attempting to retrieve the files that way . <p> Are there any other options via USB or Ethernet to access the drives ? Obviously the third would not be supported / recommended by Buffalo , but given its a 200$ NAS I figure its worth considering given its significantly cheaper than having a third party retrieve the data . So my question is what 's the chances that the data is intact on the drive itself ? Has someone seen/posted a disassembly guide ( I 'd like to know how difficult it would be ) ? Once the drive is out , is there a guide to retrieving the files ? <p> If you go with option three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I 'm guessing it runs some linux XFS variant . When my parent 's LS 420 recently choked , I grabbed a copy of UFS Explorer Standard . It reads the LS 420 hdds , as well as some older hdds that I pulled out of older NAS boxes . I ca n't speak to your LS 210 , but the other single-disk NAS boxes from which I pulled hard drives were incredibly difficult to open without damaging the enclosure . But there were youtube videos showing how the disks could be pulled . Good luck . <p> Ok , I finally got around to trying to flash the new software to the unit , and it is inaccessible through its ethernet port so far . <p> I have to decide if I open it up , voiding the warranty , in hopes of retrieving some media files or return it as is to the manufacturer . Problem is that I do n't  know if the actual hard drive is toast , or just the drive controller . Does anyone have any experience of retrieving files from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off that drive is I do open it up ? <p> In surfing around , I just realized that there was some ambiguity in the instructions they sent me to manually flash the firmware , and there are other things I could try . Both the firmware updater and NAS navigator do n't  see the NAS and in that case they recommend : <p> Quote <p> **NOTE** If you are having issues with the firmware update not finding the unit or you are getting errors please try these troubleshooting steps . <p> Try resetting your unit by following these steps. Switch the unit to off and wait until the lights are off. Hold the function button for 10 seconds while it is still off. While still holding the function button after 10 seconds please flip the switch to on. Once the function light begins to blink release the function button and press it again for one second. Wait until the power light is solid and this will restore your unit . <p> I tried this several times incase my timing was off ... with no luck . Since my NAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never become " solid " even after a reset , so I proceeded with this part : <p> Quote <p> 1 . Boot your PC in to Safe Mode With Networking and attach the unit directly to your PC . This will prevent any firewalls , antivirus or software from preventing the updater from doing its job . Example : Updater can not find the unit or pass authentication . <p> 2 . Hold the reset button while booting the unit which will boot the unit in to Emergency Mode ( EM Mode ) . The reset button is on the back of the Linkstations and is behind the door underneath the LCD screen on the TeraStations . <p> 3 . When the unit boots ( LinkStations - solid power light , TeraStations - When you see the host name of the unit ) reset the unit and give it 1-2 minutes to reset . Run the Nas Navigator . Then set your computer 's IP address to a static IP address of the same range that the unit received from your PC with the same subnet . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit to PC via Ethernet . The unit should NOTE : If you do n't know how to change your IP address on your computer you can find out how to do that for Windows ( XP , Vista or 7 ) . <p> Again , light never goes solid , and NAS navigator and the firmware updater never see the unit ... so I do not know what its IP address is , making it difficult to set the PCs IP in the same range . In in command prompt , I did notice my Ethernet port took an address in the 169.254.0.0 range , and this is where I believe leaves room for more exploring . <p> On that web page , they mention that the NAS in EM mode ( Engineering Mode -or- Emergency Mode ) would take an IP in that range . So it seems I have managed to get the unit in EM mode ... and they suggest using IP 169.254.11.1 and subnet mask 255.255.0.0 , a combo I have n't yet tried . <p> Unfortunately that was not part of the Buffalo supplied instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there are actually no options at all . <p> So I re-tried to manually reinstall the Buffalo firmware with the NAS directly plugged into a computer in Safe Mode , using the fixed IP of 169.254.11.1 and yet I cant seem to see the unit . Here are a couple of screen shots of my network setting and ipconfig results <p> Yet , NAS Navigator and LSupdate does n't  find any Buffalo NAS connected so I ran an IP Scanner to see what it would find on my network <p> I recognize everything on that network , and definitely see no LS210 ( note how my iOmega and Segate NASs both appear ) . <p> I 'm wondering if there are any other tests I can do , or if the unit simply has got a dead network adapter ? The key being I want to retrieve the files on the NAS and not just get it workingThanks again ... <p> Thanks for the info MiG174 I was afraid I might have to start with the TFTP boot image ( I 'm still in the midst of learning this NASs tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be followed with reformatting the entire drive ? : -/ <p> Buffalo has already offered to replace the unit , but the catch is I 'd like to save the data on the NAS which I cant seem to access without breaking the case open and voiding my warranty ( Its a single drive unit , and not a user serviceable inside ) . <p> In your experience , do you feel this is just a software issue and not a failing drive ? If so , would the files be intact if I used Linux or UFS Explorer Access to extract them from the raw drive ? <p> p.s . What makes you think that the disk is not removable , all sealed box ? <p> I realise its just a standard hard drive in the Buffalo plastic case but the LS210 is a single drive NAS with no visible fasteners to hold the case together and opening it will void the Buffalo warranty . <p> I 've tried searching photos or videos of a disassembled one so that I could figure how the thing snaps together ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just suspect that several of the snap clips will break . <p> Ok , I will try restoring the firmware over the TFTP without the format option I was just afraid ( given I do n't  have any experience with this ) that it might corrupt the files on the other partition of the drive . <p> Then , if I understand correctly , once I 'm able to get the drive back on the network , I extract the data partition using SSH in ACP Commander without opening the case ? <p> I really appreciate the help I 'll give this all a try , hopefully over the weekend . <p> You are right that my knowledge in Linux is very limited and I do understand that recovering the data my might escape me . Given that these NASs are pretty inexpensive , I decided to open up my single drive unit and try and recuperate the data from the raw drive <p> 1 ) Disassembled NAS , and removed hard drive ( I 'll be posting some pictures for those looking to opening one up ) 2 ) Connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The computer would hang after displaying the Windows logo4 ) Trying to boot into safe mode made no difference5 ) Disconnected the drive , booted into Windows , and then reconnected the drive via a USB to SATA hub that supports drives up to 8TB6 ) Tried running SeaTools , but it did not see the drive <p> 7 ) Windows " Disk Management " does see an Unallocated unknown Disk 1 of 3.86GB despite it being 3TB <p> I tried the demo of EaseUS Data Recovery , and it sees the drive but finds no recoverable files on it9 ) I also tried PhotoRec 6.1 Recover utility , which sees the drive as 4142MB / 3950MiB and returns an error reading each sector <p> I 'm looking for ideas of what to try next , and/or which software I should be investigating ? 
@@77980928 @6680928/ <p> I have a LS-XHL2.0TL ? , firmware 1.41 , which has been quietly working for months with no dramatics . This evening I copied some big files to it ; when I came back to my computer , I found that the the LS had been disconnected from the network . I was able to access Properties , and discovered that it was completely full ( I do n't know if that was in real time , since it had by that time been disconnected , or some sort of " last gasp " artifact ) . The light was solid orange , it was making soft clicking noises ( I think it 's generally been pretty quiet up to now ) , and NAS Navigator reported showed no drives . <p> I unplugged it and re-plugged it a couple of times ; each time I got first a flashing blue light , then a steady orange light , but no sign of a connection . However , the third or fourth time ( after I had started this panicky message ) , the light remained orange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAS Navigator , and I was able to access my data and re-map a drive letter . Properties on the the drive , confirmed by NAS Navigator , now show as 1.34 TB used out of 1.80 . Obviously , though the solid orange light indicates a certain unhappiness in the drive--or is it just telling me that it was getting full ? <p> I know that I should be backing everything up , but the LS is my backup drive . How do you back up a 2 TB drive--with a 4 TB one ? As I type this , I 'm copying my most important files ( various install programs and files--it seemed like a good idea to keep these on an external dirve ) to my computer ; when this is done , I guess I should use NAS Navigator Web Access to System Storage Check Disk . <p> Other than practicing redundancy and running CheckDisk , should I be doing something to make the disk feel better ? Is it time for panic , or just concern ? Should I be getting another LS to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of comfort gratefully accepted . Thanks . Goodnight . --Howard <p> Later : Checking the disk . A disquieting message : " Checking/formatting disk ... All features are disabled until the disk is completely checked/formatted . " I would actually prefer a less generic message that tells me that my disk is being checked , non-destructively , and not being formatted ... Well , the check finished with no message , good or bad , which I will take as a good sign--but should n't it give some kind of a report after a check ? --H <p> A clicking noise is never good . That usually means the drive is physicaly defective in some way . You most likely need a new disk . The orange light was probably telling you that it was checking the disk . I doubt that the unit is actually formatting . I would wait for the disk check to finish and see what the status is after that . I would get a second unit . I would recommend a unit with RAID . <p> I also have my LS-XHL1.0TL with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can get into the configuration or access the shares with no problems . The only new in the configuration screen it is the message a new firmaware it is found . The amber light it is an information light ( no error light ) maybe the solid amber light it is the advice for a new firmware ? ? ? Can somebody confirm this ? <p> I 'm honestly not sure as I have not seen that before . Go ahead and do the update and see the error light goes away . I had mine check to see if there was a firmware update . I am leaving it in that state and when I get home I am going to check to see if the amber light is solid . <p> The solid amber/orange light is telling you there is a firmware update for the box . It is a bit annoying Buffalo does n't inform about this ... It seems a warning/error in the box . <p> I can confirm this restarting the box with no network attached or at least not connection to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My box starting with the solib blue light as always , then connect the internet and after that the box becomes orange/amber and the msg appears in the config. page . <p> Well , I checked , and there was indeed a new firmware release ( 1.42 as opposed to the 1.41 I was running ) ; I downloaded it and ran it ( with some unease , since it appeared that the " Read Me First ! " file was empty ) ; lo and behold , my LS is now running comfortably with a solid blue light . It 's pretty quiet now--I think that the quiet clicking I heard before must have been normal for large data flows ( it was n't anywhere near the kind of furious clicking I 've heard from drives that were really in trouble , or " the click of Death " I used to hear from my Zip drives . ( Gee , a storage medium that actually held 100 MB , dwarfing those 3.5 " diskettes ! High tech ! ) <p> So I guess that the orange light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmware available , and I guess that it was just a coincidence ( still within Auric Goldfinger 's definition ) that this happened at the same time that I was copying a whole lot of data and the device disconnected from the network . Still , I have learned a valuable lesson about the necessity of redundant backups . <p> As a sometime developer , I have to question the wisdom of using an operational error indicator ( the device 's sole LED ) to show a routine informational message ( undocumented , as far as I know ) about the availability of new firmware . Perhaps a dedicated LED for this might be overkill , but there 's a whole operating system inside the LS , and I ca n't imagine that it could be that hard to put , in NAS Navigator Web View , " New firmware is available " right under the report of the current firmware . <p> Anyway , I guess that all 's well that ends well , and tonight at least I am a happy camper with my LS . Thanks again to the number of people who responded . --Howard

Here is a setup for everyone to use as I hope this thread will be the last time anyone needs to dig for weeks to get this fixed . <p> I have a XP laptop directly ethernetted to the NAS with a patch cord . My lappy ip is the gateway for the nas ; for non I.T . people it 's 192.168.11.1 , subnet is 255.255.0.0 , and gateway is 192.168.11.1 . My nas is 192.168.11.150 .

There is no AV and no firewall since this laptop is not on the internet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmware update will fail with a password incorrect error .

I have rebooted everything and I can not find any way to get the firmware onto the disks . <p> Any help is appreciated . I will try and find a way to upload some pic 's or a vid . <p> But then when all is done , I curiously get at Japanese webpage when I try to web to the NAS .

@@77980937 @6680937/ <p> Quick backstory : a friend of mine gave me a Terastation TS-RIX4.0TL/R5 , with the disclaimer of " I ca n't get the firmware to load ; if you can fix it , you can have it " , keeping the existing disks for another project . So , I understand if the answer is " you 're simply screwed " , but it would be nice to have this handy device up and running in some capacity . The good news is that a solution involving " nuke it from orbit " ( figuratively speaking , of course ) is a perfectly acceptable set of procedures here . <p> I 've installed a single disk for the purpose of initial configuration and acclamation to the system ; I 'm not looking to create a RAID at this juncture . However , while the manual indicates that a JBOD setup should be practical , it 's unclear whether it will throw a temper tantrum if there is n't a disk in every slot . The disk is blanked out ; there are no partitions on the drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't seem to see the Terastation . Presumably , this is acceptable , due to the implicit necessity of working firmware for that application to work . I have the ZIP file for the 1.65 firmware update . I 've static IP 'd my laptop and have an ethernet cable directly connecting the two of them , with a static IP in the same 169.254. x.y subnet . The firmware update utility sees the NAS , but when I attempt to flash it , I get the error " Partition not found . Aborting firmware update " . I also tried loading the firmware blob on a USB flash drive and hope it would pick up ; no dice there , either . The NAS will ping , but it does n't telnet , SSH , or HTTP as far as I can tell . The manual does n't seem to address this scenario ; Google searches have brought me other forum posts like this one LONG ... and others mentioning a " Kirkwood TFTP " application , which I had no success with , either - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests actually made , so it would seem . I also tried what was listed on this blog post LONG ... but did n't get anywhere , and the " force firmware update " procedures did n't seem all that useful , either . <p> The LCD reads that it 's in " Emergency Mode " with a red backlight , eventually turning a nifty magenta color . After some time , the fans power down entirely . <p> I greatly appreciate any and all available asistance with getting this NAS to work . <p> This formatted the drives and forced the firmware to be uploaded . It did take a couple of attempts for the firmware flash to finally take ; at one point it complained about the inability to make a TCP handshake ... but the magical ' reset ' button seemed to help aplenty in that regard . <p> Do note that the entire point of this exercise was to force a factory reset on this NAS , and had there been any data on the disks I cared about , I 'd be screwed . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place by way of a NAS with actual data on it , I strongly recommend taking a desktop , a handful of SATA cables , and an Ubuntu disk out first , because this WILL completely wipe your drives ... I happened to have been in a place where that was the goal . <p> Bonus tip : My firmware flash was in Japanese . If you end up with the same issue , log in with the default credentials ( admin/password ) . Choose the second button in the top , charcoal greyish header bar . Leave it at the first option in the light grey header beneath it , then expand the fourth maroon option bar .

@@77980939 @6680939/ <p> I copied all data from TS1 to LS1 using the following xcopy command on my XP system : <p> &gt;xcopy /D /E /C /H /R /K /I TS1Share LS1Share <p> This took the better part of a day to complete , but it copied all of the files from TS1 to LS1 . <p> Then , to ensure I picked up whatever files might have changed on TS1 during the lengthy copy period , I issued the same xcopy command again . I expected it to copy about 5 or 6 files . Unfortunately , it copied about 1/3rd of the files again ( tens of thousands of files ) . <p> After some experimenting , I concluded that xcopy was being given incorrect " modified " date stamps for *some* of the files on LS1 . <p> I have not yet been able to establish a pattern to which files it is receiving incorrect date stamps , but it is extremely reproducible and consistent . <p> Here are a series of tests I performed using a small folder containing 9 files : <p> Test #1 : xcopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TS12 ) XCOPY that folder to LS1 ( the folder was created and all nine files were copied ) .3 ) XCOPY the folder to LS1 again ( 3 of the nine files were copied AGAIN ) . <p> Test #2 : xcopy from TS1 to TS11 ) Start with the folder on TS12 ) XCOPY that folder to another folder on TS1 ( the folder was created and all nine files were copied ) .3 ) XCOPY the folder to TS1 again ( ZERO files were copied - as expected ) . <p> Test #3 : xcopy from TS1 to My XP system1 ) Start with the folder on TS12 ) XCOPY that folder to my XP system ( the folder was created and all nine files were copied ) .3 ) XCOPY the folder to my XP system again ( ZERO files were copied - as expected ) . <p> Test #4 : xcopy from my XP system to LS11 ) Start with the folder on my XP system2 ) XCOPY that folder to LS1 ( the folder was created and all nine files were copied ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nine files were copied AGAIN ) .

Note : the same three files were copied here that were re-copied in Test 1 &amp; Test 4 - extremely strange . <p> For the following tests I deleted all files in the source folder except the three that seemed to have a problem ( that is , the three that get re-copied each time ) .

Not only that , but the same files are effected on LS1 and LS2 . &gt; The error does n't occur when copying to either an XP system or to a Terastation ( HD-H1.0TGL/R5 ) . &gt; The error is tied to contents of specific files . <p> I have now written a program to determine that the Modified Date on some files is not being returned correctly by the Linkstation Quad . I do not know if the date is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a transmission problem that is causing the low order bits of the time field to be corrupted when retrieved . But something is definitely causing the wrong modified time value to be returned . <p> A total of 31 files ( and one folder containing them ) were copied using the command : <p> xcopy /D /E /C /H /R /K /Ih : tempd2x : tempd2 <p> In this command , drive h : is a local drive and drive x : is a network drive to the " share " folder of the Linkstation.Of these copies , 14 files and the folder itself had a corrupted ( incorrect ) timestamp when later retrieved . <p> Observations : <p> +The lowest 8 bits are always improperly zeroed . <p> +The upper 5 bits are always preserved . <p> +Bits 9 through 20 always seem to be corrupted . <p> +Bits 21 through 27 are often corrupted ( but apparently not always ) . <p> The net effect is that any file with a corrupt timestamp ( roughly 50% of the files in this test ) will appear older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about 1 second ) . <p> Until Buffalo Technology provides a fix for this problem it is unlikely that any backup software that relies upon comparing modified timestamps will work . <p> Sorry about the long wait . After much searching , I think I 've found a solution for you . The issue appears to be that Windows sees the share ( basically ) as an NTFS filesystem , but Samba uses FAT-style timestamps . <p> The solution : use robocopy instead of xcopy . Robocopy has a /FFT switch that uses 2-second granularity for timestamps . You can download it from the MS Technet , in the package linked here : <p> Thanks Colin , but no thanks.You see , I am one of the original 14 Windows NT developers.My best friend developed the memory management and another good friend developed the kernel.All of us core NT architects and developers go back a long way together.So I know that xcopy was written long before NTFS existed.It was written for FAT and the SMB interface , and its timestamps are perfectly compatible with Samba . Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an NTFS file system . <p> Your reply makes it sound like this problem is " by design " . But , if this was an xcopy incompatibility with Samba then you would also see it in your other products that utilize Samba , such as the Terastation. yet the Terastation does exactly the right thing when files are xcopy-ed to it . No , this is not an NTFS vs FAT vs Samba file system issue.This is a bug in the Linkstation that is OCCASIONALLY corrupting several bits in the Modified Time field of files . <p> If a file storage product contains a bug that corrupts data and the developers do n't know why it is causing the corruption , then there is a good chance it will corrupt other pieces of data as well - such as the main data stream.I 'm not about to put my faith in such a product , and I 'm certainly not trusting all my data to such a product.I 've given you plenty of detailed information to work from . It took me several hours to collect it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the bug , drop me an email.Until then I 'm taking my two Linkstations back to the store tomorrow . <p> I know this thread is several months old and is without a satisfactory conclusion , but it seems worth reporting on something I discovered today using ROBOCOPY , and then looked up on these forums to see if it had previously been encountered - and it had , by Jim Kelly . <p> Yesterday I had copied the contents of a Maxstor OneTouch II external drive , NTFS formatted , to my new LinkStation Pro LS-XHL ( firmware is the UK v1.20 ) , using ROBOCOPY ( XP-010 ) with the /MIR ( mirror ) option . This took about 12 hours . <p> Since the Maxtor gets updated daily with backup files from my PC 's hard disk , I decided to copy any new files written on the Maxstor drive since yesterday to the LinkStation Pro , and found that far too many files were being copied across which ROBOCOPY thought were newer than those copied yesterday to the Linkstation Pro . So I abandoned this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the /L option ( which does all the file timestamp comparisons , but does n't do the actual copying , so that the Maxtor and the Linkstation are both left in the same state after as they were before ) . I got the following results : <p> Total Copied Skipped <p> Files : 573566 184068 389498 <p> Bytes : 244.405 GB 161.705 GB 82.700 GB <p> This action had clearly ' copied ' a huge number of files which were classed as Newer on the Maxtor , but which I was certain had not altered siince the previous copy . <p> So I used the ROBOCOPY /FFT option ( whose meaning is to ignore file timestamp differences of up to 2 seconds ) and the results were now : <p> Total Copied Skipped <p> Files : 573566 14382 559184 <p> Bytes : 244.405 GB 31.816 GB 212.589 GB <p> Inspecting the ROBOCOPY log showed that in the total of files that would have been copied across to the LinkStation Pro there were still a number of so-called ' newer ' files which had n't in fact been changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timestamp comparison was made ( previous test ) . <p> So I would allege that the file timestamp data that Windows is given by the Linkstation Pro ( in this case ) can be inaccurately low by as many as two seconds , and occasionally more . <p> Surely the LinkStation Pro 's NTFS file system ' appearance ' to Windows should be identical to that of a ' real ' NTFS file system , and that includes file timestamp data ? <p> I do n't have the enthusiasm to examine these file timestamps to the 100 ns granularity offered by ' real ' NTFS , nor whether consistent timestamp data is returned for the same file on different occasions , but probably some of the Buffalo techies should , to determine how this inaccuracy can be resolved . <p> I have used Microsoft Richcopy to copy data from my PC to the Linkstation Pro LS-XHL ( v1.10 ) with the condition to copy where modification dates are different . A second copy should n't any files . Instead it copies a lot if not all . <p> It sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone have been successful in using Richcopy or other copy programs and if so what settings were used ? <p> I think this is related .. any guidance.I notice that between my Terastaation H1.0TGL/R5 and my Drivestation ... there is a now ONE HOUR difference in the Date Modified between backups . I assum eits because of DST ... but .. <p> How does this happen ? Robocopy ( when run ) is now recopying ALL from Terastation onto Drivestation and not just the items changed . I use /MIR <p> Incidentally .. the DST option is in Vista version too ... cos it works on my Robocopy . This seems to be sorting out the issue above.But I remain cuious to understand HOW these dates got out of synch in the first place .. the fiels were mIrrored . <p> All run in a batch file from the task scheduler on Windows 7 . Runs fine the first time , but every time after that continues to copy about 24 files EVEN THOUGH NOTHING HAS CHANGED BETWEEN Y : Media and D : Media because the time stamps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it back because I have owned it for a couple years at this point . I will have to get something else and use this unit as a really odd sized and shaped paperweight until Buffalo Tech comes up with a fix . <p> I ca n't believe Buffalo Tech has n't figured this out yet . It seems this thread has been going on for a long time with multiple products and you would think it would be a high priority considering the chances for corruption that original Windows NT developer cited . <p> I would suggest that no one buy a linkstation product until they can verify Buffalo did something about this problem . <p> There seem to be three problems involved in your post ( these are common to all the NAS devices which use Samba ) : <p> 1 ) the times on the PC and on the Linkstation must match - that is , the transition from daylight saving time to ' ordinary ' time must have taken place on both devices , not just one . Try resetting the Linkstation 's time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an NTFS-like interface to Windows , with the one relevant exception being that the timestamp granularity on Samba is ( like FAT ) 2 s , whereas that of NTFS is 100 ns . Hence the need for the RoboCopy /FFT switch . <p> 3 ) there is a minor RoboCopy bug , fixed in the Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 version where , even when using the /FFT switch , there is still ' a proportion ' of ' identical ' files copied from NTFS to Linkstation when they should n't be . I 've posted about this elsewhere on the forums ( my figures for RoboCopy XP010 were that 101 files out of 86,400 files timestamped for 0 , 1 , 2 , ... 86399 seconds of the day were copied when they should n't have been ) . <p> That said , there is still the problem described by JimK , who knows more about the subject than almost anyone - but understanding and/or fixing the problems I 've mentioned above are a prerequisite to getting a final solution from Buffalo , should one be forthcoming ...

" ) transfer the information over from my 1tb to the 3tb while 3 is in the nas , then ( if required ) put the 1tb back in the nas then remove from web admin swap the 1 for the 3 again and this should work ? <p> i do n't  know if i can remove the 1tb from the web admin while it is not in the nas and i do not have any way to test this . <p> Will this work , also how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious ? i havent looked for a few months but i saw a decent 3tb HDD for not a lot of cash . <p> apologies if this made no sence its complicated it is a mash up of what i understand and a process to fit in with what i understand . <p> OK i have cloned the 1tb hard drive onto a 3tb hard drive then i expanded the main data parttition into the unallocated space stuck it back in the linkstation and this did work .... the linkstation however thought that the size was still 1tb and still at 97% full . so i then figured that if i removed the disk from web admin and then i could select ( rediscover disk ) and this would look at my HDD and say " oh it 's bigger than before better allocate that size " <p> this as you might have guessed did not work , so i preeeded to format the 3tb disk in the linkstation using the web admin , for some reason i thought this would do the job and while i can actually put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing me as having 2 drives and one is 3tb one is n't readable ( i assume this is beause i removed the 2nd disk from the Array 1 ) and this additional disk has not filled the gap i thought that i might be able to get away without completely re-building the arrays ( which wipes them ) .

I 'm tryinig to get the QoS per user bandwidth limiting working . It does n't seem to . I can limit bandwidth for everyone by using the top settings in QoS , which works , but when I try using per user limits at the bottom and run speedtests , I am getting full speed with no limiting . Does this feature not work ? <p> Bummer . I just ordered a WHR-HP-G300N hoping the preloaded DD-WRT would let me do just that . I 'm dismayed to see that you had no luck , and furthermore that you have n't been able to get any response here in seven weeks . My kids saturate our DSL watching video and then it takes me forever just to check my email . I was hoping I could give my IP , you know , god-like priority , and give their computers a priority setting of " Termite " . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kids . It should deliver one bit per second . <p> You can limit bandwith by mac address , that will allow you to specify actual bandwith limits for the individual devices . I never tried limits per user , so I ca n't vouch for that , but I did try by mac address and it actually worked . <p> Thank you , Osocoloso ! I have a box of old wired routers . I was thinking I might plug four of them into my G300N and name them Bulk , Standard , Express , and Premium ( using ethernet jack level QoS to give each a priority corresponding to said names ) . Then maybe I could prioritize from there in a very visual way that even I could understand , ie. wire everyone up to the box with the appropriate priority ( of course I 'd have to turn off the wifi to keep them from cheating my simple scheme ) . And if this lame-brained idea of mine does n't work so well , I 'll do something reasonable like the bandwidth-by-MAC that you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what you suggest , but it would n't be like me to do it the reasonable way first , not if I could run several hundred feet of cable through the house instead . I like cables . Makes my house feel manly . ) <p> I just tested QoS by MAC address , and it did work . I did n't do a thorough test with multiple computers , but at least it worked on mine . I 'm not sure what I was doing last time and if I was using a previous firmware or not . It does look more promising now . <p> Hi , Mzaur . Sorry about hijacking your thread a bit there . Glad to hear things have started working better , has me feeling more optimistic myself . Little do the wee cretins know what Daddy has in store . Your endless mindless videos are all pausing now ? You know what that is , Honey ? That 's solar flares . <p> Well my G300N arrived Friday and I set it up over the weekend . I actually have several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like setting them up , sort of like a model railroad , only with data packets and little blinky lights instead of locomotives . So it took me a while just to get the new router to play well with the others . Well that and gazing in geeky rapture at InsSider while I decided on the perfect wifi channel . But eventually I got around to QoS . Well , the first thing I noticed was that there was no ethernet-port-based control . At about this point I decided to RTFM , and there , or rather here LONG ... I discovered that there was no longer any such thing . So after playing with the various service priorities , I finally settled on throttling IP ranges . That works well for me because of my toy network , I just throttle a mask that covers that whole rodent branch of the network . I have n't done any scientific testing of the result yet but so far it seems pretty good . I can check my email now .

@@77980947 @6680947/ <p> I have been using the harddrive for a while now and now have begun running out of space . but when I begin to delete files the drive is not releasing the disk space . The disk is now about 400mb from being completely full ( 99% ) and even after I have deleted about 150gb it is still showing 99% full . Is there a utility I can use ? Is this normal ? <p> It is if you have the Trashbox functionality enabled and you do n't delete the Trashbox directory . It 's sort of like the recycle bin or the Trash . If the functionality is enabled , any files you delete in the LinkStation will go there . Hence , no disk space recovery . Delete the Trashbox and you will get the space back . The Trashbox will be automatically Re-created when you delete something . You can disable the Trashbox functionality via the Web Interface . <p> The Trashbox can be a very useful feature . While you have n't recovered your disk space , if you try to copy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space available , items in the Trashbox will be deleted as needed to accomodate the new file . <p> So you have 400mb " available " but have deleted 150G to the Trashbox .

" <p> Huh ? What ? What recent release ? Their has not been a new release for this model from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buffalo download page is the date they finely REMEMBERED that it was not even listed on their site . That date is the date it was posted to their site when in fact it is the same December released firmware the unit ships with . <p> As it has been clearly started , it is not stable . That is , unless you consider your wireless radios just turning off for no reason . <p> BuffaloTech WZR-HP-AG300H factory firmware ( DD-WRT v24SP2-MULTI ( 03/21/11 ) std ) is the latest firmare available for the excellent wireless router that keeps dropping off it 's wireless part , wifi dropout . The dd-wrt site states that lates support firmware fo the router is V24preSP2 BETA Build 14896 , which is the origin of the factory firmware as stated earlier in this thread . So , no luck for the wireless dropout . <p> Noticed that there dd-wrt page has detailed howto instructions to help you to fix WiFi Dropout and also an alternate method for it . Why would I want to reset wireless connection ( manually or automatically via script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to get my wlan working today . It 's gon na be either BuffaloTech or some other vendor here at the end of the day . <p> Works great and I 've had zero issues . It 's a DDWRT front end with a basic gui front end but has quite a few advanced features as well if you want to use them ( including TOR and openNIC support as well as an extensive reporting tools and QOS options ) . <p> Buffalo will never get any business from me or the company I work for ever again because of how this router release and maintenance was handled .

I have the AG300H with the DD-WRT built 16519 ( DD-WRT v24SP2-MULTI ( 03/21/11 ) std ) that came pre-installed with this router . <p> I stupidly replaced Buffalo 300GH router that had the identical problem , expecting that this " better " model would not be plagued by the same wi-fi drop out issue . I 've had great experience with Buffalo products in the past , but this has completely shaken my brand loyalty . <p> As you said earlier in this thread , the router is n't even listed in the dd-wrt.com router database . <p> I 'm ready to take this router out back and run it over with my SUV to extract some amount of satisfaction from the miserable hours of time I have wasted trying to get the SSID to stop disappearing . I posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said there below in case anyone here can throw me a bone to fix this . <p> <p> I 'm an IT pro that manages the network for a small business . I have read through a couple expired threads here on techguy.org where people are experiencing the same issue that I have . Unfortunately , I do n't have any resolution , but am instead throwing this out there in case anyone does have a way to resolve this problem . <p> The problem has occured with both of the AP/Routers that are listed in the subject . This makes me think it is DD-WRT related and not Buffalo related , but that may not be the case . <p> The problem is simple : the SSID disappears 1 or more times a day . Sometimes it makes it more than a full day , but then disappears again . It is completely intermittent and there does n't seem to be any logical reason for it . <p> * Firmware on the WZR-HP-AG300H is DD-WRT v24SP2-MULTI(03/21/11)* The device is configured as an Access Point , not a router. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled* SSID Assigned , WPA2 Personal Mixed wireless security , WPA Shared Key assigned. * The device is located in the middle of the office in a nice cool area where it in not prone to overheating in any way. * There are no issues with power as printers/fax machines within 10 feet of the device get their power from the same source. * The office is not located in a high density area . There are only 2 other SSID 's in the area that broadcast and are picked up at this location ( owned by other individuals or companies in the vicinity of my office ) . <p> When the SSID disappears , I can use a web browser to connect to the device ( via wired connection ) , so although SSID is down ( and indeed trying to connect to it by name does n't work either ) , the physical ethernet port(s) of are " up " . So , I connect to the device , login , go to the Wireless , Basic Settings . Make no changes but click " Apply Settings " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wireless users can connect again . Makes no sense . It 's like the wireless side of the device just goes to sleep . Alternatively , I have trained the users to just unplug the device and plug it back in , which solves the problem , for a little while . <p> Although not a reliable workaround , but it helps with reducing the constant reboots , I have gone to the Administration , Keep Alive tab and enabled Schedule Reboot to reboot everyday at 0600 hours . <p> I experienced this problem with the WHR-HP-G300N and replaced it with the WZR-HP-AG300H and see now that both models suffer from the exact same problem . <p> I am sorryto say NO . This router has to be the WORST one I have ever come across . It is SO SAD and says A LOT about a company that not only lists this their FLAGSHIP product abut they do not even care to look to fix theit " best product " . I am looking for a better product at this time that ... well ... WORKS without drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup the watchdog to look at 2 wireless IP 's . If they can not be reached , it restart the WiFi radio . I also find I can last longer if not running in Dual Band mode and stay with only B/G and not use 5Ghz which is why I biught it . <p> Thanks DBott for the tips on things you 've done to make the problem better . <p> I located the the latest firmware here : http : **40;2899;TOOLONG for DD-WRT and the " User Friendly Firmware " . I 've just applied this DD-WRT firmware DD-WRT v24SP2-MULTI ( 11/20/11 ) std Build 17798 to see if it will make any difference . I 've flashed the G300 previously and it did n't make a lick of difference , so am not anticipating this will resolve the problem . <p> IF it does n't , I am going to try the crappy User Friendly Firmware to see if that might solve the SSID disappearance problem . Read here or somewhere in the DD-WRT user forums that this problem goes away with that firmware . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read in the user forums that a guy used OPENWRT on his Buffalo G300 and the wifi dropout problem went away . <p> The problem definitely appears to be rooted in DD-WRT , and perhaps specifically when running on the Buffalo products , but I am not sure of that link per se ( just guessing as I see a lot of Buffalo complaints with this specific issue , but do n't see other product owners complaining about this problem ) . <p> The issue with the Friendly firmware is you can not setup guest access which is one thing I required . I am also not sure if it supports Dual mode ( 2.4Ghz and 5 Ghz ) at the same time . ( Not sure , but I thought I recall itdid not. )

I can not even see what is inside the folders as it gives me access denied . I 'm using the admin login . <p> I also have this issue .

Apparently not . <p> It seems that the Backup feature is not very robust , and when it fails - which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult to recover from , not to mention the loss of all the files actually involved . This is particularly troubling with a device intended as a ( rather pricey ) corporate backup solution . <p> - And now the tech got his answer , after 25 minutes . There is no other option . Create a second share , copy everything needed from the old share to the new one , and delete the old share with the damaged content . <p> Of course , since the UI does not allow folder copying between shares , this will have to be done from a network computer - routing all copy traffic through the computer , at maximum 1Gb rather than 3Gb . <p> He says he is " escalating " the issue , but considering is has been a " known issue " for five months , I 'm not hopeful . <p> ---------- <p> Buffalo : Be advised that we are a reseller , that this issue involves a government client , and that I will be posting this info on several social media outlets . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also post that information . <p> AFAIK , since Buffalo does not give out Root access ( /sadface ) , you must delete the ROOT level folder ( IE the main folder under shared folders where you selected for the backup job ) , its not fun , and I have read of horror story 's about days of copying files to a NEW ROOT level folder in order to get rid of them ... <p> From what I read cringed about , it seems the Backup and Replication process ( TeraStation only ) , uses the root user or a root level account to PREcreate both the files/folders ( padding ? ) and locks them for its exclusive use , then starts the procedure ! The issue it seems here is that if the Backup/Replication error 's out , or is interrupted by anything other then what is considered NORMAL operation ( completion ? ) , while the process stops , the lock by the root/root level user is not removed ... thus making deleting/removing files/folders that did not copy successfully an operation you " do n't  have access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ( an empty folder/s trashbox option in the WebGUI ) , I wish they would put a " ReAlign Permissions " button on the shared folders page , so if something like this occurs , you could simply use the button to remove the root permissions ( since , ya know , you ARE N'T root ) and restore whatever access restrictions you have setup on the shared folder ! Of course there would have to be other checks to make sure a backup/replication procedure is n't running , but this would solve this issue outright ! ( not to mention strip pesky NTFS permissions that sometimes manage to " inflitrate " when you copy it to the LINUX XFS/EXT3 partitions ! ) <p> Hope this helps your issue . <p> Logged <p> Disclaimer : Buffalo does n't write my check , consider me a Tech Enthusiast in love with NAS and Network Hardware .

Whether you have nasupdater.ini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . ini file and add the following two lines to the of the text file : <p> SpecialFlagsDebug=1 <p> 1 .

The TCP error means that it can not communicate . The way you can do this process would be to replace one drive at a time while flashing the firmware . So you would replace drive 1 , flash the firmware , and then drive 2 and then flash the firmware again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives it will void the warranty . If you send buffalo a unit with different size hard drives they will just send you the unit back without fixing it . <p> I would try FAQ 2 of 5 that 's pinned at the top of the storage forum .

The LinkStation is connected to a router , to which my computer network is attached . I am not using BuffaloNAS.com or any internet access . I am trying to set up the Web Access feature in my internal network , but I 've noticed several oddities and I 'm writing to ask for help in making sense of this : <p> 1 ) The Web Access &gt; Service Setup tab has a field " External Port " which I 've set to " 8080 " . In addition : The Web Access Service is enabled ; HTTPS/SSL Encryption is disabled ; Use BuffaloNAS.com is disabled ; Since a DNS Hostname is required , I 've entered " share " ; and Auto-Configure Firewall is disabled . Even so , the LinkStation DOES NOT respond to requests on port 8080 ! Strangely , the LinkStation DOES respond to requests on port 9000 . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port 9000 as a test user I 've created . However , there DOES NOT appear to be any way to LOGOUT ! <p> 3 ) Lastly , users DO NOT have the option to manage their password via the interface on port 9000 . Instead , they must login to the web admin interface on port 80 . Wha ? <p> Surely I 'm just being daft and I 'm missing some important piece of understanding as to how this all makes sense . Please explain . <p> Ok well I 'll take a stab at your 3 questions ( in reverse order ) . Also as an Fyi , firmware versions 3.08 and 3.09 are available for the LS Pro Duo . Do n't think they address any of your areas of concern , however , but just something to keep in mind . <p> 3 ) User management through Web Access system ( port 9000 ) ? <p> You are correct , no user management functionality can be done through this interface . <p> As a business user , I tend to agree w/ this philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could at least change their passwords via this interface ( excluding admin users , i think that 's a security issue ) . <p> But ignoring what i would like or not like , No , you ca n't do anything related to user account management or access through this interface , must use the main Linkstation admin interface ( port 80 by default ) . <p> 2 ) How do I log out of Buffalo Web Access ( port 9000 ) ? <p> Correct , there is no ' logout ' option . Buffalo 's usage procedure states to ' close the browser ' . <p> Not ideal , but it 's the only option at this point . <p> 1 ) What the heck does the ' Web Access ' external port option do ? Web access is still running on port 9000 ! <p> So just to clarify , Web Access is ALWAYS running on port 9000 , this can NOT currently be changed . <p> The External Port option is telling the LS Pro Duo what port External to your Router are people using that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When someone accesses your router/gateway on port 9000 from the WAN port ( externally ) , it normally does not route it to your LS Pro Duo 's web access system . So your router will require you to Forward an incoming port request for a specific port to the LS Pro Duo 's port 9000 . <p> There are 2 ways to do this . Using uPNP to automatically set this up , or to do it manually . For the sake of explanation , I 'll explain it manually , but uPNP does the same type of thing ( in a more random and automatic way ) . <p> If you use Buffalonas.com , it gets the name + external port sent to it from the LS PRO DUO , so it will direct traffic to your nas to the proper external port ( 5555 ) which we now know is being forwarded to actual port 9000 . So for BuffaloNas.com to know how to direct external traffic , we set it here . <p> Whether Buffalonas.com is in use or not , another purpose is how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you browse to web access and click on a Shortcut link to a file , the LS PRO DUO would normally send you to a link for that file on port 9000 . If you are not on the local LAN though , port 9000 may not be routing to the LS PRO DUO , so the links wo n't work . So the LS PRO DUO will enumerate it 's links in Web Access to contain the external port , with the assumption that your router is properly forwarding the requests to port 9000 on the device . <p> Summary : External Port # is just a place to specify what external port you are forwarding from your Router to the LS PRO Duo Web Access module ( running on port 9000 of the LS PRO Duo ) . <p> Sorry for the long explanation , but hope this clarifies how the External port deal actually works . Also , hope this answers your questions . <p> Hi rinthos , and thank you very much for your prompt and detailed response ! <p> To Buffalo support staff regarding Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Please enable users to manage their passwords themselves via the Web Access interface .

So which is the latest firmware ? <p> 2 ) Having experience in IT , I tend not to install firmware updates unless I know what specifically is being updated . Please provide release notes or at least more verbose descriptions explaining what has been updated in the firmware version and why . <p> Perhaps a corollary of the OP 's question is a problem I have . We have several offices throughout the state with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no VPN ) . I can access the Web interfaces on many devices in the remote offices including printers , copiers , servers , etc. , but I can not get to the Web interface ( for administration ) of our LS-WTGL/R1-V3 F/W 3.09 that is installed in one of our offices . I can get to the interface if I VNC or remote desktop a computer on the LAN on which the LinkStation is installed . <p> NOTE : I am not talking about Web Access for file share at this point ( though I would like to do that too ) .

@@77980959 @6680959/ <p> The linkstation is set to backup to the usb drive on demand manually , no overwrite i.e. new file each time . Backups are , or are said and appear to be , successful . All other functions appear to work normally , the only strange thing is that I have to switch the USB drive on first if I want to use it otherwise the Linkstation loses contact with the network when the USB drive is switched on . <p> PROBLEM : the USB drive is getting rather full ( 40% ) but when I try to delete old backup folders ( or even parts of the folders or just files ) it just does not happen . After an eternity of saying " preparing to delete " , I tell it to do so and get " Can not remove folder : Access denied . Make sure etc ..... " . <p> The status page says FAT16/32 on the usb drive connected to the linkstation . I did think of connecting it direct to the pc but could see no good reason why it should work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try that later . <p> I do not remember being asked what filesystem should be used during format . What are the advantages of EXT3 ? How do I select that system during format if it solves my problem ? <p> I may just totally re-format and start again if it has sufficient advantages . <p> Thanks for your advice . I have simply re-formatted and , for some unknown reason , this time it formatted EXT3 despite not showing any options . This may be because I have upgraded the OS from 2.05 to 2.30 since the problem arose . <p> The first new backup is running now . If what you say is true , problem solved . <p> Thanks for your help and suggestions so far , this is an update on progress : <p> OK , it has been a busy holiday weekend . <p> 1 ) the backup that I am doing is from/of the linkstation to the usb drive , i.e. I am backing up the linkstation contents . <p> 2 ) the backup is of 3 folders , one is password protected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all . <p> 3 ) Every attempt to backup all three together in the same session has failed . The backup seems to have been generated as far as the first folder , then it stops but the status says backup is still running ( after 12 hours ! ) I have to power down and restart to get everything working again . <p> 6 ) A little thought and it seems to me that it is either a size issue ( not uncommon at my age:smileywink : ) or , it may be that it is the length of time that the backup is running ? <p> After some thought : <p> In the past I have noticed that the clock in the linkstation is really cr*p so I set it to update from a time server . I am now going to disable this " feature " in case what is happening is that the time update is messing up the timing of the temp files that seem to get generated during backup . I will also be trying some intermediate size folders to see where and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ja the backup size , I know what you mean - I had to change my wardrobe a lot in the past couple of years . <p> IMHO the problem is not the size , more the amount of files.The CPU resources are limited and copy a folder with 100s of files takes a lot . If you split large amout of files in two or more jobs it should work better . You can see it if you copy some stuff manually , starts fast , slows down and if it is too much the unit freezes . <p> So its like real life , big is OK just too many of it in one room becomes a problem . Goes well along with my own experience . <p> 3 ) tried reducing number of files by splitting up into smaller jobs : this did work BUT the number had to be reduced so far ( from &gt; 20,000 files to less than 1,000 ) that the number of jobs became unwieldy . The other problem is that it meant some top level folders had to be split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Even at less than 1,000 files , the video store would not back up , that had only about 20 files in it but all large ( 1 -&gt; 2GBytes each ) . <p> It seems that there is more than one factor at work here . <p> I will get back to this " some time soon " . In the mean time I am re-thinking my backup strategy . I will probably use a cron script to back up the linkstation to a Ubuntu Linux box that I also have on the network , all this will need is an additional removable hard drive and cradle at about 70 . I do n't think that the usb drive would be fast enough to complete overnight . <p> In the meantime the 500GByte usb drive will just sit there and look pretty .

With Windows loaded , it sometimes gives BSODs , frequently freezes , frequently has programs announce they have encountered a problem and must close etc . <p> I have tried a number of things to solve these issues and have narrowed down the source of the problems to the RAM timings and voltage .

Since you say it runs well with 6-6-6-21 , you probably need to notch the Vdimm up .1V to clear up the timing issues . Raising the voltage , cleans up the timing windows ( faster rise time , faster fall time ) . <p> 2 ) With the voltage bumped by .1v and the timings still at their " De Fault " settings , the number of errors was reduced by approximately 1/2 .

And how can I stop it happening ! It seems strange that it only happens on some files / folders and not others . <p> That should have worked ... I have seen some users use linux with the user of 1000 with no pass be able to go into the files and change the permissions . I do n't know how to do it and linux is n't supported , but it is a suggestion that you could try . <p> Thanks , I 'm no expert on linux at all but remembered some things from years ago and had a bit of a try of Ubuntu . I do n't think it worked , but I am not entirely sure I was able to do everything . <p> I 'm not sure what user 1000 is but I was able to install it under a VMware player , and could ftp into the box ( login as admin account ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folders in the backup storage area . I did not know how to get access to the box except by ftp . <p> Folders that I can access in windows have permissions = drwxrwxrwx <p> Folders that I can not access in windows have permissions = drwx------ <p> I was unable to access the folders , or change those permissions in linux and my knowledge is not good enough to know what else to do . Strangely , I am able to rename these folders ( also in Windows ) but that is all . <p> Is there no way to take over the account that is tagged as the Owner of these files ? This is the Unix Userroot account ? It seems such a simple thing to do but frustrating the files are inaccessible even though I put them there !

If you have a mix of products - set up security using the Advanced settings ' screens .

Browsing kakaku.com , it became very clear that the Japanese Keiretsu are not allowing routers in , so you can pretty much choose Buffalo or Buffalo . It is obviously the only way that they can peddle their garbage . <p> I am seriously thinking that it is time to do something about these Japanese companies and their obsession with making life difficult for expats in Japan just because these people are Heso Magaru .

Any suggestions other than returning the device would be greatly appreciated . <p> I have to agree with kevin , the transfer speed is really poor . With a 100Mbps switch i was gettin 7MB/s of speed . that is pretty good for a 100Mbs connection at 70% rate . <p> Then i replaced with switch with a 1000Mbps switch .

I expect the speed to be atleast around 20MB/s range . so i that i feel like it was worth the money for the gigabit switch as well = ) . obvesiouly we upgrade to gigabit switch in an effort to see double the speed of 100Mbps .

@@77980976 @6680976/ <p> Just need your help on how to resolve my problem . I have a LS-W1.0TGL/R1 with firmware 3.09 which I bought a few days ago .

Also , I forgot the default IP address of the said NAS . <p> I need help on how to restore it to factory settings without sacrificing my data in it . <p> There is a function button on the back of the device that says , function/reset/init . Power device down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then while holding the button flip the power switch to auto , then release button and press it again and release . should reset ip it without touching your data . If that does n't work do a direct connect with a pc that has a automatic ip assignment get into the device using the same 169 ip address you find in the nas navi and then set a static and see if you can get into the gui with the ip . <p> I 've tried this approach ( switch to off , holding down the func button for 6 secs , power on , release func , " click " func again ) and gotten no results . I also have tried to plug in directly to my computer ( bypassing the router ) , but do n't know how to access the Linkstation with the direct ethernet connection .

Initialization may take several minutes . <p> Initialization will affect different settings on the LinkStation depending on which method you use . <p> In Linux ( Buffalo NAS runs on Linux ) , all devices ( like harddisks or usbdisks ) are mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not affected by firmware update . So , about the data in hardisks/usbdisks ; they will remain intact even when the firmware is corrupted . If the firmware is corrupted , you can still access the data in the harddisks/usbdisks ( by mounting them to a Linux machine ) . In case of RAID-ed harddisks , you need to set up a troubleshooting machine in a RAID mode that matches the setup of the harddisks to recover the data . Unless , the firmware update does something dangerous like wiping the data of mounted devices in the /mnt directory ( which never happens ) , then the data will be affected by this event . <p> When you ask a factory reset , the scripts under /etc/init.d in your Buffalo NAS firmware will instruct a program **28;2995;TOOLONG to perform what you have described in the second paragraph . These scripts do not touch anything under the /mnt directory , so your data in the mounted harddisks/usbdisks are not affected by the factory reset . 
@@77980993 @6680993/ <h> Author Topic : WZR-HP-AG300H Transmit power ( Read 19477 times ) <p> Recently purchased the WZR-HP-AG300H . I am running the stock dd-wrt that was on the device : DD-WRT v24SP2-MULTI ( 12/17/10 ) std ( SVN revision 15940 ) . on the 2.4ghz radio The transmit power is set to 20dbm ( 100mw ) . The issue is that the AG300H is reducing tx power to somewhere between 10 and 16 dbm which is shown on the Sys-info tab and is evident by the reduction of coverage in my house . Is there any way to get tx power to stay at what it is set ? <p> This is a common situation with all of the dd-wrt builds for the Atheros based Buffalo HP units . This was reported for the other models 6 months ago . Buffalo claims that they are working with DD-WRT on this issue . But , I follow the DD-WRT ' Timeline ' ( list of all tickets and change sets ) , and I have seen no activity addressing this issue . It appears as if the DD-WRT is defaulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " FCC " regulatory domain setting ( supposedly set with the US country code setting ) . This is either a problem with the DD-WRT Atheros drivers or the Buffalo " Board/Radio **25;3025;TOOLONG " . It would be nice to see some progress on this issue . It is being ignored by DD-WRT and needs some Buffalo attention . It is a shame , these Buffalo 's have so much potential ! <p> Nope , no way to get it to stay at 20dBm , and the best i could ever get an AR7161 with dd-wrt to transmit at was 17dBm . As KingJL mentioned , but i will go ahead and clarify , the madwifi driver that dd-wrt uses does n't seem to let you control the Tx power settings , it will say it does , like if you go into advanced wireless settings and bump it up to say 21 , then apply that , then look in wireless&gt;status , it will say its at 21 , but its not really , if you measure your signal with something like inSSIDer , it wo n't show any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that being solved anytime soon , the ath9k driver is still to new and under-developed , so no implementation at this time or like i said , anytime soon . <p> Believe me , i know your frustration in this matter , because i have a WZR-HP-G300NH , according to reports and stats , its max dBm is supposed to be @ 26-28 , i never see anything near that with dd-wrt , i can with stock firmware , just not dd-wrt , but the way i have my setup , i prefer to use dd-wrt , because its more feature filled . <p> I was hoping with the AG300H that some of the issues might have been corrected from the prior 300 series routers . As far as i can tell any field that can flucuate on the status page is far from accurate . What is more rediculous is the TX power is n't even accurate for what is occuring . The router appears to be selectively choosing how much bandwidth to provide based on amount of traffic requested/sent for more that 1 minute . See below . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Log into the router and go to " Wireless " and than underneath it " Basic Settings " under there you can go to Channel Width and change that to Turbo 40 MHZ . Also you can try changing the wireless channel to something the will get you less interference from other wireless devices in the area . If you have any other problems please contact our tech support for furhter assistance . <p> and my reply ... <p> I moved the settings to turbo under NG-mixed . I have also used both auto and manual channel selection . My neighbors are far enough away that I can occasionally see them at -90 to -80 db . I have actually gone so far as to turn all wireless equipment ( excluding laptop/wifi analyzer ) and the power breakers in the house off except the office . I have tried every possible combination of antenna chains , antenna gain , Ack timer , and TX power . I have exhausted a number of wifi and dd-wrt forums . The best the router can display for 2.4 ghz is 13dBm power with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is constant regardless of idle or active traffic . <p> I have included some basic examples of what I am seeing below . It almost appears as if some adaptive radio management or power save feature is in place . Only after trying to pass a decent amount of data ( streaming , large file xfer , multiple web pages ) for at least 1 minute does the router seem to boost the radio signal to provide more that 5 Mb/s . <p> I really do like the router features and dd-wrt , but I need a router that performs better than the 9 year old router it is replacing . Any other advice is definitely welcome . I have about another week before the time I can return the router runs up . <p> Here is what I notice reported by the router and the wifi analyzer laptop : <p> signal strength : <p> AG300H never above 66% . Farthest point is as low as 8% <p> Laptop : 100% for most locations . Farthest point is 25% or more <p> Idle Bandwidth ( by distance ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laptop : 5 - 19Mb/s <p> 10-15 meters ( through walls ) : router : 1 - 5 Mb/s . Laptop 1 - 5 Mb/s <p> Active Bandwidth ( active trying to pass significant amounts of data for more that 1 minute ) : <p> Hrm well , with that unit , what was the default antenna chains set to ? IIRC , its a 2x2 MIMO setup on the WZR-HP-AG300H , so it probably should be set at 1+2 1+2 And also , for your wireless security , are you using WPA2 with AES ? <p> Hey ya sorry for the multi posts . I 'm going to repost my info to you but I 'll add in a couple lines to try and increase clarity . Let me know . It was VERY easy to do this , just make sure your computer has nothing else running when you actually start flashing the router ... <p> 1 . Search and enter the " BRAINSLAYER build 16785 " thread in the DDWRT Forum . Find the link inside the first post which brings you to the downloads section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you should HOPEFULLY be seeing two files with similar names . <p> 3 . Download the " **41;3052;TOOLONG " file to your computer ... MAKE SURE you got the correct one and that it is build 16785 . <p> 4. hook up LAN-ethernet cable to your computer and router , make sure to shut off ALL other connections ... that means kill your laptop wireless probably <p> 5 . Open internet explorer ( not firefox or anything else ) <p> 6. login to router at 192.168.11.1 using whatever username and password you 've created <p> 7. go to Admin tab , go to Default Settings tab , reset router to factory default and give it a couple mins . After about 5 minutes of sitting there , the router will have been reset to complete factory settings . Refresh the internet page . <p> 6. log back into router once it reboots ( it will have the stock username/password again ) <p> As far as I know , the only firmware available is the Buffalo firmware that comes with the unit and the Community editions published by DD-WRT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 , IIRC . I 've not tried it yet , as I like people to try it before I do . : robotvery-happy : <p> Brainslayer has repeatedly said that dd-wrt does not limit the transmit power , but that it is limited by the chipset/hardware . Further he has indicated that anyone in tech support who disagrees is wrong . See ticket 2047 at the following link ( read all comments ) <p> I have located the FCC report filed by Buffalo , Inc. for the WZR-HP-AG300H . Page 7 , Section 3.1 describe the unit under test as having a TX power of 935.7 mW ( 29.7 dBm ) for 2.4 GHz and 915.1 mW ( 29.6 dBm ) for 5.0 GHz .. The full report can be obtaines at : <p> there will be three entries displayed , click on " Detail " of the second entry ( 2.4 GHz ) <p> there will be a list of attachments displayed , click on " Test Report - 5C " <p> the Test Report PDF will be displayed <p> If this issue is ever to be resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous statements that Buffalo Inc. and DD-WRT are working on the issue , if the owner/developer of DD-WRT ( brainslayer ) belives that it is the hardware and not DD-WRT that is the issue , IT WILL NEVER BE FIXED ! <p> Tech support , will you please get involved in this . It is obvious that this unit ( as well as other Buffalo HP units ) are being limeted by DD-WRT . I would think that from a marketing veiw alone , it would be worthwhile to address and correct this problem ! Since embracing DD-WRT on it 's products , Buffalo Inc. products are now being judged by the performance of dd-wrt ! <p> What is it going to take to get a response from Buffalo Inc. about this issue ? Maybe a class action lawsuit for false advertising will help ... a HP router that was reported to the FCC as having &gt;29 dBm TX Power , but shipped to the customer running Buffalo branded DD-WRT that will not provide greater than 20 dBm TX Power ! <p> I had to figure out how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wanted to share what works in case someone else finds himself in my predicament . Basically , I took the first 32 bytes from the openwrt WZR-HP-G301NH tftp firmware and appended all but the first 28 bytes of **41;3095;TOOLONG from dd-wrt . Here is a hex dump of the result : <p> This flashes successfully via tftp . On all devices , the bootloader listens for HW address 02:aa:bb:cc:dd:20 with IP 192.168.11.1 , so set that with " arp -s 192.168.11.1 02:aa:bb:cc:dd:20 " .

Secondly , the problem reported is based off of a few isolated incidents that our users have reported to us , whether it is a firmware issue , OS issue or user issue is something that can be difficult to determine .

Thank you for your thorough , informative and concise post . Hopefully , the problem will be solved quickly with these steps but if not please post back . <p> First of all , let me add some precision about my NAS model . In fact , I bought my NAS in Japan , not in China . My firmware is the Japanese one since I downloaded it from the JP Buffalo website . The reason why I complain on the US forum is simple : I do n't speak Japanese ... I came to the US forum because people speak English and it is rather dynamic . <p> I 'd like to take advantage of my situation to point out a problem : you do n't have any international support website . Therefore , since your firmware versions are localized depending on region , how can someone who buys a product in Japan but does n't speak any Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JP website since you do n't understand a **bleep** , you can only go to other English spoken countries ' website to get the support ... : - ( And for me , to be able to get the JP firmware on the JP website was really a hassle ! Everything written in Japanese . Even once you had download the . exe for the firmware installation , the wizard is n't in English and you have unreadable strange characters instead of proper JP characters so you just pray that the update goes smoothly ... <p> It would be really better if you had a common English ( since it 's the only international language ) international support website where all the firmwares for all versions of NAS in the world would be available . Now it 's too complicated ... Asus , for example , has a global English support site for worldwide : http : //support.asus.com/ . Or if not , the JP site should have an English version . But I know by experience that when there 's an English version of a site of a non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare to the local language version of the website . <p> Are you able to tell me whether 1.32 is the latest firmware version for my NAS ? <p> Regarding your suggestions , since the incident I have n't encountered again the issue , I will let it as it is . If the issue occurs again , I can have a try . I wanted , with my post , to let people aware of the problem and to know if there was another solution but apparently no . <p> I access my NAS usually by NetBIOS name but for my test , I used the IP address to be sure that the problem was n't related with the NetBIOS name . <p> These are the USA/Canada forums , not international forums . We will try to help those in other countries that can write English , but we may not have the same products and firmwares from other countries and may never have encountered the issues you are experiencing . It 's best to contact the support team of the country where the unit was purchased . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your product , as a second source for their support to know about issues . The first source is the customer contacting the appropriate support team in country of origin . <p> If you buy a product in another country , the language of the product is probably of that country and the language used on the box , is a pretty strong indicator of the language used for the GUI . Do n't expect the FW to be in English when buying a product in Spain , Japan , Korea , etc . <p> Products purchased in other countries , even if they have the same product number as a product in the USA , may have different hardware and changing the FW to a USA firmware may brick your unit , void your warranty , and is done with the customer 's responsibility only ( if there is an English language FW available for that product ) . Try using the forums to find someone in the same country that does speak and read the language of the country and ask them nicely to translate the GUI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done this already on these forums . <p> Concerning my NAS bought in Japan , it was written in JP and EN on the box and do n't worry , the firmware itself , is in English . I have my web interface in English since you can choose the language . Howvever , the JP website which is the place to get my firmware for my product is n't in English and when you download the firmware from this website , the installer wizard is n't in English ( As I said in my previous post , the wizard language should be in JP but I have unreadable buggy characters instead , even if my Windows 7 can read JP characters ) . Therefore , it makes all the process really difficult for a non JP speaker ... <p> We traced your IP to China hence why I was on that conclusion .

When I try any of the methods suggested I get a transfer speed of only max 400 KB/s . When I try to direct copy using the direct copy button on the Livestation I can transfer very quickly a very large amount of data but only of media types . My problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 50GB and I would like to transfer them to the larger livestation drive . <p> What can I do to get these large files into my livestation quickly . Drive backup method shows me that it would take days . <p> It is very easy to back up and restore data to and from a linkstation and an external USB drive . <p> You have to make sure that the external drive is formated to XFS through the linkstation . <p> From here you want to go to the usbdisk1 folder under shared folders . You have to make sure that this folder has " disk backup " checked under its folder support . You have to do the same thing for all the share folders that you want to back up or restore . <p> Once this is done you can go to the back up utility in your linkstation 's interface . <p> From here you can make a backup or a restore job . Just choose your schedule and back up type and choose the source and destination folders . So if you want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share folders on the linkstation that you want as the source and the usbdisk1 as the destination . You just have to do the reverse for a restore from the external usbdisk . <p> I bought one of these 2TB Linkstation drives to back up a handful of smaller drives I 've accumulated over the years . Overall I 've been disappointed with the advertised DirectLink , as it 's really marketed as a plug-n-play type thing , which it certainly is n't . Moreover , I find the manuals poorly written and the software bundle confusing as to which programs I actually need . But I have found what I feel is the best way to transfer large amounts of data of all types so I 'll share it in case it helps someone else . <p> First I plugged my HDD in the USB on the back of the linkstation ( any format HDD should work as mine are all NTFS ) . It should now visible as a folder in the root directory of the LS called " usbdisk1 " . <p> Sorethumbs recommended opening this folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem I have with that is that those files are unnecessarily being transferred through your computer . So your computer needs to stay on the network to make that transfer , and it slows your computer down if you want to do other things with it . Also if the transfer stops mid-folder , then you need to try to figure out where to restart the process , etc . <p> So I plugged my HDD in the back of the Linkstation and set a backup through the web interface . One thing the manuals are n't very clear on is the fact that there are 2 control ' programs ' . The first being NAS Navigator , which I find to be useless , except for finding the IP address of the Linkstation . Once you 've found that IP ( 192.168.1 . X ) then typing that in to any web browser ( eg : http : //192.168.1.6 ) will get you in to the control panel ( default username : admin , password : password ) . Under the tab " Shared Folders " you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ' share ' and ' usbdisk1 ' . Make sure under the ' Support ' column both disks should say at least " Disk Backup " . Mine say " Windows , Apple , Disk Backup " . <p> Then click on the " System " tab , and go to the " Backup " tab . Here you 'll see a little button that says " create new job " . Click on it . Now assign a job name ( whatever you like ) , mark the schedule ' immediate ' , and the operation ' normal ' . I left all the options in their default settings , but I marked ' exclude trash ' as a personal preference . Then click the green " Add " button under backup folders . From backup sources , select " usbdisk1 " and for backup targets , select ' share@LS-CHLF22 ' . Your model number may be different . Then click " Apply " . <p> The screen should now show your transfer name , with the status ' running ' . It took me about 1 day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but workable . I think with those speeds it 's using some protocol other than USB2.0 . But I was free to take my laptop away with me for the day while this was all running at home , which worked well .

It also assumes you wish to provide full access to the share for yourself , but not for other users . However , with this startingpoint and a little reading of man pages it should be fairly self-explanatory how to proceed if you need a slightly different result . <p> On your Linkstation , set up a user with RW access to all of the shares that you want to mount on your linux system . I recommend even setting up a user for shares that do n't require a user . It just makes things more uniform when you 're setting up several shares on your Linux box . <p> Now on your linux system : <p> First , in your /mnt directory create a folder named /mnt/lspro . ( You may use a different name if you wish , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of my shares that I wanted to be able to access from my Linux system . <p> Sudo will be asking you for your Linux account password . Once this is done , you 'll have your Linkstation share available at /mnt/lspro/SHARE ( where SHARE is whatever name you gave it ) . Now , it may be inconvenient for you to dive into /mnt/lspro to find your Linkstation files , so in your home directory do this : <p> cd <p> ln -s /mnt/lspro <p> Now you 'll have a symbolic link that looks like a directory in your home directory called lspro . Inside it , you 'll have all the shares you mounted . <p> Note it was not immediately obvious to me ( it should have been but was not ) , that LSUser was the name of a user account on the NAS and password was the associated password for that account on the NAS .

DO NOT USE OLD CONFIG FILES WITH NEW VERSIONS ! ! whilst they may appear to work there can be hidden problems that wo n't manifest until after some use , also , old configs can brick the router . <p> For example , DD-WRT services change occasionally , if you have set a configuration for something that is later removed , or has its behaviour changed , then it can confuse things ... A LOT of changes have been modified since r20025 ...

Biggest fixes for me were for SAMBA and the NAS features ... I also have more options under Wireless Advanced settings and some nice ad-blocking and filtering functions under services too ... <p> What kind of power gain you are trying to achieve depends on your settings ; for example , are you trying to increase the routers connective range , or increase it 's stability across a short range ? <p> Also bear in mind something as simple as carefully planning the three external antenna 's direction and orientation can affect the units effectiveness and range tremendously .

@@77981031 @6681031/ <p> This url fails to work , and when I login to my NAS and attempt to shutdown via the admin panel , the shutdown button does n't have a link with a clear URL , such as the one above , instead it is masked within javascript . <p> The reason I would like to be able to do this is so I can shutdown the device from within XBMC once finished using it . So can anyone help me with this ? A clear and concise URL for shutdown would have been much better IMHO . <p> I know it 's been asked before also , but why oh why is there no way to ping the NAS with a WoL ( Wake-on-LAN ) to turn it on too ? ! ? ! This would be awesome , as I could turn my XBMC media centre on and the NAS at the same time , then ( hopefully ) turn the NAS off with my XBMC HTPC too . Why is this not been added with a FW update yet ? There have been requests about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a command line to shut down the Linkstation Quad remotely . <p> My PC goes to sleep after a half hour of non-use and this causes the linkstation to shut down because of NasNavigator , however laptop users still want access to the Linkststation . <p> My APC ups has Powerchute software to gracefully shutdown the PC ( even if asleep ) in the event of a power failure and I have the option to have a command line run to execute a URL or program during shutdown . It would be ideal to be able to issue a shutdown command the the Linkstation when a power failure triggers the UPS to issue a shutdown to the PC . <p> A startup command would also be nice but I can restart it manually just as easily . <p> BTW my firmware has a UPS page but all the options are grayed out . I 'm not sure how this would work anyway since the UPS is commanding the PC to shutdown . <p> Just a status update : My issue remains still unsolved as of today , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of question when standing in their shoes . They might say : " Why do n't you install your UPS client software to the laptop clients as well that they stop gracefully accessing NAS before the shutdown occurs " . This is of course one workaround , but it is clearly unnecessary overhead to maintain and verify that it always works in every device . Also , there can be smaller mobile devices and tiny-linux-boxes where this luxury ( or overhead ) is not even available . If the Buffalo NAS would " know " it has received shutdown command that it should respect ( to not auto-powerup right away , but wait until power is lost-and-recovered OR somebody presses physical buttons OR it receives special " cancel shutdown/resume " -operation command yes , this would be classified luxury ! ) then it could safely shut down operations before the final power failure , as after receiving the shutdown request it would just deny starting any new file operation requests ( like opening file for writing ) , but would allow the ongoing operations continue until some safety-window encloses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed some time after the shutdown request to gracefully shut down all ongoing operations before the power is lost .

@@77981038 @6681038/ <p> Log of my experience rebuilding my home network with Buffalo routers and bridges <p> Final equipment package <p> Modem ARRIS / Motorola SurfBoard SB6141 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem ( Changed out a DOCSIS 2- Motorola ) Router WZR-1750DHP ( Changed out an Apple Time Capsule not compatible with WLI-H4-D1300 Bridge ) Bridge WLI-H4-D1300 ( changed out Linksys bridges ) Bridge WZR-1750DHP configured as bridge more options with this one as a bridge ( changed out a series of Linksys bridges ) <p> The story started with a bunch of lousy Linksys wireless bridges and my Apple time capsule . The Linksys bridges would not/could not hold a fixed IP in some cases or did not wake up in time for work so started looking for a new bridge . Bought a Buffalo WLI-H4-D1300 bridge and installed it . Good download speeds , but terrible upload speeds . I called Buffalo tech support and they mentioned that there was a compatibility issue between the WLI-H4-D1300 bridge and the Apple Time capsule router . So I bought a new router WZR-1750DHP but figured I should get a new modem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( both Motorolas ) . All of this required some hours on the phone with the Buffalo tech people who were very competent and helpful . With just these changes my wireless upload and download speeds on our COX network improved dramatically . <p> I wanted another bridge and while chatting with the tech support the gentleman mentioned I could use the WZR-1750DHP as a wireless bridge ( supporting 6 devices ) as well so ordered it because of the speed and stability of the existing Buffalo bridge . <p> I got the new bridge yesterday , and called Buffalo tech support ( no manuals or CD with the bridges what 's up with that ? ? ) and configured the WZR-1750DHP as a bridge . I then hooked 2 computers , a printer and a Buffalo NAS to the new bridge . All is well . Life was good . <p> I then tried to hook up a USB printer to one of 2 USB ports on the WZR-1750DHP to no avail . I called Buffalo tech support and spoke to a tech who shall remain nameless and she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should work . Well she was wrong . <p> Go there and download " Network-USB Navigator " and run it . Your printer will have to be preinstalled on every computer that wants to use the printer , and the utility will discover the printer and set up some new ports these will be either virtual USB ports or DOT4 ports . And the printer works swimmingly . However the " Network-USB Navigator " will NOT work with the latest Apple OS system , but will work with the previous ones , so my iMac with the newest Apple updates can not use this " Network-USB Navigator " <p> Now here is the strangest thing I can imagine with a bunch of high priced routers and bridges with a USB port . I quote from Pg 69 of WZR-1750DHP manual - " You can use a printer connected to the AirStations USB port via any computer in your network with this software . Note : Concurrent use by multiple computers is not supported . " <p> What that means is that if you want multiple computers to use the printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if another computer #2 wants to use the printer then #1 computer needs to unhook from the printer . Workable but very kludged up ! <p> I am very happy with the speed and stability of the network and the bridges.I am disappointed with the documentation.I am 95% happy with the tech support.I am disappointed with USB printer server lack of versatility . <p> Hey JDB , I know this was a year ago , but I am having some difficulty and awaiting a response from Buffalo tech support . <p> Like you said , the documentation is a bit sparse with information . I can not tell if I can hang a Mac OS X Journaled drive off the USB 3.0 port or not . I 'm going to go ahead and format a smaller drive ( I bought a 6TB ) as Mac OS X Journaled and see if it works . Trial and error ... Are you able to use a USB drive connected to the WZR-1750DHP as a TimeMachine backup destination ? <p> Secondly , I also am replacing a time capsule ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio is dying on the wifi . Otherwise , the router works perfectly as a wired device . My second issue is that I am not able to use Back to My Mack ( BtMM ) . Seems uPnp is n't working correctly to get the traffic to the destination computer when I am outside my network . ( This is what I 'm waiting for Buffalo Support to help me with ) Are you able to use BtMM from outside your network through this router ? <p> Lastly , I read somewhere concerning DD-WRT that if you use this router as an AP only that the USB ports on the back are disabled . Again , I was going to try and see by setting up the TimeCapsule as the primary wired router ( turn off the wifi ) and then connect the WZR-1750DHP to it via the NIC and then try to configure the WZR-1750DHP as the WAP. 
@@77981039 @6681039/ <p> I have an LS-Q4.0TL/R5 that I have been using for about a year . Over the weekend , the unit disappeared from NAS Navigator and had a blinking blue power light . I read the FAQs and followed the instructions to get into EM mode . Once it showed up in NAS Navigator agian , I did a force update of the firmware . Now , the unit had solid lights and shows up in NAS Navigator with FW version 1.10 and using 57% of disc space as before . I am reaching out to the good people of the forum because I am still unable to access my shares on the unit . I am fairly certain that the data is still there and has not been corrupted because I had this unit acting as a media server in addition to being used as network storage for my home computers . I can still access the media server using my computer or my PS3 . In addition to no access to my shares in windows explorer , I can not access the web settings for this unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit , I simply get a generic " Internet Explorer can not display webpage " error . I have all of the important data ( pics and personal docs ) backed up on a separate external hard drive , so data preservation is not my primary concern . I simply want to get this unit functioning like normal if that is at all possible . I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions that may work . Thanks . <p> Everything is normal in NAS Navi . In the bottom section , the status shows as HDD ( RAID5 ) 1599.1GB/2771.5GB(57.7%) . No flashing lights on the front of the unit . Solid blue power light and four solid green lights ( one for each drive ) . <p> I tried to flash the firmware again . I am now getting a problem with a password . The updater is asking me for the admin password for the buffalo unit . The default password is supposed to be " password " . I never changed the password , but the updater is not accepting the password . I tried leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the password may be ? I can not force an update again without a password of some sort . I was not asked for a password when I flashed the firmware on Monday . <p> I have tried to reset it by holding the function button . That has not worked as the " password " is not working as the unit admin password . I was thinking that maybe if I could get the unit into EM mode again , that would work . I have tried to do that , but I am not able to get the unit into EM mode either . I looked at the FAQ#1 , my link station model number is not listed . Can you tell me how to get my model into EM mode again . Maybe that will allow me to flash the firmware . <p> I too face the same problem , but with LS-WVL . I know what password I have been using because I actually have 2 units , but I just could not log in . It is the same after resetting the unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I desperately need to revive the unit because I want the data inside . Thanks . <p> Make sure the unit is off . Hold the function button for 6 seconds while the unit is off . While still holding the function buttion press the power button . Then release the function button and press it again for one second . This will boot the unit into EM mode . <p> Here is the reset process , <p> Please switch the unit to off and wait until the lights are off . <p> Hold the function button for 10 seconds while it is still off . <p> While still holding the function button after 10 seconds please flip the switch to on . <p> Once the function light begins to blink release the function button and press it again for one second .

This speed is limited primarily by the processor in the unit . A typical 1GB transfer should take about 5-7 minutes . <p> If you 're exceedingly slow performance , the unit is likely going through a through check of the disk array .

Even after a FW-update from 1.56 to 1.61 it also introduced the problem with updating DTCP-IP. see here . <p> I know some about ethernet networking , so I was quite confinced that the problem was with the LinkStation , though I found out it was not in my case . <p> I had a fixed IP address set to .253 . My home ADSL- modem/router ( Thomson TG712 ) has a fixed IP at .254 so it made sence to me to keep al fixed IP addresses in my network within the same range . The range for DHCP is .1 to .100 . When browsing my router settings one day I finally found that my router only uses IP addresses .1 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .253 , which was the only one that I should not use , though this is not mentioned in any documentation at all . Finally I found some indirect clue on the internet that mentioned the usage of the .253 address for the USB port on a router ( not my model ) . I still do n't know if this is so in my case , but after changing the fixed IP address of my Linkstation to any other addres but .253 all my problems were solved .

Pity that my first experience with a Buffalo product is this . <p> Btw , what seems to avoid the issue - I 'm not gon na say solve , as it is no solution - is to limit the transfer speed .

Along with that connection lag disapointment , file transfer speed is not stellar . Not as speedy as I believe I remember it when initially configured . Perhaps I changed some settings which invoked this performance change also . No way of knowing unless trial and error or quality tips from users .

Should be fairly straight-forward ... <p> If it 's any help , I was able to easily set up an Epson Stylus Photo R200 printer using the LPV-U2-US USB Print Server in Mac OS X 10.6.8 ( Snow Leopard ) . I downloaded the latest Epson driver package ( v8.6 ) through the Mac OS Software Update . NOTE : Up-to-date drivers for Mac are no longer available on the Epson site , but older versions are . <p> Steps to success : <p> Configure the print server . I assigned it a fixed IP address from my router 's address pool ( as mentioned above ) and gave it a recognizable name . Left all else at default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application 's print dialog , or from System **37;3388;TOOLONG Printer . Mac OS X will see the print server via Boujour ? with the name you gave it . <p> Give the new printer a name . In the Print Using : pulldown menu ? go to Select Printer Software . For some reason , this has to be done manually - the Add Print tools do n't see the drivers . <p> The Gutenprint driver was the key - I had been using the manufacturer 's driver with no success . The OS could talk and listen to the print server , but not the driver . <p> According to Apple 's support site for Snow Leopard , ( http : **29;3427;TOOLONG ? ) , " Some of the included drivers were developed through the Gutenprint and CUPS open source projects . You can identify these drivers by looking for " Gutenprint " or " CUPS Sample Driver " next to the model name . You might use one of these drivers if no Snow Leopard-ready driver is available from a printer 's manufacturer . Please note that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the printer 's manufacturer does not provide support for using these drivers. ? " <p> I have not done exhaustive testing , but the driver options seem to be adequate for most of the printing one would do with this printer . <p> The web browser configuration interface for the LPV3-U2-US print server is confusing - it 's not been updated for awhile . It allows configuration of printers via the Rendezvous network protocol which apparently is n't supported by Snow Leopard. 
@@77981050 @6681050/ <p> I 'm quite concerned as I may have lost 2TB of important content . I really hope you guys can help . <p> I have a Linkstation Quad pro in JBOD configuration , I 've had it for a while with a 4TB , a 3TB , a 2TB and a 1.5TB HDD . When the last disk was full , I purchased another 4TB drive , so in order to backup the contents of the 1.5TB HDD to the new 4TB disk , what I did was to remove ( Nas off ) the 2TB disk , and put the new 4TB in its tray , then I turned on the Nas , formatted the new 4TB disk and created a backup job to replicate all the content of the 1.5TB drive to the new 4TB disk . <p> After I finished and checked everything was ok , I removed the 1.5TB HDD from the tray to use it with an external usb box , and reinserted the 2TB HDD in the tray and then to the Linkstation , expecting that the NAS would read the drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the check disk feature and the 2tb disk appears as non formatted , also the system appears to have mistaken the unit name , this is weird : the new 4TB drive is a Western Digital WD40EZRX , while the 2TB drive is a WD20EZRX , but if you check in the image , Disk 3 appears as WD20EZRX although it has 4TB of storage , and the 2TB appears as WD40EZRX when it is a 2TB . <p> The contents of the 2TB disk ought to be unaltered and I hope I can put the HDD in a usb box and maybe copy such contents to another disk , at the very least . I 'm not sure , considering the FS the Linkstation uses , if I will be able to read the contents with a PC or I will need to use some linux version to do it . Any suggestions on how to recover the data will be sincereley appreciated , I can not afford to lose all those files . 
@@77981052 @6681052/ <p> Can someone help me please I have spent the last 2 days going around and around in circles and am getting nowhere . I am not a network whizz ( but am not an idiot either so have tried my best ! ) . <p> I have bought the Buffalo LinkStation Live LS-X2.0TL but can not for the life of me seem to get it working properly . I can access through my local network ( sometimes its BUFFALONAS , others it 10.0.0.2 ) and seem to have been able to save my NAS name to buffalonas . It will not connect using webaccess though . I have tried port forwarding but nothing seems to work . I can not connect using my iPhone either as it says it can not connect to the server . I am using a Netgear router WNDR3400v2 . <p> Sorry but that does n't seem to help . I 've tried all sorts of numbers in both Port Forwarding and Port Triggering but nothing is working ! Interestingly I can only connect to the NAS wirelessly on my network ... If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it ? ? ? <p> The port you are using for web access ( 47939 ) is being blocked by your router so there is no out going communication . Contact your router support and get them to open this port to the Linkstations IP address the protocol used is TCP if they ask .

@@77981098 @6681098/ <p> mcg : As long as one of your wireless computers is always on , then it will work . If it is set to sleep when inactive then it would not be a good candidate . First check that the computer you want to monitor responds to ping requests ( some antivirus/firewall software prevents this ) . First turn off the other wireless computer so only the one you want the router to watch is turned on . Go to DD-WRT Status Sys-Info tab and scroll to the bottom . It should show only one wireless client now and you 'll need to write down its MAC address and its IP address . Write down Host name if it shows one ( ignore if just shows an asterisk ) . Now turn the other wireless computer back on and get a command prompt ( Start , Run , cmd.exe ) and type " ping 192.168. x.x " where the x.x completes the IP address of the computer you want the router to monitor . If it responds with " Request timed out " then the machine you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to resolve that with your antivirus/firewall software before you can continue . If it responds with " Reply from 192.168 .... " then you can continue . Go to DD-WRT Services tab and under DHCP Server section , click the Add button to create a new blank line . Type in the MAC address ( with colons ) , host name if it showed one or leave blank if not , IP address ( 192.168. x.x ) , and use 1440 for client lease time ( 24 hours ) . Click " apply settings " . Reboot the computer you want to monitor and then check again the DD-WRT Status Sys-Info tab to make sure it came up with the same IP address you wrote down before ( it should always get the same IP address now when it connects to your router ) . Now go to DD-WRT Admin Keep-Alive tab and in WDS/Connection Watchdog section , click Enable , use 300 for seconds , and put in the IP address of the wireless computer to monitor ( 192.168. x.x ) . Click Apply Settings . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor and wait 5 minutes for router to notice and reboot . You can either notice the lights on the front of it cycling through reboot sequence , or check DD-WRT from the other computer - it shows " up " time since last reboot in the upper right corner . Of course if you turn off or sleep that computer that the router watches , the router will keep rebooting every 5 minutes until you turn that computer back on . I have no idea if that is " bad " for your router if you turn your computer off nightly and let the router reboot itself all night long . You could change the 300 seconds to less if you want it to notice wireless dropout sooner , but I would n't go less than 120 seconds or so to avoid an endless reboot cycle if it ca n't find that computer . You need at least enough time to get back into DD-WRT to turn off the Connection Watchdog if something goes wrong later on . Five minutes seemed like a reasonable time window to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DHCP static leases " do n't work " but it seems to be working for me with Buffalo DD-WRT 14998 .

I did find a solution to my problem , albeit not the one I was hoping for : I bought a Linksys E3000 wireless router . I have been using it for only about five days now , but so far not one reboot has been required . This is an expensive solution , but Cisco has been in the business for a long time and seems to know how to design an excellent router . I wrote a review of my Buffalo Tech . router for Amazon.com . Needless to say , it was not favorable--no rants , no expletives--just the truth . This has been a expensive lesson for me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves by producing equipment that is used by large organizations . <p> mcg : stu1019 , for the DD-WRT wireless hang auto reboot you can choose to monitor any device that 1 ) uses wireless ( not wired ) connection to the router , 2 ) is " on " all the time , and 3 ) responds to ping . eliascm , I share your frustration with this half-baked marriage between Buffalo and DD-WRT . I suspect that Buffalo wanted to capitalize on popularity of DD-WRT but did not realize that their choice of Atheros chipset was not yet very stable on DD-WRT . If Buffalo paid any license money to DD-WRT then I hope they got a refund , and in my opinion any customers who bought this router specifically because it was advertised as " Powered by DD-WRT " deserve a refund . I was going to return mine as well , but decided it was working " good enough " for my purposes to continue using it until DD-WRT releases a stable Atheros version
