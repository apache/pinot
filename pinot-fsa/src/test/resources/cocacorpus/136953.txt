Its known that the foods are flash frozen to help preserve quality . This means that one can heat up their foods using a microwave where no other preparation is needed . <p> There are also 3 different plans offered : <p> Balance : This is the standard meal plan that the company has been using for over 20 years . It offers vegetarian and seafood free options . Its said to be formulated with the guidance of chefs and nutritionists . According to the manufacturers , this is their most popular option . <p> Balance Diabetes : This is made under the guidelines proposed by the American Diabetes Association . This is meant for those who have type-2 diabetes , or who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balanced ratio of carbohydrates , and its made for people looking to lose between 5 to 10 pounds .

Some have mentioned that there 's a large amount of things like sodium , sugars , and fats added . Its impossible to verify the official amount without first seeing a nutrition facts list . There were disgruntled customers that did n't  know that the nutritional profile would be so high in unwanted ingredients . <p> Its not a sign of quality when you 're unable to know what you will be eating before its served . This makes it impossible to determine if one will have issues with any food allergies , health considerations , or simply wants to limit certain additives . The official website does mention : <p> " you can order with confidenceknowing there are no surprises ; just fresh , healthy , delicious meals " <h> The Price and Quality of Diet-to-Go Diet <p> The price depends on the specific plan chosen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and womens version .

Limiting calories this much can be hard to do if one is n't receiving high quality protein and fiber . <p> You can select either a weeks or 5 days worth of meals , orwhether you want 3 meals a day or 2 . <p> The price for a total of 3 meals a day for a full week in the original " Balance " diet for mens is $183.59 per week . This can be broken down into 51 meals for a cost of each meal being $3.59 . <p> This is a standard price for what one might pay for a standard frozen meal . Many customers who have tried this diet plan have referred to it as being like any other frozen meal as well . Without knowing exactly what kinds of ingredients are used its impossible to determine the overall quality .

His system uses a combo of science and sensibility to help you lose some extra pounds while still delighting in your favorite foods . <p> You begin the diet by indulging in a " cheat day " where you get to eat all of your favorite , carbohydrate-filled foods . For the next six days , you follow Marion 's system of low-fat diet foods and low-calorie eating . With each successive day , gradually more carbohydrates are added until you reach your " cheat day " on the seventh day . <p> The Cheat to Lose Diet plan is divided into three phases : Priming , Core and Maintenance .

So the ' gorging ' so to speak actually makes perfect sense , as not only does it speed up metabolism but many testimonies are those that people are not ' gorging ' so much on the cheat day , as the logic is that knowing we have access to anything by the ' cheat ' day , the natural inclination is not to go full-blown at all but ends up being rather moderate instead . <p> posted Aug 14th , 2008 10:04 am <p> Christine <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The online membership is somewhat helpful however is is lacking in some important aspects .

I did n't  lose a pound " <p> " I 'm rapidly gaining weight . I gained 8lbs in 30 days " <p> " I took it for 4 months and did n't  lose any weight " <p> Though some did lose weight , there were often common complaints that include anxiety , restlessness , extreme fatigue , headaches , and loss of sex drive , mood swings , and many other issues . <p> The most often listed side effect was fatigue .

After the first couple of weeks of morning nausea the only other side effect I have is mild constipation .

I had one of the worst panic attacks I 've ever had in my life . Think very hard before you take this drug . <p> While most diet pills are a dime a dozen , once in awhile a promising weight loss pill hits the market that causes even the most skeptical of medical professionals to stop and listen . Contrave is one such product . <p> Developed by Orexigen Therapeutics , Contrave is actually the combination of two different drugs : The antidepressant medication , buproprion , or Wellbutrin , and the drug naltrexone , which is used to treat alcohol and opiate addiction . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed diet pills do , Contrave unleashes its power on the brain , where it works to quell cravings in the brain 's highly complex behavior-reward center , and also to temper appetite . <p> In late-stage clinical trials , Contrave has fared much better than the FDA 's standards for improving weight loss , exceeding by five percent . Rather , those who took Contrave while also following a diet and exercise program lost between nine and 15 percent of their body weight while those who did not lost just about five percent of their body weight . <p> Contrave has also shown few side effects and notably absent are mental health and uncomfortable physical side effects that often come from taking weight loss pills . In fact , those studied showed an improved quality of life while taking the pill . <p> Contrave is being slated as a chronic diet pill ; if you take it and lose weight you will have to continue to take it in order to maintain lost weight . One of the downfalls with most of the diet pills on the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once you stop taking them , weight is easily regained . Since Contrave specifically acts on the centers of the brain that govern overeating behaviors and craving desires , there is hope that its ability to suppress these processes will lead to long-term weight loss . <p> As of July 2009 , Orexigen Therapeutics is seeking FDA approval . When and if Contrave is approved for consumer use , it will require a prescription from a medical professional . <p> Not a magic solution to healthy eating behaviors and to a healthy weight <p> Still awaiting FDA approval <p> INGREDIENTS <p> Contrave is a breakthrough weight loss drug because it contains both buproprion and naltrexone . <p> Buprupion is also known as the branded prescription drug Wellbutrin , a quality anti-depressant . <p> Naltrexone is a prescription drug used to treat addiction , in cases such as smoking , alcohol or even opiates . <p> ADMINISTRATION <p> Contrave will likely be taken daily . Since the drug is awaiting FDA approval , precise dosage instructions are not yet available . <p> DIET and EXERCISE <p> A low-fat and low-calorie diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since this drug does not act on the stomach , there are currently no specific foods that need to be avoided or a particular style of eating that needs to be followed while taking it . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Contrave is a new weight loss pill that shows promise for being able to act on the brain 's pathways that control cravings and appetite . This new kind of drug , which combines two different kinds of psychopharmaceuticals , is predicted to be the wave of the future for diet pills . 10978 @qwx870978

The sugar content of typical meals is revealed to give you more of an idea about how much sugar you are consuming . <p> Through this program , you will learn how to completely wean your body from sugar and refined carbohydrates while eating great , losing weight , and without exercising . <p> Author 's story and experience with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been linked to obesity , diabetes and many weight-related conditions <p> Educates reader on the many different names and sources of sugar <p> CON <p> Eliminating carbs and sugar can be difficult for some <p> Does not promote exercise <p> Very similar to other low-carb , no-sugar diet plans 10974 @qwx870974 <p> The main focus of the Fat to Skinny program is on the foods you eat and more importantly , the foods you eliminate from your diet . <p> Sugar and carbs are removed from the diet and replaced with no-carb foods like lean protein sources , low-fat diary and low-starch veggies . Out are all forms of sugar as well as some plant-based foods like corn , potatoes , some fruits and grains . <p> The program includes several recipes so that you can learn the proper way to prepare meals . <p> Some of the food items that are included in the recipes are : <p> Chicken Cacciatore <p> Spaghetti Squash <p> Baked Shrimp with Crab Meat Stuffing <p> Roast Cajun Pork Loin <p> Creamed Spinach Alfredo with Mushrooms <p> Strawberry Shortcakes <p> EXERCISE <p> Fat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without exercise , even though exercise has been shown to not only facilitate weight loss but also improve physical and mental health as well . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Fat to Skinny Fast and Easy is not only an easy-to-follow low-carb plan but it is backed by the inspirational and motivational real-life weight loss story of author Doug Varrier . While there are many diet plans and books available , few of them have authors who lost 100 pounds using that particular plan . <p> If you are looking for a successful approach to the low-carb diet , this book could be a good tool for you . But be aware that the diet 's no-sugar rule may very tough to follow for the long-haul and you might want to consider overlooking the lack of exercise program and instead , hit the gym instead in order to give your body and health the best results possible . 10972 @qwx870972 <p> fat to skinny fast and esy , fat to skinny fasts and easy , fat to skinny fast and easiest , fat to skinny , fat to thin , fat to skiny , fast to skinny 10978 @qwx870978

This beverage mixes maple syrup , cayenne pepper , and lemonade . <p> The claimed benefits extend beyond weight loss and they include healthier skin and nails , a resistance to illness via stronger immune system , increase mental focus , enhanced energy , and stronger hair . The diet was popularized by the musician BeyoncT after she admitted it helped her lose weight for a film role . By reviewing many different weight loss diets our experts found the most effective was the 18Shake Diet . This diet offers a nutritionally balanced appetite suppressing meal replacement and a fat burning diet pill . They both are free of stimulants , preservatives , binders , fillers , and only have natural ingredients . Discover more about the 18Shake Diet via the link provided here . <h> Maple Syrup Diet Ingredients and Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Maple Syrup:Sweetener extractedfrom the maple tree . It has a unique flavor and is mostly made up of the sugar sucrose . There are different grades to this as some are less processed , taste stronger , and have a darker amber color . <p> It also has very little macronutrients , and often has a lot of carbohydrates and sugars per serving . <p> Lemon Juice:This citrus fruit is low in sugar and high in vitamin C , with an average sized fruit providing 51% of the daily requirement for vitamin C. They help support the immune system and are high in antioxidants . <p> Cayenne Pepper : Spicy chili pepper extract that is used to flavor dishes . It is rated from 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville units which means it can be exceptionally spicy and very little of it is need to add spice to meals . When handled and eaten it can promote side effects that may include : <p> Stomach pain , diarrhea , and cramps . <p> Skin irritation , burning , and itching . <p> Kidney or liver damage . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace vitamins and minerals .

One can drink as much as one likes , with an ideal range of 6 to nine glasses . <p> Different plans are offered as well with typically the 4 possibilities listed : <p> Full detox : Having the only thing you eat being this drink for a total of 10 days straight , and 14 fulldays if one is capable .

Also there is no allowance for dairy , coffee , sweets alcohol , red meat , processed foods , and fried foods . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> Maple Syrup Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> While cayenne pepper and lemon juice can be healthy , the added maple syrup is high in sugar and there 's no protein from this drink . Sustaining oneself only on this can be potentially dangerous , as Web MD adds : <p> " The problem is , you will lose muscle mass . The diet puts you at risk for nutritional deficient too . " <p> They also mention the possibility for weight loss : <p> " you will likely gain the weight back really quickly once you start eating normally " <h> The Price and Quality of Maple Syrup Diet <p> All one has to pay for is the lemons , cayenne , and maple syrup . This can be easy to obtain and often does not cost much , though the grade of maple syrup might be pricy . <p> Overall however , due to the lack of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an unlikely weight loss fad diet . Its considered a crash diet , meaning one has to follow it for a short period in order to achieve weight loss . <p> The diet does not emphasize any important facets of weight loss , and instead is meant to promote effects via a detoxing effect which has not been proven . There is a lack of provided facts about the real effects of this diet . Without this key information , it makes the overall quality poor and potentially risky to try even in short bursts . <h> Business of Maple Syrup Diet <p> The diet was popularized by the musician BeyoncT and there are some websites which offer free resources . However , the basics of the diet are easy to explain . <p> Its unclear exactly who created this diet , though one claim is that it was founded in the 1940s by a Stanley Burroughs who practiced alternative health strategies . His claim was that this drink was effective for treating ulcers and eliminating toxic waste fromthebody . His original plan was to help detoxify the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dahlman mentions : <p> " not only is this diet dangerous , but it fails to detox the body " The detoxification system works by nutrients combining with toxins " <p> " does n't  provide the necessary nutrients foe the liver to do its job , and it will deplete your reserves within 48 hours " <h> Customer Opinions of Maple Syrup Diet <p> Many have tried this diet ; here are some user quotes about the use of the Maple Syrup Diet : <p> " drank it and immediately vomited " <p> " I think the taste of the drink is horrible ! I could n't even drink it ! " <p> " I HIGHLY discourage this . " <p> " I 've got the mother of all headaches and nausea " <p> There were many people who found it undrinkable and much too spicy to handle . There were side effects such as nausea , heartburn , vomiting , diarrhea , and feelings of illness . <p> Some people did lose weight ; however , any diet that severely restricts calories will have this effect . There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help suppress appetite . Many said they felt extremely hungry and unable to operate at full strength . <p> The British Dietic Association has also said that the diet is potentially unsafe and that weight loss is likely to be short term , as the weight will return once one resumes a regular diet . <h> Conclusion - Does Maple Syrup DietWork ? <p> The Maple Syrup Diet is a detox diet that claims it can help provide many benefits to overall health as well as make weight loss easy . The diet was first created as a way to help treat ulcers , but its now used by some celebrities for quick weight loss . While any severe caloric restriction can promote weight loss , its not considered the most wholesome way to accomplish this goal . Many users have repeated the same issues , that it does not taste good , promoted side effects , left them feeling hungry , and did not promote sustained weight loss . Health sites have also confirmed that this can lead to nutritional deficiencies and a rebounding effect with weight gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( Page 1 of 7 , 140 total comments ) <p> Holly <p> + <p> I just started this as I need to lose weight . I actually need to lose27 lbs and I have 17 days . For those saying it is temporary and you will gain it all right back , that 's only if you are a fatty . Once you ease off , if you eat a clean , raw diet , you wo n't gain it back except maybe some muscle weight . If you go back to potato chips and twinkies then you obviously will . I am doing the full 40 days and once I am done I will be eating clean and only when I am hungry plus sticking with pilates and I know I will keep it off . If you do this diet for a quick solution and go back to eating the way you did that made you overweight to begin with , then yes you will gain it back .

However i attempted it on a day in which i was hungover and failed so prepare the night before , i.e. do n't  drink lol , in fact they say you 're supposed to " ease in " for 3 days before the diet drinking natural soups and orange juice , however i did n't  know about this at the time . Anyway , I have recently put on around 20 pounds and weigh around 136lbs ( i am used to a small figure and am short ) and on my 4th day i have a flat belly and a less-rounded face ! They also say that day 4 is the " hump " day which is supposed to be the hardest and to be honest i 'm not struggling really . I 've had mcdonalds around me today , have been in and out of ther fridge ( to smell the food haha ) , been supermarket shopping AND I WORK IN A RESTAURANT , and if i can resist eating for 4 days so far , do n't  tell me you cant ! ! So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you experiment with the water added to the maple and lemonade ( i found the more water the better ) . I also only used a small ammount of pepper as i ddnt like the taste but got there in the end . The salt water flush was HORRIBLE on the first day and i couldnt do it , however the next day i made it in concentrate ( 2 tsps and a small amount of water ) and added a small amount of lemon juice and took a sip , and then a sip of water , and so on . The laxative tea i 'm drinking is yummy , its by pukka and contains aniseed fennel and some other natural igredients . I 've only really been drinking 4 glasses a day and havve been fine , but its effective because as soon as you feel hungry/weak you can have a glass and feel fine , i actually like the feeling of emptiness i have in my belly its motivating . Furthermore the craving and want for food , i.e. cakes , cookies , burgers chips etc i have learnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start you think in your head ' should i eat ' ' arr i really fancy fried chicken ' simply dismiss this crazy idea and do something about it - take a nap or go on a walk or a drive , just anything to avoid that state of mind , THIS IS KEY TO THE DETOX , without this in mind you are likely to fail . I plan to do this until day 10 , and think i 'm going pretty strong , i feel strong and i feel motivated and better about myself and life in general - i guess this is the spiritual cleansing they speak about . I will reblog to tell people how much i have lost on day 10 . <p> posted Apr 20th , 2012 3:30 pm <p> Arucha Haynes <p> + <p> Its been 8 days now since I 'm on this diet and it truly works , before I started I eat everything I can the week before so the cravings was not too harsh on me , I loose 9 lbs so far and I am determain to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers keep falling and it motivates me to push forward , I have no problem so far with this diet . <p> posted Apr 18th , 2012 4:18 am <p> Ola <p> can i just mix the maple syrup with pure lemon juice rather than adding the cayenne pepper to it ? <p> posted Apr 13th , 2012 12:57 am <p> Heidi <p> Hi ! I have recently completed the lemon maple syrup diet ( for 5 days only ) and would like to give my thoughts . <p> On the plus side it worked , I lost a total of 4 kilos in 5 days - I have never been overweight but wanted to get rid of unnecessary body fat . Needless to say , people noticed it straight away saying I look noticeably skinnier , especially in my arms . I also lost few centimetres of my waist . It is all about self-control and I found it not too difficult to not eat proper food and just have the drink . I also did the salt water flush a couple of times . <p> Now ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my defense system and I have pretty much been i 'll for nearly the 3 weeks that I have been off the diet . The next day after stopping eating I got a food poisoning of some sort ( have never had one in my life before ) , although my friends had the same food they did n't contract the poisoning , I got it as of course my body 's defense system was down . Straight after food poisoning followed an infection in my tooth , again I do n't usually get this problem , and a week after being treated with antibiotics , I got a ridiculously sore throat for few days with scary looking stuff in my throat . Once I got rid of that , the infection in my tooth has now come back and I will get another set of antibiotics . <p> Overall a diet that really works , but it has not been worth messing up my health over it . I am generally a very healthy person and it is overwhelming to have one illness after another since this diet . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I would not advise my friends to do it . If you have a holiday coming up and want to she 'd some kilos quickly please do another form of diet , where you can still eat fruit etc and consume a lot of drinks . This one is too drastic and you may not end up making it to your holiday at the end . <p> I really hope it helps xx <p> posted Apr 12th , 2012 11:06 am <p> adp <p> Day 1 ... wish me luck ! ! ! <p> Anyone done it for 5 days ? ?

I have tried so many different types of diets and I could not follow through or got lazy because I did not see immediate results . I got that here . <p> Let me be honest , this drink is way too hot ! I could barely breathe the first day when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to find a solution for this . After some online research , I found out that I could make cayenne pills ( place the cayenne in emply capsules that I purchased at Whole Foods ) and TA-DA ! ! I was drinking sweet lemonade and popping a cayenne pepper ! I was in love . <p> I do want you to know that one of the hardest things of this diet is the intense food cravings . Since there is nothing but liquid in your diet , I mean , I was dreaming dreams of quesadillas running through fields of cheese saying " Eat me , Eat me ! " BUT I have never cheated once because you would have to start the diet all over again . <p> In three days , I have gone from 171.5 to 165.5 , that is 6 pounds in 3 days . THAT is my motivation ! ! <p> Popularized as of late by starlets around the globe , including Beyonce Knowles of Dreamgirls fame , the Maple Syrup Diet is not a diet per se . Rather , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous food intake , providing a clean slate for future healthy eating . Also known as the " Master Cleanse " or the " Lemonade Diet " , the program is basically a mixture of Grade B Maple syrup , fresh squeezed lemon juice , spring water and cayenne pepper that a person drinks for up to 10 days . Pioneered by Stanley Burroughs in the 1950s , its practitioners and participants claim that not only do they lose weight , but they see better , smell better , hear better and feel better , while also ridding their bodies of ailments that have afflicted them for years . <p> Note : followers of this program also recommend a senna laxative tea as well as a saline water drink in the morning , as an additional component of this program . These additional supplements are simply for additional colon cleansing . <p> EXERCISE <p> None , and thank goodness , because most users would not have time ( with all the trips to the bathroom ) or the energy ( at about 500 calories a day ) . <p> CONCLUSION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fasting or detox program , and can not be recommended for long-term use . Ask your physician if you are healthy enough to carry out this very restrictive regimen before beginning . However , weight loss experts have touted the benefit of a healthy bowel system , but forcing the bowel to cleanse , may cause future problems for a person when they begin to eat their regular food routine . This would be a good program for someone who already eats vegetarian/vegan and avoids all processed foods , as a return to processed and fatty foods will take the user back to their pre-cleanse weight in short order . 10978 @qwx870978

When you slash calories your body gets energy from every source it can , and it uses up the protein in your muscles rather than the fat in your body like we want .

I go to the bathroom 5-10 times a day and my rear end is always sore from going so much . I have constant flatulence and bloating from this entire high fiber diet which my doctor says is the problem . I tested myself one day and cut out all the beans , broccoli /caulif family , and lowered my fruit to one a day . I was so excited when I had one visit to the bathroom .

So now I eat my eggs for breakfast , fish and chicken instead of beans and average portions of veggies with small amounts of fruits , not the ridiculously amounts Dr. Furhman wants you to eat . Remember , there is no one diet that works for everyone . Dr. Fuhrman has turned into a Dr. Mercola site with selling all his products online . Such a shame . It compromises his integrity . Supplements are NOT needed except b12 if long time vegan . Take a d3 if not getting it from the sun . If you are eating enough calories from the plant based world you will be getting all the nutrients your body needs . Take the plant based nutrttion course online at Cornell University and you will learn a lot . Dr. Furhman is just making money .

Though Examine.com adds : <p> " there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> EDITORS TIP : Combine this supplement with a proven fat burner such as Sletrokor for better results . <h> Hydroxycut Quality of Ingredients <p> Ingredients like amla , maqui , and saffron have not been thoroughly studied and its unknown if they would affect weight loss . <p> Then there 's the added caffeine and green coffee bean which are the key active ingredients . Caffeine can be replaced with coffee or tea for cheaper and green coffee bean has n't  shown any valuable weight loss effects . Studies have shown it to be either ineffective , or weak in its possible weight loss effects . <p> For the kinds of ingredients used , the lack of clinical studies for some ingredients , and the unknown side effects of certain additives , this mixture is a poor choice for weight loss . There are far too many unanswered questions to determine what the formula might do . <h> The Price and Quality of Hydroxycut <p> Sales are not offered via the manfaucturer , but they do suggest multiple online and in store 3rd party retailers . <p> Amazon.com sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dosage of 4 capsules a day , this lasts for a total of 37.5 days . This makes the daily cost for supplementation 76 cents . <p> Though inexpensive , many of the ingredinets in this are either innefective for weight loss , not yet proven , or can be replaced . <p> Caffeine at 400 mg is roughly 4 cups of coffee . That 's why special considerations must be put in place to help protect against side effects . Still , the key active ingredients in caffeine and green coffee bean extract are n't  enough to suggest both reliable and safe effects . These two ingredients can also be replaced for much cheaper . <h> Business of Hydroxycut <p> The owners of this brand are Iovate Health Sciences Inc . They can be reached via the following : <p> The FTC fined them $5.5 million dollars for making false advertising claims about their supplements .

Its often mentioned from customers that they experienced side effects , as well as a lack of weight loss . <p> Many also said this is basically just a caffeine pill , and that it had no noticeable weight loss effects . <h> Conclusion - Does Hydroxycut Work ? <p> The key features to notice about this brand are the company history , and the kinds of ingredients used . Many customers have failed to see any weight loss benefits , and people describe it as a caffeine pill . This is likely because the only ingredeints in this that might have a weight loss effect are caffeine and green coffee extract . There 's not enough in this to suggest it would help benefit people . The company has also had to recall Hydroxycut due to serious health concerns . There 's also a lot of caffeine added to this , with a full serving providing the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients added to this blend , with the ability to suppress appetite , increase metabolism , and improve mood .

This is BY FAR the best supplement for combined fat burning &amp; appetite suppression out there on the market ( coming from someone used to shedding the additional pounds to get the tone and definition I have been looking for over those 6 years ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just finding excuses not to take it , or they are the people with other diet/activity choices or preexisting conditions that leads to that abdominal pain . Take ANY other appetite suppression and I PROMISE you that you 'll feel the same abdominal pains--it 's called your stomach shrinking and the " old " you trying to convince you to eat more food . <p> A tip to avoid the pains from being anywhere near as excruciating as people have described : do n't use a daily caloric deficit of greater than 500 calories . This means that your caloric intake should be 500 cals less basal metabolic rate . This will allow you to feel a bit fuller throughout the day because you 'll have higher calorie content in your bigger meals . To go along with that tip , try to get up in the morning , take your first dose , get ready for work , then make a FAT breakfast . The only time I usually ever even notice that I 'm taking it , is in the morning when your stomach is already coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> To address some of the people who are running their asses off or doing HIIT cardio to burn fat while taking hydroxycut : I would recommend that you simply change your fat burning strategy while taking hydroxycut . My cardio regimen consists of long duration &amp; moderate speed walking . This is the same effect as HIIT/Interval cardio ( slightly less effective , but the same core concepts of burning fat rather than muscle proteins for energy sources during workouts ) . You 'll find that you do n't need to do much more than lift weights , do moderate cardio ( NOT intense cardio ) , and keep your diet in check ( no processed foods whenever possible , high protein/lower carb/moderate fats for your calorie composition ) . <p> I DO agree with the people saying that taking the doses on-time is much more difficult than you think , but it is quite critical to do so in order to avoid some of the symptoms ... <p> Follow the instructions , look on bodybuilding.com forums for people who have had successful hydroxycut " cuts " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can offer valuable insight to help you succeed--do n't forget , we are all different specimens at different parts of our voyages to have the bodies of our life ! !

Studies were performed on people taking Lipozene who kept exercising like regular , while not having to diet . Its advised to take Lipozene with at least 8 ounces of water , and 30 minutes before each meal .

Glucomannan is a key active ingredient in this plant which is a water soluble thickener and emulsifier . It is found in parts of Asia , and it is a mass that has had traditional use as a laxative . The intended effect is to grab a hold of things in the digestive tract and to help them get pushed out . It has to be mixed with water so it can properly function and promote slow acting digestion . <p> The FDA has not given this ingredient a pass as a treatment for any medical condition . This means that although companies like Lipozene will say its been clinically studied , its not an active ingredient made to produce guaranteed weight loss . <p> It swells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often used to relieve constipation . Its also used to help stabilize blood sugar and lower cholesterol . It is a sugar extract that is often added to help gel surrounding ingredients , and it is used as a way to help reduce blood sugar during meals . <p> The powder and flour is often added as a food in certain countries , as it can absorb moisture well . In processed foods it also serves the same purpose , and since its cheap to produce , it is a common addition to certain supplements and foods . <p> This study was run similar as to the study Lipozene uses , which did n't  have people add any additional exercise , and allowing people to eat the foods they wanted . <p> The lack of weight loss is exactly why the FDA has not approved this ingredient for weight loss . <p> Another comprehensive study performed by the University of Connecticut found that it : <p> " did not affect total weight loss " <p> This ingredient was given to people who had controlled diets and who made sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by participants , it did not affect their weight loss results . <p> Possible side effects from this ingredient may vary and they can include : <p> Diarrhea , increased bathroom usage , and flatulence . <p> Bloating , stomach problems , and nausea . <p> Difficulty swallowing , blockages in the intestines , and blockages in the throat . <p> Another possible interaction is that it may have complications with medication or other supplements . Reference.com has noted : <p> " can also decrease the effectiveness of certain prescription medications " <p> Therefore potential users should exercise caution , as it can contribute to reduced usefulness of certain pills . This can delay or completely obstruct the effects of ones important medication . There 's no way to determine beforehand what kinds of effects one may have , so it may be best to contact a medical professional to determine if Lipozene can still be taken as well as ones personal medication . <p> The makers of Lipozene do recommend taking it with a full 8 ounces of water . This is to help alleviate any of the potential digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill form this can become logged in the esophagus , which can then lead to suffocating sensations . This is why its advised to make sure to start off with a low regimen of this additive , and to build up according to ones needs and preferences . <p> The FDA at one point banned this in certain foods due to concerns with choking . Health Canada which is similar to the US based FDA has also sent a warning that it has a : <p> " potential for harm if taken without at least 250 ml or 8 ounces of water or other fluid " <p> They noted it can lead to blockages in the intestine and esophagus . They also advise to not take it before one goes to bed . <p> Further review by Web MD on this ingredient as held and they had this to say : <p> Those concerned about their blood sugar may experience detrimental results . This is why its highly important to also contact ones doctor to see if the effects may lead to a negative impact on their blood sugar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful . <p> Also mentioned by Web MD is the possibility of : <p> " solid tablets containing are POSSIBLY UNSAFE for adults and LIKELY UNSAFE for children " <p> FD&amp;C Blue #1 : Synthetic dye which has no nutritional value . Its often added to processed foods in order to give them a blue tint . This ingredient is used controversially due to its lack of weight loss effect or important purpose . <p> This ingredient does not absorb well in the body , and around 95% of it remains in the stool . This will give a noticeable blue discoloration in feces . This Lipozene side effect is not of concern but its something to keep in mind as it can be confusing to see discolored stools . <p> In some people it may lead to allergic reactions such as rashes , difficulty breathing , and other symptoms . This is especially seen in children , who may experience additional ADHD like symptoms . <p> There have also been toxic effects experienced from this ingredient . According to the FDA : <p> " Toxicity , including death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> These potential toxic effects make this unnecessary additive a potentially unsafe ingredient . Food coloring has no nutritional value and its only added to give Lipozene pills a unique tint . Some people have been found to be allergic to this ingredient , and it can lead to rashes and hyperactivity . <p> Their studies found that this food dye has shown the possibility to lead to serious side effects and even toxic buildup which can lead to death . DNA damage is a concern which some studies have shown is a possibility . The issue with this side effect of Lipozene is that it can be difficult to determine what kind of long term impact this may have on health . In some cases this can lead to future issues related to diseases and poor quality of life . <p> In reviewing the Lipozene ingredients its clear that many unwanted additives are included . Some of these have shown the ability to lead to side effects and unwanted symptoms . Many potential side effects of Lipozene exist , most of them having to do with digestive issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " no known allergens in this product " <p> However , studies have shown that some people are allergic to the blue food coloring added . There is also a possibility for DNA damage according to some studies , which can also increase the risk for allergies . The long term effects of this are difficult to describe , as not everyone reacts the same . <p> The EWG.com has also reviewed this additive and according to their studies they found : <p> " Persistent or bio accumulative and moderate to high toxicity concern " <p> This petroleum made dye is seen as being an unnecessary additive to any weight loss supplement or food , though it does give Lipozene its trademark blue tint . <p> The side effects of Lipozene are questionable , due to the additions of additives like this . As you 'll see in the " Customer Opinions of Lipozene " section , there were serious complaints about side effects of Lipozene according to the majority of users who posted their reviews online . <p> Gelatin : A protein extracted from animals which is often used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are inactive and help to provide an adhesive effect , similar to glue . It is a cheap option to help produce capsules , and serve as a flavorless and easy to make solution to transport active ingredients . <p> This ingredient has been shown to be safe and is an effective solution for making capsules . It is also easy to absorb , and will often be used as a base for the majority of supplements used . <p> Stearic Acid : Waxy fatty acid which can be found in vegetable and animal fats .

As you 'll see in the " CUSTOMER OPINIONS OF LIPOZENE " heading , there were many Lipozene complaints from users who experienced side effects as well as a lack of weight loss . <p> The only active ingredient in Lipozene has failed to show any significant effects , many clinical studies have been performed which have shown it to be infective and possibly side effect causing . It can also be found in many other kinds of pills , and there 's not enough to help suggest that Lipozene ingredients ill truly promote sustained weight loss benefits . <p> The beneficial fiber effects can be found in many fruits , vegetables and grains without the potential side effects of Lipozene . There 's a possibility for side effects and not enough in guaranteed effects to suggest one can use Lipozene effectively . <p> Fiber alone is not a reassuring enough ingredient which can truly promote sustained weight loss effects . The issues with this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one has an addiction to food , or if one finds it difficult to reduce their food intake . <p> While fiber can promote a sense of fullness , one can eat small portions of calorie dense foods which can contribute to weight gain . <p> There 's nothing particularly unique about glucomannan that ca n't be simply replaced with a more wholesome fiber source . <p> There are other sources for glucomannan which are cheaper and do n't  have inactive ingredients which can lead to side effects . <p> Its for all these reasons and more that determining does Lipozene really work is impossible to say . There are far too many factors which come into play which can reduce the overall effectiveness of this weight loss pill . <h> The Price and Quality of Lipozene <p> Sales are available direct from the official website , with one bottle costing $29.95 . Though this is only for a trial offer , and the company fails to mention how much it will cost to order this brand an additional time . Each bottle has 30 capsules , and its advised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each bottle only lasts 5 days . The daily piece for a trial bottle then is $7.99 , when one considers the total length of use . <p> You can also find Lipozene at many retail stores both online and in person . Lipozene at Walmart sells for $19.99 reduced from $25.99 per bottle . The Lipozene website does say however that their return is only offered for purchases made from their website . So while Walmart may be cheaper , there 's also no money back return from the official company . <p> Since there 's only one key active ingredient in Amorphophallus Konjac , this formula is very poor . This ingredient can be found for much cheaper elsewhere , and the only different in this brand and others is the marketing . The sole extract in this which is meant for weight loss is Glucomannan , and it can be found in many other supplements . The only other ingredients added to Lipozene are inactive ingredients such as food coloring . <p> No science is provided to showcase why the dosage strength of Lipozene pills is any better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good amount of the sole active ingredient glucomannan , and they found : <p> " Clinical studies of obesity have used dosages of 1 to 13 g daily " <p> Therefore , there 's no real known preference to low or high amounts . 1 to 13 grams is a giant leap in dosage strength . They also found by looking at studies that : <p> So there is no known increased benefit in terms of weight loss , but there is a possibility for increased side effects with larger amounts . Currently Lipozene pills have a total of 1,500 mg per 2 capsules , or 4,500 mg per 6 maximum capsule servings . Therefore , one is receiving 4.5 grams of glucomannan or just less than 500 mg of what is considered a likely result of side effects . <p> The issue with this formula is that there still have been many who experienced side effects and a lack of weight loss with the total full daily dosage of Lipozene . <p> Also , glucomannan has not been proven to have beneficial weight loss results . Clinical studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of this brand is poor . <p> Lipozene suffers from being incredibly expensive , and being potentially dangerous . Lipozene side effects were a constant issue for some users , and in reading about the additives its clear that the formula is not entirely safe . Users will often ask " is Lipozene safe ? " and while its impossible to determine beforehand what ones results may be , there is an alarming amount of negative reviews . <p> Some had added that it promoted many unwanted side effects , and clinical studies have shown that some of the additives can promote symptoms when taken individually . <p> They add in their terms and conditions which one must apply for if one makes a purchase they will not sue the company if there were any issues related to a lack of weight loss results . When you read the long winded terms and conditions section it says that any and all issues are to be settled by an arbitration between a company chosen by the manufacturers . This kind of practice is questionable and showcases a potential issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being able to make your own decisions on how to best handle a potential issue with Lipozene . This answers the question of whether or not Lipozene side effects may be potentially extreme . Its not normal for a company to want it automatically protect itself unless it has had serious issues in the past , or if they do not trust their own formula . <p> If one were to experience a lack of weight loss results or even possible symptoms , you 'd have to settle with a company chosen by the makers of Lipozene . This showcases how the company is not entirely secure in the quality of Lipozene ingredients . Its unclear why they have chosen such a drastic route in order to prevent potential lawsuits . Our review experts have crafted a list of the top ranked weight loss pills available . <h> How does Lipozene work ? <p> The website describes Lipozene as having one benefit , which is providing fiber that makes one feel full so you end up eating less . You take it alongside food and the intended benefit is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The benefit of this is that water weight can often return with things like sodium intake , lack of water , and due to the kinds of foods eaten . By targeting fat directly , its meant to actually lead to long term effects on weight . <p> The sole active ingredient is Glucomannan , which can be found in other supplements alongside additional ingredients . The issue with Lipozene is that its made to produce weight loss with one sole ingredient . This is not potent enough to really promote significant weight loss according to most users . While fiber can promote satiety , this can be found in many other foods with a reduced price . <p> It can also be easy to over eat Glucomannan , and this can lead to side effects including digestive issues . While its preferable to have it in capsule form instead of it taken in its pure powder , there 's still the possibility for complications . <p> Determining how does Lipozene work is difficult as not all users will experience the same results . One can still overeat even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult thing to target as one can develop addictions to eating rich foods . <h> Business of Lipozene <p> The owners of Lipozene go by the name of Obesity Research Institute , LLC . Though they are not actually a scientific organization which researchers obesity . Their name is very misleading and makes it seem as though they have scientists in their headquarters , instead of being a group that sells diet pills . They can be reached via the following : <p> Phone Number : ( 800 ) 409-9768 <p> Address : 4910 Longley Ln STE 101 <p> Reno , Nevada 89502 <p> The company currently has 52 different complaints on their Better Business Bureau page , though originally they had much more before they revamped and changed their BBB company profile . Heres what some people had to say about the company : <p> " never authorized this and had already asked them to stop charging me " <p> " refusing to cancel and return my funds " <p> " told me that even if I sent the product back they still would not refund my money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Of the 52 complaints , 31 had to do with the company automatically charging each month for unrequested products . This is what 's known as an auto billing practice , and it locks people onto month to month contracts . People were also lured in by the cheap trial bottle , which then quickly extends into a pricier jump in price per additional bottle of Lipozene . <p> People were worried to discover they could n't cancel , and that the company failed to honor their 30 day money back guarantee . Many repeat Lipozene complaints are found online from many unsatisfied customers who felt ripped off . This included those who felt that they bought Lipozene in good faith , only to suddenly be billed without due notice first . <p> Rip Off Report.com also features many negative reviews relating to issues with billing , and a lack of helpful customer service . <p> This company also had to settle a 2005 lawsuit that the Federal Trade Commission fined them . A total $1.5 million dollar lawsuit was settled due to the company making false weight loss claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and many people who were tricked . The FTC letter which was sent to the company stated : <p> " claimed would cause rapid , substantial weight loss without any need to diet or exercise " <p> They also added in their statement : <p> " barred from making false claims about any dietary product in the future " <p> Due to these false claims , the company was forced to revoke their claims and promise not to repeat these mistakes for any other marketing campaigns . This major lawsuit forced to company to stop making print advertisements , online statements , and reformulating their entire marketing . Lipozene consumer reports are largely negative as they mention the companys history of lying to consumers . Featured in this link is a comprehensive list showcasing the best weight loss supplements . <p> In 2015 the ESRP or Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program advised the company to stop making , or to alter the claims made about Lipozene pills . This agency helps to regulate advertising and is moderated by the Better Business Bureau . They looked over the 2005 FTC suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This included statements and testimonials such as : <p> " Lipozene has effectively helped millions of people meet their weight loss goals " <p> Other statements including claims that its sold over 20 million , that its Americans #1 supplement for weight loss , and that its free of any side effects . They took issue with these kinds of claims since there is a lack of evidence to support all that 's advertised . These kinds of bold claims can be difficult to prove , and in looking at the official website its clear that no evidence of this claim is featured anywhere . <p> In fact , only 3 testimonials are offered on their official website . With so many users , one would expect a lot more customers to want to leave their own before and after photos . Without clearer evidence to help prove this bold claim , its impossible for one to determine if what is said is true . Also , just because something is widely used does not mean that its actually effective . Many scams and shady practices have lured unsuspecting users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements made online are not factual and that : <p> " claims do not depict results that may be typically expected by consumers " <p> EDITORS TIP : For the best results , our experts recommend using weight loss pills for at least 3 months . Save your money by buying a few bottles at once . <h> Customer Opinions of Lipozene <p> The majority of Lipozene reviews are extremely negative . Currently , 630 complaints are listed on their Amazon.com page . A minority of people have actually said that they felt this supplement was beneficial . Heres what some customers had to say about their experience with Lipozene : <p> " I am very disappointed in this product and the false advertisements " <p> " gained 11 pounds in two weeks taking Lipozene exactly how it is prescribed " <p> " did not help me lose any weight what so ever " <p> " I have been on the toiler for over an hour and a half vomiting " <p> People often complained about a lack of appetite suppression and weight loss benefits of any kind . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dehydration , increased bowel movements , bloating , constipation , and difficulty swallowing . Some described it as being a complete waste of money , and that it only promoted i 'll side effects . <p> Reviews on Lipozene are often of disappointed customers who found that they did not experience any of the claimed benefits , even with repeat use . In trying to find out does Lipozene work the majority of users who tried it for long periods added how they would not recommend it . <p> Lipozene before and after photos featured on the website do showcase great weight loss results , but the website does add a disclaimer that this is not typical , and that diet and exercise were also included . So one can not expect these kinds of results solely on Lipozene alone , one also has to add discipline by eating less and exercising more . <p> Live Strong.com has reviewed all the claims of weight loss and they have added : <p> " no research has focused on Lipozene advertised claims for Lipozene are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly on anecdotal experiences " <p> Therefore , there 's a complete lack of research to help show whether or not one can expect any real weight loss results . Furthermore , the studies performed were on glucomannan itself , not on Lipozene . This makes it possible that the claimed results are exaggerated , or that there are different dosing requirements that are n't  matched by Lipozene . <p> In researching does Lipozene actually work its evident that many have responded with a resounding no . It did not produce any of the claimed results according to several user reviews . In fact , there were many Lipozene complaints from unsatisfied users who said that the clamed benefits are greatly exaggerated . Unfortunately even those who made sure to diet and exercise have also failed to notice any changes in weight . Provided in this link is a list of the best weight loss supplements as reviewed by our experts . <h> Conclusion - Does Lipozene Work ? <p> When making a decision on Lipozene , its important to look at the company history , customer reviews , and kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for weight loss , the rest are stabilizers and fillers . This includes blue food coloring which has been shown to be potentially toxic . Many people were disappointed to find that Lipozene did not help with weight loss , nor did it suppress appetite . The company has also been fined by the FTC for making false weight loss claims . <p> In determining does Lipozene really work its been shown that the additives even if they do n't  produce side effects , are unlikely to produce the claimed dramatic weight loss effects . Lipozene consumer reports are extremely negative , with the official consumer reports website adding " Do n't  waste your money " . Its clear from the majority of user reviews that many felt there are no weight loss effects possible . <p> In Sletrokor is plant based extracts made to help control blood sugar , reduce appetite , raise metabolism , improve mood , and provide several other potent benefits . That 's why so many users have left great reviews and testimonials showcasing this supplements weight loss effects . People have continued to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has many more active ingredients instead of Lipozenes only one active ingredient . It also avoids fiber additives which may lead to indigestion , and one does not have to take it 30 minutes before meals , but instead during meals to help avoid potential timing mishaps . The blend of active ingredients all has a potent intent for weight loss . Added to the formula are natural plant compounds such as garcinia cambogia , cascara sagrada , aloe vera , gymnema sylvestre and much more . <p> Before you buy something it 's always good to do an in-depth research on the product . I wanted to buy it but then I searched : Lipozene Reviews on Google and this page showed up : https : **29;40;TOOLONG <p> It looks like a 30 cap bottle will last you only for 5 days since you have to take 6 a day , that will be around $180 a month , not to mention it has terrible side effects . <p> posted Mar 7th , 2015 1:22 pm <p> Renee Proctor <p> ? <p> Will Lopozene hurt my Ulcers ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that really works ! its really good . but they took it off the shelves and I miss them . I hope they come back . I just bought Lipozene and I have ulcers so I am just a little worried will that give me problems ? I hope not . But iam going to try it . If it works I will stick to it . It is a lot cheaper than Ali .

We purchased it at Walmart after reading almost all the other diet pills/supplements they had , thinking this one would be the best for us . After a week , we felt no change . We did n't feel any less hungry , not any more energetic than normal , did not have to go to the bathroom more than usual - nothing . We kept going , to go a full month on it . Our diets have always been healthy , and we did exercising the whole time . Neither of us lost any weight from this product , nor had any positive/negative effect - it was pointless .

The complaints are off the charts ! They give your bank info to third parties who debit your account or credit card without your consent . Glucomannan does NOT burn fat , it just reduces your appetite by making you feel full . Scam , Scam , Scam ! ! <p> If you do n't want to just lose weight , but pounds of body fat , Lipozene is for you . Never mind that that message is a bit perplexing . What else do you want to lose but " body fat " ? <p> That 's not the only strange or negative message sent in the video testimonial that is displayed on the Lipozene homepage . The general message is not very responsible either : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose weight . <p> Magic pill marketing is not the way to go . So , criticism aside , what is the make up of Lipozene ? Glucomannan . That 's it . You do n't see very many weight loss supplements that put all of their eggs in one basket . Glucomannan is a dietary fiber that promotes satiety . <p> One study showed that glucomannan helped people lose an average of 5.5 pounds . The study was made of obese individuals , who would take one gram of glucomannan and 8oz. of water an hour prior to three meals a day , during an eight week period . <p> Lipozene with its only ingredient Glucomannan appears to be nothing more than a high-fiber supplement . However , if you 're buying Lipozene for just one ingredient , the high fiber , you could get a similar effect from a high-fiber cereal or making sure you eat fibrous vegetables . It would be more affordable . As with any weight loss program , you should seek your doctor 's advice before starting . Adding a high-fiber supplement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 10978 @qwx870978

No official guide is offered to help explain what is needed to follow this plan , but there are simple suggestions made . <p> There is no added meal plan and instead its advised to eat in moderation while using this diet . Apple cider vinegar has become a popular holistic food as its claimed to be able to promote many health benefits . Our review experts have analyzed many unique diets and they 've concluded the best overall is the 18Shake Diet . It ranks high in customer satisfaction due to its appetite suppressing meal replacement and fat burning diet pill . They help to increase weight loss without the use of stimulants , artificial ingredients , or fillers . Learn more information about the 18Shake Diet when you click on the link provided here . <p> The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person study which showed that people who ate white vinegar with bread felt fuller than those who only ate the bread by itself .

It still requires having to control calorie intake , though no suggestions are offered as to what one should eat or how limited ones food selections should be.Therefore , theresnot much available support given to followers of this diet . <p> Web MD also cited a study which used vinegar as a weight loss tool : <p> " 175 obese but healthy people tool either vinegar or water daily for 12 weeks . Their diets were similar " <p> " At the end of the study , those who used vinegar lost slightly more weight on average . The vinegar group lost 1-2 pounds over the 3-month period . They gained it all back after the study was over " <p> While this study did show someweight loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2 pounds of weight loss is not much at all . People also regained all their weight , so it was not a lasting effect . <p> A dietician named Debbie Davis also mentions how vinegar might work : <p> " may have some benefits in terms of weight loss and weight management , but it is definitely not a quick fix " <p> It does have an effect on controlling blood sugar , but taking apple cider vinegar in high amounts and on an empty stomach can promote side effects such as : <p> Increased acid production in the stomach , difficulty swallowing , and nausea . <p> Increased burping , throat damage , and upset stomach . <p> It can also be difficult to drink straight shots of vinegar since its acidic and it has a very sour taste . <p> Other issues are mentioned by Web MD : <p> " Its so acidic that it could harm our tooth enamel and your esophagus " <p> This is why its often advised to take only small amounts and to dilute it with water . Its unknown if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> Apple Cider Vinegar Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The diet is simple ; it only requires eating sensibly while introducing apple cider vinegar before meals . Theresno much available support , and there 's no recommendations for foods . <p> While apple cider vinegar can be healthy , its not enough to promote well rounded weight loss . Taking it on its own can be potentially harmful especially when drank repeatedly and on an empty stomach . This diet requires it to be taken just before meals which can strain the body . <h> The Price and Quality of Apple Cider Vinegar Diet <p> Apple cider vinegar is the only food which is specificallyrecommended to be taken . Its typically sold in a glass jug for just a few dollars . Since this diet requires 3 tablespoons before meals , its likely one will have to buy in bulk . <p> There 's not much support offered by this diet however , as its basically explained in just a few sentences . No information is provided at all on what kinds of foods to use , instead its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple cider vinegar . While this is a simple request , its unknown if this would be enough to promote long lasting or effective weight loss results . <h> Business of Apple Cider Vinegar Diet <p> There 's no informationavailable to help show who created this diet , and no book or official guide is available anywhere . This makes it impossible to ask the creators any information about how to use this diet , or to learn of any tips . <p> The basics are outlined in a few websites that do not mention where they found information about this diet . This makes it impossible to determine why they suggest 3 tablespoons every day before each meal . Its important to verify if this is the optimal amount , as it can be difficult to drink this much . <p> They also fail to mention whether or not one can dilute the vinegar with water or other liquids . <h> Customer Opinions of Apple Cider Vinegar Diet <p> Very few reviews are available online , as there are other diets which also use apple cider vinegar as a main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on different diets without mentioning their official names . <p> Here are some reviews from those who have introduced apple cider vinegar into their diets : <p> " its not working with me " <p> " it is hard to swallow " <p> " My throat is still burning this morning " <p> " could n't get past the horrible taste heartburn , and being so thirsty . Also made me feel a little strange , kinda spacey " <p> It was hard for many to swallow this much apple cider vinegar . People oftencomplained about side effects such as heartburn , sore throat , nausea , inability to enjoy foods , and increased acidity . <p> When taking largeamounts of apple cider vinegar , its likely to promote increased stomach acids which can make eating more difficult . However , it can also promote side effects such as the ones customers have listed above . <p> There were some that did manage to lose weight , but its unclear if this is a healthy approach to weight loss . There 's nothing in apple cider vinegar alone which is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Conclusion - Does Apple Cider Vinegar Diet Work ? <p> The Apple Cider Vinegar Diet has a very simple premise ; it calls for eating in moderation and taking 3 tablespoons of this vinegar before meals . There is no official guide or website which claims to have created this diet . There are only a few sentences which help explain it . Its unknown whether or not it would be safe to use repeatedly , or why it specified a specific 3 tablespoons . Without more information , its impossible to determine whether or not it was created with legitimatescience in mind . There were also mixed reviews from some people only experiencing side effects and others with modest weight loss . Its unlikely to produce any long lasting effects however , as there 's no evidence to help support this exact diet . <p> My brother just started ACV and a question . My brother has been using ACV for about a little over a week and has no appetite , is this a side effect of the ACV ? ? I read on here others mentioned loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return ? ?

I originally purchased the acv for health benefits other than weightloss , but it would be awesome if this could increase the likelihood that i will loose some weight . I am 5 ' 7 and weigh 155 pounds . I would like to loose 15 pounds . So today i started drinking 2 tbsp about 15 minutes before i eat . I had absolutely no appetite all day long and plenty of energy to hit the gym .

So if there is any advice out there I am open to it .. will update at a later date . Thanks <p> Hi guys ! I started this vinegar treatment about 4 days ago . Ca n't report on weight loss yet but I can tell you that almost immediately I noticed a significant decrease in appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have been feeling better or more energetic but I have the flu . So I wont really be able to tell about that until I 'm better . But my heartburn in just gone . No heartburn I love it . Also I think my skin is clearing up : ) I plan to get more exercise and eat better and I hope that doing this treatment alongside will be beneficial to my weight loss . I read an article from someone who did this long-term , and she said that the brand of vinegar she used never made a difference as long as it 's apple cider vinegar .

I 've been speaking to a nutritionist about my future approach to weight loss . There 's a giant glitch I 'm noticing in these posts . DIET does not mean EAT LESS OFTEN , it means EAT LESS MORE OFTEN . Might sound a little k-12 but use your food groups . This diet causes decrease in appetite ( the vinegar shrinks your stomach ) but for nutrients and energy , you have to eat and eat healthy . In this world we 're super-sizing everything . Cut portions in half and make it healthy . Steam , bake , and boil . For energy , complement your new diet with b-12 supplements . THEY WORK ! ! ! I 'm officially starting my diet today . Here are the main tips : -5 meals daily ( breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat= deck of cards , fistfuls of everything else ) *Snack suggestions= Fruit bowls or yogurt <p> -Eat dinner at least four hours before your bed time ( I aim for 6-7:30 ) <p> IG ? ? ve been drinking BraggG ? ? s ACV raw organic honey religiously everyday , 2-3 teaspoons of ACV to 1 teaspoon of honey before every meal . IG ? ? ve also cut down on snacking between my meals ( used to always snack ) and incorporated minimal exercise into my life ( once per week for now because IG ? ? m having my exams ) . I no longer drink sweetened beverages , only been drinking water , unsweetened tea and coffee ( This with sugar , around 3 times per week . Again , because IG ? ? m having exams and tea doesnG ? ? t keep me as awake as coffee ) . But IG ? ? ve yet to lose a single pound . Am i doing something wrong ! ! !

From losing weight to ridding your body of toxins , many people swear by the effects of putting their bodies and minds through the challenge of a cleanse . One such popular cleansing diet is the apple cider vinegar program . <p> It 's yet to be determined if the benefits of apple cider vinegar are worthwhile for weight loss . Even still , some suggest that the acidity of the vinegar mixed with the pectin found in apples can offer an easy answer to dropping pounds . <p> While pectin has been linked with lowering cholesterol , it 's still unclear whether there is a connection with weight loss . A 2005 study of 12 people found that those who ate a piece of bread along with small amounts of white vinegar felt fuller and more satisfied than those who just ate the bread . <p> On the apple cider vinegar diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times a day . Organic apple cider vinegar is a top-choice among enthusiasts . <p> Here is what you do on the apple cider vinegar diet : Take no more than three teaspoons of apple cider vinegar about 15 minutes before each meal . Regular users recommend prepping your stomach by taking one teaspoon to start with and easing into more . <p> The apple cider vinegar diet does not prescribe a menu or meal plan . Just eat in moderation with sensible portions and skip the snacks . Over time , the vinegar will decrease hunger and urges to nibble . <p> If the flavor becomes too much to handle , you can find apple cider vinegar tablets . <p> EXERCISE <p> Not really applicable since this address something very specific in the benefits of apple cider vinegar . But , the book does broach the subject a little . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Since the benefits of apple cider vinegar are still inconclusive , it 's hard to make a solid recommendation . Some research shows that it does have some health benefits like reducing cholesterol and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few apparent serious risks involved , speak to your doctor before consuming apple cider vinegar , especially if you have osteoporosis or take any medications. 10978 @qwx870978

Basically , any slight changes that you make will enhance the weight loss process . Changing your diet , exercising , or just being more active throughout the course of the day will help . <p> First , let 's discuss the diet . Try to avoid fast food as often as you can and check food labels as well . I recommend keeping a food log , this holds you accountable and helps you keep track of the amount of calories you intake . Try to focus on foods that are high in protein and low in sodium , fat , saturated fat , and carbohydrates . Make sure to watch your portion sizes , too . <p> Staying active throughout the day is a must as well . This helps keep the heart rate up and metabolism a little higher than normal . Try going for a walk in the morning , afternoon , and evening , or after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouts of physical activity along with your everyday workout routine . Try to exercise three to five days a week at 45 to 60 minutes a pop .

You do n't  need me to tell you most of us do n't  look like models , but this fact does n't  mean you cant enjoy feeling hot in a sexy bra and a cute pair of panties . Everyone deserves to feel great in their underwear , so here are a few tips to help you get there . <p> Fit Fit Fit <p> Invest some real time shopping for a bra . It can be tiresome , embarrassing , and draining , but the pay-off will be huge . Having the right bra makes a big impact on your figure .

Do n't  fall into this trap , a bra shouldnt shift around on your body .

The phases of the diet are : <p> Phase 1 " Attack " : You can eat as much protein as you 'd like from 68 different kinds of animal protein . <p> Its said this phase will : <p> " increases the speed of weight loss while flushing out the excess water " <p> Between 6 to 8 cups of water are needed daily , as well as 1.5 tablespoons of oat bran for fiber to help reduce appetite , and to help with limiting the absorption of calories . <p> Its also advised to introduce exercise , preferably in the morning . Also , the length of the diet depends on how much weight one wants to lose . The standards are listed as : <p> 40 pounds or more : Talk to a physician and do it for around 7 days . <p> Between 15 to 30 pounds : 3-5 days . <p> 10 pounds or less : 1-2 days . <p> The average time for most people is 2-5 days . <p> Phase 2 " Cruise " : This phase is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

So for people who have lost 30 pounds , 150 days are needed . You also get to eat the exact same foods allowed from the Attack and Cruise phases . <p> For the first half of the phase the following are required : <p> 1 serving of starchy foods each week . <p> 1.5 ounces of hard cheese . <p> 2 slices of whole grain bread . <p> A serving of fruit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servings of fruit . <p> 2 servings of starchy foods each week . <p> 2 slices of whole grain bread . <p> 2 tablespoons of oat bran are required daily alongside around 25 minutes of brisk walking .

Once a week similar to the Attack phase , its necessary to eat only protein . This is required for the duration of ones life . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> The Dukan Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The diet focuses on suggesting certain foods , so the overall quality depends on which one chooses . Though there are very specific allowances for foods . For the Attack phase one has to eat only protein . This can be potentially unsafe , Web MD confirms : <p> " experts still do not know what the long-term effects are for your health and weight " <p> " no evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enough to maintain your weight loss " <p> They also discuss the Dukan Diet by stating : <p> " does n't  teach lifelong healthy eating habits . " <p> " could lead to a nutritionally inadequate diet " <p> They also add : <p> " the risks may outweigh the benefits " <p> This makes the Dukan Diet a potentially unhealthy diet plan which does not guarantee safe weight loss results . <p> The British Dietic Association which is Britains largest organization of nutrition and food experts named this the : <p> " Top Celebrity Diet to Avoid " <p> For 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 it was rated as the absolute worst diet to use . Its also been in the top 5 list for years now . This is due to health concerns , and a lack of proven safe weight loss . The group also adds : <p> " Initial weight loss will be fluid " <p> This is because carbohydrates which are strictly forbidden for most of the diet help to promote water weight . Live Strong mentions that : <p> " Its possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during one week , most of which is water " <p> Therefore , its likely most of the weight lost on this diet is strictly just water . <h> The Price and Quality of The Dukan Diet <p> Prices range depending on the kinds of groceries purchased . The website also offers online support for a total of $29.99 each month . This is optional and not required . <p> The diet is considered a crash diet since it requires extreme changes in diet . The major concern from health groups is that the Dukan Diet is n't practical , proven safe , or helpful for promoting long lasting dietary advice . <h> Customer Opinions of The Dukan Diet <p> " My blood pressure was really low , I had no energy at all and my doctor told me that the diet was very unhealthy " <p> " my hair began falling out and my fingernails broke in record time " <p> " This diet just is n't healthy " <p> " This diet is so hard to follow " <p> Many people found it incredibly limiting and impossible to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues such as low energy , headaches , brittle hair and nails , low blood pressure , mood swings , loss of focus , and other problems . <p> A major concern was that people were extremely bored of the diet , and that it was hard for many to keep eating the same kinds of foods , even when there are 100 options available . <p> The extreme carbohydrate loss also caused the majority of users to have no energy . <h> Conclusion - Does The Dukan Diet Work ? <p> When making a decision on a diet plan like the Dukan Diet , its important to examine the science behind it , customer reviews , and what 's offered . The required food allowances are considered extreme , as the beginning of the phase allows for only protein . Many users mention it promoted side effects , and that it was bland eating the same kinds of foods repeatedly . Health experts also add that this diet may be potentially unhealthy , and its unknown what kinds of long term effects it may promote . Furthermore , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated diet plan of the year is known as the 18Shake Diet .

This phase should not be followed for longer than 10 days . <p> Cruise Phase : Alternating in five-day cycles , you cycle back and forth between eating protein and non-starchy vegetables and eating only protein .

@@98099794 @2299794/ <h> Ideal Shape Shake Review : Does it Work ? <h> Use hypnotherapy along with other elements to lose weight and keep it off . 10971 @qwx870971 <p> Ideal Shape is a weight loss shake made with a hunger blocking ingredient said to produce potent results . The website claims that unlike other shakes , this one has the appetite suppressor already inside its formula . <p> It contains over 50% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals . There 's also just 2 grams of sugar added depending on the flavor , of which there are 7 different varieties . This includes chocolate , chocolate cream pie , vanilla , strawberry , orange cream , mocha , and cookies n cream . This comprehensive review will go over the quality of the ingredients , its taste , what it can do in terms of weight loss , and whether or not its a safe and healthy mixture of ingredients . For your convenience a list of the top 10 meal replacements is available if you click here . <p> Artificial Flavor : This man made ingredient is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake . It can be extracted from many different things , and this includes common allergens such as soy , wheat , and corn . <p> Cellulose Gum : This thickener and binder is added to many items such as laxatives , toothpaste , and paper products . A study by Nature , the international weekly journal of science found that this ingredient : <p> " might be contributing to an increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases " <p> This additive showed a possibility for causing weight gain and inflammation which could lead to serious illnesses . <p> The study concluded with the idea that the possible reason for increased obesity is ingredients like this in the American diet . This additive is a cheap binder which is often only found in processed foods . <p> Potato Protein Extract : This ingredient is made to help reduce appetite . Though considered safe , a study on its weight loss effects have been disproven according to the European Food Safety Authority , which reviewed a patented version of this ingredient . They found that a : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the consumption of Potato Extract and reduction of body weight " <p> This means that its yet to be proven as an effective weight loss ingredient . <p> Sucralose : An artificial sweetener which is approcimately 320 to 100 times much sweeter than regular sucrose . <p> This ingredient has been shown to be potentially dangerous . The Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health adds : <p> P-gp will be released by the body only when a potential toxin enters the body . Also , this ingredient reduced the amount of healthy microflora . This is needed in order to help support a stable and functioning immune system . <p> Its unknown what kinds of long term effects this may have on health . Reduced microflora can be a potentially damaging issue that harms overall health . <p> Acesulfame Potassium : Calorie free artificial sweetener which is around 200 times sweeter than sucrose . <p> Though this ingredient is added to help have a lowered effect on blood sugar , a study featured in the Hormone and Metabolic Resaerch journal found that it : <p> Acesulfame K not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also induce insulin secretion " <p> So this ingredient may potentially cause metabolism disorders , and it does have a noted effect on blood sugar . Its effects on changing brain chemistry may also be a potentially serious problem . Its unknown how this affects long term health . <h> Ideal Shape Quality of Ingredients <p> There 's only 100 caloris per serving , and 11 grams of good protein in whey . The issue is that more protein would have been better , also there 's a mixture of 3 artificial ingredients , 2 of which have been shown in clinical studies to be potentially unsafe for overall health . <p> There has also been the issue with sucralose and cellulose gum potentially increasing the risk for either obesity or disease . Both of these ingredients have been shown in studies to have alarming effects on health . They might have a damaging effect on brain health as well as the immune system . These cheap ingredients are only added to substitute other additives . They do n't  have an improved effect on health , and they 're often only found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combine this supplement with a proven meal replacement such as 18Shake for better results . <h> The Price and Quality of Ideal Shape <p> A container of 30 servings sells for $49.99 when purchased via the manufacturer . If taken at the advised 2 shakes a day maximum , the daily cost would be $3.33 . <p> Since there are binders and artificial ingredients added to this , it reduces the overall quality of Ideal Shape . There 's a possibility for damaging effects on health , as well as a potential increase for obesity . Many of these ingredients are cheapo additives which are used to substitute more wholesome ingredients . This includes cheap binders , artificial flavors , and artificial sweeteners . <p> The major problem with these kinds of additives is that its unknown what kind of an effect they might have long-term . Also , for the price paid , this shake is not a very well-priced brand . <p> " company has n't  disclosed the exact amount of lead levels contained in their product " <p> People were disappointed to learn that the shakes they ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause organ damage , coma , seizure , and even death . <p> The company fails to explain why lead is necessary in these shakes . Its not a common ingredient that any other meal replacement has , and its potentially fatal . Lead is sometimes found in certain weight loss products and shakes due to the manufacturing of certain ingredients . Its unknown which of the additives in Ideal Shape is the reason for added lead . <p> Returns are also only offered for purchases more than $74.99 . Though there are complaints online from people claiming the company does not honor their return policy . <p> EDITORS TIP : For the best results with meal replacement shakes diet our experts recommend to use it at least 5 months . Save your money buying a few bags of meal replacement product . <h> Customer Opinions of Ideal Shape <p> Here are some reviews from online users : <p> " it does not seem to curb my appetite " <p> " I ended up throwing it away without even tasting it " <p> " This shake is disgustingly sweet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was shocked to feel the opposite , I was very hungry " <p> Many people were concerned to find no appetite suppression or weight loss benefits . <p> There were also many who found this shake far too sweet . People were concerned witht the amount of artificial sweeteners added , and there was issues with the cloyingly sweet taste . <p> Some could not finish the entire container due to the taste . Complaints were had by people who found that it did n't  taste natural in any way . <h> Conclusion - Does Ideal Shape Work ? <p> When deciding on whether or not to try Ideal Shape , its important to look over all the available information . This shakes has artificial ingredients , and many customers were concerned to learn that lead is also found in these shakes . People often mention that they could n't drink this shake , due to the overly sweet taste from the artificial sweeteners .

The problem with your comment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three different metabolism , and three different activity levels . It is an unfair judgement to say Ideal Shape produced the least amount of weight loss in your trial . To make it a fair trial you need to do one month where all participants are on X , then the following month switch , then the following month switch . I guarantee you will all see different results on each of the products because of your different bodies . Some of you could be insulin resistant and not even know it . So many medical things go unnoticed and could also explain the lessor loss .

Its not specifically made for weight loss however , and the rules on what one needs to follow are not well explained . <p> One to two meals or even a snack are to be substituted with jars of baby food , which have around 20 to 100 calories per jar depending on the brand and kind of food . Finding information about this diet is difficult as there are a few variations . Our experts have rated countless diets and have confirmed that the most effective solution for weight loss is the 18Shake Diet . It offers a meal replacement and diet pill that have combined fat loss effects . Both are made free of stimulants , artificial ingredients , binders , fillers , or unwanted additives . More information about the 18Shake Diet can be read about in the link provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the foods one will be eating will be baby food , the kinds ofingredients found depend on the specific brand . There are many kinds of baby food , and this can include vegetable based or fruit based foods . Typically these foods are free of preservatives or any additives they 're typically natural whole foods which have been mushed to be made easy to eat . Click the link here to see a top 10 list of the highest ranked diets for weight loss . <p> The kinds of foods and standards one website recommends are : <p> Some meats such as turkey , beef , and chicken . <p> Pureed vegetables and fruits . <p> Up to 14 jars a day to replace 2 meals . <p> Typically one can eat many jars of baby food since they have much less calories , protein , and fiber . There also can be issues with not getting adequate nutrition , as Web MD mentions : <p> " Replacing meals with baby food could result in nutritional imbalances and getting very few calories " <p> They also discuss whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " may find your stomach grumbling after a " meal " on this diet " <p> This is also not a long term solution for weight loss .

The nutritional needs of a baby are far different than an adult , so this can make for deficiencies and issues .

As Web MD mentions : <p> " Costs may add up quickly too , depending on how many jars a day you will be eating " <p> For example , a 12 pack of single servingyogurt smoothie featured on Walmart sells for $20.41 . A 12 count of 4 oz. each baby food also sells for $11.85 on the same site . Considering one has to eat around 14 jars a day , this can be incredibly costly .

However , she has since stopped promoting this diet for unknown reasons . <p> There are many websites which explain the Baby Food Diet , and each one has their own take . There 's not one specific source for this diet . The only information which is universal is that one should replace meals with a few jars of baby food of ones choosing . There are no additional tips or suggestions made by websites which promote this diet . <p> This is why many who have tried to learn more about this plan have found it confusing . There are often questions about how to start , or what considerations should be made . <p> Some suggest eating 14 servings and replacing two meals a day for as long as one needs to .

It claims to have been used by Elvis Presley , though little information exists about its history or origin . <p> The idea is that since not getting enough sleep can lead to obesity , receiving more sleep can help with weight loss . It also is used to help those who eat excessively not have to worry about being tempted by food . Our experts have rated several unique diet plans and have found that the 18Shake Diet produced the most effective weight loss . It offers a meal replacement that suppresses appetite , and a fat burning diet pill . Both have wholesome all natural ingredients with no preservatives , colors , or stimulants .

The types of sedatives which are recommended can be potentially harmful , and the diet does not mention how long one should be using these pills . <p> " sleeping for several days straight wont make you thinner , and neither will the potentially addicting pills " <p> There 's actually no proof or science shown to help show whether or not this diet is safe and effective . Similar to other fad diets , there are claims made without any proof . Christopher Ochner a PhD director of research and development and administration at Mount Sinai found that : <p> " Every time you go under , there 's risk " <p> " you might wake up 2 pounds lighter , but you might not wake up at all " <p> When abusing sedatives it can lead to addiction and negative health effects . This is why there are specific prescriptions which are often only recommended for short term use .

There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to prevent hunger . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> The Sleeping Beauty Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The only ingredients one needs to take come from sedatives . This can be difficult to obtain however , since a prescription is needed and only given for a specific reason not related to weight loss . <p> This diet has not been proven to be a safe and effective way to help provide weight loss . Getting enough sleep is important to prevent stress buildup and obesity , but too muchsleep can also be harmful . Web MD adds : <p> " oversleeping has been linked to a host of medical problems , including diabetes , heart disease and increased risk of death " <p> They also mention its effects on weight : <p> " Sleeping too much or too little could make you weight too much " <p> " people who slept for nine or 10 hours every night were 21% more likely to become obese " <p> This means that while The Sleeping Beauty Diet is made to help prevent one from eating excess calories , there is still an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While on this diet one is relying on starvation and an extreme caloric deficit in order to produce weight loss . This is not a safe and long-term solution for results . Web MD describes a diet like this to be similar to an eating disorder . They mention : <p> " fasting - - that is , eating little to no food - - will result in weight loss , at least in the short term . But the risk far outweigh any benefits , and ultimately , fasting can cause more harm than good " <p> So while initially one might lose some weight alongside muscle , metabolism will also slow down which will halt any short-term weight loss results . Also , when the body goes into starving its likely that most of what is lost will be water weight which quickly returns with regular eating habits . <p> This is not a lasting solution for weight loss , and without any evidence or studies , its unknown if it is a safe approach to weight loss . <h> The Price and Quality of The Sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one chooses to use sedatives to help one sleep . For those that have no trouble sleeping the diet is free . However , since there is clear evidence that oversleeping can actually lead to weight gain and health problems , its not advised to use this diet . <p> There 's no evidence or guidelines provided by the supporters of this diet , and as you 'll see in the " Business Of The Sleeping Beauty Diet " section , this was taken from a fictional book . The diet was not created to be a real weight loss solution , it was actually mentioned in the book to show how dangerous it can be when one is looking to lose weight via any method . <p> Avoiding overeating by sleeping more is not an effective solution for weight loss . There are many unanswered questions about what is needed to use this diet , and no official source is available to showcase what is needed . <h> Business of TheSleeping Beauty Diet <p> There is no company or person who claims they came up with this diet . Information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though none take ownership . <p> The only known origin is that the diet came from a novel called Valley of the Dolls . The book talked about peoples need to rely on drugs in order to lose weight . This is likely why there is no science to back up the safety and effectiveness of this diet . The author did not make up this diet in order for it to be used for sustained and healthy weight loss . <p> This also explains the lack of an official guide explaining what needs to be considered in order for this diet to work . There are only a few sentences offered to help describe The Sleeping Beauty Diet . <h> Customer Opinions of The Sleeping Beauty Diet <p> There are no official customer reviews available about this diet as of this writing .

This is common to fad diets like this , which have no evidence to support their use . <p> Without being able to learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are common side effects or positive results . <p> One important consideration is the fact that the diet recommends taking prescription drugs , which when used for the purpose of this diet is not the prescribed approach . This can be potentially illegal and an abuse of the intention of sedatives . <h> Conclusion - Does The Sleeping Beauty DietWork ? <p> The Sleeping Beauty Diet has very little information to describe exactly what it requires , where it came from , and what should be considered before use . It requires sedating oneself with either pills or forced sleep to help prevent overeating . This form of starvation can not only slow metabolism , but health sites mention its potentially unhealthy and can actually promote weight gain . Any lost weight will not be fat but mostly water weight and muscle . Information about where the diet came from is also questionable , with the only sourcebeing a novel about people with eating disorders .

This diet was very popular with musical legend Elvis Presley . Basically for the Sleeping Beauty Diet , you are put under heavy sedation for several days in order to sleep off pounds . Since you are sedated , you do n't consume any calories during this time , so your body is forced to burn calories that has already stored up . There has been information that shows a link between lack of sleep and being overweight or obese . <p> However , turning a lack of sleep into total sleep is not the solution to losing weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damaging to the body . It is unclear where you would receive the sedatives from as most doctors would highly advise against this method of weight loss .

You simply sleep for several days in order to burn calories . While you are sleep , there is no eating involved . <p> EXERCISE <p> The Sleeping Beauty Diet involves no exercise . You sedate yourself in order to lose weight and are conducting no exercise while you 're sleep . <p> CONCLUSION <p> As far as fad diets are concerned , The Sleeping Beauty Diet*definitely fits the bill . Anytime a diet sounds outrageous or like something that would n't work , it 's a good idea to run in the opposite direction . Any diet that suggests you starve yourself by sleeping for several days is not going to be a healthy one .

There 's also no way to verify if what one will be buying into is wholesome and suited for their individual needs . <p> Here are the ingredients to one of the few found images found online of their chocolate flavored shake : <p> Milk Protein Concentrate <p> Cocoa Powder Processed with Alkali <p> Skim Milk <p> Whey Protein Isolate <p> Natural and Artificial Flavor <p> Sugar <p> Salt <p> Carrageenan <p> Sodium Caseinate <p> Sea Salt <p> Xanthan Gum <p> Sucralose <p> Acesulfame Potassium <p> Silicon Dioxide <p> Milk Protein Concentrate : Typically made from skim milk , this processed form of milk protein is spray dried and added as a cheaper alternative to other protein sources . <p> This ingredient is now largely imported from different countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of safety from imported milk protein concentrate : <p> " hard to imagine how regulatory agencies manage to keep track " <p> " MPCS are largely unregulated " <p> They also mention that similar kinds of protein were imported from China , and that they contained contaminated dairy which was added to baby formula . It contained high levels of melamine , which is known to cause liver damage and other side effects . This potentially harmful additive is said to be nonexistent according to some US groups , however , it did remain in some past shipments of Milk Protein Concentrate . <p> It is a cheap additive which will often be added to processed foods as a cost effective protein source . This is because it is preserved and imported from places where its cheaper to hire people to produce it . <p> In it is often a minimum of 40% protein to 90% protein by weight . 1 tablespoon of pure Milk Protein Concentrate typically has around 5 grams of protein per serving . It is a complete source of amino acids , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A study by the Dairy Management , Inc. in Illinois found : <p> Therefore it also has use as an additive for boosting the overall consistency of surrounding ingredients . This can double up as a substitute for gelling and emulsifying agents . Though Ideal Protein still has these kinds of additives in their foods . <p> Whey Protein Isolate : A byproduct of the cheese making process which contains a full range of amino acids . This ingredient has been shown to support lean muscle growth , and it is known to be easy to digest . In its isolated version it contains a minimum of 90% protein by weight , making it a protein rich source which is low in lactose and fat . <p> It also has the benefit of containing few calories per serving . <p> Skim Milk : Milk which has removed the cream to make a less fattening protein source . This typically has around 0.1% total fat . This will result in more watered down milk , which is often described as being less appetizing . <p> While this is often taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that its not truly helpful for weight loss . This is for two reasons . Fat is actually satiating and there is no evidence that a diet with moderate fats will increase body weight , and its flawed because it contains fewer nutrients . The Real Food Guide.com has noted : <p> " wont find any vitamin K in fat-free milk the vitamins it retains are all fat-soluble " <p> This means that in order to get the benefits of the added vitamins , one would have to add fat alongside their skim milk . This defeats the purpose of drinking a reduced fat beverage like skim . There 's no need to get rid of it as it causes more problems to get slightly more caloric rich milk . <p> The potential loss of nutrients also means one might have to supplement with additional vitamins and minerals to make up for the lacking nutrition gained from this milk source . <p> Cocoa Powder Processed with Alkali : A treated form of crushed cocoa bean which when alkalized reduces much of the antioxidants . <p> Due to the natural stimulants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include : <p> Rapid heart rate . <p> Insomnia . <p> Restlessness . <p> This ingredient can contain levels of caffeine , and due to the way its processed ; its not as nutrient rich as pure cocoa powder . This reduces trace minerals and vitamins , in order for it to be better preserved in the formula . <p> The added caffeine is unlikely to be major , but for those sensitive it may cause unwanted issues . No mention of the total caffeine content is provided by the makers of Ideal Protein from the foods which have included this ingredient . <p> Sugar : Simple carbohydrate with no nutritional value , its only added to provide a pleasant taste to foods , and its cheap to add and easy to produce . <p> It can be extracted from many different foods such as sugar beet and sugar cane . It is often highly processed and added to substitute more wholesome sweeteners which have a lower rating on the glycemic index . When insulin rises it can lead to a gain of body weight , and sugar is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly when it is included to a diet on a daily basis as many of these foods would require . <p> In its unrefined form it may produce several unwanted side effects that may include : <p> Increased risk of cardiovascular disease . <p> Increased risk for obesity via metabolism disorders . <p> Addiction that can lead to mood swings and flu like symptoms . <p> Tooth decay . <p> A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine adds : <p> " sugar is associated with ( being ) overweight , possibly because liquid sugars do not lead to a sense of satiety " <p> So its possible to eat lots of sugar and still not be satisfied , as the body is not satiated even with increased amounts of sugar . <p> This should be limited as much as possible when one is trying to achieve weight loss , as it can cause a major increase in body weight . If one were to follow an Ideal Protein Diet there would be intake of sugar as high as 4 grams of sugar per serving , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sugar is not needed in food as there are other known substitutes which can provide the same kind of flavor , without all the potential issues related to overall health and weight , <p> Carrageenan : A thickener and stabilizer found in many processed foods . This is made from edible seaweed and is often highly processed to be made usable . <p> Juntendo University performed a study by giving this ingredient to mice . The findings revealed toxic effects : <p> " carrageenan is carcinogenic to the colorectum of the rat " <p> This study showed an increase in tumors in once health rats . Another study was also performed on rats , this time by the Laboratoire de Securite des Aliments : <p> " promotes the growth of aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon " <p> This means it created abnormalities in the colon and rectum . This can potentially lead to cancer . Therefore , both studies confirmed cancerous side effects , even though they were not affiliated with another . <p> Carrageenan is not a necessary additive and it does not provide fiber or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost effective thickener . The only reason this additive is found in the formula is because its meant to be a cheap way to help promote a better balance of ingredients . <p> There are major issues seen in this additive and some consumer watchdog groups have advised to get rid of this ingredient from ones diet . There are multiple studies which revealed the potential for dangerous effects in animals . <p> Xanthan Gum : Thickener made from a mixture of a sugar and bacteria . It can be extracted from different ingredients like wheat , corn , and soy . This is cheap to produce and is often found in many kinds of foods . <p> Considered likely safe in the amounts typically found in food . It has an unmatched ability to help create viscosity with just a small amount of liquid added . This is often added at a concentration of just 0.5% or less . <p> The effect on reducing gut bacteria may cause damage to the immune system . Also , P-Glycoprotein is only released by the body when a potential toxin might cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats sucralose as a toxic ingredient . <p> Sucralose is added as an alternative to sugar which is supposed to be a much healthier alternative . The issue with this additive is that due to its processed nature , it can potentially lead to unwanted side effects . This can also have similar effects to standard table sugar , such as an effect on increasing insulin levels . Therefore , even though its added as a substitute for harmful sweeteners , it may have the same effect as well as additional unwanted side effects in the amounts added to food . <p> So it can be eaten in large amounts and not effect hunger levels , this can potentially increase the risk for obesity . This artificial sweetener has been used controversially , as many studies have shown it has the potential to cause side effects . <p> There are many ingredients in these foods which are cheap and often added to very generic types of prepackaged foods . Better options are available which do not use processed , artificial , and cheap additives . Its best to avoid eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickeners and binders . <p> Silicon Dioxide : Mineral that shares similarities to plastic . This is added to help treat weak bones , stroke , and often as an inactive ingredient to prevent caking . <p> Higher amounts of this ingredient can potentially lead to it passing the blood brain barrier , which may be unhealthy . Web MD has also added : <p> " LIKELY SAFE in food amounts . Its safety as a medicine is unknown " <p> So without being able to read about the total amount added , its not possible to determine what one might experience with this . Though its most likely that this is added more as filler instead of an actual nutritional additive . <h> Ideal Protein Quality Of Ingredients <p> Finding the ingredients to their foods was difficult , and after discovering what was added it became clear why . <p> There are artificial sweeteners , artificial flavors , potentially damaging thickeners , and many cheap forms of protein . The company has failed to add their own ingredients label online , and instead they ask those interested to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users who posted the supplements facts label to the shakes online , though labels for the foods are lacking . <p> Though there 's a lot of protein provided with the chocolate having 18 grams , its made up of milk protein concentrate and sodium caseinate . Both of these are poor in comparison to the unknown quantities of whey protein , which is also added to this shake . It would have been much better quality if they avoided these other 2 forms of cheap protein . <p> They also fail to mention what the amino acid content is . When choosing a protein rich shake its important to know if there 's a well-balanced amount of amino acids , since its what gives the body nourishment to function properly . Amino acids help determine : <p> Whether or not these shakes are rich in wholesome protein . <p> How effective it is as a meal replacement : Amino acids are needed when replacing meals as they are essential to regulate many important body processes . <p> Seeing if one would have to supplement with additional protein sources to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ingredients is very poor for the price paid . <p> They also fail to properly describe what makes their meal replacements stand out . Many of the ingredients are common to other standard shakes . There 's nothing unique in this shake that would make it stand out from the competition . After reading the nutrition facts label and looking at the overall vitamins and minerals , it appears to be a very standard meal replacement with nothing unique about it other than the heavy use of processed and artificial additives . <p> Other concerns exist from the kinds of foods provided in this plan . While they do offer many kinds of options to suit ones needs , they are very limited in the amount of full meals . Mostly snack and bite size foods are offered instead of any real substance . They also fail to list any of the nutrition facts label . This makes it impossible to do a proper review on what one can expect from these foods . <p> Recipes are offered for one to create ones own dishes from scratch , including around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipes for general weight management . They describe it as being : <p> These kinds of meals are needed as one transitions away from the foods offered by Ideal Protein . This is meant more as an easy to follow stepping stone so one can get used to eating reduced calories foods , which are already prepped and easy to go . The benefit of using already made foods is that it can take away from the temptation of eating rich foods . <p> This is why the company has decided to offer non-traditional diet foods such as bars , wafers , desserts , fruit drinks , and much more . <p> EDITORS TIP : Combine this supplement with a proven meal replacement such as 18Shake for better results . <h> The Price and Quality of Ideal Protein <p> You 're not allowed the opportunity to buy the prepackaged foods on their own , so you have to pay for overall weight loss support from one of their diet centers . This includes paying for pre-packaged meals which is of unknown price . The total Ideal Protein cost can be extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm the exact pricing . <p> There are also different diet phases which range in cost . Heres what some customers have experienced in terms of price : <p> " $85.00 per week ; or $500 for Phase 1 " <p> " $60.00 per week ; or $120 for Phase 2 " <p> " $30.00 per week ; or $60 for Phase 3 " <p> " Around $700 for 10 weeks ; or average $70 per week " <p> So the price for this can vary depending on what ones individual demands are . Its fairly expensive for what you 're getting . Its also unknown whether or not you have to buy into the whole diet plan , of if you can simply purchase the meal replacement shakes and other foods separately . <p> Its incredibly difficult to review these foods for many key reasons : <p> No nutrition facts list is provided by the makers : There are only user posted images of what 's added , but its unknown if this is up to date and reflective of what one can expect . Its not known why the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not all foods have images to showcase what 's added , in fact the majority is completely missing . You 're unable to verify beforehand if what the company is offering would be suitable for your needs . They do offer gluten-free foods , but its unclear if they also provide other allergy free options . <p> They also fail to list any relevant information about the use of processed ingredients which are found in some foods like the shakes . <p> There is a lack of real claims about their foods : Instead of giving insights into the nutritional value , weight loss effects , or what one can expect in terms of nutrition , the company has decided to instead only talk about the foods consistency and taste . <p> Getting a face to face interaction with the company centers is required : Because they are selling a comprehensive weight loss plan , these foods are a small apart of a greater solution for weight loss . The company places little emphasis on this due to the fact they are asking potential customers to actually talk to a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it harder for one to learn from the comfort of ones home . Its also unknown what kind of technique is used , but it can be potentially difficult to escape from . <p> From looking at the images its clear that the meal replacements offered are not very good quality since they 're full of artificial ingredients and cheap protein . There 's not enough here to satisfy as a proper meal replacement . Many of the ingredients have been shown in clinical studies to lead to metabolism disorders and weight gain . <p> The company also asks users to use Ideal Protein in 4 different phases . Ideal Protein phase 1 is to determine what practical weight loss goals are . While this is more comprehensive , this also raises the price . Ideal Protein phase 2 is similar to phase 1 , but provides more in depth coaching and counseling . This can be helpful to those who need a more hands on approach , but its unknown if the people offering advice are qualified to give out nutritional support . <p> There are cheap processed ingredients that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ideal Protein cost unnecessarily , as these additives can be bought cheaper elsewhere . There is no need to have to purchase this since the same basic formula is featured in many other shakes and foods . <p> As far as other Ideal Protein Products go , the overall price can be high to receive the entire system as a whole . The main issue with the price is that there 's no clear outline of what one can expect . Youre meant to visit a center to learn more which can be a waste of time if you were to find it far too much to pay . Companies that fail to list how much they charge are questionable as one is not able to determine beforehand if what they 're getting will be suitable for their needs . <p> The majority of those who invested in Ideal Protein products added how it was far too pricy for what is being offered . Judging from the few ingredients labels , its clear that they have focused on adding a heavy amount of cheap ingredients which are often found in processed foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though information about their customer service support is nonexistent . This is often because groups in Canada go through a different quality assurance system . They are not bound by any entity like the FDA . <p> No information is available about whether or not they offer a money back return policy . <p> Bloomberg.com did mention a few details about the company by stating : <p> " company offers education , development workshops , and private and public lectures on weight loss and nutrition " <p> There is no information on whether they operate these kinds of services outside of Canada . The only available information listed is about their CEO changes , though they do offer contact details . <p> My Ideal Protein is also offered which helps connect users with more information on the overall diet plan offered . Though to access this part of the website one first has to be a member . Its not exactly clear how detailed the information is , and whether or not its advised for users to follow potentially difficult advice . My Ideal Protein is more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online whether on a computer or mobile device . <p> Very little information is provided by the official website and its unknown if the advice given is supported by scientific fact , or if its general advice for weight loss . <p> The company website does give insights into their process about weight loss by stating : <p> The company assists those who implement the plan with insights into how to properly manage weight after one has cut calories drastically . The idea is to make smarter dietary decisions and getting rid of unhealthy foods . They also add they can teach : <p> What foods are best for maintaining weight . <p> How insulin affects body weight . <p> How body fat can be burned . <p> What the proper combination is of macronutrient s such as fats , proteins , and carbohydrate . <p> While this is all helpful advice , its noteworthy to consider what the total overall price is if one decides to keep getting support from the business . This can amount to a lot of money , and if one were to gain weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly . <p> There is also no assurance that all the information you 're getting will be provided by some sort of professional . Typically nutritionists can be pricy , and its unknown if the information provided will be mostly support and general advice for weight loss . This needs to be addressed so one knows whether or not they are receiving scientifically backed advice , or if its only basic support anyone can give . <p> EDITORS TIP : For the best results with meal replacement shakes diet our experts recommend to use it at least 5 months . Save your money buying a few bags of meal replacement product . <h> Customer Opinions of Ideal Protein <p> Ideal Protein reviews are scattered online from many different sources . Heres what a few customers have experienced : <p> " its not real food " <p> " They all lost weight and then they gained it back , plus more " <p> " way too hard for me " <p> " I had very little energy " <p> People who tried the meal replacement often complained that it left them without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low carbohydrate and lack of appetite suppression . <p> There were also negative reviews from those who tried Ideal Protein recipes . Some added how they tried to mix this shake with fruits and vegetables , but that the consistency was not pleasant . <p> Overall , it seems from user reviews that by trying to make this shake work as a full meal plan that it was not satisfying and that it did not help support their weight loss goals . This makes it seem unlikely to work as a functional weight loss shake . <p> " on the program and my hair is unhealthy and thin . Makes me feel drained " <p> " started a fourth week and paid $630 only lost a single pound did n't  lose any inches off my waist " <p> " Ca n't get off of this diet because I just regain all the weight . Very disappointing as its costing a lot of money " <p> There have been serious issues from users who added how they did n't  feel like the entire system was effective , and many added it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it did not lead to sustained weight loss results . So anyone who managed to lose weight added how they did n't  experience any long lasting benefits . Any benefits that people noticed were lost as soon as normal eating began . <p> The issue with this is that its possible one is only losing weight because of a serious caloric deprivation . This means its not truly a metabolism boosting or fat burning way to lose weight . Also , there are some who only lost a few pounds yet they made sure to stay disciplined . This can lead to a waste of time and money . If one has to dedicate themselves to a diet which is not delivering on its results in a grand way , they its likely one will continue to experience the same results . <h> Conclusion - Does Ideal Protein Work ? <p> Ideal Protein has an interesting website that claims to offer the ideal weight loss solution . Though before you decide on whether or not this is right for you , its important to look at the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall foods offered . Their shakes are loaded with artificial sugars , mostly cheap protein sources , and they make it hard to know anything about what these shakes have to offer . The same goes for the foods which only have descriptions as to their taste instead of their nutritional content . <p> Ideal Protein food is often described as being unfulfilling , chalky , and not easy to mix by users . Many also added how they did n't  find the advice supportive , and that it was all general weight loss tips . This was far too general and not specific enough to promote long lasting weight loss results . Some added how it did not actually promote significant weight loss , and that it takes a lot of sacrifice for such little reward . <p> Customers have left testimonials showing how effective their weight loss effects were . Best of all , it combines a potent metabolism booster and a wholesome meal replacement shake . This shake has high quality whey protein , good fiber for appetite suppression , and you can read the full amino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The metabolism booster Vitakor contains a blend of potent extracts such as fennel seed , flax seed oil , cape aloe , and other potent compounds . Before and after photos are also provided by users who used Vitakor individually , when combined with 18Shake it can boost overall weight loss results . <p> 18Shake Diet also contains a full range of amino acids and just 1 gram of sugar from the shake . Vitakor is free of any artificial additives or stimulants . Unlike Ideal Protein it contains unprocessed ingredients and a blend of proven ingredients . 18Shake Diet offers a comprehensive meal replacement shake that provides healthy ingredients , a customer approved taste , and no cheap additives alongside a potent metabolism booster which can help burn calories .

After reading more reviews I found a different meal replacement shake called 18shake and decided to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lbs , and I hope to be down 25 lbs by the end of the year ! All I do is drink it twice a day and do some light exercise twice a week , and it works great . <p> Ideal Protein " Buyer Beware " Deadly Health Risk " Testimonial I joined up after hearing about those positive results . I completed an Ideal Protein 9 Page Patient Profile prior to my initial appointments which include my health history and all medications I was taking . At my appointment at a Chiropractic Office ( Doctor ) I met with a part time IP Coach , who had me review a video , performed a weight &amp; BMI &amp; water bio-impedance measurement(s) , gave me some hand-outs , and selected boxed food and drinks to take for the upcoming week . I paid my consultation and food fees and then my meeting was complete . All was OK except I was told I had a -3 water deficit , and advised by the IP coach to drink more water . Next week I weighed in , and lost 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the part time IP coach . Soon afterwards that day I was having severe abnormal neurologic and physical and mental changes and feeling I was going to collapse . My blood pressure went to 170/100 and pulse dropped to 55 or less . I contacted the Chiropractic Office for advice and there was no one available to answer my help call . I immediately drove to the local Emergency Unit and was treated for Acute Hyponatremia ( water intoxication ) . I was drinking a lot of water because the IP coach told me I was dehydrated . I spent two days in the local hospital and advised about the foolish decision I made doing this Ketosis type diet with my significant health history . I have only one kidney , take water pills ( diuretic ) , controlled high blood pressure and antiarrhythmic meds , and stage II obesity . I could do just as good if I purchased their food from a Walgreens or CVS ? While in hospital my spouse contacted the Chiropractic office to get a refund on the food I had just purchased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but was informed that I was to have reviewed the program with my medical physician ( MD ) ; that you only go to their office to pick out your food . Additionally I was informed later that the Ideal Protein Owners provide a Script of what to say or respond to certain questions they are asked of their customers ( not patients of course ) . My complaint is that I thought I was going to a Chiropractic Medical Office to go on a medically supervised weight loss program . I assumed that I was having a Medical Professional , a Chiropractic Doctor ( with a fundamental knowledge of basic electrolyte and nutritional background ) ; provide consultation , clinical assessment , and medical screening , on my entrance to the Ideal Protein Weight loss Program . This did not occur . If true , a flag should have gone up with medical profile of one kidney , on a diuretic pill with hypertensive drugs , etc . I should have been instructed to wait one week either until the water deficit is gone , given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied access to the program , all due to health reasons . This Ideal Protein program might be Ok if you 're young and healthy , but should be declined if you have health issues . You ca n't rely on the distributors that sell the program , because they have scripts to deflect any responsibility and accountability . Some people with similar experiences , as I have , contacted me to join them in legal action against all parties engaged in Ideal Protein medically unsupervised program , with scripted and un-accountable responses , where they occur . <p> posted May 12th , 2016 11:03 pm <p> Mary <p> - <p> Let me be specific . I do n't like the diet . If you do n't mind constipation , severe headaches and expensive , highly processed foods , then this diet is for you . <p> posted May 6th , 2016 4:52 pm <p> Lynne H <p> - <p> Have been on the diet 24 weeks ; lost 7 lbs . The program DOES work but only if you are extremely dedicated to follow the plan exactly . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat out . Since I have not lost the mandatory average of 0.5 lbs per week , my " weight loss coach " advised me that I would need to re-evaluate my goal weight , be ok with the lbs lost , and phase out of the program because I was obviously not invested , was obviously cheating , and IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO NOT LOOSE WEIGHT ON THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEIR BUSINESS OR IMAGE ! Oh yes , do n't forget , this IS A BUSINESS as a previous writer mentioned . The " coaches " are not weight loss specialists or medical professionals . It is all about money ! I wanted to like this program , I really did ! I saw my coworkers melt away . But after weigh in last night .... DONE ! She actually told me " this is not WW " . NO , it 's not , WW has very caring , empathetic coaches ! My coworker inquired of her clinic if I could possibly switch over without a fee and that clinic agreed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was invited to a weight loss clinic during my 3rd week to talk about being on Phase 1 , I met an ANOREXIC individual . Of course I asked lots of questions about her weight loss and which Phase she was in . She was somewhat avoidant but finally disclosed she was an anorexic and was on the program to eat to maintain her weight . WTF ? That was my first red flag I chose to ignore . An anorexic person has absolutely no business speaking at a weight loss clinic . The coach totally misrepresented her , making us think this person had lost a ton of weight on Ideal Protein .

This program focuses primarily on fat loss and naturally suppresses your appetite . Ideal Protein manufactures and distributes products to health professionals and you must sign up with a center to enroll in the program . The program was medically designed and developed over 25 years ago by Dr. Tran Tien Chanh in France . There are four different phases which help stabilize the pancreas and blood sugar levels . While on this program you will teach your body to live off its own fat reserves . You will also learn that simple carbohydrates can prevent weight loss . Ideal protein is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricting sugars both simple and complex until your weight loss goal is reached . This program takes on the belief that the body can not burn fat as long as sugar is being consumed . While on the Ideal Protein Weight Loss Method , you will eat foods high in protein which will help your body burn fat reserves instead of muscle . Education is a top priority of the Ideal Protein Weight Loss Method . You will learn why you gain weight and how to lose it properly . <p> Eliminating sugar and carbs may be difficult for some to maintain for long periods <p> Must enter name , email address and phone number to search for a center <p> Cost information is not readily available <p> There may not be a center in your area <p> Program involves you eating prepackaged food which may leave you hungry <p> Diet can involve some unpleasant side effects while the body adjusts <p> You may suffer health problems if the supplements are not taken <p> Exercise not recommended <p> Calorie count is between 1,000-1,100 calories per day 10974 @qwx870974 <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some required supplements and eating prepackaged meals that the company manufactures . There is no sugar allowed as long as you are on the program . This program can be very strict to stick to , especially for those that may be used to eating carbohydrates or sugar . You must follow the plan precisely so no cheating is allowed . There are a lot of foods that are not allowed , and it is easy to see how you can drop fairly large amounts of weight each week . The eating plan is designed to help your body burn stored fat and allow your organs to function properly . Below is a list of the foods that are not allowed in phases one and two : <p> Pasta , rice , potatoes , legumes , breads or carbohydrates <p> Rooted vegetables of any kind including beets and carrots <p> Sweet peas or corn <p> Fruit or fruit juice <p> Cheese or other dairy <p> Nuts <p> Soda ( diet or regular ) <p> Alcohol <p> EXERCISE <p> Exercise is actually not recommended during the first three weeks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because your calorie intake will only be about 900 per day . The first three weeks of the program you will be teaching your body to dip into its fat stores for energy . If you exercise , you may burn too many calories and your body will start to burn off muscle as well . If you feel that you have to exercise during the first three weeks , it is recommended that you do it lightly rather than at full intensity . <p> CONCLUSION <p> The Ideal Protein Weight Loss Method is basically a low-calorie , low-carb diet . This program places you on a restrictive calorie count each day , and it also requires that you eat packaged meals . With no wiggle room and such strict rules , many dieters will not be able to stick to the program . For those that can , the low calorie portion of the diet alone is bound to cause weight loss . Many people have claimed that the Ideal Protein program has worked for them . If you have the discipline and can afford the program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10978 @qwx870978

@@98099817 @2299817/ <p> Do you think you could feed your family a healthy meal with only $15 ? It all depends on where you live , and what you 're willing to buy . <p> To get the ingredients to make a simple meal at home , you would spend an average of $15 . That 's compared to an average of $6.50 for a single meal from a fast food restaurant like McDonalds . When looking at base cost , fast food certainly seems like the cheaper option , and that 's appealing to a family crunched for cash . <p> However , the ingredients you could get for $15 would make a meal for four people we priced chicken breasts , potatoes , apples , and milk and the meal would be better for you than a cheeseburger and fries from the nearest drive-through . <p> Unfortunately , not everyone has access to fresh ingredients , nor can everyone afford them . In some states , the cost of a meals worth of groceries is far more than $15 . In Virginia , for example , you would need nearly $30 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $10 in Idaho . How is it possible that a family can have more or less affordable food depending on where they live ? <p> Food inequality is a growing problem in the United States , as shown in a recent study released by the Harvard School of Public Health . Though diet quality has improved among people of higher socioeconomic status , the same can not be said for those on the other side of the spectrum . <p> Researchers on the study addressed this gap and the other findings in a statement . <p> " Our study suggests that the overall dietary quality of the U.S. population steadily improved from 1999 through 2010 . This improvement reflected favorable changes in both consumers food choices and food processing , - especially the reduction of trans fat intake , that were likely motivated by both public policy and nutrition education , " they said . <p> " However , overall dietary quality remains poor , indicating room for improvement and presenting challenges for both public health researchers and policy makers . Furthermore , substantial differences in dietary quality were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gap between those with the highest and lowest levels increased over time . " <p> Many suggest the food inequality problem is caused by the seemingly high price of health food . While its true that buying food at the " trendy " health-based grocery stores may be expensive , they are n't  the only places selling the components of healthy meals . Even if you buy the ingredients from your local Wal-Mart or Aldi , its still going to be ultimately cheaper than buying fast food , and a lot better for you . <p> The problem then may not be the cost of groceries themselves , but rather the accessibility . Food deserts are a growing problem in the U.S. , as more people turn to unhealthy food alternatives simply because of easy access . <p> Many low-income areas are barren of places to buy fresh ingredients . Neighborhoods that lack grocery stores have convenience stores aplenty . When people do find a store selling fresh , healthy food , the price is usually higher . This can lead to the price disparity of groceries across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cost you at least a dollar more no matter what state you go to in any direction . While that may not seem like a huge difference , it can spell the difference between a healthy meal and a quick fix for many families . <p> Though fast food may be more expensive in the long run , it does n't  seem like it in the moment . Also , when unhealthy options are the only affordable , accessible options , healthy foods can seem like an unnecessary expense . <p> It is not more costly to stroll through the grocery store for food instead of rolling through the drive-through window . The real problem lies in making fresh , healthy food available to everyone , no matter where they are . For many , the answer to the original question of could you feed your family a meal for $15 is a resounding , and unfortunate , no. 10976 @qwx870976 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

It breaks the overnight fast you experience while you sleep , where you body slows down everything , including your metabolism , to rest and repair itself . The food you eat first thing in the morning signals to all your body systems that you 're awake , you 're fueled , and its time to get the day started . Without it , your systems never fully turn back on and run on all cylinders . <p> While a doughnut is n't the ideal fuel for your body , it will provide you energy in the form of quick burning sugars , holding you over until you can get something with some nutrients in it , and itll - jump-start your metabolism the same as nutritious one , helping your body to burn off those extra doughnut calories , as well . If you do n't  eat anything , you will feel tired and low energy , be unable to concentrate on your meeting , and will walk around with a half functioning metabolism until you do finally have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its breakfast and the first thing you 've eaten , you have the ability to account for that doughnut by making healthy food choices the rest of the day and working it off , lessening its overall impact , something you cant do if you eat a doughnut or other high fat , high sugar , low nutrient food late at night . <p> So , go ahead and eat the doughnut , but ! This is only true , of course , if you do n't  regularly eat doughnuts and typically have a healthy breakfast . The excess calories in one doughnut will not make you fat , but the excess calories from a doughnut every day just might . Not only that , but processed carbohydrates like doughnuts and bagels burn off quickly , leaving you craving more unhealthy processed carbs to bring your energy levels back up , unlike whole grains and other complex carbohydrates that digest slowly and keep your energy levels stable for hours . If doughnuts or other unhealthy breakfasts are your norm , skipping it will do you a better service by not introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place , rather than relying on your metabolism to ( hopefully ) make up the difference . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

Possible side effects are many and they may include : <p> Reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as Vitamin A , D , E and K. <p> Severe pain in the lower back . <p> Bllod in the urine and difficulty urinating . <p> Liver problems that can proote loss of appetite , dark urine , yellowing od the skin and eyes , and nausea . <p> If this is prescribed , there is more of an increased risk for side effects , and special considerations need to be made .

Nutritional deficiencies are serious issues which have been shown to be a leading cause for certain diseases and illnesses . <p> Another issue is the way this brand blocks fat .

One also has to consider how much caloriues they get from fat , as its advised to only get 30% of ones calories from this one macronutrient .

I am happy with this . My weight loss does seem to of slowed recently but I have been experiencing a few other health problems so even the little bit of walking and wii fit exercise i was doing has not been able to happen . I have never really had any major problems with Orlistat . Yes I some times have the oily stools and orange discharge and yes I do have a tendancy to " fart " on a more regular basis now .

I have not heard anything negative about the medication , except for the side effects of oily stools , etc . I believe the people who have experienced the bad side effects are people who are continuing to eat fatty foods ( such as pizza , cheeseburgers , etc. ) and continue to take the Orlistat .

Orlistat is probably more recognizable under its marketed names of Xenical or the over-the-counter drug , Alli . Orlistats primary objective is to prevent the absorption of fat that is consumed and thereby reduce caloric intake and ultimately body weight . <p> Orlistat works by inhibiting the pancreatic enzyme , lipase , which is responsible for metabolizing triglycerides in the intestine . Triglycerides are a fancy name for a kind of fat that is found in vegetable oils and animal fats . Without the enzyme lipase , triglycerides are not absorbed and are instead excreted from the body . The prescription form of Orlistat is given to overweight people that also have accompanying conditions of high blood pressure , Type 2 diabetes , high cholesterol or heart diease . Orlistat is also used after weight loss to help people prevent gaining back the weight lost . <p> There are uncomfortable gastrointestinal side effects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss effects are modest . Those taking Xenical , the prescription form of Orlistat , lost on average about six pounds more than those who just relied on diet and exercise alone during a one-year time frame . Taking the over-the-counter drug Alli results in an average of three pounds greater loss than just relying on diet and exercise alone within a one-year time frame . <p> Must continue to take weight loss medication in order to keep weight off <p> INGREDIENTS <p> Orlistat contains a saturated form of lipstatin , a powerful natural inhibitor of lipase , the pancreatic enzyem that absorbs fat . <p> ADMINISTRATION <p> Orlistat is taken in a capsule form three times a day with a meal that contains fat . If the meal does not contain fat , then you should not take Orlistat . <p> At the standard prescription dose of 120mg , three times daily before meals , Orlistat prevents approximately 30% of dietary fat from being absorbed . Over-the-counter dosages , like the product Alli , contain 60mg of Orlistat . This amount prevents about 25% of dietary fat from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight loss . <p> DIET AND EXERCISE <p> Orlistat is always used in combination with a physician-monitored reduced-calorie and low-fat diet as well as regular exercise program . <p> You should also not consume foods that contain more than 30% of their calories from fat . This will increase the chances of experiencing gastrointestinal side effects . While taking Orlistat , each meal that you eat should contain 15 grams of fat or less . It is recommended to eat 2-3 ounces of lean protein with each meal as well as filling your plate with good carbohydrates like vegetables and whole grains . Low-fat or fat-free versions of dairy and salad dressings should be eaten as well as asking for foods to be prepared without fat when dining out . <p> Since Orlistat also inhibits the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins , A , D , E and K , a multivitamin that also contains beta-carotene must be taken on a daily basis , preferably at bedtime or two hours after taking Orlistat , to ensure that your body is readily absorbing these necessary nutrients . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Orlistat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though it may help those who are overweight or obese to lose weight , it does carry some serious side effects .

Sadly , I find the same ingredients in my One a Day men 's vitamin that was only $6.99 at Wal-Mart . There is no scientific evidence to prove that it helps you lose weight . All I see are claims that it " increases your mood so you 're ' able ' to fight abdominal fat ... " I think it 's BS and really wish I had n't purchased this product because it 's going to end up in the trash . Any supplement that has a star after every " claim " on the front of the bottle because it 's not telling you the whole truth is n't worth the money . As for the acne and baldness ... I 'd rather starve myself for free than pay $20-$40 a month to be bald and broken out . Most of the guys I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Relacore .

In the last 5 years I have not had a major depressive episode and have had no side affects . <p> I live in Canada and have been purchasing Relacore at Walmart and Shoppers DrugMart .

It claims to be a nutritionally well-rounded and high protein way to recover from a workout , or to simply use as an extra protein source . <p> They offer a low carbohydrate to no carbohydrate powder , all natural blend , ready to drink unique flavors , and unflavored versions . The powdered versions are available in 1 , 3 , and 7.5 pound servings , while the drinks are offered in singles and 12 packs . By reviewing many meal replacements our experts found that the most effective solution for weight loss was 18Shake . Its composed of a duo protein whey formula and a potent appetite suppressing fiber . Many customers say its an effective and great tasting weight loss solution . More information on 18Shake can be seen when you click this link . <p> Whey Protein Isolate : A virtually pure protein source extracted from whey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy to absorb and amino acid rich protein source . <p> Its widely considered one of the best forms of protein available . <p> Taurine:Organic acid that is found in many animal tissues . Its required for the cardiovascular system to function properly . Studies into its supplement form are limited , and its unknown what kind of an effect it may have on the body when supplemented . <p> Artificial Flavor:Often added to processed foods , these manmade chemicals are added to help substitute real ingredients . They are often more stable and preserve a certain flavor for longer . Some extracts used can come from tar , oil , and potentially dangerous additives . <p> Sucralose:Noncaloric artificial sweetener which the body can not break down . It can be upwards of 1,000 times sweeter than standard sugar . <p> Studies have shown the potential for side effects including reduced healthy gut bacteria , and a possible negative impact on blood sugar . A study by the Washington University School of Medicine found that it : <p> " sucralose affects the glycemic and insulin responses " <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that it : <p> The body will release P-gp during moments when a toxin enters the body .

The FDA issued a partial ban due to it having a high risk forcancer on lab mice . <p> Certain European countries have also banned it due to health concerns . <p> Health organizations have also attempted to ban this ingredient since it has no positive health effects , and can be substituted with more whole additives . <p> Ion Exchange Whey Protein Isolate : This form of whey is processed in a way that concentrates more protein .

Its also often the case that components meant to help absorb vitamins and minerals better will be lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Isopure Protein , as the full amino acid list is not offered . Also , the ingredients are n't  featured on the official website , only 3rd party sites . <p> EDITORS TIP : Combine this supplement with a proven meal replacement such as 18Shake for better results . <h> Isopure Protein Quality of Ingredients <p> There are 2 types of main offerings from the company . A stripped down protein powder made without many vitamins and minerals , and a more balanced nutrient blend with many artificial ingredients . <p> The low carbohydrate to no carbohydrate blends has artificial ingredients like sucralose , food coloring , and artificial flavors . These cheap additives have shown the possibility for side effects . They 're also substitutes for more wholesome ingredients ; they have no benefit to other ingredients which can replace them . Theyre only added because they are cheaper in price . <p> The purer protein blend made only with whey protein and soy lecithin is lacking in many important vitamins and minerals . This means its not intended to be a full meal replacement , its only made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minerals added are : <p> Calcium : 4% <p> Iron : 4% <p> Phosphorus : 2% <p> Magnesium : 2% <p> Chloride : 20% <p> There are no vitamins A , C , E , K , B6 B12 , or the minerals Thiamin , Riboflavin , Zinc , Chromium , and other necessary nutrients . This makes it a nutritionally poor protein powder . The issue with supplementing with extra protein without necessarynutrients is that protein is a powerful appetite suppressant . This can make it harder to eat the necessary foods to account for the essential nutrients . <p> Web MD also recommends a meal replacement to be : <p> " Fortified with a third of daily vitamins and minerals " <p> Isopure Protein has 0% of many of these nutrients . This will require one to seek these nutrients elsewhere either through eating more foods , or by adding multivitamins . In either case it raises the overall price , and it means this protein blend is lacking . <h> The Price and Quality of Isopure Protein <p> Direct sales are offered with the natural flavor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub . One pound sells for $18.57 . <p> At the advised one serving a day , a 1 pound pouch has 16 servings . This amounts to a daily price of $1.60 . <p> This is fairly expensive when you consider that one has to either select a nutritionally weak formula , which requires extra supplementation with vitamins and minerals , or a blend consisting of many artificial and potentially harmful additives . There 's also no money back return policy , so all sales are final . Isopure Protein does offer many flavors and styles , but all of them are flawed .

It suggests that weight loss is often the result of environment , emotional , and physical issues which affect the bodys ability to burn and store fat . <p> It mentions its approach is a holistic way to help prevent " fat programs " and to provide life changing results forever . Its not like a typical diet in which the main focus is calorie counting ; most of what you learn is new strategies for preventing the body from holding unto fat due to stressors . There are a lot of different techniques offered by this method which will be covered in this review . Our experts have rated and ranked many weight loss diets , and the overall best one was the 18Shake Diet . It combines an appetite suppressing meal replacement to prevent hunger for hours , and a fat burning stimulant free diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated the best diet plan click the link here . <h> The Gabriel MethodIngredients and Side Effects <p> This plan makes use of they refer to as the FAT program which stands for famine and temperature . The claim is that our ancestors had to promote fat storage during times in the winter where food access was limited . Now with our new formed bodies this can lead to hunger , less calorie burning , and increase storage of fat . So the suggestion is that our new environment make it likely one will gain weight , and that not having self-control and discipline is not the reason for weight loss . <p> It also adds how dieting can actually make weight loss harder and in turn it can promote obesity . <p> Chemical signals are activate in the body which lead to this FAT program . So its advised to get the following : <p> It also emphasized not mixing certain foods together such as acidic and alkaline . This means you ca n't mix starches and milks with meat . The idea of this is to give your body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods . The claim is that by eating foods which are n't  wholesome or properly mixed you are n't  allowing your DNA to repair itself and create healthy cells . This then can lead to i 'll health and weight gain . <p> A fundamental skill required is to visualize the body you want every day.This is known as manifesting and its believed that by doing this trick your mind can help you reach your goals . Its also advised to understand why one might be overeating . This can come from a place of needing love or security , and instead of getting it through people , you find it via food . <p> Other aspects of this plan include : <p> Making sure to drink enough water . <p> Chewing food thoroughly . <p> Exercising like our ancestors did . <p> Eating earlier in the day instead of late night . <p> Being in nature and getting enough sunlight . , or making sure to get some vitamin D supplement . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> The Gabriel Method Quality of Ingredients <p> Whole foods are greatly emphasized and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin D. While these suggestions are healthy , its not anything new you would n't already be recommended by a health professional . <p> There are also suggestions on mental attitude which are commonly known , such as having a positive outlook which can help reduce stress further triggering weight gain . <p> The issue is that the book emphasizes thinking about the kind of body you want which is supposed to make it appear . Also , its suggested not to mix particular foods as acidic and alkaline is not good for the body . This is not grounded in any science , and there 's no proof to suggest it would be effective . There is very little explanation about this plan other than the reviews from other customers as well . To see a top 10 list of the highest rated diet plans click the link here . <h> The Price and Quality of The Gabriel Method <p> There is optional support and meetings offered , but most of the cost is dedicated to a few supplements and eating nutritious whole foods . While this is good advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence about how the strategies outlined will promote weight loss . Without any form of calorie counting its unlikely one can rely on real weight loss . <p> The overall quality is in question due to a lack of credibility and proof . The issue with visualization and alkaline versus acidic environments is that this is considered pseudo-science and can not be treated as truth . This calls the entire plan into question , as these methods are seen as false . Its impossible to take a method like this seriously when it fails to provide proof for bold claims . <h> Business of The Gabriel Method <p> The official website offers additional resources such as meditation retreats ; visualization meet ups and paid coaching . The creator of the plan is John Gabriel who lost 226 pounds through the use of The Gabriel Method . He is a biochemist which means he studies the chemical processes and changes in a living thing . <p> There are also testimonials offered from those who claim they have lost weight , but a disclaimer mentions : <p> " Youll find hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this website I take their stories in good faith since Im unable t personally verify the validity of their individual results " <p> Therefore , its possible that some of these testimonials are actually paid off and not legitimate . <p> While there are useful techniques for weight loss , most of the advice is general or either completely unproven . <h> Customer Opinions of The Gabriel Method <p> " If any pf that worked we would all be in perfect health and millionaires by now " <p> " Disappointed in the amount of information . Did n't  feel there was much substance " <p> " I did n't  care for it . Its a pitch to sell his products " <p> Many complained that they failed to learn anything new from this book , and that there was a lot of useless knowledge . The major complaints were that there is n't any real applicable information about how to lose weight exactly . Some also said that the diet tries to push the companys products . <p> Some didappreciate the visualization techniques , but they felt this was not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were those who felt that thinking about a chosen body is not enough to promote any real weight loss . <p> Those who understood some science felt that there are many claims made which are untruthful . <h> Conclusion - Does The Gabriel MethodWork ? <p> The Gabriel Method is not described as a diet ; instead its an approach to using the correctmind state and approach to selecting foods . There is no needed calorie counting and no particular foods one needs to eat , though there are suggestions for the scale of allowed foods . As long as its whole foods and unprocessed , as well as not mixing acidic with alkaline foods you can eat it . This limits the kinds of food combinations you can have . There have been customers who felt that while the advice offered can be helpful , there is still a lack of overall support to help with real weight loss . Some also found the idea of thinking about the kind of body you want to be unrealistic and based off of fake science . 10970 @qwx870970 <p> ( Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> + <p> FINALLY !

For Jon Gabriel , author of The Gabriel Method , his call was 9/11 . On the day of 9/11 , Gabriel topped the scale at 400 pounds . He was scheduled to be on United Airlines flight 93 that was hijacked by terrorists , but fate stepped in and Gabriel , at the last minute , had to change his plans . And then he changed his life . <p> The Gabriel Method came out of this life-changing situation , which inspired Jon to take control over his health and life and lose 220 pounds . <p> The Gabriel Method is a diet-less program that taps into your body 's own logic to determine how fat or thin you will be at any given time . The way to lose weight is not to struggle or to force yourself to lose weight , but to understand this internal logic and work with it so that your body wants to be thinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background in biochemistry into this 252-page book , which also comes with a guided imagery CD . It has been highlighted on the television show Entertainment Tonight and it is endorsed by the American Holistic Medicine Association . <p> Encourages you to overcome the emotional and mental barriers that get in the way of your health <p> Recognizes the differences in bodies and how our environments play a role in our health <p> Contains a program for long-term weight loss success <p> CON <p> Does not lay out a specific or detailed diet plan <p> Holistic approach to weight loss may not appeal to some <p> Weight loss is gradual 10974 @qwx870974 <p> The Gabriel Method is not a diet that will force you to count calories , measure how much protein you are eating or prohibit you from eating carbs . Rather , Gabriel makes the case that what pushes your body into a state of weight gain is eating food that is devoid of essential nutrients , not sleeping enough , allowing stress to overcome you and being overwhelmed by environmental toxins . All of this creates famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather weight loss . In an effort to protect itself , the body clings on to fat and forces you to crave and eat the foods that are void of nutritional value . <p> Therefore , in order to calibrate your body 's metabolism and weight to its ideal set point , The Gabriel Method promotes a style of eating that balances leptin and insulin , two key hormones in weight loss . Eating foods that are whole , minimally processed and fresh are the mainstay of the Gabriel Method . In addition , as you go about your day , you are supposed to continually remind yourself to think of yourself as thin and visualize yourself in your ideal body . <p> EXERCISE <p> Exercise is gently promoted in the Gabriel Method . You are encouraged to be active and to engage in activities that you enjoy doing . <p> CONCLUSION <p> The Gabriel Method is a holistic approach to weight loss that was created by a man who once topped the scales at 400 pounds . Jon Gabriel uses his background in biochemistry and his own experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to in essence treat yourself with more respect from the foods you eat to the thoughts you entertain to how much sleep you receive each night . <p> The Gabriel Method may not melt off the pounds over night but it will encourage you to gradually and effectively change how you eat and how you live your life . 10978 @qwx870978

This fast would mean having only one meal on that day , and that meal would be meatless. 10975 @qwx870975 <h> DIET and NUTRITION <p> The Lenten Diet is completely spiritual in nature . This is not a diet you do to lose weight . The Lenten Diet takes place for 40 days out of the year typically starting with Ash Wednesday and ending either the Thursday or Saturday before the Easter holiday . Those that participate in the Lenten Diet are forbidden from having meat on Fridays during Lent . Ash Wednesday is for fasting . On that day , one meatless meal is allowed . Not all meat is banned on Fridays with this diet . Anything that is a warm blooded animal is what has to be avoided . Below are the types of foods you can have on Fridays : <p> Lobster <p> Crab <p> Shrimp <p> Squid <p> Octopus <p> All vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fruit and vegetable juices <p> Jam , jelly or marmalade <p> Beans and lentils <p> Olives and pickles <p> Rice <p> Spaghetti <p> Olive oil ( if used sparingly ) <p> Since there are clear restrictions while on this diet , it will take reevaluation of what is acceptable during certain dates . Many common foods are not allowed , which can take planning depending on ones own individual schedule . <p> It may get boring for some to be limited to these kinds of foods . The fatigue of this can lead some to not want to continue , or it may cause symptoms such as irritability and mood swings . <p> These kinds of foods allowed are meant more to connect one with god however , so it would be beneficial for those who are already religious to practice such a practice . Giving up certain more commonly eaten foods in order to have a deeper spiritual connection would be seen as a good practice and it may actually reduce ones stress levels . However , as far as weight loss goes , it does not offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants also have a lent friendly menu which can make it easier for one to eat out and still enjoy a meal that is based around ones limitations . Even certain fast food restaurants advertise specials on fish and more vegetable heavy dishes to cater to those who are fasting . This can make it easier to enjoy meals out while still following the regimen of lent . <h> EXERCISE <p> There is no exercise regimen with this diet as it is not used for weight loss . Some may want to limit their exercise while doing this diet as it can help keep one from feeling less energetic . <p> During moments of fasting you 're already using up your caloric reserves , to add in additional physical exercise can be difficult , as you have to burn even more calories . When your body has nothing to rely on for fuel , it can make easy tasks more strenuous on the body . <p> It might be best for most to not do any strenuous activities , as this can further strain the body . Another potential issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain their lean muscle mass . There is a possibility for experiencing a loss of healthy muscle and bone density , as you are n't  receiving a more traditional diet needed to fuel the body . <p> For some it would be better to consult a nutritionist or doctor to ensure one is able to exercise without experiencing any unwanted symptoms . Its not uncommon for one to experience brain fog and other similar symptoms . <p> Since during certain fasting periods you 're not allowed any solid foods and only liquids , post supplementation may be difficult . These periods is typically when the body needs nutrients to ensure you 're able to support your body with the amino acids it needs to rebuild and create bigger and stronger muscles . This may limit the intensity and frequency of exercises . <h> CONCLUSION <p> Lent may be something you 've been puzzled about for a while , but every year there are millions of people that follow the Lenten Diet for 40 days .

The Lenten Diet does however incorporate some practices that might be able to improve your overall health if done on a consistent basis . There are other true diets which can target weight loss directly , without the need to do any sort of fasting . <p> The great benefit of this diet is that it offers comprehensive coverage for anyone looking to lose weight in a safe and effective manner . Low calories and high amounts of protein are added to the meal replacement shake to ensure hunger is suppressed for hours , which helps one reduce their total calories , the primary major factor in weight loss . The metabolism booster has plant extracts which have been shown to help one continually burn calories at a steady rate , which can often be slowed down during times of caloric deprivations . <p> Each ingredient is made in a GMP compliant facility to ensure quality control inspections and proper handling . Customers have also rated this diet highly for its ease of use , flexibility , and the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious in nature and observed primarily by those in the Catholic church for 40 days out of the year . Lent is classified as a season of spiritual housecleaning and the days of Lent are a period of self denial . Typically during lent those that practice it are giving up something throughout that 40 days in addition to observing a special diet . Many people who are not observing the Lenten diet specifications do decide to give something up for Lent . The diet that is undergone during Lent is intended to transform people physically and spiritually . <p> This is not a diet intended for weight loss , but for spiritual purposes . Typically all members over the age of 14 are asked to avoid eating meat on the Fridays during Lent . This is done to help demonstrate self denial and control materialism .

The program boasts no exercise and you eat the foods you love including the diet program 's own line of diet foods and herbal and thermogenic supplements . <p> Made popular by Rush Limbaugh who in 2009 lost a remarkable amount of weight in a short period of time following a Quick Weight Loss created just for him , this southern Florida company has helped many lose weight . <p> Currently , the only bricks and mortar Quick Weight Loss Centers are scattered around southern Florida but there is an online program that you can join from anywhere in the country . This home-based program is a six-week program in which you receive support and counseling via email and phone from Quick Weight Loss Center specialists . <p> Once you have signed up for either program , you work individually with a Quick Weight Loss Center expert in order to create your own customized diet plan . <p> In general , the Quick Weight Loss plan provides participants a diet that is low calorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods you like to make and supplement with Quick Weight Loss brand 's bars , beverages , soups as well as supplement s that are intended to facilitate weight loss . <p> You can expect to lose three to seven pounds each week while following the Quick Weight Loss Center programs . <p> Supplements do not require FDA approval ; check with your doctor before taking <p> Brick and mortar locations are limited to southern Florida and Texas <p> Low calorie diet plan may lead to rebound weight gain <p> Diet program rules are not scientifically founded 10974 @qwx870974 <p> While all Quick Weight Loss Center diets are custom-designed , there are a few benchmark features that are applied to every participant 's diet . <p> Most diet plans include a low-calorie and low-fat daily eating plan that is comprised of about 1,500 calories a day . <p> And while the company remains pretty hush-hush about what their diet looks like , a few secrets slipped through the cracks thanks to Rush 's public discussion about his experience with Quick Weight Loss Centers . <p> There are a host of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program such as eating green peppers but not red bell peppers and not combining two different kinds of proteins in one meal .

In addition , alcohol , sugar , refined flours and fried foods are not allowed . <p> You can also supplement with Quick Weight Loss Centers proprietary foods which can be purchased online or at one of the Center 's Florida locations .

So important thing is to know how fairly and badly does work on us , Is there any element what is responsible for our health damage ! As we know " Health is Wealth " So , now the big question is Which Product Is Right for Our Personality ? Go through the link to get a SECRET eBook . To know details . . http : **39;71;TOOLONG <p> What I can say about this program . I am in my 7th week out of 12 weeks , and I have lost 19 lbs . So I think it works , however This is a business and as a business they want to sell sell sell .. When I heard about this program on the radio they said 99 for 4 weeks and I said that is great . But , its not true . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 698 . That 698 included the supplements for 6 weeks , 3 boxes of a protein shakes , 1 box of fiber and 3 boxes of energy boost , 12 weeks office visits and 4 more weeks of office visits after you are done with the program . I knew it was a lot of money buy I did it , I asked them before signing that if this was all I will have to pay and they yes , and in a very low voice just supplement that is all . I though vitamins and stuff not big deal . After few days of prep I took a class and at the end and the class-video the real true of the program came through . They want to hit you with a ridiculous member ship that it will cost over 2000 and if you said no they keep trying to sell you anything and everything . The guy that it was trying to sell me all the stuff got very nasty when I refuse to buy anything . Then he show me graphs of numbers and numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said no .. After the class I got home and then this is when I got smart , I did my homework and with the supplements I got from them when I sing up I was able to see the manufacture for the pills and with a very little more research I found out you can buy everything online for a lot less money . Some items 50% less like the energy booster ( QWL 39 Online 20 ) ( Metabolizer QWL 155 Online 129 ) I though the energy bars where ridicules expensive $18 per 6 or 7 bars . So that is when I said to myself let see if I can find something in the market close enough for a less money . And unfortunately from them all the supplements , bars and more have all the nutrition fact in QWL website , then I learned what I need it to look for . For example in the bars Calories= less than 200 Sodium= Less tan 200mg Protein= more than 10g Sugars= Less than 10g Total fat= less than 10g Now , bars like this are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Nutrition smart and whole foods , and I was able to find what I was looking for . Then , I officially stared the program and within the first week they still trying to sell me their stuff , that is when I got upset and I told then I was able to find everything online .. They were very surprise when I knew the manufacture and the best part for me it was when they ask me to buy at least the protein bars , they instead that I have to take the protein bars to succeed . and I told them I was taking them but a different ones . They said I must to follow the program because and other bars may not be good for me , then I told them about my criteria selecting them . I said I 'm looking for less than 200 calories and the guy cut me off and said its not just about the calories , so I kept going with the sugar lees than 10g and he said that is way too much sugar so I ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? And guess what ? He did not know . Then I said your QWL bars have from 6g to 14g of sugar Then I finish with the rest of nutrition facts and he was very surprise Then he said if you do not take our products we can not guaranty you lose the weight , I told him I had no choice because they were not honest to me about the cost and I will not buy anything from them . I told them 698 was a lot of money and I will not spend 150 to 200 a week in products I can buy for + of the price somewhere else . Then he made me singed a paper that they will no guarantee that I will lose the weight due to I 'm using other products . However . I think besides the sell sell sell shit they give you , I think the program works . I can not imagine not to be able to lose weight if you follow the diet . Its very hard diet but I 'm sure if you do everything they tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will lose the weigh , May not be as quick as they claim but you will lose they weight quick . After my 6th week my pills-supplements ended but I was able to find them online , and I did replace few of them like the FDSs , Fiber , multivitamins and I stop taking the energy boost ( amazing product by the way but a bit expensive for me , about 20 a week ) I purchased online Metabolizer and carb blocker . If you stick with it I believe you will lose the weight , I 'm sure if you modified few things you will get results . But the only thing I never modified was the diet . If you are going to do the program do your homework . <p> It 's interesting to read these accounts . Here is what I can tell you , I just started my 3rd ( yes 3rd ) time doing the QWLC diet . Why you might ask ... because it works , but then as so many articles and so on have indicated , I boomeranged both other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will be smarter to keep the weight off . <p> IF YOU want to get this diet to work for you , you MUST buy the additional supplements , they greatly increase your success rate with this program . With the supplements , I am not hungry between meals and lost 75 lbs in about 3.5 months . The starter pack is just that , a starter pack ... so yes , you will need to buy more . Do you need to buy the entire 6 month supply they tell you to ... heck NO ! Buy a month or two at a time ... its more expensive , but you will find the most well intentioned person forgets to take a pill here and there . PLUS , if you do NOT cheat , you WILL lose the weight fast and will not need the entire supply of supplements and snacks . <p> Now do n't lie to yourself and to us , if you did not get the results promised , you did not strictly follow the diet plan , you did not take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they can help you .. All these aspects are very key and the visits to the center are part of what you pay for . ANY cheating by eating non-diet foods in larger ( or smaller quantities ) , yes ANY , can slow dramatically your weight loss . <p> So , if you already have the supplements , give it a chance ... be STRONG ! ! But you MUST follow the diet exactly and taking the supplements how they ask you to take them will increase your chances of success greatly ! <p> posted Aug 26th , 2016 4:47 pm <p> mkj <p> Can anyone please email me with what supplements mimic the ones from QWL that can be bought cheaper elsewhere ? txblonde2010@gmail.com <p> posted Aug 8th , 2016 11:30 am <p> William <p> You know its a scam when they put you through an hour long sales pitch that they originally told me was going to only take 30 min , lower your goal weight so you will require more weeks on their wonder program , and then tell you an ungodly price for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the vitamin , and cost a fraction of the cost elsewhere . They show you NO CALORIC VALUES for the plan or foods . So I asked , how many calories are you giving me , I am a 6 ' 2 " 235Lb man and I work hard 12 hours a day . The girl says , 1,100 and I promise you wo n't feel hungry at all ! Guess what , when you eliminate so much food intake , and fill peoples stomachs with so little real healthy food and a ton of water , and bogus Chinese supplements , and then chase it all with fiber and diuretics its not a diet ! It 's a marketing ploy to make ridiculous amounts of profits on cheap crappy supplements while starving and purging your clients ! The name " Quick Weight Loss Center " is legit however ! I have gallstones , so the girl called her medical advisor and told me I COULD N'T EAT THEIR HIGH PROTEIN SNACK BARS AND OTHER ITEMS , HOWEVER THEY WERE PART OF THE RIDICUOULSLY EXPENSIVE STARTER KIT ! SO THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIDS , WITHOUT OFFERING ME A SUBSTITUTION FOR MY MONEY , AND WORSE , THEY DID N'T ASK ABOUT MY WIFE OR KIDS CURRENT HEALTH STATUS YET I COULD JUST LET THEM CONSUME THESE ITEMS AND OF COURSE BUY THE ONES I CAN TAKE ? SCAM , SCAM , SALES SCAM ! Folks , my beautiful tiny 100lb wife could eat 1,100 calories of ice cream or bacon and lose weight . Since I paid for this crap , I am going to continue to use it , as I will certainly lose weight , but I thought I would tell you it 's day 2 and I have been hungry for both days even with their appetite suppressant and fat burners !

They advertise on the radio " Get 10 Weeks for Just $99.00 " Then at the end of the commercial a person in a quiet voice says " Certain Conditions may Apply " This is reminiscent of the way that the Automobile Industry advertises . <p> What they do n't tell you up front is that the price they charge for their nutrients and supplements are outrageous . O.K. some of you might be thinking that " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost 22 lbs in 8 weeks at an approximate cost so far of $40.00 per pound . Not a misprint. $40.00 per lb . Outrageous ! <p> When I went to sign up for the $100.00 special in December , 2015 , I told the Councillor Brian who I had known from QWL from previous years ago at my 1st attempt with QWL that I was going to get the Gastric Sleeve Surgery in January or February and that I had to loose 20 - 30 pounds before they would allow the surgery . He agreed that it would be a great idea for me to get the gastric sleeve but instead of offering the 10 week promotional membership at $100.00 which I originally came in for and was all I really needed , he had talked me into taking out a different type of membership that would enable me to save supposedly thousands of dollars . So I paid the initial payment of $400.00 - $500.00 which included a starter kit of their supplements and other products that I was required to take . Then I sat down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was immediately offered a $4,000.00 package that would supposedly afford me the greatest savings . I laughed out loud a little and then settled for a less expensive package which cost me an additional $399.00 that was put onto a QWL card . So . here I am , I 've paid out $800.00 - $900.00 and I am ready to start . <p> What I did n't know at the time but have since confirmed from our local head office is that some of the QWL agents work on a COMMISSION basis . Ah Ha .... know it starts to make more sense . This was why the used " Gorilla Marketing " and pushed me so hard into buying a program and products that I really did n't need but was better for them financially . <p> When some of my original starter kit items were finished , I went into my QWLC and gave them my QWL card an asked to order 3 or 4 items . I was then told that there was a 10 item minimum ? I asked why I had to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that was their rule . Well , guess what ? ? ? They had neglected to tell me about their rules before I purchased my prepaid card . If I knew that then , I would NOT have pre-purchased anything and just buy what I need as I need it . I felt as if I was being GOUGED ! ! <p> They apologized to me and told me that the person who sold it to me was new and that is why she neglected to tell me the rules . O.K. , mistakes happen . The Manager Tony , who is very polite and professional offered me a few boxes of supplements to make up for any hard feelings that I might have . <p> Yesterday , when I went in to get weighed , I presented a list of 10 items that I would like to purchase against my QWL card as per their rules . To my horror , they told me that only the supplements were included in the 10 items and not the fiber . Again , I felt enraged that I was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional $150.00 . I ca n't for the life of me figure out why when I have made a prepayment of almost $400.00 that they would limit me in what I can buy . <p> I am done with them . I ca n't take their B.S. any more . I have not used my prepaid card yet and they refuse to credit me for the outstanding amount . I feel that they are greedy little pigs . What web of lies and deceit they have spun . I think that I should let the Attorney Generals Office know about this . <p> BTW ... Anyone can do just as well for themselves in losing weight with Weight Watches or any other diet plans out there . <p> posted Feb 2nd , 2016 11:53 pm <p> kathleen marconis <p> - <p> this is a completely waste of money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

@@98099832 @2299832/ <h> 4 Bio-Hacks to Lose Weight and Get More Sleep <p> It turns out that what you eat strongly influences how you sleepand how you sleep affects your waistline . <p> Did you know that getting less than seven hours of sleep per night is a risk factor for obesity ? <p> Here are four easy bio-hacks that will help you get more sleep AND lose weight at the same time . <p> #1 TOO SWEET TO SLEEP <p> Foods high in sugar , especially when eaten before bed , set up a cascade of hormones that will keep you up at night . In turn , sleeplessness can make you insulin-resistant , sending blood sugar levels even higher , creating a cycle that leads to excess fat and obesity . <p> Skipping the late-hour sugar rush from dessert is a quick fix to deepen your sleep . <p> For more consistent deep sleep , focus on eating meats , eggs , nuts , and non-starchy vegetables throughout the day . These foods will reduce your overall sugar intake so your body can rest better at night . Less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it a step further ? Try an overnight fast in which you keep 12-14 hours between your last meal and your first meal the following day . This will help you sleep better as your body draws on the long-lasting and stable energy from your fat stores . An overnight fast will have you waking up more refreshed and you will lose weight faster too . <p> #2 BLUE LIGHT = UP ALL NIGHT <p> Blue light is found in morning light from the sun . It 's the kind of light you want to start your day with because it suppresses melatonin , making you feel more alert . <p> But blue light at night is a huge sleep disruptor . We are engulfed in blue light throughout the day , at the office and at home , especially with light from the TV , energy-efficient lights , and your cellphone or iPad . <p> Exposure to blue light does n't stop at messing up your circadian rhythm . It is also linked to heart disease , cancer , diabetes , and obesity . The connection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hormone that makes you feel fuller longer . A lack of leptin is a trigger for over-eating and weight gain . <p> Reduce your exposure by shutting down electronics in the evening . Resist the urge to check your cell phone one more time before turning off the lights . Just glancing at it is enough to set back your sleep cycle by 30 minutes . <p> #3 SUNLIGHT TO BOOST ZZZ 'S AND BURN FAT <p> As we mentioned above , blue light from bright morning light is a signal to your body to start its day . Furthermore , exposure to sunlight on your skin between 8:00 am and noon boosts your mood and your level of alertness during the day while helping you rest better at night . <p> Getting in sync with the sun can also lower your body fat . People who get 20 to 30 minutes a day of bright morning light have lower BMIs than people who do not . <p> Set your circadian clock as soon as your alarm goes off . Get out of the dark and into daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute or two spent viewing the dawn light through your window , you will feel yourself wake up faster . No time for that ? Ditch wearing your sunglasses on your way into work so you can soak in the light . <p> A good strategy to synchronize your body with your watch is to take a 20-minute outdoor walk in the morning . It will physically and mentally wake you up while giving you some exposure to the early morning sun . The exercise will have you burning fat and sleeping sounder as well . <p> #4 ARE YOU A MONDAY MORNING ZOMBIE ? <p> Monday mornings not your thing ? While you might not have set foot on a plane over the weekend , the deep level of exhaustion at the start of the week is because you are jet-lagged . <p> How does that happen ? <p> Most of us shift our Monday to Friday work schedule by 2-3 hours when the weekend hits . We stay up later and sleep in longer . To your body , this shift is like flying through a few time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get more sleep over the weekend , misaligning your time-zone every few days is hard on your body . <p> Social jet lag is linked to obesity , diabetes , and heart disease . The cure ? Keep your weekend social life to the same hours as your work-life . It turns out Mom was right . Having a set time to go to bed and wake up is important to your health ! <p> If you are determined to keep up with your demanding social life , following the other three hacks listed above will help you stay on top of your Monday game . <p> When it comes to sleep or your waistline , every little positive change counts .

Healthy preservative free meals are greatly advised such as our expert recommended protein shakes . The highest rated protein shake was found to be 18Shake , and you can find its review HERE . <p> Here are some of the worst preservatives that should be avoided as much as possible : <p> What it is : This ingredient , made from soybeans or corn , is used as a flame retardant by chemical companies , but its purpose in soft drinks is to stabilize the citrus oils from floating to the surface , giving the drink a cloudy appearance . <p> How it can make you sick : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and Japan .

Since its widely imported in from countries with different safety standards , the group adds that there is a risk for toxic effects : <p> " food safety problems like melamine adulteration " <p> Melamine can potentially cause organ damage and a series of health problems . According to the Food and Water Watch organization , pasteurization does not kill melamine , and it has been shown in other milk protein concentrate blends in high amounts . <p> Fructose : Fruit sugar that is added to provide a sweet taste , but it has no nutritional value . This is considered one of the worst sweeteners , due to its ability to cause numerous health problems . The Louisiana University System ran a study on fructose and showed that it : <p> This study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Its important to limit calories as much as possible in order to promote weight gain . 2 shakes provide 480 calories , which is significantly higher than other meal replacements . <p> There 's also a lot of protein at 24 grams , but not all of it is quality whey . Some of it comes from cheap non-fat milk and milk protein concentrate . Both of these can be purchased for much cheaper elsewhere . <p> EDITORS TIP : Combine this supplement with a proven meal replacement such as 18Shake for better results . <h> The Price and Quality of Isagenix <p> A 14 serving canister sells for $51.95 . So if you were to do 2 shakes a day for a total of 28 days worth , the price would be $207.80 . <p> This is exceptionally higher than the average meal replacement shake .

It advises to stop eating certain foods without the need to count calories . <p> Once one reaches their targeted weight loss , you can then introduce the banned foods in limited portions .

Anything that has flour or sugar will be removed from your diet . This approach is supposed to remove all the empty calories from your diet and allow you to replace those food items with healthier , more nutrient-rich items . <p> Dr. Gott is a widely published medical doctor , contributing to hundreds of newspapers , medical publications , magazines and a few other books about health and wellness . He 's been a general practice physician for more than 40 years . <p> Empty calories means that the nutrients of the food will not stay with you long . Your body burns and processes these quickly and often leave you feeling hungry again . Instead , you can eat foods that provide better nutrients , you 'll digest them more slowly , and begin to feel healthier . <p> Focus less on what the No Sugar , No Flour diet wo n't let you have and more on what it does let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which include : <p> Whole grains ( not whole grain flour ) <p> Fruits <p> Vegetables <p> Dairy <p> Poultry <p> Meat <p> Fish <p> Starches like potatoes and rice <p> The sugar restriction is quite broad , as it does not solely pertain to white sugar . You 'll have to eliminate honey , brown sugar , maple syrup , molasses or anywhere else you find sugar . Look for flour alternatives like barley , corn and quinoa . <p> You 'll also learn more about portion control . By eliminating flour and sugar , you 're eliminating a lot of unhealthy calories from your diet . But you still have to manage the calories you 're consuming from the permissible foods . To do this , you 'll divide your plate in half : <p> Half with non-starchy vegetables or a split of fruit and non-starchy vegetables <p> The No Flour , No Sugar Diet suggests you can lose weight without a dedicated exercise plan . However , it does make some recommendations to increase those results . Exercise should n't be a punishment , so find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 30-60 minutes each day . <p> CONCLUSION <p> It seems that the No Flour , No Sugar Diet would be most ideal for individuals with food allergies who are looking for support to eat healthy . However , if you 're looking for a low-carb plan , this one definitely takes it to the extreme . Some testimonials say it 's hard to stick to because you 're refusing yourself some of the foods you really enjoy , like sandwiches , pizza or pastries . The diet requires a lot of effort on the user 's part , as there is daily journaling , measuring portions , detailed reading of food labels ( searching for those hidden sugars ) and a daily commitment to exercise . 10978 @qwx870978

I really like what Christian Jarrett had to say about using positive reinforcement to encourage children to eat vegetables , learn to like them , and even eat more vegetables when no reward would be given . Rewarding children with stickers or praise for eating healthy food can do more than get them to clean their plates one evening . <p> After being encouraged to eat a vegetable 12 times in two weeks , children ranked the vegetable higher in preference to other vegetables than they had previously ranked it , and these results remained consistent in follow ups one and three months later . After the two week experimental period , those children that had been rewarded with stickers during the experimental period chose to eat more of the target vegetable when they knew there would be no reward than those children that received no positive reinforcement during the experimental period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised and the children given stickers maintained their increased voluntary consumption , but the children simply exposed to the vegetable did not . <p> The researchers point out that in older research , bribing children to eat vegetables that they already liked did make them less interested in those vegetables . This may mean that once a child integrates a previously avoided food into his or her diet without discussion , it is no longer beneficial to reinforce the behavior . However , Jarretts final paragraph makes an important point : <p> " An important detail of the current study is that verbal praise was almost as effective as tangible reward . Social reward might be particularly valuable in the home , the researchers said , because it may help parents avoid being accused of unfairness in offering incentives to a fussy child but not to the childs siblings .

Did you see the " unlimited fruits and veggies " almost every day ? It does include lean protein or milk on several days . The only thing it cuts out is fat and bread/pasta/sugar . As for the allegedly low calories , I calculate about 56 calories per serving of soup , which you could easily eat 4-8 servings of in a day plus the other things . Bananas and apples have about 100 calories for a medium one ( x 8 is 800 calories ) plus milk , which is almost the same . Chicken breast has 600 calories ( lean beef is the same ) for the recommended 20oz . I calculate around 1000 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only truly extreme low calorie day is the one where only vegetables and baked potato/butter are allowed ( around 500 ) . I do n't see any evidence that fasting ( or almost fasting ) for one day every harmed anyone . Or , that going without bread/pasta/sugar and fat for one week every harmed anyone . The key is continuing after the diet to consume limited bread/pasta/sugar and healthy fats like nuts and avocados in order to maintain the weight loss . I 've lost 90 lbs and kept it off for the last year and a half following a diet very similar to this and can say this with confidence and experience . One tip I will give , is that I 've always found when sugar cravings hit really hard , try eating an apple and a small handful of almonds along with a full glass of water . This almost always works for me and the almonds do n't really break the diet significantly as long as you do n't overdo it . <p> posted Apr 13th , 2015 2:07 pm <p> Joy <p> + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very easy . I am a veggie so I swapped out beef for tofu and milk for almond milk . I also recommend using a low sodium soup stock to reduce water retention . I did not have a lot of weight to loose so I dropped 5 pounds but I felt it was a great reboot for when I might have overindulged a bit . I did not regain any of the weight but I also kept up a healthy diet afterwards . I 'm pretty sure if I binged out again it would all pile back .

I have a major sweet tooth and it really does take away the desire after the first few days and after the week of diet continues to work . I have found it easy to keep the weight off because it changes my junk food desires . Whenever I gain a few lbs I begin again . I find it pretty easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to eat , and do not ever feel hungry . I would rather follow a diet for 7 days that you see real results and stay in check than having to be on a diet for weeks or months . This diet works great . <p> Look up the definition of fad diet and you 'll see a picture illustrating the Cabbage Soup Diet . It should not be followed as a long-term eating plan , as it is dangerously low in calories and could do more harm than good . It is possible to lose 10 pounds in a week when you stick to this uber-low calorie plan . <p> The Cabbage Soup Diet does offer fast weight loss , but it is completely lacking in nutrition , flavor and variety . You 'll consume mostly soups of cabbage , onion , celery , carrots , tomatoes and mushrooms . Nutritionists argue that the pounds shed are more likely attributed to the dramatic and dangerous loss in calories and not the proposed fat-burning power found in the cabbage . This diet deprives your body of essential nutrients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak . <p> Day Two Consume all the soup and vegetables you like ( no beans , peas or corn ) .

You can also have 10-20 ounces of skinless chicken or beef and no more than six tomatoes . Drink plenty of water . <p> Day Six Eat plenty of vegetables and your servings of beef . Today is the day you can go a bit overboard with the meat ( 2 steaks if you like ) - just make sure to add salad and vegetables . Stay away from the carbs - no fries , potatoes , etc . <p> No recommendations are made . Given the severely low calories you 'll be consuming , you likely wo n't have the strength for physical activity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more healthy eating plan , the Cabbage Soup Diet could possibly be a solution .

Finishing the Cabbage Soup Diet and beginning a healthy eating and exercise regimen is the best advice anyone following this unhealthy approach can receive .

Yah for new years resolutions ! <p> Rulon was n't obeying the rules so that is why they gently allowed him to leave . It was very nice of them to do so . <p> I 'm sorry Cindy about your health issues . I know it is very difficult to do any exercising when you are in pain . I have a very bad knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets so bad that I ca n't do it . I need to do water aerobics , but it is out of the question for me right now . And since you are so limited with your budget , it would n't work for you either . There is so much out here on the internet that you really do n't need to buy any books , dvds , or video . Just look for the free stuff that is available . And just move anyway that you can , whether is it in a chair ( chair dancing ) or walking through your house . Know someone who walked off 65 pounds just walking around her house each day . She has severe pain but she said that she is in pain if she does n't do anything , and in pain if she did , so she chose to walk with the pain . She reads or alks on her cell phone . She follows the BL program as to eating . Hope you have a good day ! <p> I absolutely love the BL ! ! Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said that he used to sit on the couch and watch BL instead of getting up exercising while watching it ... I do that . However , I have severe degenerative arthritis in my spine &amp; have had 1 surgery and b4 2nd 1 could be done , the discs ruptured . Now it is happening again . I am very limited on what I am able to do tho the drs tell me I can do whatever I want . Please help ? I wish I could afford the food/books/dvds , etc but I have n't worked in 3 yrs . Also , I was wondering what happened to Roulon in the last season ? Y was he not on the finale ? Did I totally miss something ? ? ? <p> posted May 25th , 2011 10:38 pm <p> Walter <p> First let me start by saying that the biggest loser show has improved the life of many people that at one point were at their peak of their career or in life . And for some unknown reason they let life take the best of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or denial which moved them to see food as comfort . The show has moved people form the couch to a more interactive family lifestyle and itG ? ? s clearly shown by their reaction , attitude and outlook on life that your show has truly been a lifesaver . Being a Soldier for the better part of my life and always being active has given me a much healthier and stronger life . But now that I have been injured I still try to maintain a good regiment and have inspired people to not let themselves go and do see your show as a good benefit to humanity . Sure itG ? ? s good in your pocket , but you serve a much higher purpose and that is help people Now , for the bad points that the biggest loser show has continue to allow and dominate the seasons past , present and even future ones ( hope not ) . I have noticed that the show moved towards a clear game tactics , which completely moved the show more into a DRAMA show rather than a benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need help , but itG ? ? s clearly that there are ones that do need more than others . I have seen a lot of game play and itG ? ? s now time for the producers or the people that can make decisions to stop it . Sure it makes for a good TV and ratings go through the roof . But if there is ever a time that conscience comes to mind for everyone concerned and clears the injustice that the greedy contestants show just to make their move into a chess game to position the pons for easy win . You will see that allowing those bigger contestants to stay will make for a more dramatic event and fulfilling show . I know this is not the place to post this note , but I just didnG ? ? t know where to send it and I am sure that you can send it to the right people .

BEWARE if you sign up for an introductory membership you are responsible for canceling it on your own or you will be charged a rate that is nearly twice what you paid .

Added to it are fiber , digestive enzymes , and antioxidants . <p> Its made with 2 proprietary formulas to support digestion , and to help with nutrient absorption . The official website actually has no information on this product , as they currently have their website unavailable for viewing . However , there 's a lot of information about this brand , and the full ingredients list is cited . In this review you 'll learn about customer experiences , whether or not its effective , and what one can expect in terms of weight loss . The best ranking supplements are available in this easy to read top 10 list . <p> Participants were given high amounts of this ingredient for over an 8 week period . This ingredient can also potentially lead to side effects that include : <p> Blockages in the throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and frequent bowel movements . <p> Bloating , nausea , and vomiting . <p> There 's also concern for diabetics , as it may dangerously lower blood sugar . <p> The FDA has also not approved this ingredient for any medical conditions . The FTC has had to warn companies against making weight loss claims about this ingredient . Companies have often mislead and made false claims about its intended benefits . <p> Caralluma Fimbriata Powder : Cactus found in India that is used as an appetite suppressant . Web MD adds : <p> " The long-term safety is not known " <p> It may also lead to side effects that include : <p> Upset stomach , gas , and nausea . <p> Constipation , stomach pain , and irritable bowels . <p> There havent been many conclusive studies which have proven it can help suppress appetite . The FTC has also sent warnings to companies that claim this ingredient is effective . <p> Cha De Bugre Powder : This tree extract is used as a way to suppress appetite . Claims of this effect are not supported by evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cha De Bugre decreases appetite , but there is no scientific evidence that this is true " <p> They also mention its safety : <p> " There is not enough known about Cha De Bugre to know if there are any safety concerns or if it is safe to take " <p> Without more information , its unknown what once can expect from this ingredient . <p> Papain Powder : Extract taken from the papaya fruit . Its enzymes are used to help break down proteins . Web MD has expressed concerns over its safety : <p> " It can cause irritation of the throat and stomach " <p> " Taking large amounts of papain by mouth is POSSIBLY UNSAFE " <p> There have also been documented cases of people experiencing allergic reactions to this . <p> Bromelain Powder : Enzyme extracted from pineapples . Its used to help fight inflammation and swelling , as well as to improve digestive health . <p> It may cause side effects that include : <p> Diarrhea , stomach discomfort , and digestive issues . <p> Allergic reactions , swelling , and difficulty breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven fat burner such as Sletrokor for better results . <h> Skinny Fiber Quality Of Ingredients <p> Studies have shown that its key active ingredient in Glucomannan does not help with weight loss . Cha de bugre does n't  have enough studies performed , and caralluma fimbriata has conflicting reports of its appetite suppression . <p> Digestive enzymes like bromelain , papain , and others may lead to side effects . They also lack enough studies to show what kinds of effects they might have long term . <p> No clinical studies are offered by the manufacturers to help prove the effectiveness of ingredients like cha de bugre , bromelain , and glucomannan . Since reliable clinical studies are lacking for these ingredients , its unknown what kind of an effect Skinny Fiber might have with repeat use . <h> The Price and Quality of Skinny Fiber <p> The official website is currently not available at the time of this review . Though there are other ways to purchase this brand . On Amazon.com , a 30 day supply sells for $39.99 . <p> This amounts to a daily price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed by a money back guarantee . No information is available from the official website to show whether or not they allow returns . <p> For the price , you 're getting a mixture of digestive enzymes which are n't  needed in people , as the body makes its own enzymes . Some of these enzymes may actually produce side effects , and some of them lack sufficient studies to show they are effective and safe . <p> Then there 's other ingredients include glucommanan , caralluma fimbriata , and cha de bugre . Glucomannan has not been shown to help with weight loss , and the FTC has also fined companies for making false claims that it does have benefits . Cha de bugre lacks any studies at all , and its unknown if this would be safe or effective . Caralluma fimbriata has also failed to show any significant appetite reduction , currently , its known that this ingredient has yet to be proven as an effective weight loss ingredient . <p> There 's no evidence provided by the manufacturers to show why this brand would be effective . Judging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any potent weight loss effects . <h> Business of Skinny Fiber <p> The company is owned by Master Strategies they can be reached via the following . <p> Phone Number : ( 855 ) 437-4638 <p> Address : Windermere , Florida 34786 <p> They are a multilevel marketing company . Many people sell this brand , and there 's been confusion about who owns the original formula . A current lawsuit was filed from one Skinny Fiber maker to another . Its also more confusing since the manufacturers official website is no longer available . <p> The original company has an F rating on their Better Business Bureau website . This is due to 14 different complaints filed against them . People had the following to say : <p> " no refund after numerous calls and emails " <p> " Order cancelled and patiently asked for a refund to no avail " <p> " company that is so unwilling to communicate and resolve an issue " <p> " I am concerned about their practices and how often they do this to other customers " <p> Many disgruntled customers were unpleased with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were also concerns about a lack of a money back guarantee . People often tried leaving voicemails and emails without any response back . Customers were concerned to find that they repeatedly try to gain responses to their questions , only to find no support . <p> EDITORS TIP : For the best results , our experts recommend using weight loss pills for at least 3 months . Save your money by buying a few bottles at once . <h> Customer Opinions of Skinny Fiber <p> Here are some reviews from online customers : <p> " this product did not make a difference " <p> " I did not find it helpful and felt it caused heartburn " <p> " used for three months and did n't  lose anything so do n't  waste your money " <p> " actually gained weight . Ugh hate this product " <p> There 's currently 169 negative reviews on their Amazon.com page . The problem with looking at positive reviews for a brand like this is that its sold by peole who earn a commission off sales . So there are many websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often end with a sales pitch to buy Skinny Fiber through them . <p> Theres blogs and sites made by salesmen of this brand claiming it works well without any side effects . <h> Conclusion - Does Skinny Fiber Work ? <p> Before deciding on Skinny Fiber , its important to look at the aviaallbe information . This brand is made with natural ingredients , but customer reviews have been unfavorable , and there 's a lack of support from the manufacturers . Studies have shown that its key weiht loss ingredients either do n't  work , havent been studied , or require more studies . There 's not enough in this formula to suggest it would provide weight loss effects . That 's why so many of its users have left negative reviews . <p> This all natural supplement has no stimulants , binders , fillers , or unnecessary ingredients of any kind . Users have left great testimonials showing how potent it is for appetite suppression , weight loss , and overall health improvement .

At day 78 I had emailed the company to advise that I do n't feel full with the tablets I also do n't eat a great deal of food I have cut my portion size and only have 1 sugar in 1 coffee a day ( Which I have cut down from 10 cups with 2 sugars each ) . After speaking with my distributor on day 70 I started to open my capsules and take it that way ( I think in case it was n't dissolving properly ) and it still has n't changed . I was constantly tired trough out this time frame but still pushed myself to walk 20-30mis a day 3-4 days a week.I got no respons . I emailed them for a 2nd time 3 days later wanting a refund . The response I got was a short one line email to advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has exceeded my 90 days . I was on day 83 of my challange. after another 3 emails to the support team asking why I was not entitled to a refund I was advised that the 90 day refund actually is from the day of order placed . I am in Australia and it took them 2 weeks to process and send my order there fore not allowing my the time frame to complete their 90 day challange . When I questioned there empty bottle garentee I have not heard a thing from them . This company does not believe in its own product asnd will dfind any loophole to not have to deal with unhappy customers . This is not a 100% satisfation garentee that has been listed on their website .

My advice , buy one bottle see if it works for you , some people it does n't .

I have a question , if Skinny Fiber has nothing to hide , why are they not listing the ingredients on the bottles ? It does n't make sense to me as a consumer to buy something that lists very few ingredients and details . It is just a money maker ! <p> I have been on Skinny Fiber for 5 weeks . I have not lost a pound . In fact I have put on 5 pounds . But I really do like this stuff . Why ? Let me tell you . I have had fungus on my toenails for decades that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until I tried Skinny Fiber . I started noticing new nail growth almost immediately . And the bottoms of my feet were a mess . Now they are almost normal looking . Soft looking . I was getting monthly migraines . They are gone ! I do wish I would lose weight but I have realized that I have a number of internal issues that need to be resolved before I will lose the weight . And I will lose it . I believe I will . It 's just that it took many years for my body to come to this state , and so it may take a few months for it to detox and clear . I eat a very clean diet-no sugar , potatoes , rice or wheat . I exercise daily . And I drink lots of water . My body is getting healthy and I will continue to use Skinny Fiber . In another few months I believe I will be posting that I have lost weight . All the best . Do n't give up if you do n't see weight loss right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customer who is going to continue using this product . For those people who get really hungry or want sweets .

Second , I live alone so making the dinners they recommened would result in too many servings for me . This is how I made the plan work for me : the night before I 'd take one of those reusable iced coffee cups from Starbucks and I 'd add a cup of milk , a scoop of Vanilla SF powder , a spoonful of instant coffee and some water . Every week or two I 'd fill one of those 8 cup Glad containers with berries ( frozen or fresh ) , then I 'd make up some jello and with one envelope of Knox and add it to the berries and refrigerate .

I sip on the shake all morning whenever I 'm hungry . My co-workers get so jealous because it looks like I went to Starbucks . Lunch is a SF bar with an pre-sliced apple and a snack bag of raw veggies , and water . Afternoon snack ( if I need it ) is any veggies I did n't finish and a maybe a 100 cal granola bar . Dinner is about 350 cal . I 'll have a frozen entree or something from a cookbook that says it 's 350 cal or less per serving . I also have a big tossed salad with precious little dressing ( 40 cal or less ) and an orange veg if I have n't already had one that day ( for vit A ) . Dessert is a cup of tea with one sugar cube ( just 19 cal ) . Bedtime snack ( without it I wo n't sleep ) is about 1/2 cup of super low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal that looks like rabbit feed , and a banana . Between dinner and snack is work out .

I like certain staff members better than others but all of them did a good job holding me accountable every week . The products are expensive but most are worth it .

That 's right , if I ca n't make my weigh-in I had to pay anyway as if I 'm actually seeing a doctor . This is a weight program not a doctor visit ! <p> This program is a complete waste .

@@98099873 @2299873/ <h> Seven Ways to Avoid Binging at a Buffet <p> Cooking over the holidays has most of us to closing our home kitchens for a few days to recuperate . If you 're still entertaining family and friends , hitting up the local buffet may seem like the best way to keep everyone fed without spending an arm and a leg . Buffets are also great for New Years hosts who want to set up a variety of food options for people to munch on as they count down the last hours of 2013 . <p> Whatever your reasoning may be , buffets seem like an answer to many holiday eating conundrums . However , they can create more problems than they solve , especially when it comes to your waistline . Weve got tips from Brian Wansink , PhD , of the Cornell Food and Brand lab , as well as ideas of our own to help you navigate buffet-style eating . <p> Choose a smart seat Where you sit can have a big impact on how much you eat . By sitting with your back to the buffet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another dish . You also may want to consider choosing a booth over a table . Wansink found that slimmer individuals tend to go for booths . This creates a more comfortable seating arrangement like what you would find at a sit-down restaurant , and can discourage you from eating more than one plate of food . <p> Size matters While on the subject of plates , the size you use does matter . Its fairly simple , the smaller the plate is , the less you can put on it . Do you need to pile your meal on a plate the size of a serving tray ? No , you do n't  , and you 'll save yourself a lot of calories if you opt instead for a salad-size plate . When serving a buffet-style meal at home , only offer guests smaller plates . If they want more food , they can always go up for seconds . <p> Take a lap Before picking a plate and filling it up , walk around the buffet . Look at what foods are offered and think about what you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food choices can help you decide against the less healthy food options and encourage you to choose something healthier that you actually want . <p> Eat your veggies One healthy habit from growing up that I still follow today is eating a salad before anything else at a buffet . By filling your first plate up with a healthy salad , you will be less likely to overeat entrees later . If you 're at a buffet where salad is n't an option , still try to make your first " course " full of vegetables . <p> Try new things Often buffets offer a mix of comfort food favorites and uniquely local dishes . Make the most of the new offerings by only eating those . Avoid common foods like pizza , burgers , pastas and fried chicken . Not only will you possibly find a new favorite , you will avoid the extra calories many buffet staples contain . <p> Keep it balanced Eating at a buffet is like eating anywhere else . The most important part is to keep it balanced . Keeping a mix of vegetables , protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indulgent meal into a relatively healthy choice . When it comes to desserts , pick one you most want to try , or better yet , pick a couple to sample and split them between friends . <p> Take your time A meal should be something you take the time to enjoy , especially during the holidays . Take the time to enjoy your meal and the company that surrounds you . According to Wansink , author of the book Mindless Eating : Why We Eat More Than We Think , slowing down your eating habits can stop you from mindlessly overeating . <p> A buffet does n't  have to be your healthy-eating enemy . By following these tips , you 'll be sure to start off on the right foot for any health or fitness related New Years resolutions . 10976 @qwx870976 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

The spices used in Indian food , such as mustard seed , chili pepper , cumin , turmeric and garlic , have health benefits for very few calories . However , most Indian curries are cooked in vegetable oil , coconut oil or peanut oil . Oil does help to add flavor and enhance the taste of spices , but use it sparingly to avoid overloading your meal with fats .

It sounds to me like it could be one of two things : it could be an allergy to one of the ingredients in the protein blend - in that case hyou would experience itching , swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dairy allergy . THe second possible reason is that when you are on the Ideal Protein diet you are thrown into a detox quickly - a lot of toxins that have beenheld in the fat are in your bloodstream and being processed by your liver . The liver is directly connected to the skin and this can result in rashes , eczema , acne , hives .... This should be temporary and if you are drinking your water this should help . Add Milk Thistle or Dandelion root to your plan ( you can use roasted dandelion root as a beverage ) and this will help support the drainage .

@@98099883 @2299883/ <p> At this point , it should be abundantly clear that there are no quick fixes to the obesity problem in America . Though there is plenty to be done to stop or reverse a course of obesity , when it comes to preventing it in the first place , most focus on healthy diets and plenty of exercise . <p> Of course , there is nothing wrong with either of those ; here at DietsInReview , we fully support both . However , we may be missing a solution to the obesity problem . One that is n't physical in nature , but mental . <p> David L. Katz , MD , MPH , president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine , wrote in a LinkedIn post , The Obesity Fix , his belief that the obesity problem can be fixed by a shift in how we think about health and obesity . He also acknowledges change wont be easy , saying that no one seems to mind when super sugary cereals are marketed to children , or when its revealed how some foods are designed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to change , people must see health and obesity differently than they do now , in two different ways . <p> HEALTH IS WEALTH <p> First , Katz suggests people view health like wealth , and said in his post , " We respect wealth . We aspire to it . We hope to bequeath it to our children . We invest in it , and work for it . We care about it both for our own sake , and the sake of those we love . " <p> If health was treated more like wealth , its possible that there would be more families exercising together , almost in the way that children are trained in the ways of the family business . <p> Katz also mentions ways people work to be wealthy , such as saving for the future and getting guidance from experts . Both could be used as ways to think about health . Viewing health as a life-long goal could promote healthier lifestyles over quick-fix , temporary diets . Instead of getting health advice from anywhere and anyone , people could rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . <p> OBESITY IS DROWNING <p> The second change Katz proposes is to see obesity like drowning . He points out in his post that drowning is treated as a completely legitimate problem that receives full extent of medical care . Drowning prevention is viewed as a personal and public responsibility , and is the main focus instead of drowning treatment . <p> In his post , Katz said , " If we treated drowning like obesity , we would have no lifeguards at the beach . We would not teach our children to swim . We would allow signage at a shore with notorious rip tides to read : come on in , the waters fine ! ' " <p> " If , instead , we treated obesity more like drowning , we would tell the truth about food . We would not market multicolored marshmallows to children as part of a complete breakfast . We would not willfully mislead about the perilous currents in the modern food supply . We would not look on passively as an entire population of non-swimmers started wading in over their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done about the obesity problem . By following Katzs suggestions , new ways of thinking and talking about health and obesity would be opened up . Instead of going at it alone , individuals could find support and guidance along the way . More people would talk about obesity as something to be prevented , not a problem to be solved . Its a shift from the reactive , to the proactive ; and it may be just what we all need . 10976 @qwx870976 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

@@98099894 @2299894/ <h> Tapeworm Diet <h> This dangerous parasite is banned in the U.S. <p> Eating cabbage soup for two weeks . Exercising three times day . Drinking water with lemon juice and cayenne pepper for 10 days . We can all admit to going to great lengths , even if just once , to lose those unwanted pounds . But the Tapeworm Diet has to get as extreme and desperate as the world of dieting tricks and methods come . The good news is that importing or selling tapeworms in the U.S. is illegal . Tapeworms though , do occur in undercooked beef or raw meat dishes which are prone to contamination . <p> So what does a tapeworm in your gut actually do ? It secretes proteins in our intestinal tract that make our digestion of food much less efficient .

Even though our bodies have evolutionarily become used to being hosts to a myriad of parasites , our modern day ways have no doubt helped us to stay healthier and live longer . Voluntarily ingesting a tapeworm to lose weight is legally a difficult thing to pull off , not to mention dangerous .

Does that make me an over achiever or impatient ? Either way , both seasons make me want to sit on my patio , sip something delicious , and revel in my family and friends . I ca n't be alone in this just look at the Mason Jars full of beverages on Pinterest . We 've all got the itch . <p> The scratch ? My Sweet and Sour Vodka . Its as light and refreshing as a tart glass of lemonade but has that little somethin-somethin to bring you back down after a long day . Its . Amazing . <p> I stopped buying the jug o drink mixer at the grocery store years ago . Master of Mixes Sweet n Sour has 110 calories and 25 grams of sugar per four-ounce serving . Our recipe has TEN calories and LESS than 1 gram of sugar . That neon yellow color , ridiculous after taste , and undesirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer was in front of me all along my own lemons and limes squeezed to cocktail-mixing perfection . <p> The aroma after squeezing two dozen lemons and limes makes the task worth it alone . I 've tried running the fruit through a juicer before while quick and effective the flavor is all wrong . Put some muscle in to it and squeeze the citrus yourself ! <p> The two cups of sugar you might add to this recipe would have wracked up more than 1500 calories ! So I used just a cup of Truvia , which adds zero calories and a light sweet taste . It makes a simple syrup as well as granulated sugar , too . <p> Once the water is added , you get eight cups of fresh , homemade sweet and sour mix that pairs with just about any liquor you want . You can bottle it to save in your own refrigerator to sip here and there . Poured in cheap Ikea clasp bottles or Mason Jars , it makes a wonderful gift for a cocktail-loving friend ! <p> 1 . Juice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups of each . Pour through a mesh strainer in to a large pitcher , removing the seeds and pulp . <p> 2 . Bring 3 cups of water to boil and add the Truvia , stirring until dissolved ( creating a simple syrup ) . <p> 3 . Pour the simple syrup + 2 cups of cold water in to the pitcher and stir until well combined . <p> 4 . Add 1/2 cup of sour mix with 2 ounces of your choice of liquor ( vodka , whiskey , and tequila work well ) , shake over ice , and serve . <p> We like ours best with vodka which makes a very simple spiked lemonade . You can garnish with thin slices of lemons or limes and even rim the glass with Truvia . Pool-side , patio , or just a quiet night in , its equally refreshing and relaxing . <p> If you 're making margaritas , this sweet and sour mix replaces high-calorie , high-sugar mixers for a tart drink that pairs perfectly with our Chunky Guacamole . Combine in a blender for the frozen version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your choice of bourbon and add a fresh cherry and jalapeno slice for an extra sweet and spicy kick ! 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978 
@@98099899 @2299899/ <h> A McDonalds Hamburger : 145 Days Later <p> One of the eating guidelines in Michael Pollans Food Rules is to eat things that will eventually rot . Things like meat , fruits and vegetables , all eventually decompose , returning them to the organic cycle from which they came . Foods that do n't  go bad , from Twinkies to Spam , have been highly processed . Not only are processed foods often full of synthetic chemicals , theyve also been stripped of many of the nutrients that your body needs yet are still full of empty calories . <p> So , with this rule in mind , should you eat a McDonalds hamburger and fries ? New York photographer Sally Davies has set out to answer this question . Shes been photographing a Happy Meal every day , to demonstrate how long it will take to decompose . She began the Happy Meal Project on April 10 , 2010 . Today is 145 days later and the meal looks nearly identical to day one . That 's some serious preservatives in action .

@@98099900 @2299900/ <h> For more than 50 years , Weight Watchers has been a trusted approach to weight loss for men and women . 10971 @qwx870971 <p> Weight Watchers Diet is a diet plan based off a point system , where each food has a value , and you 're allowed only a certain amount of points a day . You can eat any foods you want , as long as you do n't  pass the allowed points for the day . <p> The points offered are called SmartPoints , and the amount allowed is based off one ones own body and individual weight loss goals . Healthy and low calorie foods have much less value , so it naturally steers people into eating more wholesome foods instead of eating high amounts of junk food . In this review you 'll hear customer reviews , the science behind Weight Watchers , and whether or not it can promote weight loss . The highest rated diet plan of 2016 was found to be the 18 Shake Diet . Its a combination of a natural metabolism booster and high protein meal replacement . Learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <h> Weight Watchers Diet Ingredients and Side Effects <p> Ingredients : <p> No pre-packaged foods are required , its advised to cook ones own meals at home . An app and guide is offered with over 287,000 different foods which have a stated number value . <p> High fiber , non-processed , and sugar free foods have a much lower point number . Processed foods and highly saturated foods tend to be the highest in points . So the diet focuses on introducing more healthy foods , which is already known as a practical way to lose weight . <p> There are also 4,000 recipes offered as well as optional support for meetings , online coaching , and dietary tips . Mobile apps are also offered to help people calculate their total points . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> Weight Watchers Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The quality of the ingredients can vary on what 's purchased , since no foods are off limits , what one purchases will determine the overall quality . The high points that processed foods have will force people to be more conservative in their food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Weight Watchers to show why this diet has been formulated in the point system it offers . <p> Its clear that by eating less processed foods and focusing on quality meats , high fiber , and filling foods that naturally weight loss is possible . However , no evidence is provided as to why their coaching system would be any better than not paying for this system and simply eating healthier , <p> One study by the Annals of Internal Medicine found that : <p> " Weight Watchers participants achieved at last 2.6% greater weight loss than those assigned to control/education " <p> This was in a 12 month period , and there were only slight increases in weight loss in comparison to people who were allowed to diet without control . <p> 2.6% for someone weighing 200 pounds would be 5.2 additional pounds . This means that every month , a person can expect an additional 0.43 extra pounds of weight loss more than those who dieted on their own and made their own decisions without a points system . <p> Another major issue with the plan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system before one buys into the plan . This makes it impossible to calculate if one is even capable of keeping up with this plan . Certain foods are not preferential for people , and it might require extreme changes in dieting in some . <p> Even with online support , there 's no guarantee that the advice offered will help one lose weight safely and effectively . <h> The Price and Quality of Weight Watchers Diet <p> There are different plans offered such as : <p> OnlinePlus : $4.30 per week when a 3 month long plan is offered . This amounts to $64.50 for the total 3 months . <p> Meetings + OnlinePlus : A 3 month plan is offered for $8.30 a week . This amounts to $124.50 for the full 3 months . <p> Coaching + OnlinePlus : Like the other plans , if 3 months is selected , the full price is $10.15 . A full 3 months is $152.25 . <p> These prices can vary , as it depends on what one chooses as their meals and how much support they want . No information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give advice are , and whether or not they are certified diet or nutrition experts . Since they fail to mention this , its important to be cautious of the support offered . <p> A $20 fee is mandatory for every first time member . Web MD discusses the pricing of this diet by stating : <p> " Be prepared to spend some cash to get the full benefits " <p> Many customers also agree its incredibly pricy to keep the online support available . As you 'll see in the " Customer Opinions of Weight Watchers Diet " , many felt it wasnt worth the price . <h> Business of Weight Watchers Diet <p> Weight Watchers International is the official company name . Their contact information is as follows : <p> Phone Number : ( 800 ) 651-6000 <p> Further contact information is provided to those who subscribe to the online system .

The plan offers a point system which is meant to make dieting easier . However , hundreds of people have complained about a lack of food options , as well as being forced to limit many common foods .

I 'm learning to be mindful and make better choices . Learning to be kind to myself and not make a bad day a bad week or just quit . This is a commitment to myself .

People post a question and 500 people reply . I 'm not even kidding . Also on Facebook , there are tons of WW pages for recipes and sharing tips . For any program you sign up for , the only way it works is you commit to it .

I never knew paying twice for something was help , maybe they think they prevent me from spending it on food . The program itself is also just a hoax . It is nothing more than calorie control labelled as points . I 've been doing this together with a colleague who signed up for a free app and she did it in parallel using good old calorie intake and calories burned . She achieved exactly the same results and also had access to tons of recipes in her free online forum .

Breathing becomes deeper and more frequent . You can carry on a conversation but not sing . <p> High intensity " Hard exercise that will cause you to break a sweat after three to five minutes . Breathing is deep and rapid . You can only talk in short phrases . <p> Keep in mind that those who are just starting to exercise , or those that have been inactive for a long period of time tend to overestimate their intensity levels .

You can stay on-site at the resort or at a nearby location for a minimum of one week or as long as you like . It seems that an ideal stay is at least two weeks , but many guests stay for at least a month or several at a time . <p> This review is based on actual experience at the Utah location .

Each class lasts 45 minutes , and attendance is taken . <p> HIKING <p> Daily hikes are a favorite of resort guests , as they offer a chance to leave the grounds and get up close and personal with the breathtaking scenery that surrounds the resort . Leaving the resort at 8 a.m. , guests depart in vans with two or three guides with their assigned hiking groups of about six people who are matched in ability ( beginner , intermediate or advanced ) . Each day a different trail is taken , and all require endurance . For some , they 'll burn more calories during the morning hike than they 'll consume all day .

@@98099902 @2299902/ <h> Beginners Guide to Yogilates <p> In 1997 , certified Pilates instructor Jonathan Urla combined yoga postures and Pilates exercises and named it Yogilates . Louise Solomon created her own blend of both and termed it Yogalates . Whatever you call it , hybrid classes like these are very popular in health clubs and studios across the country . <p> Yogilates and other hybrid yoga and Pilates workouts are designed for the purpose of gaining the benefits of core work from Pilates while mixing in the breath and flexibility training of yoga . Just as a yoga practice may not target all of the core muscles , a Pilates class may overlook certain stretches that promote a balanced and healthy body. - Combining the two introduces a dynamic experience of connecting the breath with a new level of mind and body fitness . <p> Save Time <p> Many of us are hard pressed for time to set aside an hour a day to exercise . Rather than taking a Pilates class and then trying finding the time to follow it up with yoga , we can be efficient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes are also attractive to those who need a little variety in their workouts . - Incorporating core work with yoga poses is a superb way to break out of the usual routine . Changing up the sequencing , challenging the muscles in new ways and adding an element of flexibility can turbo charge your body for lasting results . <p> Reduce Injury <p> Doing the same workout over and over can put you at risk for overuse injuries . Stretching without strengthening can put undue stress on your ligaments and joints just as too much muscle work can tighten the body , leaving it vulnerable to tears and strains . Yogilates offers a balance between strength and flexibility that is not repetitive or monotonous . <p> Better Posture <p> Abdominal exercises can be addictive . It is not uncommon for health nuts to crank out 100 crunches and pay no mind to the opposing muscle groups of the back . This can lead to muscle imbalances that could affect your body 's ability to stand up straight .

Wear stretchy , comfortable clothes that you would normally wear to a yoga or Pilates class and leave your shoes at the door . <p> Depending on the instructor , you may begin with some Pilates based warm up exercises or gentle yoga poses . Either way , you will ease into the workout slowly , which makes it appropriate for beginners or those with stiff bodies . <p> Throughout class you will learn to engage your core , stand up straight and breathe in a whole new way .

JIllian Michaels of The Biggest Loser can show you how to do so in only six weeks with her DVD , 6 Week Six-Pack . <p> Jillian combines cardio circuits and abdominal exercises in high-intensity 30-minute workout sessions . The program includes two workout levels to ensure you continue to see results and do not hit a plateau after the first three weeks . <p> Although all the exercises are designed to target your core , you also likely to see results in your biceps , triceps , shoulders , chest , and back because these muscles are used during plank exercises , which target your core . <p> These videos are very challenging .

Food Labels to Get First Major Update in 20 Years <p> If something has stayed the same for 20 years , its usually either a sign of a tradition holding fast , or an indication that its time for a change . Change is in the air at the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) which has plans to overhaul its 20-year-old design of food labels . <p> According to the FDA , the new design is headed down the path of final approval . " The agency is working toward publishing proposed rules to update the nutrition facts label and serving size information to improve consumer understanding and use of nutrition information on food labels , " Juli Putnam , a media spokesperson for the FDA , told- TIME magazine . <p> Many consumers and nutrition experts are saying its about time the labels are updated . Michael Taylor , the FDAs deputy commissioner for foods told ABC News that , 20 years ago , " there was a big focus on fat , and fat undifferentiated. - The food environment has changed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this updated so what is iconic does n't  become a relic . " <p> The last notable change to food labels was the separation of trans fats from all fats in 2006 , due to consumer demand . <p> A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed 42 percent of working-age adults between 29 and 68 looked at food labels a majority of the time when shopping . Adults over the age of 68 are even more likely to look at the labels . <p> Though not much is known about the proposed changes to food labels , food experts are calling for a more prominently displayed number of calories , as well as the amount of added sugar and percentage of whole wheat in the food . The FDA has also suggested it may remove the " calories from fat " listing . <p> Another popular idea is changing the units used for nutrient amounts . Currently , they are listed in grams , a unit of the metric system that people are n't  immediately familiar with . <p> When it comes to serving size , health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , single-size serving packages like small bags of chips that are obviously intended to be eaten in one sitting will be marked as containing two or three servings . The FDA has said that it may add another column to the nutrition labels listing information per serving as well as per container . <p> Whatever the changes to food labels may be , were excited that they 're happening . Its about time labels are easier for consumers to understand . We also think its great the FDA wants to change the labels to reflect what consumers care about today , instead of what was popular 20 years ago . 10976 @qwx870976 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978 
@@98099908 @2299908/ 10971 @qwx870971 <p> The Thrive Diet is a weight loss diet that claims to help reduce stress by offering whole foods , which in turn promotes weight loss . Vegan and raw foods are only allowed and all information about it is offered in The Thrive Diet book . <p> Its intended to be used for a total of 12 weeks . However , adopting a vegan lifestyle is advised when one finished the total 12 weeks . There 's no limit on the amount of foods you can eat as long as they are from the accepted foods list . In reviewing many different weight loss diets our experts concluded the best solution was the 18Shake Diet . It offers both a meal replacement and diet pill made with natural ingredients and no stimulants . The benefits include appetite suppression for hours , increased metabolism , fat burning , improved mood and much more . Discover more information about the 18Shake Diet in the link provided here . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> The Thrive Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The types of foods one has to eat are all vegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy to introduce large amounts of vegetables , but its unknown if this diet will be easy for everyone to use . For those that have never tried a vegan diet this can be extremely restrictive . This is why its advised by the creator to slowly ease oneself into a vegan lifestyle . Its recommended to introduce some raw bars and more vegetables but to not completely follow each piece of advice . <p> Studies into what a raw vegan diet does to the body have shown possible side effects . One study featured in the Annals of Nutrition &amp; Metabolism found : <p> This is why its often required for vegans to supplement with extra vitamins and minerals . These kinds of nutrients are sometimes found in vegetables , but they 're often not enough or can not be digested properly . Yet another study by the University of Giessen showed that vegans have a risk for : <p> " cooking helps with the absorption of carotenoids such as beta-carotene and other nutrients " <p> The principles of The Thrive Diet are flawed , and the book provides no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective than other diets . This makes it a poor quality diet , as the claims made are not backed up by any reliable evidence . The registered dietician Janet Brill has commented on this diet by saying : <p> " the secret to good health and longevity lies not in a detox raw-food fad diet " <p> According to their analysis , though the added fruits and vegetables arehealthy , there are better ways to reduce stress and weight . No evidence is provided that The Thrive Diet would be a better approach to a vegan diet . Though it does allow for people to eat as much has they would like , it still can lead to serious nutritional deficiencies which can harm the body . <h> The Price and Quality of The Thrive Diet <p> The price depends on what grocery stores one goes to . However , there are many recommended foods such as hemp and pumpkin seed oil which can be very expensive . <p> One also might have to supplement in order to make up for the loss of vitamin b-12 , vitamin D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the price of having to spend money on fresh wholefoods even more . <h> Business of The Thrive Diet <p> The Thrive Diet was created by the former endurance athlete Brendan Brazier . He was most famous for creating the Vega brand which makes supplements and foods . He first created Thrive in 2007 . <p> He does not explain how he came up with this diet , nor does he have a background in nutrition or weight loss diets . He does offer cookbooks that help provide more insight into what can be eaten while on this diet . <h> Conclusion - Does The Thrive DietWork ? <p> The Thrive Diet is presented as a way to energize the body , support lean muscle growth , and aid in weight loss . Its possible to lose weight when one only eats a vegan raw food based diet . The issue is that this might not be a healthy strategy . Many clinical studies have confirmed the fact that vegans require extra supplementation with vitamins and minerals . Raw foods have also been dismissed as being unnecessary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also complained that there 's a lack of evidence for many of the claims .

There 's no official guide or book offered to help show what the diet requires , instead there 's general advice for lifestyle changes . <p> There are some simple suggestions offered for people to follow to help avoid any serious dieting changes . Though its called the Rachael Ray Diet , the idea behind this plan is to help people lose weight without strict adherence to a difficult dieting regiment . In reviewing many different kids of weight loss diets , our experts found that the 18Shake Diet provided the most effective results . This is due to its appetite suppressing meal replacement and its fat burning diet pill , both of which have no unwanted stimulants or preservatives.For more information about the 18Shake Diet , click on the link here . <h> Rachael Ray Diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or offered as there are no products one has to buy , nor is there a sample meal plan . The official Rachael Ray website does offer some recipes , but this is offered without any nutrition facts . There 's also no mention of portion sizes or how one should choose their meal planning schedule . <p> The outline for this plan is to follow the following principles : <p> Do n't  eat if you 're not truly hungry . Avoid eating out of boredom or because you want to indulge . <p> Never skipping any meals , making sure to get enough food to alleviate appetite . <p> Learning from mistakes by changing that which has not helped you in the past . There are no specific examples given as to what this might mean however . <p> Determining what would be an ideal body type for you . <p> Getting some form of exercise including moderate physical activity instead of not doing anything and sitting around . <p> Try to not eat much fast food , avoiding soda and instead replacing it with water , getting a sufficientamount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no ban on fast food or unhealthy foods , only a suggestion to make sure one is not consuming too much of these foods . <p> The idea behind the Rachael Ray Diet is to live as one normally does but with minor changes . While these suggestions are definitely healthy and can promote weight loss , its also very basic advice that is already well known . Its also not a guaranteed weight loss strategy , and results can vary wildly depending on will power . <p> These very common sense suggestions are n't  enough to truly promote sustained weight loss , as there is no support for those who find it hard to simply give up rich foods or who are n't  motivated enough . <p> Another suggestion is to instead of stepping on a scale to measure progress ; its advised to avoid this altogether . Monounsaturated fats are also recommended , which are found in full fat dairy , red meat , avocados , grapeseed oil , and macadamia nuts to name a few . There is no suggestion for what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information is given in a few sentences , and there 's no way to determine exactly how to select a healthy portion for foods . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> Rachael Ray Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The only suggestion for an ingredient is monounsaturated fats , which is a healthy fat when eaten in moderation . Its been shown to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular damage , though in excess it can also promote damage to the heart . <p> Other than that one suggestion for an ingredient , the other recommendations are based off of lifestyle changes . It does n't  ask users to stop eating certain foods , only to make sure to balance their diet and life with more wholesome options . The main principle is to practice self-control in all things . <h> The Price and Quality of Rachael Ray Diet <p> Since no book , guide , supplement , or pill is recommended , the only price one has to pay is on the foods one chooses to get . The diet does not enforce any strict rules , and one can even indulge in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described is not an effective quality weight loss plan . It does not offer enough to help secure weight loss results . <h> Business of Rachael Ray Diet <p> The creator Rachael Ray is a popular television cooking host , owner of a cookware brand , and she often makes recipes without enforcing any strict standards for measuring ingredients . <p> In being interviewed about her own weight loss , she revealed how there was a struggle to lose weight . By making simple lifestyle changes she 's been able to feel better and naturally lose weight . <p> She also insists that a regular diet would not work as its difficult to avoid hearty foods as a known celebrity cook . There is no actual resource or book for the Rachael Ray Diet , and instead the basic suggestions made are taken from interviews . <p> This is seen through the lack of an education in anything related to knowledge about nutrition and weight loss . Its also likely why the Rachael Ray Diet does not make any claims about benefits , nor does it provide any detailed evidence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this diet can be summarized in a few short sentences . <h> Customer Opinions of Rachael Ray Diet <p> " She is not an expert on ANYTHING to see people even listen to her is unbelievable . Are we THAT gullible ? " <p> " give me a break ! ! She cooks nothing but pasta , most things are fried/coated in bread . How can anyone lose weight eating like that " <p> The few users who commented on the diet mentioned how it does n't  make sense of how someone without a background in weight loss would give advice . People also had issues with the kinds of foods Rachael Ray likes to cook , since they 're often full of calories and are cooked in unhealthy ways . <p> There were also problems having to do with the basic common sense information that is spread . <h> Conclusion - Does Rachael Ray Diet Work ? <p> The Rachael Ray Diet is based off of simple principles which are known to be moderate approaches to weight loss . You can still eat and drink as you 'd like , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more healthy foods . Also , moderate exercise is advised instead of staying inactive through the day . There 's no other support offered and this is why there have been criticisms for these suggestions by users who have heard of this diet .

There 's not enough support offered by this diet to prove it would be a comprehensive weight loss solution . 10970 @qwx870970 <p> So many conflicting accounts that it is impossible to know what the truth is .

Eating all of that delicious food and constantly being on the go , you have to wonder how she looks so great .

The diet focuses on the inclusion of Monounsaturated Fats ( MUFAs ) at each meal- which means a healthy dose of the chef 's favorite E-V-O-O . After featuring the acai juice Monavie on her show , her name has become synonymous with the acai berry diet , although she does not endorse the supplements . <p> Eat food you love - just remember to do it in moderation ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pressure <p> An opportunity to create the perfect plan for you <p> CON <p> No organized , detailed program ( some people like that ) <p> Self-control is the key 10974 @qwx870974 <p> It 's your call .

@@98099912 @2299912/ <h> 5 Exercises You Love to Hate , but Should Do Anyway <p> There are three benefits to hiring a personal trainer . The first is accountability . Having someone waiting on you helps insure you get to the gym . The second is structure . We have enough to think about , letting someone else put together the workout is a huge time saver . The third is having someone who pushes you out of your comfort zone and makes you do the exercises you hate . <p> Even the most devoted exerciser has at least one exercise they love to hate . We hate it when we 're doing it , but we love the way we feel or look afterwards . I did an informal poll of my clients and came up with the five exercises they love to hate ( and why we should all do them anyway ) . <p> Burpees ( aka squat thrusts ) : I do n't  think one client likes burpees . I like them because they are efficient . If you want to get to your heart rate up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and quads ) then the burpee is the quickest way to do it . A burpee can also be modified for almost every fitness level . <p> Squats : I get groans every time I mention squats . That means there are a lot of groans because we do some form of a squat at every workout . Squats are a part of daily life ( think about every time you get up out of the chair ) . If you want to stay independent and function for your whole life squats need to be part of your workout routine . <p> Push ups : Push ups are hard . If they are easy you are probably doing them wrong . We tend to dislike things that of their difficulty and push us out of our comfort zone . But if you want amazing arms and shoulder , push ups are your secret weapon . <p> Planks : A client once said , I would rather do 1000 crunches than a plank . " I told her if she could do a thousand she was probably doing something wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably give you a sore neck and back . A plank , just one , is much more effective and much kinder to your spine . <p> Walking Lunges : As if the lunge was n't bad enough , try adding locomotion . Clients do n't love the burn in the moment , but they love how they shape their thighs and booty . Do them with an offload ( weight on only one side ) for an added core workout . <p> Did your love/hate relationship make the list ?

No matter how hard I focus on keeping my eyes up and my chin off my chest , I still feel my neck is getting more of a workout than my abs . <p> That 's why crunches do n't appear often in my ( or my clients ) workouts . I do n't  ignore the core however . It is the foundation of our body and functional movement . I just choose to train it other ways . <p> There are plenty of non-crunch techniques to help you develop your core . If you have low back issues or simply do n't want a pain in the neck , try one of these ways to build a strong and stable core . <p> 1 . Planks : I love ab holds and high planks , but they can get boring after awhile . Once a client can maintain an ab hold for 60 seconds , I move on to more challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , try one of these . <p> Stability ball plank : Place your forearms on a stability ball and toes on the ground . Hold for up to 90 seconds . <p> Plank slides : I love Valslides for core work ! Place one Valslide under each hand while in high plank position . Alternating pushing arms forward and back , about 6 inches away from your body , for 12 reps per side . <p> Body Saw : Take your plank to a new level by keeping your forearms on the ground but place your feet in suspension trainers that are hanging about 10 12 inches from the ground . Move forward and back for 10-15 repetitions . <p> 2 . Kettlebell Swings : Single arm or alternating arm swings engage your core more than double arm swings . The offload makes your body want to twist so you need to engage your core to keep that kettle bell moving right down the middle . The hinging movement can also help strengthen your low back " an often-overlooked element of your core . <p> 3 . Single Leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs , it 's also about stabilizing your core . My two favorite single leg moves are the single leg Romanian deadlift and the single leg bridge . The single leg Romanian deadlift is also a hinging movement , which means it can also be useful in strengthening the low back . The single leg bridge requires core stability to prevent rolling off to one side and makes a great single leg move for beginners . Both exercises also help youbuild a better backside . <p> 4 . Boxing : Punches come from your core and your hips , not your arms . Every jab and cross involves a twist , which works your obliques . You can learn basic boxing moves in quick workouts like Jillian Michaels Kickbox FastFix , one of my favorite DVDs . For extra resistance you can shadow box with dumbbells in your hands or with weighted gloves . Rounds of punching and kicking a bag are also a great way to get low impact but high intensity cardio . <p> 5 . Yoga : Of course planks work your core , but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good yoga teacher will also help you learn how to engage the right muscles and feel what good posture is . Learning how to brace your core will help you be an all around better exerciser and give you a better chance of remaining injury free .

Many forecasts have been made about- the food trends that are awaiting us next- year , and we are excited about so many of them ! - Over the past few years , we have seen food- items like cupcakes and cronuts , popsicles , sriracha , quinoa , and bacon rise to unprecedented levels of pop culture fandom , while- food-related conversations have hit on things- like locally-traded food , organic food , and- food trucks . <p> So what do we have to look forward- to noshing on in 2015 ? Let 's dig in ! <p> 1 . Liquid Revolution ! <p> According to McCormick Spice Company , 2015 will- bring somewhat of a liquid revolution .

She looked stunning when she was finally revealed during the live finale , but awe turned to shock when millions of viewers at home noticed her frail , skeletal frame . <p> " I knew it would come to this someday , just wish it had n't  , " was the comment from a trusted insider who attended the finale . For years people have wondered if the $250,000 prize money would push contestants too far . This is n't the first time a finalist has looked too thin on that scale ; but no one has ever looked as frighteningly emaciated as Rachel did tonight . <p> " Its so much worse in person , is n't it ? " I texted , following the shows ending . <p> My sentiments were the same as my insiders . Rachels final weigh-in put her at 105 pounds . That 's not how much she lost , that 's her current weight , a 60% total weight loss off of a starting weight of 260 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest in show history , absolutely secured her win . <p> How do you celebrate that , though ? There is nothing that resembles healthy , inspiring , or motivating about what Rachel , and NBC , did tonight . I feel bad for Rachel , really . She wanted the prize , the glory , and that one last taste of success and so she undoubtedly did whatever was necessary . She worked so hard all season ; she had one of the most impressive runs in show history as she dominated the competition and won every challenge they put in front of her . She was an athlete . During the last five months we 've watched her become one again . <p> There was nothing athletic about the waif-thin appearance of Rachel tonight . <p> Even Jillian Michaels face looked dumbfounded hopefully she was as sad to see how far Rachel had taken it , too . <p> " Rachel is a beautiful girl , but my heart broke when I saw her tonight , " said Abra Pappa of NutritiousAmerica.com in an email , echoing sentiments heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obvious weight loss , Rachel shows signs of being underweight or even malnourished , noting the lines around her mouth and seemingly dehydrated skin as facial diagnostic cues . <p> I 've championed this show for years .

I know a lot about this show , the inner workings , the production , the logistics I know a lot of people , they talk , and I keep their confidences . Based on all of that , and 11 seasons of viewing history , I believe in what NBC is doing with Biggest Loser . I 've seen for myself the changes it can make for a morbidly obese society . And while its not 100% Kosher all the time , I put my trust in the band of medical experts who sit inches off camera , at all times . After all , this is not reality , this is a TV show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your average Joe at home can not . <p> That 's where it gets more dangerous though . Those average Joes at home rarely know how many calories a day they 're supposed to consume , much less that working out hours on end and not eating enough can actually have the opposite effect of what they 're striving for . <p> People in this country are sick . They 're actually killing themselves with food , and they turn to this show because , frankly , its the cheapest and easiest way to access the information . That information comes with a heavy-handed dose of marketing and smoke and mirrors , and we , mostly , all know that . Its wrong and irresponsible of NBC to have allowed Rachel to go so far , to have not given her total support at home .

@@98099922 @2299922/ <h> Top 10 Biggest Loser Behind the Scenes Questions Answered <p> We asked our very own Bernie Salazar to take us behind the scenes at the Biggest Loser Ranch . With the sixth season just days away , weve all accumulated a few curiosities about what its like on the other side of the camera , before the producers grab ahold of the tapes . Here are Bernies answers to your Top 10 questions . 1 . How much time do the contestants actually get to share with the trainers ? Is it one hour a day just for the show or are they around during the ins and outs of daily life at the Biggest Loser Ranch ? <p> The trainers are constantly around , they are not there solely for shoot days . The amazing part of the whole Biggest Loser experience is that the trainers are there all the time , they truly take time to care for not only our physical well being but also our mental and emotional health as well . <p> 2 . I want to know how much of the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach the contestants to help make good TV ? <p> There were absoulutely no writers scripting anything ! From what I observed there was no need to . There are hundreds of hours of the contestents interactions caught on camera , what you see is pretty much what you get . <p> 3 . Do contestants receive any sort of payment or stipend for their time on Biggest Loser ? <p> Contestants are provided with a stipend to assist with there personal finances , however this was a welcome surprise as most of us went on the show to gain back our health , not receive payment . <p> 4 . Where and how do you get the new , fitting clothes ? As they slim down , how does that play into the contestants wardrobes , since I assume with them being on the ranch full time there are no shopping trips ? <p> There is a wardrobe department that constantly outfits us they make sure that we have the necessary clothes not only to workout in , but also for the challenges . The stylist are wonderful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we achieve our weight loss goals . <p> 5 . I 'm curious about the general dynamics of the house . It seems like everyone gets along but do they just sit around and chit chat or do the workouts , the Q&amp;A with producers , the challenges , the eating and sleeping and the general pressures of being in the house keep everyone from spending much real " time " together ? <p> The working out , Q&amp;A , challenges , eating and sleeping do in fact take up a great deal of the contestants time ; however , there is time at the end of the day , before and after challenges , and during meal time where we all get a chance to speak and bond . Depending on how long you are on the show , the time spent together can be quite significant . We truly do have a lot of time to bond and get to know one another . <p> 6 . What happens if you have a real issue with your trainer or vice versa ( as we 've seen hints of in previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and house dymamic(s) ? <p> I did n't  have any real experience with this particular situation , however I 'm sure that would greatly effect the team and house dynamics . Both trainers and producers are very accommodating and do as much as possible to ensure that contestants are as content as possible during their time on the show . <p> 7 . How much downtime do the contestants have , and what are they doing in their downtime ? Do you ever just get to hang out and watch movies with Bob and Jillian ? <p> jillian michaels <p> DOWN TIME , What 's that ? Every once in a while contestants do have a couple moments to themselves ; however , I spent my time either resting or reflecting on my goals and my overall well being . <p> 8 . There was a trainer named Kim Lyons . She had a falling out and actually behaved quite childishly with one of the contestants , never apologizing or even listening to the contestant ( who tried to make things right ) without interrupting and getting defensive . She seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the show ? Did the producers , casting people , etc. really think that a fake blonde was gon na do it for us ? <p> I do n't  feel I can answer this question as I had no experience meeting or working with Kim . I 'm sure the producers of the show had their reasons for not opting to not have Kim continue on as a trainer on the show . <p> 9 . What day of the week do you actually weigh-in ? What time ? Do they take into account weight of clothing ? Do you know your weight prior to the ceremony ? <p> The producers of the show workout the details of the weigh-ins , I 'm sure they take into account every aspect of the weigh-in process . Never are contestants provided with their weights prior to the weigh-in , confidentiality on the parts of producers and crew is strictly enforced . <p> 10 . What is something " Behind the Scenes " we did n't  ask , that you think would be fun or interesting to know ? <p> Contestants are responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepares us for the real world . Contestants also are responsible for taking care of their own laundry and room cleaning , it is as true to real life as possible . <p> What about the food ? Do the contestants give the producers grocery lists or do you have to choose from what they have ? How fully stocked is the kitchen ? How many times do the contestants eat a day ? Five small meals or what ? <p> the word on th streets from some vast off contestants is that each player is reqd to work out in the gym for an average of 8 hours everyday . The only exceptions are challenges . Consenus was 8-12 hours a day in the gym was the average . As for meal preparation , apparenlty there was n't much choice . Pandtry was stuffed with healthy food which they were required to use . <p> The production crew went grocery shopping for the household basics and anything requested specifically was put on a grocery list for them to purchase . We had a great gal who kept up on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meats and dairy . The kitchen had the basics of every kitchen and I guess you could say it was fully stocked . Everyone ate on their own schedule but often we found ourselves eating meals together because it was quicker to cook for the whole group . Each player has a set amount of calories specified for them individually . But on average , the women eat 1200 calories per day and the men eat 1800 calories a day . While we worked out the majority of our time , we balanced out our meals and snacks accordingly . There were plenty of choices when it came to meal preparation and although I personally stuck with a pretty simple meal plan , I always had options when I needed to mix it up . Our pantry was stocked with healthy , mostly organic foods . Its up to everyone to maintain their food while on the ranch we cooked and cleaned for ourselves . Learning to prepare our meals was part of the learning process . <p> I was wondering about the extra skin . When losing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? Do you have surgery ? Shouldnt that be part of the weigh in during the final ? How do they pay for that , does the show ? ? 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

The shakes do not taste great and the bars are horrible ! I have n't tried the soups yet , I do n't even like tomato , so I hope they are better than the shakes and bars . I have younger kids so it was hard to make them their meals because they can eat regular food . I 'm already feeling the craving for something real ! ! I know I need this and I 'm willing to see how it works , just gon na need some motivation <h> Answers to this Question <p> Gary Paquette <p> First off , I am a 59 year-old male . My goal is to lose 110 pounds . I am on a modified fast plan , 3 shakes + one light meal . I am in a hospital controlled program and have the weekly group sessions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , get measured every 8 weeks and meet with an exercise physiologist monthly . Most of the posts on this site seem to be newbies so I feel a little like a veteran . I am just finishing up week 8 and I 'm on a 20 week program . Pre-fast , I had high blood pressure , sleep apnea , gastric reflux high cholesterol , and my blood sugar was high but not yet treatable . So far , I 've lost 39 pounds , none of my clothes fit anymore , even those that were way too small 8 weeks ago , my reflux is gone , my diastolic pressure is down 20mm , and I feel great . I do n't know what my cholesterol or sugar levels are but I 'll find out in 2 weeks . I also do n't know if my apnea is improved as I use a CPAP machine but I 'm looking forward to meeting with my pulmonologist in June . My hunger level was about an 8 out of 10 during weeks 1-2 . Went down to around 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at around 2 out of 10 ever since . I feel great and I 'm getting all the positive reinforcement that I need . These are my opinions of the " products " : The ready mixed shakes are convenient but they weigh a ton . Why pay for water ? I use the powdered shakes . The vanilla is too sweet for me and the flavor is not remarkable . The strawberry is tolerable but not my favorite . I love the chocolate shakes . I find the chocolate bars to be dreadful . The peanut butter and berry bars are not bad but I only use them when I do n't have time to make a shake . I never make the shakes with water . I usually use diet soda and a lot of ice . Root beer , cola , and cream soda go well with chocolate shakes . My favorite is root beer + chocolate . Tastes like a black cow . The strawberry shakes go well with Fresca , Squirt , and 7-Up . Try adding enhancers like extracts ( vanilla , almond ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make chocolate shakes but I 'm not a big fan of mocha . I 'm told that the tomato soup is pretty good but I have n't tried it yet . The chicken soup is very bland but if you add a sodium-free chicken bullion cube it 's more palatable and makes a decent lunch up here in frozen New England . It is essential that you use a conventional blender to mix the shakes . A battery-powered stick blender will probably leave some lumps . Good luck . <p> posted on Dec 29th , 2011 1:42 pm <p> Mary <p> It really does get better . It takes awhile to get over " missing " food . Once you ( and your taste buds ) realize that eating is for fuel and nutrition , not pure pleasure , you will feel better about it . Will it ever taste better ? ? ? Probably not , but the results will make up for it . Keep up the good work . You are worth it . <p> posted on Dec 30th , 2011 6:25 pm <p> autumnk <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shakes are getting better but I can not do the bars ! I was a little upset about only losing 2.4 lbs .

I hope these tips help ! <p> posted on Feb 12th , 2012 11:20 am <p> Ocean <p> I use the chocolate RTDs and chocolate Optifast bars .

POM takes pomegranates very seriously . From their fresh juices to their capsules , POM is the only pomegranate juice company that is backed by $25 million dollars in medical research . While many products claim to be 100% pure pomegranate juice , POM truly is , and they claim that many of their competitor 's products are filled with additives like sugar , colorants and other juices . <p> POM offers a range of products from juice and teas , to capsules and pills . <p> Pomegranates and their juice have a substantial amount of antioxidants , 2-to-3 times as much as red wine or green tea , and more than blueberries and cranberries .

@@98099930 @2299930/ <p> There are mixed reviews about the recent approval of lorcaserin ( Belviq ) and its new availability as a prescription weight loss drug . Obesity has become an epidemic in the United States and across the world and the maker of lorcaserin , Arena Pharmaceuticals , will market this drug as a supplement to drug and exercise to help patients reach their weight loss goals faster . Every drug has side effects and I felt it was important to look closer at some of the possible reactions . <p> Lorcaserin activates the serotonin 2C receptor which helps you eat less and feel full sooner . Previous weight loss drugs activated the 2B receptor and caused damage to heart valves.Cardiovascular health will be monitored once this hits the market to ensure no damage to the heart valves occur , as there were concerns about this in trials . In October 2010 , lorcaserin was rejected by the FDA due to a cancer signal being detected .

The drug should be discontinued if the patient does not lose at least five percent of their body weight in the first twelve weeks . <p> Now , because this medication has an effect on serotonin I would put a HUGE warning on this when used with antidepressants ( Paxil , Lexapro , Zoloft , Cymbalta , Effexor ) and pain medications like tramadol . Serotonin syndrome can result in seizures . <p> Belviq also could possibly effect memory and affection attention levels .

There is no recommendation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects but it might be a reasonable thing to consider and ask your doctor about . <p> The most common side effects of Belviq in non-diabetic patients are headache , dizziness , fatigue , nausea , dry mouth , and constipation ; in diabetic patients there is low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) , headache , back pain , cough , and fatigue . Belviq should also be avoided during pregnancy and is not recommended for children under 18 at this time . <p> The good news is that the drug company has to conduct six long-term post-market studies , which means they will be looking at the drugs effects after its on the market . Many drugs , like Vioxx and Bextra , are pulled off the market when damaging information surfaces because of post-market studies like this . Though I 'd like to believe that the side effects will make people more hesitant to try Belviq , I know better .

The foods offered are calorie and portion controlled in order to provide a low amount of calories for weight loss . <p> Exercise and personal accountability are advised for results , and there 's also support via in person meetings at clinics , or even at home . Coaches are also available on the phone to **25;215;TOOLONG plans and nutrition support . The plans offered are said to be clinically proven for weight loss . Our experts have reviewed several different diet plans and have concluded the most effective is the 18Shake Diet . It offers anappetitesuppressing meal replacement and a fat burning diet pill . Both are made with natural ingredients and no added fillers , binders , or cheap additives . More information about the 18Shake Diet can be seen when you click the link here . <p> " widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil:Soybean extract which is treated in a way that retains its shelf life . Its also a form of trans fats . This can lead to cardiovascular issues and obesity . <p> There are 3 different plans offered for the HMR Diet : <p> Decision-Free : Only offered in official clinics with medical supervision and coaching . You are allowed 500 to 800 calories only . <p> Healthy Solutions : This can be done at home or at an official clinic . There are 1,200 calories to 1,400 calories offered . <p> Healthy Shakes : Only available at home with 1,400 calories a day . There is no need for medical supervision , thousand you are taught to make decision on your own . <p> Its unknown what kind of background the people have in the clinic , whether it isnutritionists or actual doctors . Reducing calories from 1,400 calories to as low as 500 can be extremely dangerous if one does not have legitimate medical support . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> HMR Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The company does mention the ingredients for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full macronutrient and micronutrient yield . This makes it impossible to determine if they use high fats , sugars , carbohydrates , or other important macro and micronutrients . <p> There is also the heavy use of many different thickeners , artificial ingredients , and sweeteners . These kinds of additives have shown the possibility for causing many unwanted side effects . Some of which can actually make weight loss more difficult . <h> The Price and Quality of HMR Diet <p> No prices are listed anywhere . In order to learn more one has to provide personal information or meet up with an official seller of theseproducts . <p> There have been some customers online which mention a three week starter kit costs $265 , and meals average for $3.65 per serving . The clinic visits are upwards up to $1,900 for a month long plan . Without seeing official prices however its unknown what the standard price is . <p> Customers will be paying much more than they would be if they were to cook their own wholesome meals at home . The clinical support is offered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from certified medical or nutrition experts . <p> Many of the ingredients added to their foods are often found in many other processed meals . There is no information about the nutrition fats list , so one can not determine the overall quality . Due to the cheap ingredients , its clear that the main focus of the plan is to provide low calorie , yet cheap to process foods . <h> Customer Opinions of HMR Diet <p> There are a few noteworthy customer reviews available online , here 's what some had to say : <p> " There were side effects- I lost some of my hair , and I had difficulty with constipation " <p> " HAIR LOSS is due to a lack of protein " <p> " I hate the food and shakes " <p> " I was not happy at all with the HMR program , I too , lost muscle strength " <p> The most common complaints were about the flavors and overall quality of the food .

While there were those who did in fact lose weight , there was also concern about not feeling satiated . <h> Conclusion - Does HMR DietWork ? <p> The HMR Diet offers either just pre-packaged meals , or the same meals alongside support in a clinic . There are extreme calorie deficits one must follow , and three different solutions for weight loss are offered . While reducing calories significantly can produce weight loss results , its also one of the hardest ways to do so without any sufficient support . Many users of this diet have mentioned how its expensive and that the foods are not easy to eat . There were also issues with people concerned about the use of many cheap additives and the high use of sugars . The price is also high , as one can expect to pay much more than if one were to make their own foods at home with better ingredients . 10970 @qwx870970 <p> ( Page 1 of 2 , 26 total comments ) <p> Sara <p> - <p> I did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose weight . But I would not recommend this program . I went for medical monitoring and that was a straight up joke . They took my BP and told me to drink water . Useless but , I had to be there an hour early each week for it and it was first come , first serve . Losing weight actually caused a serious problem with my cholesterol going up and they literally could care less . The medical people here are a joke . I left my first program after I had been on it for a month and someone on the message board told me I was supposed to be getting a potassium supplement because the shake I was taking did n't have any . Medical people ... oh yeh .. forgot about that . <p> So the classes must be better right ? No . They never had any answers about anything . Lots of demands but no answers . I finally left the program after I spent a night at an overcrowded class with someone beside me who had a terrible cold ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of their draconian rules about attending . <p> Did I keep the 60 lbs off ? Nope . You can not , can not , continue eating HMR food in the real world . Life will eventually intervene and even if you do the maintenance .. that is premised on going from a Very Low calorie plan to a low calorie plan . You suppress your metabolism and then you gain weight fast if you go off even for a small time . <p> HMR has people to this day on the site as " success stories " that are not . They have gained it all back . There were many people in my classes that were here for the second or third time . <p> I also left after I was losing my pay due to government shut down . I would be getting zero money for an indefinite period . I told them that and they were beyond cold about it .

Wayyyyy back in the early 1980 's ( +/- a tad ) I was part of a PILOT PROGRAM that was administered by a PHYSICIAN at a hospital where I worked . Back then there were no " ready to eat " - " ready to prepare " HMR FOOD PRODUCTS . ALL we had was the " POWDERED MIX " that included various flavors and MANY Vitamins . Minerals and OTHER combinations necessary to SUSTAIN A HEALTHY LEVEL OF NUTRITION . It was a MEDICALLY SUPERVISED ' FAST ' ! NO FOOD of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PHYSICIAN 'S OFFICE ( none of this " at home crap " ) EVERY WEEK . We reported -for lack of a better term - and WE WEIGHED IN ( privately - not in front of the other " fasting folks " . We had BLOOD DRAWN at REGULAR INTERVALS ( two weeks apart as I recall ) to make CERTAIN our overall HEALTH was NOT being risked by the " FAST " ! We " exercised " - which for MOST of us simply included WALKING EACH MORNING and EVENING at OUR DISCRETION . The MORE we walked the better off we were ; walking BURNS CALORIES - period ! <p> I went from a massive 305 POUNDS all the way DOWN to 175 POUNDS even though at 175 POUNDS I looked like an emaciated mouse !

Over TIME the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a FAT GUY - GONE SLIM .

I SWEAR ON ALL THAT IS MEANINGFUL that I MAINTAINED the 190 POUNDS right up to the DAY I REINTRODUCED " BREAD " ( I love a good sandwich ) into the DIET ! I STRESS ----- BREAD WAS A BIG MISTAKE !

It is edible if you bake it in the oven but it gets old fast 3 ) the food has little flavor other then when they drench it in tomato sauce or bbq sauce . 4 ) if you are on the at home program and you ask them to put your order delivery on hold for a couple weeks they will drop you from your weekly meetings .

Now , the decision-free version is either 5 shakes / day or 8/lactose free shakes a day but they do encourage you to eat the entrees , the cereal , or the soup as a shake substitute as often as you need or want to .

Just be aware that it really is n't for everyone . <p> Oh and for those wondering about cost , it is way more expensive than it initially seems . Shakes are 40$/ box of 18 . If you 're on the 8 a day plan , do the math . Entrees 3.50 .

@@98099936 @2299936/ <h> The Hottest Fitness Trends to Rock Your Body in 2015 <p> Each year the American College of Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) surveys its membership of fitness professionals ( myself included ) to identify the top trends in fitness . The 2015 list was recently published with , in my opinion , only a few surprises . <p> What did surprise me on this list ? Outdoor activities are #12 ! I see and hear a lot about running in fitness circles , but not much else . Most popular classes and activities take place in some sort of gym , be it a commercial one or the budget home gym you created in the spare bedroom . I would love to see more people get off the spin bike and on the bike path . Hiking is a new love of mine and , unlike the treadmill , it does wonders for your body and soul . Boot camps are last on the ACSM list at #20 . They are still- very popular in the Midwest so I am curious what group fitness trend will be taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Agree or disagree , here are five " big " fitness trends you can look forward to in the coming year . <p> 1 . Body weight training and High Intensity Interval Training came in #1 and #2 , respectively , on the ACSM list . This worries me for two reasons . One , the high rate of injury that goes along with beginners starting at too high of intensity as well as over-training , and two , the level of burnout that often follows . I think body weight exercises are great . They can be some of the most challenging exercises you can do , but if proper form is n't developed before adding the explosive intensity of popular programs like Insanity or P90Xyou may be asking for trouble . <p> Trend tip : Perfect your form on squats , push-ups and other body weight exercises slowly before adding weight or plyometrics . <p> 2 . Exercise and weight loss . I always tell my clients you ca n't out train a bad diet . I also tell them you ca n't diet your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACSM list . It shows that more people want the whole package , not just the promise of pounds lost . Manycommercial weight loss programsare about calorie restriction only . They may tell you to exercise but they do not provide a program to help you do it . Without exercise , especially strength training , you lose muscle , which leads to a slower metabolism . The weight loss becomes harder to maintain and the vicious cycle begins . <p> Trend tip : Before signing up for a boot camp ask if nutritional counseling is included . Before investing in a weight loss program ask if both diet and exercise will be covered . <p> 3 . Fitness programs geared toward older adults . With 43.1 million people in the United States over age 65 , #8 on the ACSM list should come as no surprise to anyone . But what does it mean ? I recently saw a story about a woman in her 70s dead-lifting twice her weight and a man who did n't start running marathons until his 70s . On the other hand , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting up off the floor or climbing stairs . The big take away is to not judge a book by its cover and to keep offering programs that promote functional fitness ( trend #9 on ACSM list ) for all ages and fitness levels . <p> Trend tip : If you find yourself having challenges with activities of daily living , like going up stairs or keeping your balance , start a fitness program NOW . The most common reason adults end up in nursing homes is some type of challenge with activities of daily living , like walking or bathing . Regular exercise can help keep muscles strong and promote balance and mobility . <p> 4 . Yoga is HOT right now , moving up to #7 on the ACSM list . While some traditional yogis may look down on hot yoga , it has introduced the practice to many newcomers . I say anything that gets you moving is great . Whatever version of yoga works for you go for it ! <p> Trend tip : If you 're an introvert like me , yoga class may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series to learn at your own pace in the comfort of your living room . <p> 5 . Wellness coaching and work-site wellness . A recently released survey from Kaiser Family Foundation found that 98 percent of large employers have at least one workplace wellness program . This is encouraging , but it does n't tell the whole story . Offerings and participation vary widely and results are hard to quantify . The biggest obstacle from making these trends truly effective is workplaces themselves . Offering onsite Weight Watchers meetings does n't make sense if you sabotage your employees with donuts at the staff meetings . It 's great to get a discount at the gym , but 10-hour workdays make it hard to actually get there . Workplaces need to walk the walk and create environments that promote wellness . <p> Pamela Hernandez owns Thrive Personal Fitness in Springfield , MO where she focuses on weight training for weight loss .

While it can make you look and feel like a million bucks , healthy eating and intense exercise can bring about side effects that are less than comfortable and less than glamorous . If you are an avid runner , you may be familiar with digestional cramping brought on by exercise . Gas , bloating and cramping can be made worse by what you eat before you set out for your workout .

Green bananas are tough to digest , but ripe , soft bananas are perfect . <p> Hard boiled eggs Eggs have a reputation for causing gas , but this is n't the only reason they are n't  a good pre-workout snack . Hard boiled eggs have no carbohydrates , which is the fuel your body needs to perform at its best .

@@98099940 @2299940/ <h> Every Runner Should be Foam Rolling : 5 Moves to Help You Get Started <p> Foam rolling is one of those activities that every runner hears they should be doing . We know it 's important , but we are n't exactly sure why , how to do it , or when to do it . When done correctly , it 's a highly effective tool for recovery and will increase performance . <p> What the Heck is Foam Rolling , Anyway ? <p> Foam rolling is a self-myofascial technique that breaks up adhesions and scar tissue that accumulates within our muscles during exercise and daily activities . Steph Creaturo , co-owner of Mala Yogain Brooklyn , NY , teaches a yoga class specifically for runners that incorporates rolling with foam rollers , golf balls , and tennis balls . She equates a foam roller to a Zamboni machine for your muscles . Foam rolling helps to smooth out the rough patches , promoting better blood flow to the muscle , which reduces soreness and increases performance . <p> In a study published by Medicine &amp; Science in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs after a squat workout helped speed recovery . The subjects who foam rolled were less sore overall , muscle soreness peaked earlier , and they performed better in vertical leap , range of motion , and muscle contraction tests . Adding foam rolling into your daily routine will help make you a more nimble runner . <p> How Do I Get My Foam Roll On ? <p> Foam rolling can be done pre- and post-workout . Spend 30 seconds to 1 minute on each movement . Remember to breathe and take it slow . When you hit a particularly tight area , stay there for an extra breath and allow the muscle to sink into the roller . This is the key part to self-myofascial release . Applying pressure to a tight spot or a knot sends a signal to the muscle telling it to relax . Give your body and muscles time to make that connection . <p> Remember the Zamboni example : it moves slowly and purposefully over the ice to create a smooth surface . On recovery days , spend more time ( 2-3 minutes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flexion and extension ) . <p> Piriformis <p> Your piriformis is a narrow muscle that lies underneath the larger glutes in your butt . This muscle helps you run and rotate your hip . Start by sitting on top of the foam roller with the roll positioned on the back of the hip . Cross one foot to the opposite knee and lean into the hip of the crossed leg . Slowly roll on the posterior hip area to find the tender spot . Hold the spot for a few deep breaths . <p> IT Band <p> Lie on your side with the foam roller perpendicular to your body and below your hip . Bring the top leg in front of you and use it as leverage . Place your hands on the other side of the foam roller . Slowly begin to roll the foam roller down your leg , stopping just above the kneecap . As the roller moves down your leg , stop every 1-2 inches and rock your hips forward and backwards over the foam roller to release tension . Be gentle and breathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roller positioned at your hip , where the quads attach . Begin to slowly roll down your leg . Stop every 1-2 inches and move your leg left to right . Roll down another inch and repeat . Stop just below the kneecap ( about 1 inch above ) . Rocking the body from left to right helps break up any knots that form while exercising . As a bonus , instead of moving side to side , bend your knee every 1-2 inches as you move down your quad ( or when you hit a tight spot ) . <p> Hamstrings <p> Sit at one end of the roller with the other leg off the side supporting you . Start where your hamstrings attach to your gluteus maximus and slowly roll down your leg . Stop before you hit the back of your knee . When you get to a particular tight spot , stay an extra few breaths and try to sink into the foam roller a bit more . <p> Calves <p> These muscles ( the soleus and the gastrocnemius ) are the muscles that help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you faster , especially up hills ! Start with the roller under your calf and closer to your knee . Either cross the other leg over the bottom leg ( this provides more pressure on the calf you are foam rolling ) or keep it off to the side . Slowly roll down to your ankle . Stop at any sore or tight areas and turn your foot left and right , which ensures that you hit all sides of the gastrocnemius . Point and flex your foot on any tight areas . <p> Hot Bird Running promotes long-term wellness and fitness through running . We empower people to discover their inner athlete and love running as a means to become healthier .

A daily multivitamin and fish-oil supplement are also encouraged . <p> EXERCISE <p> You should exercise at least three days a week while on the Freshology program , but there are no specific guidelines for a fitness regimen . <p> CONCLUSION <p> If you want to eat and get trim like Hollywood 's celebrities , then Freshology , a meal delivery program that features low-calorie , portion-controlled meals , is one way to accomplish slimming down after a pregnancy or dropping a few pounds for bikini season . A bevy stars endorse the program , including Katy Perry and Pink , as well as having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison to competitive brands , Freshology does n't live up to the promises of fresh foods , as they deliver the same pre-made frozen meals as everyone else .

The long-term cost and its lack of instruction for teaching you how to prepare your own healthy meals are two main drawbacks . But the meals themselves are flavorful , feature seemingly quality ingredients , and can be satisfying if weight loss is your goal . 10978 @qwx870978

Meals to Live frozen entrees want to change that perception with meals targeted specifically at diabetics who lead an active lifestyle and may not always have time to cook a fresh meal . <p> Based out of Dallas , Texas , Meals to Live boasts a team of nutrition experts and chefs that help to tailor their frozen entrees to provide nutritional value while still having a fulfilling taste . Currently there are eight frozen flavors available ranging from a White Chicken Burrito , to Turkey Meatballs to a Spinach Omelet as a breakfast option . They also market a pixie-stick like powder called Glucose Quick Sticks . They come in Sour Apple and Watermelon flavor and can be used to prevent low sugar episodes . <p> Meals to Live is currently available at over 1,100 stores with local retailers like Walgreens , Meijer and Kroger in twelve states . Their website has a store locator option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to request this product in your area there is a form available to give to your local retailer . Amazon.com also sells the Meals to Live products on their website . <p> You should not have to sacrifice taste for nutrition and Meals to Live exceeded my expectations for a frozen dinner. - All the important nutritional facts are displayed on the front of the box as well as the amount of carb choices the particular meal contains . Carb choice scores range from 0 to 5 in one-half increments where zero is 0-5 grams of carbohydrates and 5 is 71-80 grams per serving . The idea behind carb choices is to encourage diabetics to choose lower numbers to keep their overall carbohydrates for the day at less than 130 . <p> The portions were great , and I was very surprised at how much food was given for the amount of calories . The portion sizes were adequate and if I added a piece of fruit would be an overall well-balanced meal . For example , their Grilled White Chicken was only 200 calories but had 14 grams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans that are seasoned and delicious . <p> My biggest concern with any frozen meal is the sodium . Diabetics usually have high blood pressure and their medications may cause them to retain water so any extra sodium needs to be tightly monitored . The sodium for all Meals to Live meals is under 500 mg which is fantastic compared to other frozen meals . Diabetics should be having less than 2,000 mg of sodium per day . They also contain fiber which is believed to help better control blood sugar and the combination of protein and fiber help people feel fuller longer . <p> I would not recommend someone eat Meals to Live frozen entrees three times a day as a part of their meal plan , but the occasional quick meal is fine . I work 12 hours days and sometimes do not have time to cook for both my lunch and dinner . This would be a great choice for one of those meals that I would n't feel guilty about . I would recommend these as a quick option over fast food or other frozen meal options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meals to Live product to review , it in no way influenced her review . <p> Dr. Sarah Khan is a graduate of Albany College of Pharmacy and a retail pharmacist .

Its not often you get access to an intimate Q&amp;A session with their top specialty pros . <p> Surprisingly , I am new to the world of seafood as I was clinging to my childhood repulsion of fish for a few too many years . Thankfully though , I have learned better and am paving the road to changing my ways .

Eating a variety of whole , unprocessed fruits and vegetables will not only help you meet your weight loss goals , it will protect your overall health as well . Not convinced ? Courtney McCormick , Corporate Dietitian at Nutrisystem gives 10 more reasons to eat these colorful , flavorful foods . <p> Low-Fat Protein Yes , protein . We tend to classify vegetables and fruits as carbohydrates , but they also contain amino acids , the building blocks of protein . A cup of broccoli , for instance , has 2.57 grams of protein and an avocado has 4 grams . Even fruits help supply the 15 to 20 percent of total calories from protein that you need each day . Blackberries and kiwis , for example , each have 2 grams of protein per cup . <p> Nutrient DensityA helpful way to think about your food choices is nutrient density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories . Fruits and vegetables top the list of most nutrient-dense foods because they 're packed with the healthiest compounds , but very low in calories . You get more bang for your buck from eating produce because you get more nutrition in every bite than with almost every- other type of food . <p> Disease DefensePeople who eat a diet rich in vegetables and fruits reduce their risk of heart disease , stroke , hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , some types of cancer , and digestive problems , and are less likely to suffer from diabetes and other blood sugar disorders , according to the National Institutes of Health .

The book opens with an overview of the program and then teaches you how to understand your metabolism before it goes into the changes that are needed .

The first step is known as the basics . This is similar to a spring cleaning for your body . This step lasts eight weeks and involves a low carb period to rest your overworked pancreas and liver while shrinking fat cells . During this period you cut most carbohydrates from your diet . It is important to remember that you are only taking these carbohydrates out temporarily to help your blood sugar run smoothly . The book does warn that the first three days of this stage will be rough . During this time you can eat whenever you are hungry as long as you are consuming normal portion sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat include lean protein , vegetables and healthy fats . There is a complete list of approved foods for this stage within the book . <p> Step two allows you to transition healthy carbs back into your diet . This stage can last eight weeks or longer depending on how much weight you want to lose . You will be reintroducing healthy carbs in the proper amounts to promote fat burning and weight loss . This will help gently restart your pancreas and liver . During this stage you are asked to take body measurements and a weight measurement once per month . You will slowly add low-impact carb foods to the foods you ate in step one . You are carefully instructed on how to reintroduce carbs into your diet and what time of day to eat them . This careful guidance keeps you from adding carbs too rapidly and helps you avoid rapid weight gain . There is no time limit for step two so you can stay on it until you reach your goal weight . In this stage , you limit your net carbs to between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program deals with keeping the weight off for a lifetime . This step will open your diet to more carbohydrates while it also helps keep your health and energy levels in shape . You start this stage after you have reached your goal weight . In this stage your daily allotted carbs consists of 30 to 35 percent of your total calories . In addition to these stages , there are some general food rules listed below . <p> Drink 64 ounces of water each day <p> Do n't go more than five hours without a meal or snack <p> Take the recommended daily vitamins and supplements <p> Choose sweeteners carefully ; sucralose is recommended <p> Read food labels to determine carbohydrate content <p> Consider drinking green tea daily <p> Increase physical activity to at least 30 minutes five times per week <p> Eat allowed foods liberally , but not excessively <p> Take a few minutes each day to relax <p> Think positive ; reflect on your accomplishments each morning <p> EXERCISE <p> Exercise with The Metabolism Miracle is called the critical link .

Its unknown if either of these techniques are safe and effective . <p> Certain people who are allergic to corn ca n't eat this food . There is also a precaution to look out for unpopped kernels , which can chip teeth if one is not careful . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> Popcorn Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> The general idea is to eat lean protein , fruits and vegetables for a standard meal . Then itsadvised to replace one whole meal a day for an undetermined time with just popcorn . No added fatty oils or butter is allowed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popcorn is a healthy food , its more of a snack and not well-rounded enough in nutrients to truly help provide sustenance . It can also become boring to have to eat the same food for a full meal .

There 's not enough variety in this diet plan to help with weight loss . Also , there are many lacking details and support . <p> A potential issue may arise if one were to use microwaved popcorn . This can cost more money than buying kernels in bulk and cooking them on ones stovetop . There can also be hidden amounts of oils in the microwaved popcorn batches . This would require one to read every label to make sure it does not have these kinds of additives which are not allowed . <h> Business of Popcorn Diet <p> Its unclear who created this diet , and multiple website offers free information but very little clears details . There are many unanswered questions , and no clinical studies are provided to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diets , it fails to provide any reliable support and the origins of it are unknown . This makes it impossible to determine whether or not it was created with real science in mind . <p> There 's nothing in popcorn that makes it any more nutritious than other foods . It is low in calories and high in fiber , but its lacking in many other nutrients . Much like other similar diets , there is an odd suggestion of eating just one food source and there 's no support to back it up . <h> Customer Opinions of Popcorn Diet <p> There are very few people online who have tried this diet . Here are some reviews from the very few users who exist : <p> " I noticed that I am really tired and have no energy from eating all this " <p> " My friends told me I looked anorexic and were a little worried about me " <p> " there are hardly any nutrients in this diet " <p> There were only a handful of reviews available , and though some did lose weight , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lightheadedness , extreme hunger , i 'll feeling , and a lack of energy .

So its unknown if a large enough pool of people have actually benefited from sustained weight loss . Its clear fromthe few reviews available that this has been rated as a poor diet . <h> Conclusion - Does Popcorn DietWork ? <p> The Popcorn Diet is made to replace a full meal a day with as much popcorn as one wants . Information about the diet is limited , and its unknown who created it or what science has proven its safe and effective . Very few have actually tried this diet , and though weight loss was mentioned , they also felt weak and as if their bodies were not getting enough nutrition . This is because popcorn is a very nutritionally weak food . It does not have several necessary vitamin and minerals , and this can lead to long-term nutritional deficiencies if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fad diets which have no proof to back up any of the claims made . One can lose weight due to the low calories , but this can be done with any other food which has reduced calories . <p> Popcorn can be a healthy snack . That is until it becomes a diet nightmare when we drench it in butter and salt . <p> The Popcorn Diet tries to capitalize on the low-calorie and lovable characteristics of popcorn by creating a nutrition plan that claims to give you SuperFood nutrition along with a fun and easy way to lose weight . With this diet you can lose weight naturally in 30 days . <p> Popcorn by itself has no fat , lots of fiber and is sodium free . In addition , it contains 23 calories per cup , making it a win-win for dieters who need to eat a lot to feel satisfied . <p> On the Popcorn Diet , you simply replace one meal a day with popcorn , including the special seasoning , which comes in three flavors : original , lemon or spicy .

There are also concerns of if one can actually be satisfied having popcorn as a meal . There 's no encouragement of exercise which when combined with a nutritional diet is the best way to lose weight . <p> Therefore , to lose weight and keep it off , the Popcorn Diet might not be your best option . 10978 @qwx870978 
@@98099960 @2299960/ <h> 4 Effective Ways to Make Your Body Weight Workouts Harder <p> Strength training is a progressive thing : as you progress and grow stronger , the intensity and resistance of your exercises will evolve to continue to challenge you and keep those results coming . There are very specific variables that effect how hard an exercise is that you can use to increase that intensity incrementally . You cant always just add more weight , so here are four other ways to ramp up the results of your body weight workouts . <p> Change the angle : The steeper the angle of your body toward your exercising muscles , the harder the exercise will be . Example : elevate your feet during push-ups to make them tougher , or place your hands on a stair to decrease the angle for an easier modification of a standard pushup . <p> Decrease the stability : Reducing your contact with the floor instantly works more muscles groups to keep you balanced . You can do this by lifting one foot or hand off the ground , or getting off the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance board , or a stability ball . <p> Change the speed : While strength training , slow your exercises down to increase the load on your muscles . This eliminates using momentum and elastic energy , creating more of a demand on your muscles . For cardio or continuous movements , speed them up to also increase the heart rate and build explosive strength . <p> Combine exercises : The more muscles you engage at once , the harder the demand on your entire body . If burpees are n't  hard enough , add push-ups ( just kidding , burpees are always hard enough ) . Or , combine squats with shoulder presses these are both strength moves , but doing them back to back turns them into cardio exercises , which then means you can then also change the speed to further control intensity . <p> Who needs to pay for a trainer ? You can create your own unique workouts using any combination of these four variables to keep your exercises just as challenging even as your fitness levels increases . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

These five tips will help keep your metabolism humming along and help maximize your hard work . <p> Drink a minimum of 64 oz. water daily .

The thermic effect of feeding ( TEF ) , how much energy it takes to digest the food you eat , makes up about 10% of your daily caloric needs . Protein is the macronutrient with the highest TEF rate with up to 30% of the calories ingested burned during the digestion process . This does n't mean cut out carbs and eat only bacon .

Dose recommendations vary based on your individual health status so always consult your doctor before taking any supplement or medication .

Its a low carbohydrate plan that adjusts to allow more calories and carbohydrates as it goes on . The prepackaged foods often use artificial and potentially harmful ingredients , and many customers agree its not worth it . Even the online counseling from uncertified people is highly priced .

It is very easy to use and only takes seconds . When you think about the amount of time a person can spend at the gym or in the kitchen preparing low calorie meals , you can begin to appreciate how important it is to make sure that any kind of weight loss product wonG ? ? t take a very long time to actually use . <p> One of the reasons why this product is so popular is because it actually works . It really surprised me while reading the slim spray review that it mentioned the fact that people sometimes get results in as little as 3 1/2 weeks . ThatG ? ? s a remarkably short amount of time when you consider whatG ? ? s actually happening . YouG ? ? re literally losing the weight that it probably took a long time to gain . <p> If you are somewhat skeptical about this type of weight loss program , relax .

He told me that he was sick and tired of all the weight that he was gaining . I asked him what he was planning to do about it . He told me that he was going to be utilizing a product called Slim Spray . I had never really heard of this product before , so I asked him if he could tell me a little bit more about it .

My friend has not yet tried it out , but he told me that there are plenty of examples of people who have had positive results using this product . <p> HereG ? ? s the way I look at this . You only live once . Your youth will one day fade away . However , that doesnG ? ? t necessarily mean that you have to accept the fact that you are continuing to gain weight . That is why I really believe there is no problem whatsoever with using a product such as Slim Spray . <p> I know that for some people it might seem a little bit embarrassing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatG ? ? s intended to help you lose weight .

Use the product when at the first sign of a craving ; before , between or after eating and exercising ; or before sleeping . Repeat as desired . <p> Each bottle contains approximately 100 sprays or about 19-20 servings per bottle . <p> DIET and EXERCISE <p> There are no formal diet or exercise guidelines other than to follow a reduced calorie diet and get regular exercise . While Slim Spray should not be used as a meal-replacement , it can be used before a meal to avoid overeating or it can be used to fend off a craving . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Some diet tools bring a chuckle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to banish cravings for high calorie foods makes your tummy giggle with humor but whether it makes your mind fend off cravings is up to the user . <p> While the spray gets notable mentions for its lack of stimulants , a common ingredient in most appetite-suppressing diet supplements , Slim Spray may cause a placebo effect at best and therefore help you lose weight in the very short-term . <p> If you have strong cravings , you might be better off smelling known appetite-suppressing scents like lavender , peppermint or vanilla to keep cravings at bay . 10978 @qwx870978

The program is intended for people who want to lose weight , are diabetic , have heart disease , are unable to drive or cook for themselves or prefer to not shop and cook meals for themselves or their family . <p> Seattle Suttons Healthy Eating program was created by medical professional <p> It is a convenient way to eat healthy meals <p> Ideal for diabetics <p> Ideal for those with heart disease <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fresh-prepared , refrigerated meals <p> Encourages exercise <p> CON <p> Expensive <p> Does not teach you how to eat or prepare your own meals <p> May not be realistic to always eat delivered meals <p> Not vegetarian friendly <p> No customization of menu <p> Does not take into account the emotional component of eating 10974 @qwx870974 <p> The Seattle Sutton Healthy Eating meals are delivered to you two times each week , or if you live near a Seattle Sutton 's center , you can pick them up . Each shipment contains 21 meals : 7 breakfasts , 7 lunches and 7 dinners . The meals require refrigeration . There are five weeks of meal plans that you will receive alternately . <p> Unfortunately , special requests like vegetarian options can not be accommodated . Each of the two meal plans , either the 1,200 or the 2,000 calories , sticks to foods that are low on the glycemic index in order to stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent any surges in hunger . <p> On the plan , you are allowed to drink fat-free milk , have an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out to dinner , you are encouraged to eat salads with dressing on the side , lean protein and vegetables with no added butter . It is then recommended that you freeze your Seattle Sutton dinner for another meal . <p> EXERCISE <p> The Seattle Sutton 's Healthy Eating program does not require that you exercise as part of your diet , but they do encourage you to exercise if you want to lose weight . According to the company , successful weight loss requires that you take in fewer calories than you use . Eating a healthy , balanced diet combined with moderate exercise is the most effective way to lose weight . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Like other meal-delivery programs , the Seattle Sutton 's Healthy Eating program is designed to help you lose weight without having to count calories or prepare your own meals . If you do n't mind spending the money to have someone cook for you , then this program might be a wise choice . Just keep in mind that the diet does not instill any knowledge in you on how to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then becomes your responsibility to teach yourself how to shop and cook for yourself while maintaining your new weight loss . 10970 @qwx870970 <p> ( Page 1 of 3 , 42 total comments ) <p> Jacquelyn <p> + <p> I have been using Seattle Sutton sporadically for the past 8 months , and I have found the food to be , for the most part , very edible/tasty , and , that said , they have recently changed some of the ( presumably less popular ) meals for the better . In addition , the food is of the highest quality of freshness ( with fresh fruits and vegetables that meet my ultra high standards of pristineness ) , and it is REAL food , NOT loaded with artificial ingredients . Yes , it 's a bit pricey , which is why I skip a week or two between my SS weeks . BUT , it is SOOOOO easy to stay on this diet -- you do n't have to expose yourself to the temptations of shopping at the supermarket or eating out ; instead , you just " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SS choices for the week and picking what looks appealing at the moment . I 've had very good results with the 1200-calorie traditional menu of meals , and have rarely felt overly hungry or deprived . It is important to note that these meals are low fat , low cholesterol , and sodium restricted , and that they contain no harmful additives , no high-fructose corn syrup , and NO trans fat . My weight loss during my " on " weeks eating the SS meals has been very impressive ; it almost seemed that there was some kind of chemical reaction going on with the combination of foods that led to even more of a loss than would be expected on a 1200-calorie diet . And on my off weeks , when I try not to undo my progress by eating a lot of big salads and not being " bad , " I have n't regained much , if ANY , of the weight I 've lost with Seattle Sutton . I 'm fortunate to live close enough to the Illinois HQ so that meals are delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pick them up . People who are n't so lucky have to pay ( about $18 per week , I think ) to have their meals shipped directly to their home . THAT makes the price pretty prohibitive . For me , though , the price is $136 per week ( base price of $146 less a $10 coupon my distributor runs regularly ) . That 's actually less than I 'd be spending eating out as much as I would otherwise do . As you can see , I 'm totally sold on Seattle Sutton , the only diet that I have found to be sustainable and successful for me in the long term , and the only diet with prepared foods I can actually stand to eat ! I would encourage anyone and everyone needing to lose weight or needing a restricted diet for other health reasons ( e.g. diabetes or heart disease ) to check out Seattle Sutton online and to try it for a week , even if you have to pay the shipping cost . ( If you find it helps you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two in between your SS weeks to cut down on the expense . ) It will be well worth your expenditure of $146 - $170 , and it could save your life ! <p> posted Mar 7th , 2016 11:36 pm <p> Dennis <p> + <p> I have been using the Seattle Sutton program for over 2 years , and not only have I lost weight , it has taught me about portion control ! Sometimes I order week to week and on occasion I just order a half-week ( which is a great option in my opinion ) . Since it is fresh food , they do have deadlines to make changes to your order , but it was never an issue since the deadline is reasonable . I highly recommend this program to anyone that wants fresh food delivered to their door . I am a busy professional , and eating healthy has always been difficult ( especially at the end of a long day ) .

I 've tried every diet in the book and although this is expensive I do n't mind paying because I know it works , it 's easy and I love the food . I look forward to the food arriving every week because I know there 's nothing that will disappoint . The other " big " thing for me is you can still lose weight and not exercise . I am walking but I do n't " have to " to lose . At night I love my " glass of milk " and with Seattle Sutton you get 200 calories a day extra for a snack or in my case that nightly glass of milk or chocolate milk !

I decided to try it again . I was shocked at the quality of the food . Either no taste or old food , on the verge of going bad . Brown lettuce , sour veges and really bad fish . I had to throw away 3 meals and believe me I am not a picky eater , I can eat anything that 's why Im overweight . I was really disappointed that they thought so little of customers that they would pawn off that stuff as editable food . If you have diverticulitis forget it cause a lot of the food has seeds everywhere . The price at 120 a week was not worth it . <p> I was amazed at how delicious &amp; tasty the meals were . I 'm dumbfounded to read negative posts but do realize that most people usually only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan was an eye for me as i realized my portion control on my own were much larger . i supplemented between meals the first week with fruit or a yogurt until I adjusted to smaller meals .

I have been on every diet you can think of and this is my favorite ( Nutrasystem , Jenny Craig , WWatchers , South Beach , etc . ) ! First of all , I work a lot of hours during the week and this has taken the guesswork and preparation time out of " what am I going to eat tomorrow . " The food is delivered to my door for $5 per week , twice per week . It is fresh , thoughtful and I feel like my mom is cooking for me again . Nice selection of foods ... I pretty much eat anything so I have no issues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picky eater , this may not be the diet for you ( I would suggest trying it for 1 week to see how you like it ) . The carb count does seem a little high , but this diet is not advertised as " low carb " and I am losing weight on this nonetheless . During the first week , I had to supplement the 1200 calorie diet with fresh fruit or almonds between meals because I got hungry , but after that week I am fine on the 1200 calories ( and I am doing cardio 4 times a week ) . On the days I lift weights , I have to increase my overall intake to 1500 calories ( again supplementing healthy foods between meals ) as my body needs it on these days . SS I think you should have a 1500 calorie ( non vegetarian ) plan .... the spread between 1200 and 2000 is quite large . Kudos to you for adding the 1500 vegetarian plan .... you now need to do a gluten free diet plan . In any event , overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly recommend it .... <p> posted Mar 31st , 2013 5:53 pm <p> Kristine <p> + <p> My daughter is off to college and my husband travels often . I do n't like to shop , plan , or cook meals . We both wanted to live a healthier lifestyle , so I looked Seattle Sutton Healthy eating up on-line . When I realized I can easily pick the meals up in my own town and spend close to the same amount we spend at the grocery store , for unhealthy food choices , I decided to give it a try . Tomorrow will be the 6th time I 've picked up the meals ( which requires me to walk thru a door , have a bag of meals placed in my hand by a friendly , smiling distributor , then walking out ) .

At first I was reluctant to share , for fear I would be hungry , but I 've not been hungry at all and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2000 cal diet is to much for me . My husband enjoys the meals and sometimes puts them in a cooler when he has to be out of town overnight . We pick and choose which we want and sometimes we open a couple and exchange this or that with each other or split one . We may not be getting a perfectly balanced diet this way , but it 's a big improvement , it 's a good start , and we enjoy them . The fresh fruit and vegetables have been very fresh , ripe and flavorful .

We do aim to please our clients and in an attempt sometimes miss the mark with a few . Often it is that clients are not used to eating healthy , balanced meals and need to give it some time in order for them to develop a taste for it . <p> As a rule of thumb , we always encourage new clients and those who are ordering for gifts ( especially for the elderly ) to only order one week of meals at a time for that very reason . We noted this in our conversation with your mother when she placed her order for your grandparents on December 20 , 2012 and was instructed this , however she insisted on ordering multiple weeks instead . We even suggested that she start them with a half-week order , to share a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that she wanted them to have multiple weeks of meals . Because we do want to please our clients , we agreed , but only after explaining that this is out of the norm and goes against our recommendation . <p> When someone places an order for our meals , they may or may not understand our meals and how we can provide such fresh meals to our clients from coast-to-coast . The meals are freshly prepared , including fresh fruit and vegetables , and are made especially for them . We do not mass produce meals and sell meals as the orders come in . We place our food order based on the orders we receive each week and the meals are then prepared , packaged and sent to the client ( or picked up at a local distributor location in certain areas ) . Freshness , quality and dedication to health is our number one goal . <p> Since we do have a no refund policy on our meals , because of the fresh produce and ingredients that make up our meals we do have to stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wo n't be a hit with every single person . We prepare the meals you should be eating , not want to be eating . Once you try our meals , most people do want to be eating them though . <p> Our sincerest apologies for any misunderstanding and for letting you and your mother down . We realize how difficult it can be to help seniors eat right and we have served many meals to them so they can age in place without the need to plan , shop and cook for themselves . It has been a lifesaver to many families searching for a solution . We 're sorry your grandparents did not find them helpful and did not appreciate your thoughtful gesture . <p> My mother and I purchased the 2000 Calorie Plan for my grandparents as a gift . We set them up for a month with home delivery to let them try it out . After the first week they really did not like the food and did not wish to receive anymore shipments . I called into the corporate office and spoke with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the meals from coming twice a week for the next 3 weeks ( 63+ more meals ) My grandparents are elderly and have a tough enough time as it is , which was the reason we thought we would try this . Now they are all stressed out about all these meals that are showing up at their home and Seattle Suttons is telling us there is no way to cancel the orders and that they will continue to keep showing up . My mother is also a current member so we suggested that Seattle Suttons just credit these meals to her plan . This request was also shot down by Paula . Paula stated that my mom and grandparents should have read the fine print where it said that the order could not be canceled . I really do not understand having to continue to pay for a service that is not wanted . I really have never seen such disregard for customer service . Needless to say my mom will be canceling her weekly orders and we would not recommend using Seattle Suttons . <p> posted Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No consistency in plan . Morning egg dishes are horrible . In an attempt to add flavor to meals they push green pepper , which i detest .

I do need to incorporate skim milk though . <p> posted Mar 27th , 2012 1:47 am <p> ahgirl <p> + <p> My husband and I started Seattle Sutton last week because we just kept putting on a few pounds every year and did n't like the way our clothes were looking or how we felt . We choose the 2000 calorie plan to start with because we thought we 'd starve on the 1200 calorie plan . We were surprised how much food was in the 2000 calorie plan and plan to switch next week to the 1200 . So far this week we 've lost a couple pounds each - even with the larger plan . I 'm looking forward to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger at all .... yes , it is the larger plan but I have n't been eating all of the food - there 's just too much .

And with my husband and i both working full time , the conveniece of having a fresh meal in the refrigerator that we just have to heat , I 'm feeling liberated from the nightly dinner . All in all , we are pleasantly surprised at the quality , taste , and variety in the meals . I would recommend the plan to a friend . 10978 @qwx870978

That 's the whole point of the " I 'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur " campaign . PETA also puts out an annual list of the years " sexiest vegan celebrities . " This year , that list includes- Kristen Bell . Peoples Sexiest Man of 2013 , Adam Levine , considers himself 85 percent vegan . This time however , PETA may have taken the sexy and slim bit a little too far . <p> When news broke that Plan B , a morning-after pill , may not be effective for women weighing more than 176 pounds , PETA jumped at the chance to convert more people to veganism . In a press release they suggested " Plan V as a Plan B lifeline for overweight women . " <p> PETA is no stranger to controversy . Most recently , vegan and animal rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade . The rocker was scheduled to make an- appearance on the South Dakota float , but citizens objected since the cattle industry is so important to the state . Jett switched to a different float and performed during the parade . <p> That 's the PETA we like hearing about . An organization that is committed to its stance , and has celebrity advocates that are truly- dedicated to the cause . We do n't  love the PETA that uses fat-shaming to convince women to take up a vegan diet . <p> While there is nothing wrong with promoting a meatless diet as a beneficial one , PETA is taking it too far . Using overtly sexy images of thin women to promote veganism is overdone and misleading . What makes it even worse is tying veganism to the ability to use Plan B. <p> President of PETA Ingrid E. Newkirk stated that she believes the new campaign " will encourage women to adopt a healthy vegan diet in order to lose weight and so take control of their reproductive rights . " <p> Encouraging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kind Diet , is n't the problem . Its the assumption that by- converting to a vegan diet , you will be thinner and thereby better able to use a morning-after pill . Not only is the thought insulting , - but it also is supported by the shakiest of science . <p> The problem with the 176 pound weight limit for Plan B is that its only based on weight . It has nothing to do with Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , which is the determining factor in what classifies a person as obese or overweight . <p> Women do n't  need someone or something else pressuring them to lose weight , especially an organization that has no business tying a diet choice to reproductive decisions . Yes , maintaining a healthy weight is important to overall health , but we do n't  need PETA telling us how we should do it . 10976 @qwx870976 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

It has been slowly but I can wait , and I can do this for the rest of my life , so , no rush . <p> posted Apr 19th , 2015 12:52 am <p> Kelly <p> + <p> I have read the book and tried the diet . During the reward meal , you may eat fruit , pasta , and a Snickers bar , if you like-every day . Of course , if one is sensible , one will eat protein , vegetables , and healthy fats during the reward meal , as well as during the other meals . Limiting insulin raising foods to a one hour period does the trick , encouraging fat release from fat cells , and discouraging fat storage . Being allowed to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person from feeling deprived . Anytime a person ceases to eat healthfully and returns to old habits , they will gain weight again . Permanent change to a low carbohydrate , moderate protein , high healthy fat diet , will balance the body 's hormone response and result in effortless weight maintenance . Very occasional , say once a week , desserts after supper will not disturb the balance once achieved . <p> posted Mar 5th , 2015 4:09 am <p> Lisa <p> + <p> Just to add to my previous post , I noticed a few of you expressing guilt about ' going overboard ' at the reward meal . Let me stress that you CAN EAT ANYTHING YOU WANT at the reward meal . Excuse the caps , but I have no other way of putting it . You have an hour to eat whatever you want since the insulin ( the hormone that causes fat storage ) is n't released until approximately 75 minutes after your first bite . Heck , sometimes my entire reward meal consists mainly of carbs ! Since it 's been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of WHEN we eat , it is understandable that we say ' Oh , that 's impossible . How can I eat 3 bowls of ice cream and still lose weight ? ! ' Maybe it 's guilt , maybe it 's your spouse or family criticizing you for enjoying eating a lot for once . Who knows . But I do n't feel guilty anymore , because I know the diet works . It has in the past and it is now . If you find yourself gaining weight , do n't panic and do n't blame the reward meal ( unless you went over your allotted 60 minutes ) . Instead , look at the amount of carbs per meal you are eating at the complimentary meals . For example , I just bought a pack of bacon and forgot to check the label in the store , turns out that particular brand of bacon has more carbs ( 1 carb per 2 slices ) than my usual brand ( 0 carbs per 2 slices ) . The same with cheese . Some cheese lists 1gm per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always . I try to keep my carbs under 6 grams per complimentary meal . Again for the reward meal , I just do n't count . That 's all I had to say . Good luck ! <p> posted Jan 6th , 2015 7:45 pm <p> Lisa <p> + <p> Luckily I 've never really had to diet before , but several years back , I gained 35 lbs from my first child . I thought I 'd look into a diet and chose this one . I started this diet and lost the 35 lbs with no effort and lots of BACON ! ! Neighbours I barely knew noticed my weight loss , which was great , but it also showed how I had n't even noticed the weight creeping up on me . It is difficult to cheat on this diet because things like bacon and cheese are allowed , so you really do n't feel deprived . I started back on it a couple months ago after gaining some winter weight last year . Even though I had been working out trying to lose it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd just give the diet another go because I was so sick of the gym . I 've lost more weight in the last few weeks than a whole year at the silly gym . The reward meal is the best because if you have it at dinner , as I do , it gives you something to look forward to throughout the day and so helps keep you on track . And now , I just do n't have the appetite for carbs that I used to - even at the reward meal . It was too bad Oprah trashed the doctors a few years ago on her show . I think she did them and those who were watching a real disservice since most of the audience who had tried the diet did , in fact , lose weight on it . In fact they lost a total of 300 lbs ! I see that the diet has a rating of 100% on this site . So the good doctors must be doing something right . But , all Oprah complained about was she ' just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she was having more than ' just an apple ' and that 's why she was n't losing weight . And the doctors tried to delicately point that out but she still slammed them and blamed the diet . Who knows , maybe her chef did n't appreciate the specific details of the diet and was inadvertently sabotaging the diet . Or it could have been because Oprah seems to like her wine ... a lot . Anyway , the whole point is to accept that you may have an insulin problem or even marginally diabetic if you ca n't lose weight any other way but this , which she still has n't accepted . Addiction , whether it be food , alcohol or crack , has no regard for the facts and can convince the brain the sky is red . But I digress , I have n't read the whole ' finish your coffee in 15 minutes ' part of the diet since I 'm using the older book . But that may be something I should look into as I realise now that savouring my coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't agree that one should stop this diet . It is based on the idea that the dieter is insulin resistant and therefore is much like a diabetic in the way that they will always be that way or will be for a very long time . Six months on the diet but then going back to regular eating is not recommended and this is not just for your weight but for your overall health . I 'm going to keep at it since it 's good for me and I enjoy it ! <p> posted Jan 6th , 2015 6:57 pm <p> Fermina <p> I would like to star this diet tomorrow april 1st .

You 're not alone and the Carbohydrate Addict 's Diet might just be the plan for you . <p> It 's possible your body does n't process carbs the way everyone else does . Sometimes , carbs in your body will result in substantial production of insulin , which in turn creates fat stores .

Such foods include : <p> Meat and poultry <p> Fish and shellfish <p> Fats , oils and dressings <p> Eggs and dairy products <p> Vegetables and salads <p> Special low-carb desserts ( recipes in book ) <p> Three meals a day are allowed . Breakfast and lunch must be protein plus low-glycemic vegetables . Dinner is referred to as your reward meal where you can eat whatever you want as long as you eat it in a one-hour time period . <p> Once you finish with the first two weeks of the diet , you gradually start to re-introduce certain carbs back into your diet , but the quantity and kinds of carbs are dependent upon your weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sample day on the Carbohydrate Addicts Diet might look like this : <p> Breakfast : Omelet made with a combination of egg whites and one whole egg , bell peppers and mushrooms <p> Dinner : Modest serving of pasta marinara and topped with Parmesan cheese shavings , served with sauteed broccoli . <p> Foods that are to be avoided during the day are : <p> Fruit <p> Fruit juices <p> Bread <p> Pasta <p> Sugar &amp; sweets <p> Processed food <p> EXERCISE <p> You are encouraged to be consistently active while following the Carbohydrate Addicts Diet . Clocking hours at the gym or on the StairMaster is not recommended , but rather you should aim to move your body more through modest exercise and in your daily routine . <p> CONCLUSION <p> Carbs have certainly received a bad rap in recent years as more and more research shows that diets high in refined carbohydrates can lead to weight gain and out-of-whack insulin levels . <p> While it 's great dietary practice to limit the amount of refined carbs you eat , completing nixing fruit or even the occasional candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the Carbohydrate Addicts Diet is likely to result in weight loss and receives high marks for its inclusion of lean protein and healthy veggies , its permission of a reward meal may lead to pasta binges and the resulting weight loss is likely to be temporary , once you cycle off the diet . 10978 @qwx870978

An official book outlines what 's required , and its also known as the Doctors Quick Weight Loss Diet . <p> There are very specific recommendations for food options where increased protein is meant to help stimulate weight loss . Its also a diet that forces the body into ketosis , which is what happens when glucose is n't a primary fuel source for the body . This diet was created in 1967 when diet fads such as this became popular . Our review experts have analyzed many kinds of weight loss diets and found the 18Shake Diet is the most effective . It combines a wholesome appetite suppressing meal replacement and a fat burning diet pill . For more information about the benefits of the 18Shake Diet , click the link here . <h> The Stillman Diet Ingredients and Side Effects <p> The diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following foods for the initial 1st phase : <p> Lean chicken , beef , veal , turkey , eggs , and fish . <p> Spices , herbs , tabasco sauce , pepper , and salt . <p> Tea , coffee , and diet soda . <p> 8 glasses of water a day are necessary . <p> Fats , oils , condiments , and butter are not allowed . <p> Exercise is not advised due to the potentially extreme reduction of calories . It also bans any kinds of fruits , carbohydratesvegetables , oils , sugars , and fats . This can be potentially dangerous as there are wholesome nutrients in vegetables and fats are also needed by the body . <p> The state of ketosis is also a potential issue . Normally the body uses glucose as a fuel source which comes from carbohydrates . When deprived , there is a switch to ketones which are the bodys backup source . This can lead to side effects such as : <p> The main issue with this diet is that both carbohydrates and fats are necessary for sustaining the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins such as vitamin A , D , E , and K. These are important to help regulate many important body functions .

Its also a quick fuel source that is needed to perform physical activities . <p> Without these two key macronutrients the body becomes susceptible to many harmful complications . There 's no proof that The Stillman Diet would be safe to use , on the contrary its likely to cause many serious side effects that include : <p> Malnutrition , muscle pain , and digestive issues . <p> Fatigue , increased risk of sickness , and improper body maintenance . <p> The second phase of the diet introduces small amounts of fats and carbohydrates once one reaches their ideal weight . No proof is offered to show if this would be a safe way to achieve results . <p> A result of quitting carbohydrates is that the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great change in weight loss , but its not long lasting as it returns as soon as carbohydrates are eaten . Each gram of carbohydrate requires the body to hold 3 grams of water . Its not uncommon for people to fluctuate 5 pounds in a day strictly due to water weight . <p> This is the reason why diets low in carbohydrates can promise quick weight loss , but its never in the form of fat unless its calorie restricted . <h> The Price and Quality of The Stillman Diet <p> The official book is sold for $25.95 on Amazon.com , and additional prices depend on what kind of high-protein foods one chooses . <p> Its not advised to follow this diet however , as there are extreme changes one needs to do which can be harmful . There are also no clinical studies or proof offered by this diet to help prove it would be safe and effective . There are many potential health risks involved which make this a poor choice for weight loss . <h> Business of The Stillman Diet <p> The diet was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he created this diet , its unclear if he had a background in nutrition or weight loss . <p> No official website is available for this diet and all the information is listed in the official book .

Since this diet has been around since 1967 , its unlikely that there is any evidence to help support it . Usually diets like these are no longer used as more information on health is available . <p> This diet was also famously used by Karen Carpenter , who wound up dying due to health complications caused by extreme weight loss . <h> Customer Opinions of The Stillman Diet <p> " I found this diet to be dangerous . I honestly thought I was going to die " <p> " do n't  do stupiddiets like this " <p> " I felt very dizzy , I lasted a week&amp; a half &amp; felt so bad " <p> Some people did manage to lose weight , but it was often described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited food menu and the fact that there were side effects . Extreme fatigue and mood swings were a major issue that many have experienced . This is likely to occur when one is not eating the nutrients and vitamins that come from a diverse diet . <p> Certain users did enjoy the diet as it produced immediate results , but this is likely the result of water weight and not actual fat loss . When the body does not get any carbohydrates it releases stores of glycogen which can be anywhere up to 20 pounds of pure water weight . <h> Conclusion - Does The Stillman DietWork ? <p> The Stillman Diet was a pioneer once famous diet that emphasized eating high protein while avoiding carbohydrates and fats to begin with . While this diet can lead to weight loss as water weight is lost , its also not a secure and healthy way to lose weight . <p> Its far too restrictive and does n't  allow for important fats and carbohydrates the body needs for optimal health .

Where can the real 2 day diet pills be purchased . I am a health food store and want to get some in .

Diet pills are risky but if you follow a good health and listen to your body , you can assure yourself , everyone is different . If you are sensitive to a few cups of coffee a day , then I would n't suggest it . You can build tolerance by taking a pill a day and work it up to 2-3 on an EMPTY stomach , it 'll be more effective .

Thanks Alli . <p> The anticipation for a new diet pill is over as the FDA recently approved Alli ( pronounced Al-eye ) . It 's the weight loss newcomer that is quickly finding its place on drug store shelves . Alli is the first FDA-approved diet pill available without a prescription . Alli is actually a low-dose version of Xenical , a prescription drug that successfully assists obese individuals losing weight . Xenical is taken under a doctor 's care while following a low-calorie , low-fat diet . Alli has the same active ingredient ( Orlistat ) , but in a much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alli can help you lose a few pounds more than just dieting and exercise alone . It works by suppressing the body 's ability to absorb fat in the intestines . By reducing fat , you reduce calories . When the body is unable to absorb these fats they become undigested waste . <p> Alli works best when it is used in conjunction with a low-calorie , low-fat diet and a regular exercise program . But since sticking to a reduced-calorie diet is tough and since certain foods need to be avoided while using the diet pill , Alli has partnered with eDiets , a meal delivery service that delivers Alli-specific meals to your door every week . <p> While some may view Alli as a controversial solution to weight loss , the manufacturers of this product have gone to great lengths to offer a comprehensive program to its users in order to make weight loss as easy and approachable as possible . <p> Although studies on the amount of weight loss you can lose with Alli are limited , you can expect to lose three to five pounds more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must be very careful to not exceed the maximum fat gram requirement with each meal <p> Weight loss affects are modest <p> Meal delivery services do n't teach you how to consume and prepare your own calorie and portion-controlled meals <p> INGREDIENTS <p> Alli contains 60 mg of Orlistat . <p> ADMINISTRATION <p> Alli is a 60 mg tablet taken three times a day with meals that should not exceed 15 mg of fat . <p> DIET and EXERCISE <p> A low-fat and low-calorie diet must be followed while taking Alli . Since the success of Alli depends so largely on what you eat , how much you eat and when you eat , you have two choices for designing the most effective meal plan for your weight loss needs : <p> You could consult with your physician or a registered dietitian to design a well-laid out diet and exercise plan . <p> You could sign up for Alli 's partner eDiets , a meal delivery service that creates special Alli-approved meals and delivers them to your door each week . <p> With the eDiets plan , you eat three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be personalized to reflect your tastes and preferences and you also have access to a registered dietitian , an online community of other Alli dieters and fitness and exercise support . <p> Since the fat content of each meal must be closely monitored while using Alli ( no more than 15 mg each day ) , eDiets special Alli-approved meals meet these requirements so that your risk of side effects is kept to a minimum . <p> The eDiets menu includes a wide variety of delicious meals , including : <p> Irrespective of which meal plan you follow , since Alli inhibits the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins , it is important to take a daily supplement that includes Vitamins A , D and E. <p> In addition , for the best results , a regular exercise program should also be followed that includes 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week . If you decide to sign-up with eDiets meal delivery service , you have access to a live fitness trainer to help you customize an exercise plan to compliment your weight loss needs . <p> CONCLUSION <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those considering taking Alli should note that side effects can include gas , and uncontrolled urination and bowel movements , especially when not following the guidelines prescribed by Alli . <p> Alli is not a magic pill to lose weight , but its special partnership with eDiets , a meal delivery service , makes eating and meal planning simple and convenient . <p> Do keep in mind that the effects of taking Alli in comparison to just dieting and exercising alone are just the difference of a few pounds . It is necessary that you consult with your medical practitioner before taking Alli. 10978 @qwx870978

@@98099989 @2299989/ <h> Raspberry Ketone Side Effects May Impact Thyroid Health <p> The amount of questions that came pouring in to my pharmacy about raspberry ketones just hours after Dr. Ozs episode about them makes me think I need to start DVRing the show . Being in the health care field I feel it is my responsibility to stay current with the latest drug and supplement information . Dr. Oz has a tremendous influence on his audience and I feel its important to dig a little deeper and not just take his word for it . <p> Raspberry ketones work in two ways for a possible weight loss effect . They increase the metabolism by increasing the release of a hormone called norepinephrine . When I think of norepinephrine I think what would happen to me if I were being chased by a bear . My heart rate speeds up and I may even have some palpitations , there 's a good chance I 'll be running the fastest I ever have . My body is going to release some glucose into my blood to give me more energy so I can outrun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot and that I 'll be panting for air even after I stop running . I would imagine that at this point I would not be hankering for food because my focus is to stay alive causing my appetite to be suppressed . My vision may become blurry and I may feel the need to throw up or even feel nauseous . I may also have difficulty falling asleep after my run-in with the bear . <p> Now , imagine this is going on all day long that could be you on raspberry ketones . The dose can of course be adjusted starting with 100 mg at breakfast and increasing to up to 300 mg . Although you may avoid or lessen the side effects with a lower dose you may not get the results you are looking for . <p> The other mechanism here is involving a protein that is found on fat cells called adiponectin . Adiponectin decreases glucose levels and has been found to be very successful in lab tests with mice regarding weight loss . Adiponectin has some ties to genetic makeup so if obesity runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame . <p> February is national thyroid health month and I think its important to think about the possible effects of a drug that increases your metabolism . This is the function that is normally controlled by the thyroid and any medication that causes an increase in this hormone could cause the thyroid to malfunction . This could lead to hypothyroidism , also known as an under-active thyroid and result in being put on prescription medication to control it . Drugs that increase metabolism that are prescription , like phentermine , are only recommended for a short time period , which is about three months . Its hard to speculate without studies being conducted , but I would not be surprised if long-term use of raspberry ketones could have an effect on thyroid function . <p> With any supplement I say go in it with a grain of salt . Know that there probably will be side effects and you may not see results . Chances are you 're more likely to experience the side effects than the results . <p> Dr. Sarah Khan is a graduate of Albany College of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her patients , and specializes in diabetes management .

Your statement disregards the fact that we will see whatever it is we focus upon , whether it is wanted or unwanted . This is the glaringly obvious viewpoint of someone in the pharmaceutical industry , who only expects results from synthetic pharmaceuticals . That approach is making Americans less and less well . I would suggest a bit of self-examination regarding the level of indoctrination you have apparently received , and the effect that it has had on your judgement . <p> I think you are making a lot of assumptions about me and how I practice from looking at 2 sentences !

Lifestyle modifications are the first line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back burner before pills ! It is clear that we are in a culture of the quick fix ! As someone who has struggled with weight loss myself I can tell you that people putting their faith in a pill is not beneficial . If you look at any weight loss supplement it clearly says lose weight in combination with diet and exercise . You have to believe in yourself and have the right mindset to change . There should be a change in diet and nutrition first and then with physician supervision you could add a supplement . Many supplements interact with medications so its important for patients to let their provider know that . The point of the article was to give an honest unbiased review of the supplement from a pharmacists perspective . I believe I accomplished that ! 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

November is National Diabetes Awareness Month . As the daughter of a type 2 diabetic , I know first-hand what it is like living with the disease . Between medications , finger sticks , foot checks , vision tests , and the daily grind of nutrition and exercise , it can be a lot for people to manage , especially after years of unhealthy habits . <p> So , would n't it be great if you knew what you could do to control your diabetes , or better yet prevent diabetes , in the first place ? Well , you 've come to the right place . This blog post will describe the top three steps you can take to prevent or reverse type 2 diabetes . <p> 1 . Eat healthy <p> If you already have type 2 diabetes , then you have ( hopefully ) learned about the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small amount of healthy carbohydrates with each meal . Well , this also works in preventing type 2 diabetes . <p> I recommend people choose carbohydrates in the form of fresh or minimally processed starchy vegetables ( like potatoes ) , fruits , beans ( like lentils ) , and whole grains ( like brown rice , quinoa , and corn ) for their meals . Non-starchy veggies have such low carbs for the calories and they are almost 100% water that you do n't  need to limit those . <p> Just watch how they are prepared . Steamed or broiled with herbs , spices or a little olive oil is best . Refined sources of carbohydrates should be limited as much as possible : sugar , white bread , white rice , etc . You do n't  need to eliminate all foods with these ingredients , but try to make a healthier swap whenever possible and limit your portion sizes of these foods . <p> 2 . Exercise more <p> Exercise can help slow or prevent the progression of diabetes a number of ways . Exercise helps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and improve sleep ( more on that next ) . Exercise also helps people manage a healthy blood sugar level whether you have diabetes or not . <p> When you exercise , you burn sugar for energy . Regular exercise also helps keep blood vessels healthy to prevent heart disease , which diabetics often get from damage to blood vessels . You do n't  have to be a marathoner either . As little as 1,000 calories worth of activity spread throughout the week ( walking 30 minutes and 20 minutes of strength training three times a week ) causes your muscles to utilize sugar more effectively and keep it from floating around in your blood , which leads to diabetes . <p> 3 . Lose weight <p> Get a tape measure and take a waist measurement . Men , if you 've got 40 or more inches around the waist you have 12 times the risk of developing diabetes than a male with 35 inches . Women , if you have 37 or more inches around the waist you are 12 times more likely to get diabetes than a female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the best steps to losing weight .

After a mild and jovial summer , the cool air that gusts melancholy over the Midwest in early September had me wondering if I was about to get SAD again , if it was a legitimate condition , and if so , what I could do fight it . <p> I shot our resident mental health expert , Brooke Randolph , LMHC an email asking her about SAD , and she revealed that after two decades of speculation , SAD had officially been classified as a common disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) .

I 'm talking about circadian rhythm , a biologically built in 24-hour clock that regulates sleep , energy , and body temperature . The decrease in daylight in autumn and winter throws our circadian rhythm off , which can cause bouts of sluggishness , confusion , and disorientation . Additionally , the lack of sunlight diminishes our supply of vitamin D , which makes it difficult for the body to fight off those pesky winter colds . <p> Fortunately , there are ways to restore your circadian rhythm andvitamin D supply .

Also , eating foods high in vitamin D " seafood , eggs , mushrooms " will encourage the efficiency your body experiences in the warmer months . <p> Exercising , socializing , and adopting a minor project are all ways to boost productivity and lower stress . If you thought you were crazy for getting SAD , sigh no more . Its a real problem that affects people all over the country ( unless you live in Southern California ) .

This is due to its balanced vitamins and minerals and high amount of amino acids which can help provide the nutrition of a full meal with few calories , fat , and just 1 gram of sugar per serving . <p> You may know that I have been undergoing treatment for acid reflux for about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Voice Institute of New York . Dr. Koufman is one of the authors of Dropping Acid : The Reflux Diet Cookbook &amp; Cure . I 'm a big lover of tea , and I was happy to hear that there are still several varieties of teas that do n't  trigger acid reflux . Some doctors might recommend that patients stay away from caffeine altogether , but Dr. Koufman says that a cup of tea ( black , green or white ) or coffee with milk per day is fine . Its the people who drink " a fishbowl " of coffee each day who have a problem . Herbal teas like chamomile and rooibos are good , but any fruit-infused teas will be too acidic . <p> Ginger is also good for people with reflux , so I like to make a simple tisane with fresh ginger . Boil a tablespoon of freshly chopped ginger for about two minutes , and sweeten with honey or sugar . Use less ginger for a milder flavor . <p> Homemade smoothies with low-acidity fruits and low-fat dairy are also a great option . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( be sure to peel it first ) , and sticking it in the blender with some milkno ice needed . <p> Dr. Koufmans team tested the acidity of many different beverages , to better help patients know what they can and cant drink .

Now , 105 pounds thinner , Eli boasts a body fat percentage of only 10% and he s currently training to compete in the Physique Division of a Mens Bodybuilding Competition in February 2014 .

It claims that the real reason people gain weight is due to a faulty combination of sugar and carbohydrates , and not excess calories . <p> There information about this diet is available in the official book which also has recipes and suggestions for eating . The diet describes how undereating and extreme dieting is not needed , and that this approach is backed by years of evolution . Our review experts have reviewed many kinds of weight loss diets , and the most effective was found to be the 18Shake Diet . It has an appetite suppressing meal replacement and a fat burning , metabolism boosting diet pill . Both contain natural ingredients without stimulants , artificial additives , fillers , binders , or colors . Learn more about why the 18Shake Diet was rated as the most effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Belly Fat Cure Ingredients and Side Effects <p> The main idea of the diet is to limit sugar to 15 grams and carbohydrates to 120 grams a day . This is in order to lower insulin which is said to be the reason why hormones convert fat into fat cells . <p> Its also said that the idea of excess calories and lack of exercise are n't  the reason why weight gain is likely . So the book introduces what 's known as the Carb Swap System . This leads to the 15/6 rule or 6 servings of complex carbohydrates and 15 grams of sugar . The creator mentions that our ancestors did n't  have access to the high amounts of sugar seen in our diets . <p> " About 200 years ago , daily consumption of sugar was under 15 grams Guess what you did n't  see much of then ? Belly fat . " <p> This claim is not proven however as there is no evidence provided by the creator . There is also the idea that this diet will help target belly fat , though this spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " Fat is lost through the day in a pattern dependent upon genetics , sex ( hormones ) , and age . Overall body fat must be reduced to lose fat in any particular area " <p> This debunks one major claim made by the diet . There 's also no explanation why the exact 15 grams of sugar and 6 servings of carbohydrates is advised . These numbers are specific without an explanation as to why they are beneficial . <p> The limit on sugar also extends to fruits , and its recommended to eat lower sugar foods such as berries . The issue with the 15 gram of sugar limit is that this is extremely low . One medium sizedbanana has around 14 grams of sugar , medium sized apple contains 19 grams of sugar , and a large orange has 17 grams of sugar . No proof is offered to show why this form of sugar in moderation would prevent weight loss . <p> The American Dietic Association has reviewed this plan : <p> " views on fruit and dairy lack s merit and may cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suggested meals or to advocate portion control " <p> The website EatRightPro.com also mentions the lack of consideration this diet places on health : <p> " little regard to total fat , saturated fat , dietary cholesterol and sodium is , at the very least , irresponsible and at worst can be extremely harmful to ones heart and overall health " 10975 @qwx870975 <h> The Belly Fat Cure Quality of Ingredients <p> Many questionable suggestions are made without any proof . While limiting sugar and eating more complex carbohydrates is healthy , its not enough to promote weight loss . <p> There are debunked claims which are made such as the idea that belly fat can be treated directly , sugar from fruit must be reduced to 15 grams a day for weight loss , and that calorie counting is not needed for weight loss . <p> As far as the sugar limit on every form available including fruit , Authority Nutrition mentions : <p> " fruits are " real " foods . They are highly nutrition and so fulfilling " <h> The Price and Quality of The Belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods one chooses and the cost of the book . People have mentioned that the book suggests many specific brands that are either difficult to find , or can only be purchased online . These kinds of ingredients can be costly to keep purchasing . <p> There are many unproven claims made , and some users have noted how the recipes offered do not list the amount of calories and other nutrition facts . This makes it impossible to track ones own individual needs for calories and other nutrients . When losing weight its important to have an idea of the calories one is getting , as activity level , sex , age , and weight loss desires play a role in determining total caloric intake . <h> Business of The Belly Fat Cure <p> The creator of this plan is Jorge Cruise , a celebrity fitness trainer . He has also promoted other diets for weight loss . Some people who have reviewed the creators diets mention how there is contradicting information <p> " check out his previous diet , which bashes low carb diets , when all thisnew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There were also complaints that the official website which features this book suppresses negative opinions : <h> Customer Opinions of The Belly Fat Cure <p> The books Amazon.com page has 238 negative reviews .

Some have added how it feels as though the creator is paid to make these brand suggestions . <p> There were also issues with the recipes offered being impractical and featuring hard to find ingredients . The majority of people mentioned that there was very common sense information such as getting lean protein , complex carbohydrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carbohydrates was difficult to sustain for people . Often within lunch time people had already passed the advised limit . <h> Conclusion - Does The Belly Fat Cure Work ? <p> The Belly Fat Cure makes many suggestions which have not been proven true . Limiting sugar is important for overall health , but the limit of 15 grams a day is not specific anywhere is being the optimal number . This also makes it difficult to enjoy fruits even in moderation . There is no information about calorie counting and no nutritional information is offered for any of the recipes featured . No evidence exists either that one can target belly fat loss , as the spot reduction myth has been debunked . Another issue with the diet is that many users have complained that there is n't enough information available to help promote sustained weight loss .

@@98100039 @2300039/ <p> Staring down a new years resolution looks a little different for actress Melissa Joan Hart this year .

" That 's her goal for 2014 , when she will celebrate a one year anniversary asspokeswoman and client of Nutrisystem . <p> After delivering her third son in fall of 2012 , she , like just about most women , had postpartum weight to lose . She turned to the meal delivery diet , which she calls " a little lifesaver , " and it has helped her get back to her fighting weight , so to speak . <p> " Its a simple system for any mom to use , " she told us . " It takes the guesswork out . " <p> Any mom is faced with the seemingly daunting task of getting back in shape after delivering a child , but in Hollywood , the pressure is almost cruel . Hart told us that this group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and says its tricky being in the spotlight because " everyone wants to see how fast you can lose it . " She calls the situation unfair , but digresses that " its our job , its what we do . " And for this busy working ( and acting ) mom of three , its good motivation " to be as healthy as I can while putting my children first . " <p> She admitted to rushing through breastfeeding in the past so that she could start a crash diet and lose the weight , but that was n't the case this time around . Almost six months after delivering her third son , she started Nutrisystem . Thanks to the ease and variety of the brands wide menu , the only resolution Hart is taking on this year has a lot more heart itself . " Im focused on my children and more playtime with them , " she said . <p> While Melissa may have felt the media pressures to lose the baby weight , the motivation to lose the weight came from within . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every meal , " she quipped . She says , like her , most of us need to accept the fact that not every meal can be Thanksgiving . She enjoys the built-in portion control that Nutrisystem has " done correctly for you . " <p> She mostly eats the pantry-ready meals , those without the need of refrigeration or freezing , and the frozen goodies for dessert . Her favorite is the pasta , specifically the ravioli ! And because it only requires a quick few minutes in the microwave , she can heat , eat , and go just about anywhere . <p> Her schedule made us weak in the knees , noting a wake-up call of 5:30 am and obligations that run well in to the night . Between production on a new season of Melissa and Joey , the release of her new book Melissa Explains It All , charity functions , and of course the family that she clearly adores , Melissa is sympathetic to the problem most moms face shower or eat ? <p> For her , Nutrisystem is that answer . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm dieting , " she told us . <p> That schedule is too busy to get Melissa in to the gym right now . " I do n't  have time for a trainer even if one came to my house , " she shared , bursting the bubble that all Hollywood stars are catered to by fitness gurus . Instead , its much easier to identify with Melissa as the harried working mom who wants to be in shape for herself and her family and cant quite fit it all in . However , her Nutrisystem counselor says that having three boys definitely counts as her three fitness activities a day . " You 're good ! " she was told . <p> " My life is absolute chaos , " she laughed . " And trying to get to the gym is pretty much impossible . " So she relies heavily on the Nutrisystem shakes and bars , too , noting how great they 've been for maintenance as well as giving her an easy option when time does n't  allow for much else . <p> For Melissa , Nutrisystem came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and the ability to manage it all . And now , a year later , a weight-focused resolution is no where in sight , nor are the 30 or so pounds she lost this past year . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

Worst case is you might gain 1-2lbs that day .... but you lose that really quick if you get right back on schedule the next day . If you are wondering why I am not considering Bady for Life now .

Those nine months are filled with a maelstrom of changes- physical , emotional , mental and spiritual . And for many women , being healthy has never been so important as during the time when she is carrying a little within her . One way that many soon-to-be-moms stay fit and healthy is through yoga . <p> Just to set the record straight , yoga is safe to do while you are pregnant as long as you are careful and move at a pace that is comfortable for you and your growing child . <p> Here are four reasons why yoga is so beneficial to- pregnant moms : <p> 1 ) Connection:Pregnant women are acutely in tune with their body during these life-changing nine months. - For pregnant women , listening intently to their bodies can make a significant difference in how well they treat their bodies .

Anyway , JC needs to lower their pricing cuz they are way expensive and I do n't care if my friend did them and lost 20 more lbs in the same time period . She spent $478 per 28 days on food .

But is it Worth It ? <p> Beyonce , the entrepreneur , has started another business , this time with her trainer , Marco Borges . Together they have launched a vegan meal delivery service called " 22 Days Nutrition . " The name comes from the common myth that it takes 21 days to form a new habit . Last winter , under Borges direction , Beyonce and Jay-Z became vegan for 22 days and they loved it ( although they do n't  seem to be vegan now ) . Borges is the author of a soon to be released diet book titled , " The 22 Day Revolution . " <p> Their website describes the meals as fresh , wholesome , gluten-free , dairy-free , and soy-free , as well as 100% organic and GMO-free . That 's a lot of buzz words and diet restrictions . The soy-free part is odd because vegans classically eat soybeans in the form of tofu , seitan , veggie burgers , meat analogues , and edamame . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your front door . You just unpack , load the fridge , reheat , and eat . And pay the bill . At one meal-a-day , a one week supply costs $103.45 , two meals-a-day goes for $153.46 , and three meals for $194.04 , all with a $19.95 shipping fee . Multiply that expense by three for a 21 day supply . <p> Vegan diets are always risky because they remove essential foods . That 's why I recommend the one- or two-meals-a-day plan , but not the three . Unless one is willing to commit to a diet full of beans , pulses ( lentils and split peas ) , grains and vegetables , the Ovo-Lacto Vegetarian Diet ( plants and eggs and dairy ) is a much safer way to eat more plants while avoiding food with a face . <p> Deficiencies of protein , vitamin B12 , calcium , vitamin D , and zinc can occur with poorly planned vegan diets . All vegans need a vitamin B12 supplement because that nutrient is only found in animal foods and deficiency leads to anemia and neurological problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless plant proteins are well-chosen and eaten in adequate amounts , they do not provide all the amino acids the body needs . Protein makes up every cell blood , muscles , organs , skin , hair , bones , antibodies to fight infections , hormones with their profound effects , and many more . Without enough quality protein , we become sick , tired and weak , bones thin , hair falls out , and fertility is compromised . <p> Another thing : there is no magic number of days it takes to create a habit . Habit change relies on constant work to shape the environment , renew our commitment , and take credit for our accomplishments . That 's why the process should be approached with joy , which is what Beyonce is trying to do . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

The company announced in March 2011 that it would make an effort to serve more sustainable beef . However , those efforts have since been ill-monitored . Regardless , seafood is a good place to start as far as were concerned , and were pleased to see such an influential company doing so much good for the cause . 10973 @qwx870973 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

Its said that one should lose between 10 to 17 pounds safely . The basic idea is that this diet will significantly reduce the amount of calories you lose via introducing low calorie foods . <p> The reason one can eat unlimited amounts of soup is due to the extremely low calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which helps to fill up the stomach . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> Sacred Heart Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> There are healthy food options which are recommended , but eating only large amounts of soups can be difficult . Its likely one will lose weight as there is very few calories provided . The issue is that this can also lead to nutritionaldeficiencies . A lot of the foods one will be eating are low in fats , which can lead to fatigue . <p> The claimed 10 to 17 pounds of weight loss are likely to be water weight . The reason why the diet is only available for use up to 7 days is because of the risk of issues with can result with repeat use . Diets that require only a short term use are often because they can promote side effects . This is not considered a sustainable diet ; they are what are known as crash diets . <p> Sharron Coplin , a registered dietician for Ohio State University said : <p> " would not recommend any diet that exceeded a safe rate of weight loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Business of Sacred Heart Diet <p> Websites which promote this brand often will claim that it was formulated by a particular hospital .

There is no officialguide , and certain sites offer different accounts on what should be followed . The same basic ideas are offered however , such as making sure to get the help of a physician in case of any excess weight loss . <p> As suspected the main issue people had was that any weight loss was quickly regained . This is what is known as a crash diet , which gives fast results that do not last and is only intended for a short period of use . <p> The issue with diets like this is that most of the weight loss is actually water weight and not fat . This makes it impossible to rely on for real weight loss . <h> Conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diet allows for unlimited amounts of soup that 's based off of just one recipe . For the entire 7 days there are different allowed foods . The diet is considered a fad crash dietthat can result to upwards of 7 pounds in the total 7 days .

There were also problems with the lack of long lasting weight loss . There are problems with sustaining weight loss efforts since most of what 's lost is water weight . Medical sites also mention that its lacking in nutrition and that it can be unsafe to keep using it .

It is clearly high in fiber , nutrients and minerals . It is similar to many low carbohydrate diets out there for its avoidance of refined sugars , flour of any sort , fried foods and added fat . Although there is no scientific proof that the sacred soup which you ingest every day is a magic pill to melt off the pounds , it is a great way to feel full and to get in more than your five veggies a day .

@@98100088 @2300088/ <p> I bet if you pick up your phone or grab your computer right now , you cant spend five minutes on the Internet without running into a beauty or fitness trend that ask women to alter the shapes of their bodies in ridiculous ( and sometimes dangerous ) ways . <p> Our friends at Shape Magazine have spoken with experts about these beauty trends and what trying to achieve them will cost you . We 've got our own take on the beauty and fitness buzzwords that seem to be sweeping social media . <p> Thigh GapOh , the thigh gap . The strange ideal to have nothing but air between your legs . I understand the desire to not have your legs rub together ( ugh , chafing ) but beyond that I have to say this trend baffles me . For most women , a thigh gap is n't possible . Not because they do n't  exercise enough or eat right , but because of their bone structure . That 's something you can not change . <p> The " V-Cut " AbsYou know the V-shape on mens abs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its possible for women to have them to . Of course , you probably would have to train like crazy to drop enough body fat so those muscles would show through . Even then , it may never happen because of genetics and your natural body shape . Instead of focusing on one small aspect of your body , do your best to get the whole thing in shape . You , and likely your core , will be much happier . <p> Toned ArmsFirst off , it is absolutely possible to have toned arms . However , it will take some serious work since women are genetically predisposed to have more fat on their arms . Those darn genes are getting in the way again ! Lifting weights is a great way to tone the muscle in your arms , and we promise , you wo n't end up looking like a dude . <p> Narrow Hips/Small ButtGenes are really out to ruin all of our beauty fun . Wish and try as you might for a smaller hip and butt region , some of us just are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve the look of your posterior , though it wont change its overall size . You truly have to work what your momma gave you , no matter what shape or size it may be . <p> Concave Stomach I 'm not sure when beauty trends fast-forwarded through flat stomachs and on to concave , but I 'd like to turn around . It seems completely contradictory to want v-cut abs but a concave stomach since fit abs stick out a bit . ( Muscle takes up space , after all . ) Also , to be so thin that your stomach concaves means you probably are n't  eating enough . That can lead to serious health problems that will make your beauty standard woes seem like a walk in the park . <p> When you get right down to it , not everyone is going to be able to achieve these trends , and few will even be able to achieve one of them . Ultimately , it comes down to being happy and healthy , and having a thigh gap or any other specific body shape is n't going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

But its not the only way to get in shape in the water . Over the last few years , traditional strength training , cardio workouts , and even yoga have taken to the water to deliver a form of exercise that is easy on the joints and effective at toning and strengthening the muscles . Sure , there 's water aerobics . But- there are also a handful of other fitness styles that have taken the plunge into the pool , - creating an entirely new experience for some of your favorite group exercises classes. - <p> here 's an introduction to five popular group fitness classes that you would n't expect to take place in a pool : <p> Aqua Zumba <p> Aqua Zumba adds a fun challenge to one of the most popular group exercise classes in the world . The concept and moves are the same as in a- traditional Zumba class , but the extra resistance created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the workout . The class is held in shallow water ( about chest height for the average participant ) and the instructor is positioned near the ledge of the pool ( so that everyone can see her movements and follow instruction ) . Aqua Zumba is described as a fun pool party- where you do n't  even realize that you get a great workout . <p> Aqua Yoga <p> Traditional yoga classes come in several different varieties , all of which promote strength , flexibility and being centered within your own mind . The principles of Aqua Yoga are no different , and the added element of water provides a number of added benefits to the practice . In an Aqua Yoga class , yoga poses are performed in warm water to help develop strength , balance and increased range of motion . Holding yoga poses in water takes away the element of gravity and adds an increased sense of calm and relaxation to the body . Activities held in warm water are said to reduce anxiety , relieve stress and reduce chronic pain . <p> Ai Chi <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and performed in warm water to create the exercise known as Ai Chi . Like traditional Tai Chi , Ai Chi combines deep breathing with slow , controlled movements of the arms , legs and torso . The class is held in shoulder-deep water , which helps facilitate relaxation and increased range of motion and mobility . The exercises are simple and effective and produce various health benefits for the body and mind . <p> Aqua Cycling <p> Spinning is one of the best ways to get a heart-pumping cardio workout while creating strong , muscular legs . It may sound a bit strange , but some indoor cycling classes are taking their bikes and placing them under water for an entirely new cycling experience . Aqua Cyclinghas gained popularity in Europe and the trend is slowly making its way to the U.S. You wont be able to gain the same amount of speed in Aqua Cycling as you would in a traditional Spinning class , but you will get a high intensity cardio workout . The water resistance adds an entirely new strength-training element to a typical indoor cycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water is n't exactly a new concept , but its starting to make a comeback . The latest trends in Aqua Jogging even provide accessories such as exercise sandals and deep-water jogger belts to help make the workout more efficient . Aqua Jogging is a perfect addition to a runners normal training routine , as it takes away much of the impact that pavement or treadmill running adds to the joints . Since the pool environment takes away the normal element of gravity ( and you 're not touching the ground ) , you 'll have to work extra hard to increase your heart rate . Like any other water-based exercises , Aqua Jogging adds an additional element of resistance to strengthen and tone the muscles . <p> Lauren Martin is a NESTA certified personal trainer , Bodypump and spinning instructor .

@@98100090 @2300090/ <h> Moringa Extract is Not a Miracle Weight Loss Supplement <p> There 's another " miracle " weight loss supplement on the market and some are claiming it may be the new solution to our nations- obesity epidemic . Its called Moringa Extract and has been sold in other forms such as Moringa Oleifera , and its derived from the Moringa tree that 's grown in remote areas in Kenya , Ethiopia and the Hemilayas . This natural supplement is being praised by many for its amazing weight loss results without side effects . <p> Moringa is beneficial for humans because it stands heads and shoulders above the competition when compared to other dietary supplements . Some even claim it has the ability to help prevent more than 300 health conditions as it- contains an extremely high amount of vitamins , minerals and amino acids . <p> According to a news release at PR Web , it contains seven times the amount of vitamin C in oranges , four times the amount of calcium in milk , four times the amount of vitamin A in carrots , and two times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his show earlier this year saying it contains three times more iron than spinach and helped naturally boost energy . <p> Moringa is also thought to cause weight loss as its been found to slow the rate at which sugar is released into the bloodstream . This is beneficial because excess sugar turns into fat in the body which can lead to weight gain . In this way Moringa is able to naturally boost energy levels while simultaneously burning fat and promoting weight loss . <p> Consumers can take Moringa in capsule form or brew it as tea , a method Dr. Oz personally recommends . However , some believe that the supplement is not as potent in tea form as it is in capsule form so users may not see as great of results if opting for this method over a pill . <p> The Discovery Channel aired a segment several years ago that highlighted Moringa in a much different way than were seeing it advertised today in the U.S. Because the Moringa tree is grown in Africa where water and food are limited resources , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rich in vitamins and minerals. - In fact , - use of Moringa has reportedly slowed malnutrition in the many regions of Africa , which has led many to call it the " miracle tree . " And because the leaves , seeds and flowers are all edible and extremely beneficial , the tree is heavily utilized in these regions . <p> In Senegal , Africa it has been an essential ingredient to help counter malnutrition especially among children . The Moringa leaves are washed , dried and crushed with a mortar and pestle and the powder is then sifted like flour and used to sprinkle over dishes as a " spice . " Moringa is- also frequently used in India where its called the " drumstick tree . " Because the leaves are so rich in vitamin A it helps fight deficiencies that can lead to such serious conditions as blindness , which has reportedly reached near epidemic proportions in these areas . <p> Another beneficial use of Moringa is purifying water . Close to one-third of people worldwide do not have access to clean and dependable water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that Moringa seeds help purify the water and since production costs of the tree are so low and accessibility is so high , its becoming a solution to an otherwise devastating problem . <p> In regards to how effective Moringa is as a dietary supplement , DietsInReview.coms registered dietitian Mary Hartley , RD is skeptical . " Moringa is a highly nutritious , medicinal plant grown in the tropics with negligible calories but loaded with high-quality protein , essential fatty acids , and vitamins and minerals , as well as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents , " she said . " It is a versatile food for livestock and humans in third-world countries , but there is no scientific evidence of Moringa being a weight loss supplement . In fact , an agricultural study showed that cattle gained weight and increased milk production on a diet supplemented with Moringa leaves .

@@98100091 @2300091/ <h> Jump in to a Les Mills Bodypump Class to Reshape Your Body <p> When I initially decided to join a gym about ten years ago I pretty much only ever stayed in one very small area of the building : the cardio section . I would walk in , jump on the treadmill or elliptical trainer for about 45 minutes and leave . I was n't really sure what to do in the weight room and found it to be pretty intimidating , so I steered clear of it altogether . But then I got bored . I decided that I wanted to start doing exercise in the form of strength training to build some muscles ! And then one day , as if by fate , I noticed a flyer for a new class that the gym was offering : Les Mills Bodypump . <p> Bodypump is described as the original Les Mills barbell class and will sculpt , tone and strengthen your entire body , fast ! The classes use a specific formula of resistance trainingthat is referred to as " The Rep Effect . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads and high repetition movements for effective fat burning and production of lean muscle tissue . ( Or , in my own words it 's an hour of strength training combined with cardio moves that will kick your butt and re-shape your body . ) <p> Nervously , I decided to give Bodypump a try , and I loved- it ! Even though the class was nearly an hour long , it went by super quickly and I enjoyed every heart-pumping minute . I immediately became hooked and found myself faithfully attending the class three times a week . I loved it so much in fact that I eventually decided to become a certified Les Mills Bodypump instructor ! <p> A Les Mills Bodypump class is about 55 minutes long and focuses on working one muscle group at a time . Classes are choreographed to ten different tracks ( or songs ) and a new release comes out every three months . This keeps things fresh and the muscles " confused " ( for more effective muscle development ) . Even though the choreography and music change each quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm-up and ends with a cool-down . <p> In between the warm-up and cool-down are the squats , chest , back , triceps , biceps , lunges , shoulders and abs/core tracks- always in that order . The choreography is set to well-known , high-energy songs and movements work off the tempo of the music . You will leave the class feeling strong , accomplished and probably a little bit sweaty . <p> As both a participant and instructor in Les Mills Bodypump classes over the last six years , I can vouch for how effective the workouts can be . I have seen peoples bodies change dramatically and muscles develop over time as a result of taking the class a few times a week . The greatest thing about the class is that yes , you work really hard- but you have a lot of fun doing it ! <p> If you get bored with weightlifting ( or even if you do n't ) , this class is for you !

We absolutely do not want to see the tricep waddle ! A lot of curls and kickbacks may create some shape in your arms but they are not the most efficient way to build muscle and burn fat .

Superset those compound body weight exercises with a barbell or dumbbell exercise targeting the same muscle group(s) . For example , pair bench dips with tricep press downs or try cable curls after your pushups . Your goal is also to keep your heart rate up to help burn fat , so do n't rest in between paired exercises . <p> 3 . Do exercises and stretches for your posture . Rounded shoulders take away from the beauty of a defined upper body . If you sit at a computer all day , or have a job that requires you to be in a hunched over position , take stretch breaks . Stand up frequently , clasping your hands behind you with your index fingers pointing down and roll your shoulders back to stretch out your shoulders and open up your chest . <p> 4 . Train your upper body at least twice per week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back one day , chest and triceps the next " that hits each muscle group only one time per week . The female body needs to train differently to stimulate muscle change while burning fat at the same time .

Building gorgeous muscles means nothing if you ca n't see them for the fat layer on top . You also need good nutrition to help the muscle repair and rebuild . Clean out the junk food and make sure you eat plenty of lean protein , vegetables , fruit and healthy fats .

@@98100095 @2300095/ <h> Why You Should Add Run/Walk Intervals to Your Training Plan <p> Next time you see someone walking and running in different intervals , do n't assume they are a beginner runner . Jeff Galloway 's method recommends run/walk intervals for all runners , even veteran marathoners , because walk breaks speed up recovery and minimize muscle overuse . Walking , when used in alternating intervals , distributes the workload between more muscles . I have found , from personal experience and in working with clients , that this method increases performance , minimizes muscle breakdown over long miles and wards off injury . <p> This method is highly effective for people just starting to run ( even highly active people ) because it : <p> 1 ) Increases cardiovascular stamina , allowing you to exercise for longer than if you were to go out and only run . <p> 2 ) Builds up your cardiovascular endurance without injury or discouragement . <p> Helps to erase the weak-links in muscles and joints that cause those pesky runner injuries : runner 's knee , ITB issues and Achilles tendinitis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardiovascular endurance . <p> How to Begin <p> Measure your intervals in minutes and figure out what works for you " there 's no set run/walk minute interval pace that you need to follow to do this correctly . It 's about listening to your body . If you are off the couch , start slowly an injury will only hamper your progress . Your run/walk might be 1:3 ( 1 minute running and 3 minutes walking ) . If you are highly active and just starting to run , you might want to try 5:2 or 7:2 intervals . If you are a seasoned runner , try walking for 30 seconds every mile . Find which run/walk interval works for you and your pace . <p> There are two key points to effectively incorporate walking in to your runs : <p> Walk briskly during the walk segments . Maintain a fast pace during your walk intervals in order to stay in an aerobic zone " you do n't want your body to start cooling down . This is not a break from the run , rather a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a run , meaning before your muscles fatigue . This allows your muscles to recover instantly during the walk intervals . If you wait too long to incorporate them , you 'll end up walking too slowly and it will be difficult to start running again . <p> Effort <p> I recommend that beginners aim for a conversational pace during the run intervals . If you start to feel like you are losing control of your breathing , slow down . Intermediate and advanced runners should aim for their pace , for example , race effort , easy pace or long run pace , depending on the type of run in their training plan . Remember , the walk is a fast walk for every level of runner , not a leisurely stroll . <p> Tools <p> I recommend buying the Gymboss because it alerts you , via a beep or vibration , when the interval is up .

Its apparent that middle class women are the primary demographic growing curious about this popular diet for their health and weight loss goals . <p> What is the Paleo Diet ? <p> The Paleo Diet , also known as the Caveman Diet , permits only foods that were consumed during the Paleolithic era , roughly 10,000 years ago .

When searching the aisles of the grocery store , make sure to be aware of tricky labels such as " fresh " or " natural . " They do n't  necessarily indicate a Paleo-friendly food . Also , " Double check the ingredients and expiration dates before buying any food , " she said . " If you cant see or smell it , how do you know how fresh it is ?

@@98100107 @2300107/ <h> How to Avoid the Thanksgiving Food Coma <p> Who here has n't  had suffered from a food coma a time or two ? Well , some history is not worth repeating . Take it from me , you can have fun , enjoy all the Thanksgiving harvest , and still fit into your jeans the next day . But how do you avoid this whole " food coma " thing ? It starts with understanding what makes you feel that way . There 's a couple things going on and its hormonal . <p> Tryptophan , Serotoninand Melatonin <p> Tryptophan is an essential amino acid ( protein building block the body can not make ) . It is high in many protein rich foods , like turkey . Tryptophan helps build muscle like other amino acids , but it is also a specific precursor of serotonin . Nearly all serotonin is in the gut where it regulates GI movement , but about 20% is actually dispersed in the central nervous system ( CNS ) where it regulates mood , appetite , sleep , muscle contraction , and some cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melatonin , which regulates your sleep/wake cycles . <p> Besides turkey , your starchy foods like rolls , potatoes and stuffing have something to do with the " food coma " that ensues . The insulin your pancreas releases after eating carbs does its job , which is partially to pull essential amino acids into muscle ( yay for muscle building ) , but there is one lonely amino acid that does n't  go into cells- tryptophan . This amino acid did n't  get an invite to the party , and so left alone in the blood it increases serotonin levels and sleep eventually comes along . <p> Perhaps the real question is " Who cares ? What 's wrong with enjoying a hearty meal with family and napping yourself into a more relaxed and carefree state , at least for a day ? " If you ask me , we do n't  really rest enough and enjoy our families as we should . Our inability to slow down does more to wreck our weight management hormones than one gut-busting , coma-inducing turkey dinner . Nevertheless , your best bet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to enjoy food and the urge to overeat . <p> Heres are some Turkey Day Eating Tips : <p> Most meals are 1000+ calories per plate ! So stick to one plate , and that 's it . Include some green vegetables on that plate . Take a little of everything that looks good and enjoy each bite .

Fun fact : some of the- celebrities that love Zumba- are Jennifer Lopez , Madonna , and Jordin Sparks . <p> Hip-hopHip-hopis one of the most exercise-friendly music genres so there are tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beats and fun rhythms are just right for vigorous dance moves and the combination makes for a truly great workout . Even without taking a dance class , turning on hip-hop music and dancing to it in the privacy of your own home can even be a great alternative to being in a class . Fun fact : there are great hip-hop workout DVDs that can help you get into the groove . <p> Ballet Ballet is another dance alternative to working out in a more usual way . Taking part in a ballet class can teach you control , balance and flexibility and help you sculpt leaner , stronger muscles . Toe shoes are probably out for anyone starting out over age 15 or so , but were guessing that if you were a childhood ballet dancer your grace and memory of the French terms will come right back . And , even if you never had dreams of- starring in a production of The Nutcracker you can still try out the dance style in a class or at home . <p> Pole Dancing I know it sounds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort zones , but if you grab some girlfriends and some confidence , pole dancing classes can be a really fun way to work out . Pole dancing is great for- upper body strength , core strength , coordination , and balance . Not to mention confidence ! Fun fact : Britney Spears and Eva Longoria are just two ladies who have admitted to loving pole dance workouts . <p> Jessica Tholmer is a Pacific Northwest-loving young lady with an obsessive personality . She loves , to the extreme , rap music , the movie Titanic , red wine , Friends , her real friends , The Simpsons , her brothers , eating healthy with a side of ice cream , her charming boyfriend , and crying at commercials . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

@@98100123 @2300123/ <p> Eat your cookies and lose weight ? Sounds like a diet dream come true . Dr. Siegal 's Cookie Diet plan is a program that helps you to lose weight while munching on his low-fat and protein-filled cookies , which are also specially-formulated to suppress appetite via its secret recipe of key ingredients . <p> For more than 30 years , Dr. Siegal has been preparing , baking and distributing these cookie snacks to help people manage their weight loss goals . He still continues to personally mixes every batch of his proprietary protein formula in his private bakery near his Miami medical clinic . <p> Here is how The Cookie Diet works : <p> You eat six of these specially-formulated cookies during the day in addition to one meal eaten at the end of the day . A typical day is comprised of about 800 calories and 70 grams of carbohydrates . You can also eat the cookies in conjunction with another diet . <p> In April of 2011 , Dr. Siegal 's announced a new weight loss plan , called Dr. Siegal 's Plan 10X . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one or two should be eaten every two hours , up to 9 cookies per day at set times . The classic plan is also still available . <p> In addition to cookies , Dr. Siegal also has a line of shakes and soups . By following this very low-calorie diet plan you can expect to lose up to 15 pounds in one month . Dr. Siegel 's cookies are available for purchase online , through professional resellers , drug stores , doctors or at one of Dr. Siegel 's retail store locations . <p> Dr. Siegel 's Cookie Diet may not be a long-term solution to weight loss <p> Meal-replacement diets rarely result in sustained weight loss 10974 @qwx870974 <p> On The Cookie Diet , you will eat six cookies throughout the day in addition to one meal at the end of the day . That meal should include six ounces of lean white meat protein and one cup of vegetables . <p> The diet 1000-1200 calories a day . Each cookie contains 90 calories and each dinner should contain no more than 500 calories . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then look no further than The Cookie Doctor Cookbook , which offers 120 recipes that do n't exceed 500 calories . <p> In addition , you should consume eight glasses of liquid a day ( ideally water ) . Coffee and tea are allowed on this diet . There are five varieties of Dr. Siegal 's cookies that you can choose from : chocolate , oatmeal raisin , coconut , banana , and blueberry . <p> While the ingredients are all-natural , and the ingredients label full of things you 'd recognize or be able to pronounce , there is some concern with a few inclusions . For one , the first ingredient is sugar , with 9 grams in a serving . Next , the cookies are almost completely void of the dietary fiber , with less than a gram per serving , a necessity in satiation . However , in our interview with Dr. Seigal , he sites a " particular mix of proteins " as being key to keeping users feeling full . Finally , it should be noted that the cookies are relatively low in sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> EXERCISE <p> Dr. Siegal claims that if you eat his 1,000-calorie a day cookie diet than you can effectively lose weight while doing very little or no aerobic exercise . But he does encourage exercise for weight loss maintenance . <p> CONCLUSION <p> On the face of it , the idea of a " Cookie Diet " sounds a bit bizarre but enticing . Dr. Siegel 's Cookies are on par to meal replacement shakes that pack nutrition in a quantity-controlled product . Critics feel that the diet is too restrictive and too low in calories despite the thousands of people who have had success in losing weight on Dr. Siegel 's Cookie Diet . Since the plan is so rigid , speak with your doctor if you are interested in following this diet . 10970 @qwx870970 <p> ( Page 1 of 10 , 188 total comments ) <p> Katrina <p> + <p> OK , so two weeks ago I started the diet , four days in a lost 3kgs !

@@98100124 @2300124/ <h> Subway Diet Review : Do n't Buy Before You Read This ! <h> Sandwiches helped Jared keep off the weight for 10 years . Can you ? 10971 @qwx870971 <p> The Subway Diet is a weight loss diet that claims you can lose weight by eating primarily only Subway sandwiches . It was popularized by a spokesperson named Jared Fogle , but the Subway Company has never endorsed this officially . <p> Jared Fogle once weighed 425 pounds , and he claimed to have lost 245 pounds within 11 months . He also had serious obesity related illnesses , but was able to make drastic changes . In reviewing weight loss diets our review experts found the 18Shake Diet to be the best overall . Its made up of a fat burning diet pill and an appetite suppressing meal replacement shake . Discover more about the 18Shake Diet by clicking the link here . 10975 @qwx870975 <h> Subway Diet Quality of Ingredients <p> There are some wholesome ingredients since one can add a lot of vegetables and lean meats to ones sandwich . However , there 's also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheap sweeteners to the bread , sauces , dips , and some preserved vegetables . <p> Some of these ingredients like fructose can make weight loss more difficult . There 's also the addition of additives which have not been shown to be the best for overall health . <h> The Price and Quality of Subway Diet <p> Prices can vary on the type of sandwiches one chooses , and it also depends on what kind of toppings one chooses . On average , a foot long sub costs around $6 . Therefore , at 2 subs a day this would cost $12 a day or $360 for 30 days . <p> Some of these ingredients are n't  very wholesome , and there is heavy use of many processed additives . <p> It can also be difficult to have to eat mostly sandwiches until one achieves weight loss . There 's also the issue of this diet not being very structured . At just 2 sandwiches a day and whatever meal one wants later in the day , its still possible for one to eat excess calories . <h> Business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the official company of Subway . Instead , their one time spokesperson Jared Fogle claimed he lost weight by eating 2 subway sandwiches a day and introducing walking . <p> Whether or not one will be able to achieve these same results depends on numerous factors . <p> Its worth noting that any reduced calorie diet can lead to some weight loss , but to only eat sandwiches one might not receive all the necessary nutrients . This is why the actually company Subway has not promoted this as an alternative to any other weight loss diet . <h> Conclusion - Does Subway Diet Work ? <p> The Subway Diet is promoted by a former spokesperson but is n't an actual diet created by the owners of Subway . While one can lose weight while eating low calorie subs , this depends largely on what kind of sandwiches one chooses . Some people gained weight while others did have some weight loss changes . There 's also the use of processed ingredients and cheap additives such as fructose . 10970 @qwx870970 <p> ( Page 1 of 2 , 32 total comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " buy one get one free " 6 in. sub coupon and was quite disappointed when I was charged for a 30 0z.

Once in a while I have a cookie , though I generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canned soup instead , and once a McD 's Quarter Pounder with salad instead of fries . <p> I have either the veggie or the BMT - always get cheese - and have a half-portion of the Subway Viniagrette .

I also get foot longs because they 're cheaper that way , but ask for them to be wrapped separately so I wo n't be tempted to eat more than a half sandwich at a time . <p> All diet drinks , lots of ice , try to move a little more ( working up to actual exercise - my knees are utter junk ) . So far I feel really , really good about this . <p> Oh , and I 'm using the free version of Happy Scale to keep me focused and on track .

For one , you should only get a 6inch . A 12inch has too many calories . Two , choose something relatively low in calories and fat like turkey , roast-beef , veggie , or roasted chicken . Or you can have it made into a salad . You drop 200 calories by losing the bread . Substitute mayo for mustard . Say " no " to cheese . Eating like this plus exercising , and you can lose weight . Just choose wisely and exercise and it is a good plan . Those who say it does n't work are not either choosing their sandwiches wisely , not exercising , not staying with it , or are splurging later . <p> posted May 3rd , 2010 12:32 pm <p> thomas <p> - <p> another day and still have n't lost weight and all hope in subway is going way down . but i will be still trying to lose weight but i still think that it is n't going to work and jared is really lucky <p> posted Apr 16th , 2010 10:44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have been eating subway for 5 weeks and still have n't lost weight <p> posted Apr 15th , 2010 8:32 am <p> Shaun <p> I think that the Subway Diet can work for some people , however the whole issue of dieting is an area that attracts a lot of debate .

At Hot Bird Running , we give every runner 3-5 days of core exercises within their weekly plan . This is both preventative and strength building . <p> The core , comprised of the transverse abdominal muscles ( deep abs ) , obliques , erector spinea ( lower back muscles ) , and gluteal muscles ( your butt ) , provides you with stability , power and endurance . If your core is weak , it can lead to poor running patterns , i.e. overstriding , understriding , or a pelvis that swings from side to side , and eventually injury . As a result , you are more susceptible to lower back , hamstring and knee injuries with a weak core . <p> The moves below help prevent injury , make you a stronger runner , and help make running more enjoyable . Aim for two sets of each exercise 3-5 times a week . <p> Plank Strengthens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Begin by lying face down , resting on your forearms .

She bravely opened up on her Tumblr page with what she 's calling the " 7 Biggest Mistakes I Made after Loser . " <p> She was one of the heaviest contestants in the shows history , and one of the most inspiring with a loss of 225 pounds . Now , at the start of a new year , Shay finds herself moving forward with her weight loss journey once again . <p> In her post she says " I have begun to refocus my direction . I am in therapy and finding my way again . While I am not as heavy as I was starting out on Loser , I am no where close to my finale weight at the culmination of my transformation . " <p> She cites many factors for finding herself in this position , seven to be exact , and is n't placing the blame anywhere but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute much of my relapse to the seven biggest mistakes I have made post-Loser . " <p> In speaking up , and especially those who are in a similar situation , Shay says " If I can help any of you out there from joining me here at the bottom of the slope then I have done my first good deed of 2012 . " <p> Where exactly did she go wrong ? Its never one thing , or one day , or one choice . Its a lot of things that always add up . The " seven deadly sins of weight loss " that Shay calls out are summarized here . <p> 1 . I stopped measuring . Measuring portions , with a scale or a measuring cup , is a fool-proof way to control how much you 're eating . That is , until you start relying on " eyeballing " measurements , which Shay found herself doing . <p> 2 . I took a break . Someone close to Shay advised that she take a break after she left The Ranch to give her body a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wound up regretting it . She says what she should have done , and what others should do , is to try something new , change the intensity , but do n't  just stop . Shes working on getting her groove back . <p> 3 . I stopped journaling my food . The practice of food journaling is key in so many weight loss journeys , and it was for Shay . She lost her BodyBugg account when Biggest Loser ended , and started relying on FitBook by Fitlosophy . She advises that people use whichever tool , be it a simple notebook or an iPhone app , that suits their needs best . <p> 4. - I did n't listen to my body . She stubbornly fought to run the NY Marathon , with a cash prize waiting for her from Subway , despite all medical advise to forgo the intense running . She ended up injured and set back from doing any workouts at all . <p> 5 . I thought I would be OK on my own . She let go of the support network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loser family , and even turned away from family and friends . She thought she could do it on her own , but wound up learning that everyone , no matter how independent , needs those relationships to help them meet their goals . <p> 6 . I started caring more about what others thought of me . Too wrapped up in what others thought of her , and a fear of letting family , friends , and fans down , Shay slipped from the spotlight . She turned down appearances , and even denied ever being on Biggest Loser . <p> 7 . I stopped caring . Going on autopilot was one of the worst things Shay could do for herself . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

@@98100159 @2300159/ <h> 7 Facts About GMOs to Convince You to Vote Yes on 37 <p> Surely you 've been hearing the buzz about GMOs by now. - As the vote in California is just around the corner , many more groups are talking about this controversial topic . In case you are n't sure what all the talk is about , the California ballot next month will ask voters to pass a law to require labeling of GMOs , or Genetically Modified Organisms . If you have n't decided where you stand about this subject , here are 7 facts about GMOs we hope will persuade you to vote Yes on 37 . <p> 1 . A GMO is a Food with Altered DNA . Before we get too caught up in the details , let 's start at the beginning and define what a GMO is . GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism . Much of our food supply is comprised of these organisms . A genetically modified food is a plant or meat that has had its DNA altered in a lab . Genes from other plants or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . This is all done in order to yield larger crops , allow the crop to resist insects , protect against viruses , and tolerate herbicides . This is all done in hopes to create bigger profits and lower costs to consumers . <p> 2 . The US is a Global Leader in GMO Crops . According to USA Today , the US leads the world in GMO crop planting . We planted 170 million acres in 2012 . That yielded 95% of the country 's sugar beets , 94% of the soybeans , 90% of the cotton , and 88% of the feed corn . <p> 4. 61 Countries Require GMO Labels , but Not the US . The US does not have labels indicating which products contain GMOs . However , 61 other countries across the globe do have such requirements . Australia , Brazil , China , Russia , Japan , Spain , and the UK are just a few of the many countries that label their GMO products . Yet , the US is one of the few developed nations that does not give that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $34 Million Spent on No on 37 by Leading Health Food Brands . The state of California has the issue of labeling GMOs on their ballot this November . Interestingly , many companies are paying big money to campaign against labeling . Monsanto is against labels , as they are one of the biggest biotech companies in the world . They are leading seemingly health conscious companies like Kashi , Silk , and Horizon Organics inspending $34,440,286 in anti-labeling campaigning . <p> 6 . GMO Ingredients Linked to Allergens . Foods comprised of GMO ingredients or meats and dairy that have been fed GMO feed have been linked to an increase in allergens and immune system compromises , especially in children . These facts have been gathered by independent studies , as the government does not require testing on these products . While they insist GMOs are safe , there 's no long-term evidence to back up those claims . <p> 7 . This Summers Sweet Corn was First Produce to be GMO . Before this summer , there were no commercial GMO produce items in our stores , consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . However , this summer Monsanto 's sweet corn became the first commercially distributed genetically modified produce to be sold to the public . It was placed in the produce bins with no label and no way for consumers to know what they were eating . <p> There are pages and pages of things to know about GMOs . Hopefully these 7 facts can start clearing up your first questions and enable you to know what 's going on with the food you buy in your stores . We encourage you to make an educated vote next month , and for the sake of all of our health , vote yes on 37. 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978 
@@98100161 @2300161/ <p> In case you were wondering why the ads for fast-food fish increase this time of year here 's your answer . Catholics started Lent on Wednesday , a 40-day observance wherein an individual fasts or abstains from something worldly , including abstinence from meat on Fridays . Catholics are permitted fish , and the restaurant industry takes full advantage . While grabbing a fish sandwich from a drive-thru seems innocent enough considering how healthful fish can be , those combos are often no better than the cheeseburgers . <p> Once you batter , fry , slather with mayo , and stuff fish inside a big white , starchy bun , you 're left with alarmingly high sodium and diet-crushing calorie counts . <p> We scanned restaurant menus to organize a list of the healthiest fish sandwiches , but our direction had to change when we could n't find any . That 's right the fast food industry fails when it comes to serving a sandwich that meets our nutritional criteria , which is 500 calories and 500 milligrams of sodium or less for a meal . A couple come close with modifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . <p> McDonalds Filet OFish Sandwich " wins " for the " healthier " fast food fish sandwich , as long as you ditch the cheese and maybe even the tartar sauce . The Long John Silvers grilled salmon option is the best meal we found , and you even get to order corn with it ! And for cold sandwiches , Panera barely wins with its tuna sandwich ( barely because the sodium is still too high ) . <p> Take a look at the break down of eight of the most popular fast food restaurants and why you should avoid their fish menu . If you 've got to go meatless on Friday , consider their vegetarian options or just pack a lunch ! <p> McDonalds Filet OFish Sandwich <p> As is , the sandwich barely misses the cut-off for our sodium qualifier , with 390 calories and 590 milligrams of sodium . However , just removing the cheese brings this sandwich back down to 360 calories and 490 milligrams of sodium . To really trim it back , remove the cheese and tartar sauce for 270 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fries and a " healthier " fast food lunch is served . Another win for McDonalds theyve committed to sustainable seafood . <p> Long John Silvers <p> For a place known for fried drops of batter , they have one of the better fast-food fish meals around . Order the Grilled Pacific Salmon , which comes with two pieces , for 150 calories and 440 milligrams of sodium . You can even add an unbuttered corn cob for 90 calories and 0 sodium ! <p> Burger Kings Premium Alaskan Fish Sandwich <p> This is one of the worst offenders . It starts at 590 calories and 1480 milligrams of sodium pushing it outside the bounds of what we consider a healthier fast food meal . Remove the tartar sauce and you get within the calories at 410 , but the sodium still borders an entire days worth at 1240mg . Even losing the bun wont save this catch of the day . <p> Wendys Premium Cod Sandwich <p> This big fish sandwich is n't much better than the others with 510 calories and 970 milligrams of sodium . While removing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 , its still too high on sodium at 810 milligrams . <p> Panera Bread <p> This restaurant has a deceiving health halo . They print calorie counts on their menu and most consumers would be surprised to see what those totals are . The half tuna sandwich on honey wheat is one of the better options at 250 calories , but as fast food has a way of doing , the sodium is high at 580 milligrams . Make our Healthy Tuna Salad instead and pack a lunch . <p> Subway 6 ? Tuna Sub <p> A tuna sandwich seems benign enough , and Subway manages to keep it mostly in check with 470 calories . Its the 620 milligrams of sodium that disqualify this lunch from our list . If you could have it made without the mayo , and just top tuna with fresh veggies , you 'd be better off . But its pretty standard that this salad is pre-made . <p> Quiznos <p> The small Lobster and Seafood Salad is fine calorie wise with 460 , but the sodium is off the chart with 1090 milligrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence nutrition changes , so were not sure how to improve this one . <p> The small tuna sandwich is the healthier option , just barely exceeding our sodium qualification with 590 milligrams and 420 calories . <p> Jasons Deli <p> We appreciate the clean , wholesome foods that Jasons Deli serves , and especially their commitment to organics . But they fall very short when it comes to fish . The Wild Salmon-wich has 670 calories with 1000 milligrams of sodium , and the tuna melt is worse with 900 calories and 1140 milligrams of sodium .

Once tipping the scales at nearly 300 pounds , Sharpton is now well below the 200-pound mark and credits his dramatic transformation primarily to a- vegetarian diet . <p> Sharpton is no newcomer to the vegetarian scene . He began appearing on behalf of PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) as early as 2006 to raise awareness about the maltreatment of chickens , specifically within the KFC corporation . <p> That same year Sharpton was awarded the PETA Humanitarian Award . During his acceptance speech at the New York City gala , he shed more light on his clean eating habits . <p> " Avoiding meat is the way to eat for anyone with a highly-charged life , " he said .

He also touted his new-found appreciation for fruit and vegetables , which now make up a great majority of his diet . <p> It seems Sharptons dietary changes have paid off big time . As of late last year the reverend speculated that he was down to 180 or 185 pounds a considerable difference from his heaviest weight of 305 pounds . Its even been rumored that Sharpton is now resting at a much slimmer 167 pounds , which is a huge change for a man who used to eat chicken three times a day . <p> These days Sharpton hits the gym at 6 a.m. most mornings for a rigorous workout that typically includes a 10 minute bike ride and a 30 minute run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruits and vegetables to stay full and forgoes late-night eating to stay trim . <p> Fellow prominent figure in the African American community , Chaka Khan , joined Sharpton at the BET Awards this summer also looking much slimmer after a 60-plus pound weight loss .

Only in recent years have I let the sweet , orange variety reign supreme in my heart over traditional white potatoes .

@@98100173 @2300173/ <p> If you have never heard the term " health halo " before , you are not alone . In fact , this buzz phrase is not used all that often in common conversation ; however , it is something dietitians use once in a while to explain the effect certain foods have on our overall healthy meal perceptions . <p> The term " health halo " has actually been around for quite a few years . In fact , a few researchers from Cornell in 2007 brought up the issue of health halos and some of the fast food restaurants that wear them in an effort to identify why the obesity epidemic continues despite the fact that more " healthified " foods seem to become available by the day . <p> At first , you may be confused by what the term actually means , but when you think about it , its actually a clever way to identify foods that claim to be more than what they really are . For example , foods that carry a low-fat claim may cause someone to identify them as healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food is healthy or not , believing that it is may cause inhibitions to be lowered and result in eating more and underestimating calories all at the same time . Foods that cause this to happen are considered to be under a " health halo " and you want to watch out for these if weight loss or maintenance is a primary goal for you . <p> If identifying health halos seems like a challenge , do n't  worry ! There are many ways to not let that pesky halo get the best of you . <p> Do n't  Classify Foods as Good , Bad , Healthy , or Unhealthy . Food is just food . Your body needs it for energy and you need to choose the ones that are going to provide you the best quality nutrients . That being said , you have to view all of what you eat on an even playing field . Use good judgement when deciding what to eat and choose foods that you know are going to provide the most bang for your buck . Avoid labeling foods as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap instead view the food for what it is and decide whether its worth utilizing calories for or not . <p> Read Food Labels . To eat well , you have to know what you are eating . Although flashy claims and bright-colored stickers may cover the front of your food package , remember that these do n't  tell the whole story . Flip the package around and check the nutrition facts panel and the ingredient list . Use this information to decide whether this food is a good choice or not . <p> Do n't  Barter Your Calories . Health halos often make less-healthy choices more appealing . Afterall , if you saved a few calories on the main course , surely a large piece of chocolate cake is fine , right ? Not necessarily . Having a " this for that " mentality can often cause you to go overboard on calories without even realizing it . Plus , you could be missing out on some of those nutrients your body needs by swapping calories from lunch for a piece of chocolate cake . <p> Portion Sizes Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you eat an ultra-mega-super-sized salad with all the fixins its probably past the point of healthy . Keep portion sizes in proportion and look for tools to help you identify what a real portion size looks like . Often they are much smaller than what we imagine them to be ! <p> Bottom Line : Health halos can cause a false sense of security in your food choices . Instead of buying into the latest food claim , be food savvy . Read labels , keep meal sizes in check , incorporate foods rich in nutrients as often as you can , and remember that if something seems too good to be true , it probably is . <p> Kati Mora , RD is a private-practice dietitian in Michigan .

No matter how your food is grown , if its shipped from across the U.S. or even from another country , that 's a long way for your food to travel . <p> Locally grown foods are fresher because they do n't  have to be picked before they 're ripe for shipping , and are less likely to be subjected to different means of preserving freshness .

According to the United States Department of Agriculture , there are at least 6,132 farmers markets operating in the U.S. , a 16 percent increase over the past year .

If you cant find someone in the store , consider calling . If the grocery store employees do n't  know , the food probably does n't  come from anywhere nearby . <p> Join a CSA CSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture , and is another way to get fresh produce directly from your farmer . You essentially buy a " share " in a farm , and they will deliver you fresh produce as its harvested . Different CSAs have slightly different systems , some will deliver food each week and use a bi-weekly schedule . <p> Reconnect with the Seasons Part of eating locally will automatically mean you 're eating more seasonally too . Do you really need to eat spring asparagus all winter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Do a little research , and be adventurous . <p> Find a Farm Wouldnt it be nice to see where your food really comes from ? This is particularly good if you want to see how livestock are being treated . Even if you live in an urban area , the nearest farm may be closer than you think . Look for a farm that offers U-Pick and plan a fun outing that even your kids can enjoy . Frequent Locally Owned Food Producers Restaurants , bakeries and even grocery stores are often proud of supporting local agriculture . This is also a good way to find some prepared foods made from locally produced ingredients , like bread , cheese and yogurt . <p> Grow Your Own What could be fresher than food grown in your own backyard ?

@@98100193 @2300193/ <p> Pepsi Special contains dextrin , " a type of functional fiber , ' " explained our resident dietitian , Mary Hartley , RD .

They act as prebiotics , undigested fibers that feed the friendly bacteria in the colon .

Dextrin can be found in glue products as well , but its not safe to consume in that form .

Probably not . <p> " Pepsi Special is a gimmick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " calls out Hartley . <p> Products like this just fool consumers in to thinking they 're doing something better for themselves while maintaining a long-held habit . Companies like Pepsi need to do a better job of removing harmful and unhealthy ingredients before they try to mask existing products . <p> Harmful and unhealthy ingredients in Pepsi Special include phosphoric acid , sugar , and caffeine . Phosphoric acid weakens the bones because it reduces calcium levels in the body . Sugar is an unhealthy ingredient that causes tooth decay and weight gain ; unfortunately , most soda companies , Pepsi included , rely on high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar . Caffeine is addictive and it can cause an individual to become dizzy and irritable , as well as cause a person to have trouble sleeping and have headaches . <p> If you want to reap the benefits of fiber in your diet , as with most foods , its better to eat it than drink it . <p> Hartley points out that , " The best way to increase soluble fiber is to eat more vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains at every meal . The natural fiber in those foods will create a feeling of fullness , while providing healthy nutrients at the same time , without the empty ( and expensive ) calories from sugar in soda . " <p> She does n't  expect consumers of Pepsi Special to notice a feeling of fullness after drinking the new soda . In fact , the results might not be pleasant at all .

As we enter the most popular season for dieting , I wanted to arm you with the good side and bad side of carbs , before you fall into one of those low-carb fad diets and refuse to ever eat bread again ! You might be surprised to learn that there are a lot of healthy benefits to eating the right kind of carbs . <p> Benefits of Carbohydrates <p> When you eat a carbohydrate , your body breaks it down into a simpler form known as glucose . <p> Glucose ( for immediate energy ) and its storage form glycogen ( reserve energy ) provide about half of all the energy muscles and other body tissues use ( the brain depends 100% on glucose for its energy ) . The other half of the body 's energy comes from mostly fat. - We now know that carbohydrates are n't  all good or all bad . Some promote health while others , when eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes and heart disease . <p> They also come in a variety of forms , most common and abundant forms are sugars , fibers , and starches . <p> Carbohydrates were once grouped into two main categories : <p> Simple carbohydrates included sugars such as fruit sugar ( fructose ) , corn or grape sugar ( dextrose or glucose ) , and table sugar ( sucrose ) . <p> Complex carbohydrates included everything made of three or more linked sugars . Complex carbohydrates were thought to be the healthiest to eat , while simple carbohydrates werent so great . <p> Common Misconception of Carbohydrates <p> Many people mistakenly think of carbs as " fattening " and avoid them when trying to lose weight . Such a strategy may be helpful if the carbohydrates are simple sugars ( soda , candy , etc. ) , but it is counterproductive if the carbs are complex carbohydrates ( whole grains , legumes , etc . ) . <p> Glycemic response , which is how quickly glucose is absorbed after a person eats , indicates how high the blood glucose rises , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to classify carbohydrates based on how quickly and how high they boost blood sugar compared to pure glucose . <p> Slow absorption is desirable , a modest rise in blood glucose , and a smooth return to normal ( low glycemic response ) . <p> Fast absorption is less desirable , a surge in blood glucose , and an overreaction that plunges glucose below normal ( high glycemic response ) . <p> Different foods have different effects on blood glucose . <p> Foods with a high glycemic index , like white bread , cause rapid spikes in blood sugar . Low glycemic foods , like whole oats , are digested more slowly , causing a lower and gentler change in blood sugar . <p> Which Carbs Should You Eat ? <p> Choose whole grains and whole-wheat options <p> Start your day off with whole grains . Hot cereal fan ? Try old-fashioned or steel-cut oats. - Like cold cereals more ? Look for one that lists whole wheat , whole oats , or other whole grain first on the ingredient list . <h> 3 Responses to What Everyone Needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbohydrates . I visit a lot of low-carb websites and just do n't  believe everyone should avoid carbs like the plague . <p> The glycemic index is a little less helpful to me . The index was designed to express the blood glucose response to foods eaten alone , such as slice of white bread . When you eat that slice with eggs and bacon , the response is much different . <p> I weighed in at 233 ( my MAX ! ) last July with an allergic reaction to another blood pressure med . Since I am running out of options on bp meds I can take I commented to the doctor that I probably would n't NEED them if I dropped 60 pounds . So here I go !

The answer in all of this is fiber , specifically psyllium fiber . <p> " Its the kind that creates the bulk , " Keri Glassman , MS , RD , CDN told us . Shes a renowned dietitian who breaks down the science in to bite-sized morsels of nutrition information real people can actually use . <p> She explained that women should be consuming about 25-38 grams of fiber every day , while we typically get about half of that .

As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributes to a lack of fiber . These meals rarely have whole grains nor do they have ample serving sizes of fruits and vegetables ( a thin slice of tomato on a burger hardly counts ) . Therefore we simply " do n't  get enough fiber , " said Keri . <p> There are two ways to fix this , and both endorsed by this nutrition expert and author of Slim Calm Sexy Diet adding more fiber-rich foods to your diet and a fiber supplement like Konsyl Fiber . <p> She makes adding more fiber-rich foods sound as simple as stirring in a spoonful of fiber powder to a smoothie or soup , and honestly it probably is . <p> But Keri also suggests starting with breakfast , where a high-fiber/whole-grain cereal is a great choice , as is eating actual whole grains like quinoa or oatmeal . ( We have a wonderful Fig &amp; Honey Breakfast Quinoa recipe in our Bakers Dozen eCookbook . ) She also suggests swapping your bagel for a whole wheat piece of toast or whole wheat toaster waffle ( DIR likes Vans frozen waffles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protein and fiber with a serving of fresh fruit and a handful of nuts ( think apple slices and pistachios or almonds ) . You could also snack on fresh veggies , like carrot and cucumber sticks , dipped in nut butter . <p> At lunch or dinner , Keris swap suggestions just make sense while adding some wonderful flavor to your meals . Consider replacing mayonnaise with hummus for more fiber . Avocado can replace cheese , adding more fiber and swapping in a heart-healthy fat . Top yogurt with ground flaxseed and nuts . Be sure to eat the skins on baked potatoes or sweet potatoes , which offer a lot of fiber . Toss chickpeas in a salad for another flavorful fiber boost . <p> Konsyl Fiber is a healthful solution if after all of that you 're still not reaching your fiber needs .

Keri recommends 3 grams of fiber for a serving of bread and 10 grams of fiber for cereal ( or , more than 7 grams of fiber , less than 7 grams of sugar ) . With the number of cereals on the market , she says this is totally doable . <p> As you head in to the busiest time of year and your weight becomes more of a concern , be sure to get enough fiber every day so that you 're satiated and satisfied and avoid those snack attack pitfalls. 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

@@98100203 @2300203/ <h> How to Survive an Ultra Marathon <p> Because completing my first Olympic distance triathlon was not enough , I decided to follow up a week later with my first ultra marathon a 50K ( 31 mile ) trail race in The North Face Endurance Challenge series ! If you 're surprised , trust me , I was too ! I actually thought I was competing in a 20-miler ! But , you know what , when it came down to it , I trusted myself and my nutrition fueling plan . I just committed to having fun . <p> here 's how I survived my ultra marathon : <p> Carb-load Carbs are gasoline for the body and you cant attempt a 50K without putting gas in the tank . I had two cups of whole wheat pasta with marinara sauce and some salted steak fries the night before my run . <p> Early riser breakfast I woke at 4 a.m. for a 7 a.m. start and I noshed on a toasted plain bagel with almond butter , a banana , and water . <p> Drink early and often Always run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cool weather less than an hour , but after that I 'd choose a sports beverage . I gulped on 3-4 ounces of the sports drink every 2 miles ( 20-22 minutes ) , even if I did n't  feel thirsty . The number one health risk in an ultra marathon is dehydration . You prevent it by drinking from start to finish of your races and training run . <p> Eat on the run I had my last meal at 6 a.m. and crossed the finish line at about 1:30 p.m . That 's a long time to go without any nutrition . This is one of the things that makes ultra distance trail running different than other races , you spend more time at your rest stops and you get bits of food that help you delay fatigue and stay energized . I usually go for what looks appetizing and I favor salty foods over sweet , mainly because my sports drink is so sweet that the salty foods are a happy change . <p> Not only that , but the longer you engage in outdoor activity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is common for a heavy sweater to lose 1,000-2,500 milligrams of sodium per hour , and up to 5,000 mg sodium in a hot environment . I had 1/2-1 cup of chicken soup or broth at miles 15 , 19 , 25 , and 28 and I honestly think it boosted me the entire time . The salty broth made me want to keep drinking between stops . I also enjoyed a boiled potato dipped in rock salt at one point along the journey . Other items on my list included cola , pretzels , and frozen oranges . Between rest stops , I chewed on cola flavored Powerbar gummies with 50 milligrams of caffeine ( which actually gives a bit of an athletic performance boost ) . <p> Non-runners might be reading this and thinking " How can this stuff be good for you ? Isnt it what you are supposed to avoid ? " That 's a mistake you do n't  want to make if you venture into distance running . It can be very challenging and rewarding , but people who ignore the basics of hydrating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cramping , heat illnesses or the dreaded DNF ( did not finish ) . <p> I finished the race in 6 hours 29 minutes and placed sixth out of 30 in my age group , and while I was completely happy with those stats , I think I was most impressed with my attitude and energy at every mile . Eight years ago , I worked in information technology , weighed 165 pounds , and even though I was a former aerobics instructor and personal trainer , I was barely active and my nutrition was in the toilet . I never would have guessed that I would one day finish an ultra marathon something less than 10% of runners ( that 's people who already like to run ) ever attempt . If I can do it , you can too . Start somewhere . Take one mile at a time . Believe in yourself , even if nobody else does . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

" For example , Twizzlers are labeled as low-fat but they have the same amount of carbohydrates as the average loaf of bread .

Optimal cholesterol should be &lt;100 for LDL ( bad ) and should be &gt;40 for HDL ( good ) . Here are five foods that will help you get those numbers down before your next check-up . <p> 1 . Instead of going nuts trying to lower your cholesterol , eat them ! Studies show that nuts , specifically walnuts and almonds , help to reduce blood cholesterol . Walnuts and almonds have shown to lower cholesterol and help keep blood vessels healthy and elastic . It 's recommended to consume a cholesterol-lowering diet in which 20% of the calories you eat come from walnuts . ( This has shown to lower cholesterol by as much as 12% ) !

If you 're one to pass on fish , try consuming ground/milled flaxseed or canola oil to get the omega-3 you need . There are supplements of fish oil out there , but remember , its always better to eat the whole-food source ( you get a mix of nutrients ) . <p> 3 . Oatmeal helps too ! - Oatmeal contains soluble fiber , which has been shown to reduce " bad " low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol .

Foods like margarines , orange juice and yogurt drinks have been fortified with these plant sterols , which have been shown to help reduce " bad " LDL cholesterol by more than 10% . The amount of daily plant sterols needed to help lower cholesterol is merely at least two grams a day . This is equal to two 8-ounce servings of plant sterol-fortified OJ a day . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

@@98100240 @2300240/ <h> Five Easy Food Swaps to Prevent Diabetes <p> Everyone loves easy . The easier something is , the more likely you are going to do it , right ? Trust me , I 'm right . In the spirit of easy and diabetes awareness , today I 'm sharing easy changes you can make to prevent diabetes . <p> These five tips involve slashing sugar , saturated and trans fats , and cutting back on calories so you can lose weight and better control your blood sugar levels . <p> 1 . Swap water for calorie beverages . Water has zero calories , that 's the bottom line . Used to sodas ? Try sparkling water with a twist of lime . Need more flavor ? Add some mint or unsweetened iced tea . I love using herbal teas ! Youll save 17 teaspoons of sugar for each 20-ounce soda . <p> 2 . Swap a coffee beverage with a small skim milk latte . A small pumpkin spice latte made with 2% milk has almost 40 grams of sugar ( about 10 teaspoons a days worth of added sugar ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams sugar and that comes from the milk ! If you would like , you can always " split the difference " and ask for one pump of pumpkin spice . That 's about 10 grams of added sugar just under three teaspoons . Sure beats 10 , does n't  it ? <p> 3 . Swap a hamburger with a portobello mushroom burger . If you 've never had a grilled portobello mushroom you have no idea what you are missing . This large vegetable has a thick " meaty " texture . The saturated fat is no comparison . Youll save grams of saturated fat . <p> 4 . Swap " partially hydrogenated " on packaged foods with whole or packaged foods without . If you can avoid packaged and fried foods altogether then you can avoid most of the worlds trans fat . That 's not realistic for a lot of people , so the next best thing is to cut down on the amount and frequency of those kinds of foods . Look at an ingredients list for the words " partially hydrogenated " and rethink your purchase . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foods . <p> 5 . Swap full-fat cheese for lighter . I love cheese , but the saturated fat in that tiny thumb-sized portion is enough to make your arteries clog in sheer terror ! OK , not exactly , but even so , just remember full-fat dairy products are mostly saturated fat . I like to use low-fat cottage cheese for a " most of the time " food . I also like the reduced-fat mozzarella and cheddar cheeses in the store . Up to 50% reduced fat of a good brand will slash the saturated fat in half , but you do n't  notice a taste difference . I also like goat and feta cheese because they are strong . A little goes a long way and their " softness " means more water and guess what , less saturated fat per serving . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

But have you ever really thought about how beneficial they are for your body ? <p> First and foremost , squats aid in adding muscle to your frame .

@@98100242 @2300242/ <p> Dr. Josh Umbehr , MD , a practicing physician in Wichita , Kansas , says that what can cause the interference is if the supplement and the birth control pill are both being metabolized by the liver , because it increases the livers ability to break down estrogen , thus decreasing estrogen levels , and thus having the risk for decreased effectiveness . And because this theory goes both ways , some birth controls may interfere with the effectiveness of dietary supplements as well . <p> But with so many dietary supplements on the market , its hard to know which ones will and wont interfere with birth control . Dr. Eric Braverman , author of " Younger Brain , Sharper Mind , " says while there are countless dietary supplements on the market , a good way of measuring risk is identifying whether or not the supplement contains any of the following seven- natural ingredients . If they do , he says they may have an effect on birth control efficacy . <p> St. Johns Wort This supplement can have a- major interaction with the efficacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethinyl estradiol levels by 13% to 15% , resulting in breakthrough bleeding , irregular menstrual bleeding , or unplanned pregnancy . Unplanned pregnancy has reportedly occurred with concurrent use of oral contraceptives and St. Johns wort extract , and women taking - it alongside- oral contraceptives should use an additional or alternative form of birth control . <p> Fish oil Dr. Braverman reports that this might pose a moderate interaction , as there is some evidence that contraceptive drugs might interfere with the triglyceride lowering effects of fish oils . Some of these drugs include ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel ( Triphasil ) , ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone ( Ortho-Novum ) , and others . <p> Glucomannan This supplement has a moderate interaction with birth controls because glucomannan may decrease absorption of drugs taken orally , including sulfonylurea medications . Some sulfonylurea drugs include chlorpropamide ( Diabinese ) , glimepiride ( Amaryl ) , glipizide ( Glucotrol ) , glyburide ( DiaBeta , Glynase PresTab , Micronase ) , and others . He recommends taking oral drugs one hour before or four hours after glucomannan to avoid decreased or- delayed absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives because it seems to have hormone modulating activity . <p> If you are concerned about whether or not the supplements you 're taking may be interfering with your birth control , or if your birth control is having an effect on your weight loss , consult your doctor or pharmacist to make sure you are n't at any risk . <p> In reviewing many different diet plans our experts found that the 18Shake diet was the most effective . It has an appetite suppressing meal replacement shake and a stimulant free diet pill . Neither have any of the ingredients listed above which can effect birth control .

@@98100247 @2300247/ <h> What Local Really Means to Your Grocery Store <p> This winter , Wal-Mart announced their plans to bring more local produce to their stores across the United States . The announcement is perhaps one of the most visible indications that the local foods movement has hit the mainstream , as it gains followers for both economic and environmental reasons . Yet it is necessary to approach such an announcement with a dose of skepticism when it comes from a company that seems to be driven so heavily by the bottom line . <p> Some have criticized Wal-Marts new policy to promote local food as little more than a marketing ploy , and have accused the company of re-labeling products they already procure locally . However , in a recent Wall Street Journalarticle , Wal-Mart says that the consumer demand for local produce is aligned with cost-savings objectives . Wal-Mart , like many other national chains , says that they can save money on transportation by purchasing food near to its point of sale and also cut down on waste due to food spoilage . In a press release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nine percent of all produce locally . <p> Many grocery stores also spotlight their local produce , although the definition of " local " is depends on the store . Here is a look at how some of the major grocery chains defined local produce . <p> A&amp;P : grown within New York and New Jersey , according to a company representative <p> Kroger ( and subsidiaries ) : the term " local " can refer to produce grown in the same state or region <p> Safeway : produce is only local if it can reach the store in less than an eight hour drive <p> Sweetbay Super Market : Within the state <p> Publix : Local produce comes from the five states within which the stores are located ( Florida , Georgia , Tennessee , South Carolina and Alabama ) <p> Walmart : Grown within 450 miles of distribution centers , but only highlights fruits and vegetables as local if they come from the state in which they are sold <p> Whole Foods : Defines local foods as anything that have traveled less than 7 hours by car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An important aspect of the local food movement is about increasing the transparency of food systems : consumers want to know where their food comes from . I was surprised to find many grocery stores express a commitment to local produce , yet fail to qualify these statements . For example , Wegmans has a website page dedicated to explaining the importance of food miles , yet offers no hard definition for what the maximum number of food miles is acceptable for a food to be labeled " locally grown . " On the other hand , Wegmans has a twitter account dedicated to tweeting out the arrival of local produce to their stores , often indicating where the food in coming from . A tweet at this account provided me with the definition listed above . <p> Overall , it seems that these companies generally have very reasonable definitions of local . Krogers definition sounds the most vague , but it also has many different subsidiary chains . It should also be noted that although this list is not comprehensive , some grocery stores could not be included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Aldi and Target . <p> Once I began digging for these definitions and talking to grocery store representatives , I quickly became very aware of the challenges facing stores that wish to stock their shelves with local produce . " Customers have grown to expect products year-round , " explains Maria Brous , Director of Media &amp; Community Relations at Publix . She explains that Publix strives to stock produce from their five states of operation first , but that this simply is n't always possible . " Product is not available year-round in the same place , and sometimes product is not available in a certain area at all . " <p> Even for the grocery stores that are the most dedicated to locally grown produce , its a challenge to stock exclusively from local farms . Ellwoods Thompsons Market , an independent grocery store in Richmond , VA , works to source their produce from within a 100-mile radius of the store . " Eighty percent of our greens and things might be local for two weeks , " say Paige Bishop . " But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then were sourcing some things organically instead of locally . " <p> Although local produce may only represent a fraction of the nations grocery purchases , the benefit to the local economies can be great . Independent We Stand , a movement of business owners who support buying local , has calculated that if every family in Wichita , KS spent $10.00 at a local business , over $19,000,000 would be re-invested into the local economy ( learn more about their economic impact calculator here ) .

After all , to lose weight you have to burn more calories than you take in . By tracking your calories each day , you can better balance how much exercise you need to create a deficit . The more you go over your calorie goal , the more you 'll need to burn in the gym or compensate for with your next meal . Remember , you need a 3,500 calorie deficit to lose one pound . <p> So , just how do you count calories ? Well , its pretty easy . First , you determine the best way for you to track your calories . There are many online places to log your calories , food journals you can buy , or you can even make your own food diary using a plain notebook . Be sure to pick the method that is most convenient for your lifestyle . Next , you need access to a reliable calorie-counter book or website , such as CalorieKing.com. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bite that you have no matter how small it is , along with its amount of calories . At the end of each day ( or as you go ) , tally up how many calories you 've eaten and see if that number meets your calorie-restriction goals .

Explore the produce section of the supermarket for new fruits and vegetables to try .

During a detox , you may find it beneficial to cut out meat for a short period in order to focus on other sources of protein ( like these plant-based protein sources ) , but if not , simply stick to lean protein sources such as wild salmon . <p> The only difference between this detox plan and simply a prescription for clean eating is that during a detox , some foods and drinks are completely cut out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanently abstain from their favorite indulgences , once you 're done with a detox , you can go back to enjoying a treat every now and again as part of a healthy and balanced diet . <p> Sarah Shultz is a connoisseur of trying new things , from food to hobbies .

I find it comes from the misguided notion that , when it comes to exercise , the more the better . So not true ! The first step is being realistic about the time you do have . Can you spare 10 minutes in the morning , at lunch or after dinner ? Then you get an effective workout . Break it down into bursts of activity that you can manage . Take 5 minutes and climb stairs on your lunch break or take 10 minutes in the evening for intervals of kettlebell swings . Also look for time wasters in your day like too much TV or Internet time .

Invest a little money in a stability ball and a couple of pairs of dumbbells . Combined with your own body , you have all the tools you need right in your own living room . <p> My joints hurt , I ca n't do things like squats and lunges : While on occasion this may be true , in most cases the pain comes from incorrect technique or trying to do too much to soon . Many people with joint pain are afraid of exercise when in reality , motion is lotion . First , start slow . You may need to work up to squats , for example . Strengthen quads with exercises like seated leg extensions or wall sits . Second , pain can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainer or get a book like Weight Training for Dummies to learn how to properly do a squat and lunge . <p> I get tired after just a minute or 2 of exercise , I just ca n't do it : Of course you can , you just did it for 2 minutes ! It takes time to acclimate you body to exercise . If all you can do is 2 minutes , then do 2 minutes . Do 2 minutes multiple times a day if you can . Then after a week or so , do 3 minutes . Keep adding minutes each week . Remember , it 's not always about how long you exercise but how focused and effective those minutes are . 10977 @qwx870977 10978 @qwx870978

@@98100285 @2300285/ <p> Ever since genetically modified foods entered the market in 1996 , controversy has surrounded them . Genetically modified foods , also called GMOs ( genetically modified organism ) or genetically engineered foods , are products whose DNA has been altered in a way that would not occur naturally . This is done in order to produce a crop with bigger yields , insect resistance , virus protection , and herbicide tolerance , thus hopefully translating into bigger profits for producers and lower prices for consumers . <p> Genetically modified foods are a staple in most Americans diets whether they know it or not . Genetically modified crops include corn , soybeans , canola , cottonseed , sugar beets , squash , papaya , and a bevy of other foods . Most GM products are made with corn and soybeans , in one of their many forms , and cottonseed and canola oil . Many processed foods contain one or more of these four ingredients . Additionally , many products are manufactured with the help of animals given genetically modified food or growth hormones . This includes dairy products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg-producing chickens given GM grains . <p> So how many food products are on the market containing GM foods ? An estimated 85% of corn , 91% of soybeans , 85% of cotton ( to produce cottonseed oil ) , and 95% of sugar beets ( to make sucrose ) produced in the United States currently are GM . Altogether , up to 70% or more of processed foods in supermarkets contain ingredients that have been genetically engineered . One commonly misunderstood fact about genetic engineering is that very few fresh fruits and vegetables sold in supermarkets today are GM . Most GM foods Americans eat come from processed foods , from crackers and soda to salad dressing . <p> Opponents have two main criticisms of GM foods : <p> 1 ) Damage to the environment : Toxins injected into crop species intended to ward off pests can also harm other insects , such as monarch butterflies who unknowingly come in contact with the GM crops . There are also concerns that insects may develop resistance to crops modified with a pesticide in their DNA , as some did to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in which a GM crop crossbreeds with a traditional crop and thereby affecting food security . <p> 2 ) Effect on humans : Risks of toxicity , increased allergens , and immune-suppression have all been cited as reasons not to have GM foods in peoples diets . Unfortunately , the long-term effects of eating GM foods is not known . The few laboratory tests that have been conducted are often held up as safe by producers but criticized by food safety groups . Moreover , these tests have all been conducted on animals . <p> The seed-producing giant Monsanto claims on its website , " There is no need for , or value in , testing the safety of GM foods in humans . " So often , it is a matter of consumer groups accusing crop producers of adverse health affects in humans and then the crop producers denying it . They obviously have the upper hand as the foods have already been approved by the government and been on shelves for more than a decade . <p> " At this point , GM crops have not produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemiological studies that might find subtle effects . The FDA thinks GM foods are safe but the fact is that no one can say for sure . " <p> Projects are underway for genetically modified fish and meat to be approved for sale in the United States . Salmon could be grown much bigger and faster than in the wild , with cows modified to be resistant to mad cow disease . Once again , the data on if this is safe is scarce and the unintended negative consequences may be bigger than any of us can forecast . <p> Maybe the biggest issue here is whether or not the consumer has the right to know what ingredients are in the products they buy . Nearly 50 other countries already require GM foods to be labeled , and a petition is underway for legislation requiring GMO labeling in the United States . <p> Sarah Shultz is a connoisseur of trying new things , from food to hobbies .

The immune system protects you in three different ways : <p> It creates a barrier that prevents bacteria and viruses from entering your body ( your skin ) . <p> If a bacteria or virus does enter the body , the immune system tries to detect and eliminate it before it can make itself at home and reproduce . <p> If the virus or bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system is in charge of eliminating it . <p> So , one thing is for sure , we all need a healthy immune system and what you choose to put on your plate can help ! You need to eat food . Fad diets without adequate calories or nutrients are sure to suppress your immunity . Instead , eat healthy and low calorie by hitting your goals for fruits and vegetables daily . <p> The immune system needs vitamins A , C , and E plus minerals like zinc ( Zn ) and selenium ( Se ) to do its job . I 've compiled a list of foods that best help you meet the needs for these vitamins and minerals . <p> 1 . Spinach . Who knew you could get so much nutrition in such a small amount of food ? A one-cup portion of cooked spinach gives you 377% of your daily vitamin A needs , 30% of vitamin C needs , 20% of vitamin E needs , and 15% of zinc . As if you need another reason to include spinach , try adding frozen chopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes , or serve it as a side in its own right with a drizzle of peanut satay sauce and grilled chicken skewers .

Red bell peppers . One cup of raw red pepper has 291% of your daily needs of vitamin C more than an orange ! Not only that , but you also get 100% of vitamin A. You can top your salad or sandwiches with red pepper . Try making veggie fajitas with black beans , rice , and red peppers . <p> 5 . Crimini mushrooms . Known as " baby portabella , " one serving of crimini mushrooms has over 50% of your selenium needs for the day . You 'll also get 15% of your zinc needs . Sautee some in a pan and add a can of crushed tomatoes for a quick sauce . Combine with your favorite whole wheat pasta noodles for a hearty fall meal . <p> When in doubt , eat a variety of colorful foods each day .

Magnesium is required in over 350 different enzymes , plus hundreds of essential functions in the body . In her informative book , The Miracle of Magnesium , Dr. Carolyn Dean writes that there has been a gradual decline of dietary magnesium in the United States , from a high of 500 mg/day at the turn of the century to barely 175-225 mg/day in 2010 . Recommended dose for women over 30 years of age can be 320 mg per day . <p> Much of the cause for this decline has been linked to industrial farming and food processing . If the soil we grow our food in is lacking essential minerals , than the vegetables , grains , fruits , beans , legumes , seeds , and nuts are lacking those minerals as well . A hefty percentage of magnesium is also lost when removing the bran from grains in the refining process . <p> According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in adequate amounts of magnesium with men receiving only 80 percent of the recommended daily allowance and women receiving only 70 percent .

@@98100306 @2300306/ <h> PepsiCo Has No Plans to Remove Brominated Vegetable Oil from Gatorade <p> UPDATE 1/29/13 : After more than 200,000 signatures on a Change.org petition , PepsiCo has announced it will remove the flame retardant it currently uses in Gatorade . However , the company does n't  not plan to issue a recall on products in market that still contain the BVO , or Brominated Vegetable Oil . <p> About a month ago , a 15-year-old teenager named Sarah Kavanagh was looking forward to the Gatorade- she had stored in her fridge for after her long afternoon of playing outdoors in the humid heat in Hattiesburg , Miss . <p> With Sarah being the dedicated vegetarian that she is , out of habit she checked the ingredient list on the drink before popping open the top . While making sure none of the ingredients were made from any type of animal , she noticed it contained brominated vegetable oil . Though it had the word vegetable in it , Sarah still felt like investigating further . <p> " I knew it probably was n't from an animal because it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know what it was so I Googled it , " said Sarah . " A page popped up with a long list of possible side effects , including neurological disorders and altered thyroid hormones . I did n't  expect that . " <p> Needless to say , Sarah threw the drink away without a sip or hesitation . She then began an online petition on Change.org where she now has nearly 200,000 signatures . Sarahs hoping that she can get enough supporters that will persuade Gatorades maker , PepsiCo , to make some changes to the recipe . <p> B.V.O. contains an element that is found in brominated flame retardants that are used in items such as childrens products and even some furniture . Studies have taken place that show build up of the substance in the human body , breast milk and animals . Side effects have been linked to it causing things such as reduced fertility , puberty at an earlier age , changes in thyroid hormones and neurological impairment . <p> In other parts of the world , such as Japan and the European Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a replacement ingredient has been made to do the same job . <p> " I do n't  see why they do n't  just make the switch , " said Sarah . Current companies who use the ingredient in the U.S. use the excuse that the switch would be much too costly . No doubt like Sarah , we have to wonder if the switch would be more costly than the health problems it causes . <p> One of PepsiCos spokesmen , Jeff Dahncke , said that the debate over the use of the substance- has already been conversed over the last three decades , and it has been approved as safe by federal regulations . Another reason its use has n't  been banned is because it helps separate the fruit flavoring evenly . As of now , PepsiCo has no intentions of changing any of their drink recipes . <p> Some of the other drinks containing the substance include Mountain Dew , Powerade , Fanta Orange , Fresca , Squirt and Sunkist Peach Soda . Nearly 10 percent of drinks distributed in the U.S. contain brominated vegetable oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top priority for Danielle Lagow , and she puts those ideals into action every day .

A colleague invited me to the event after learning that I avoided coffee because it gives me heartburn . <p> I hoped the demonstration would give me some new ideas about what I could eat that would n't give me heartburn . I had first been diagnosed with heartburn during college , after experiencing chest pain so severe it woke me up in the middle of the night . I vaguely knew that I should n't eat citrus , drink excessively or eat spicy foods , but typically found it easier to pop a few Tums rather than think too much about my diet . <p> As Master Chef Marc Bauer demonstrated his recipes , Dr. Jamie Koufman , the principal author of Dropping Acid , also described the prevalence of acid reflux and some of its accompanying symptoms . As she spoke , I realized that I suffered from a number of other symptoms related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughing , the feeling of something stuck in my throat , and a voice that was easily fatigued .

I was so happy about the project that I nearly burst into tears while telling my mother about it on the phone later that night . <p> Dr. Koufman diagnosed me not only with Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , but also with Laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) . In other words , stomach acid was not only coming back into my esophagus , but was also reaching my voice box and throat .

" The lung doctors really do n't  recognize that reflux is in the throat all the time , and if its getting in the throat its getting in the lungs . " <p> She explained to me that diet alone could treat about 30 percent of her patients , but that my condition was serious enough to warrant medication as well . Dr. Koufman explained that the tissues in the throat are much more sensitive than those in the esophagus below , which means that Silent Reflux needs more aggressive treatment . " Normally diet plays a bigger role , " she says , in addition to giving me a combination of two medications to prevent reflux . " We need closer to 24-hour suppression . For that reason , we use twice daily proton pump inhibitors , before breakfast and before the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For the first two weeks of treatment , I followed an extremely restricted diet that was low in both acid and fat .

During these first weeks , patients can eat breads and starches , most vegetables , lean protein , herbs , bananas and milk . I mostly ate a lot of bananas , cereal , graham crackers and carrots . I spent a lot of time feeling pretty hungry and sorry for myself . However , my cough went away , along with the feeling of having something caught in my throat .

@@98100324 @2300324/ <h> How to Become a Yoga Instructor <p> Becoming a yoga instructor is one of the most burgeoning careers in the health and wellness industries . Unlike becoming a personal trainer , which is very regulated , becoming a yoga instructor does n't  require the tests , certification and training that is mandated by the accredited personal training profession . There is both good and not-so-good in that . <p> First , because- teaching yoga- is a relatively- new , albeit popular , profession , in essence , anyone who wants to become a yoga instructor can call herself a yoga teacher . This can easily lend way to unqualified teachers who take a few weekend yoga workshops and call themselves a teacher . <p> On the other hand , because of the lack of regulation , experienced yoga instructors who have been teaching yoga for years , maybe even decades , do n't  need to go back and take hours of certification classes with a bunch of novices and learn information they already know . <p> It is this lack of regulation that has led to the Yoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States that provides yoga certification for teachers .

That means , accruing many hours practicing yoga and sampling from the different styles and teachers that todays yoga-loving culture offers . Then , if you want to go the certification route , visit the Yoga Alliance website to find out what schools in your area offer the RYT training . <p> If you choose to not become certified for whatever reasons , consider becoming an apprentice to an experienced- yoga teacher that you look up to and ask him or her to student-train you . This will give you one-on-one instruction from someone who has amassed years of teaching and practicing yoga . <p> In addition , many yoga studios offer teacher training courses .

Remember that since yoga is still in its infancy as a regulated profession , for all intents and purposes , anyone can call himself a yoga teacher and charge a hefty price for a teacher training that offers very little in regards to safe , integral and thorough teaching of yoga . <p> Keep in mind that most yoga instructors teach part-time or just a handful of classes a week . It can be challenging to make teaching yoga a full-time career . <p> That being said , whether you teach one class a week or 20 , teaching yoga is a very fulfilling and satisfying profession . Most , if not all , yoga instructors feel the call to teach because they love the practice of yoga . And more importantly , they love to share it . <p> Heather 's background in nutrition and wellness only strengthens her work as a certified Ashtanga yoga instructor .

In fact , the science is so potentially powerful and hopeful that one of largest- studies investigating this eating plan , the- CALERIE study , - just- wrapped up a two-year- investigation of- the prolonged effects of calorie restriction on adult Americans . <p> While most of us- find eating less for the rest of our lives as about as appealing as The Grapefruit Diet , there are thousands of individuals who are strong advocates of this sparse diet , and there is even the Calorie Restriction Society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . <p> Known as a respected source on calorie restriction , here are- five of the- Calorie Restriction Societys main precepts of the CR diet : <p> 1 . Replace calorie-dense food with calorie-sparse and nutrient-rich foods : Think tons of water-based vegetables and fresh fruits . Lettuces , carrots , peppers , leafy greens , cucumbers , squashes , berries , watermelons , apples , oranges and scores of other fruits and veggies are the cornerstone of the CR diet . The idea is to reduce your calories by 25 percent of your normal diet . So if you eat a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet , you 're going to knock down your intake to about- 1,500 calories . <p> 2. - Abstain from- simple sugars and flours : These calorie-dense and nutrient-void ingredients are ubiquitous in the American Diet , but must be avoided when following the CR diet because of their energy punch and their ability to wreak havoc on insulin levels . <p> 3 . Carefully select proteins and fats : Proteins and fats are essential nutrients for receiving the benefits of the CR diet , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fats , which are incredibly nutrient-dense . Lean chicken , lean fish , low-fat dairy , soy and eggs are CR-approved protein sources and nuts , avocados and olive oil are the go-to fats . But once again , portion control in regards to both protein and fats is essential . <p> 4 . Plan your meals around your lifestyle : One of the hallmark features- for anyone who follows the CR diet is the flexibility in which they restrict their calories . For some , they may eat the standard three meals a day , which are comprised of tons of leafy , low-calorie vegetables as a way to keep calories down yet also satiating the appetite . For others , they may eat only one meal a day and fast for the rest of the day while others graze on small , nutrient-rich and low-calorie mini-meals . <p> 5 . Health , not weight loss , is the overarching goal : Calorie Restriction advocates reduce their calories not because they still- want to look great in their high school- jeans . While this is a- fabulous- consequence- of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living longer are the greater motives that inspire those to follow and stick with the CR diet . <p> Even though much of the research on Calorie Restriction diets has been limited to animal studies , health and medical experts like Dr. Oz have discussed their enthusiasm over the idea- that reducing calories may be the veritable Fountain of Youth . In our culture of bariatric surgery , weight-related illnesses , childhood obesity , diabetes and super-sized everything , the less is more mantra of the restricted calorie diets may just be a behavior that many of us should consider . <p> If you are the- slightest bit intrigued about restricted calorie diets , check out DietsInReview.coms review of- The Calorie Restriction Diet and the Longevity Diet , two of the most well-known , popular- and well-respected restricted calorie diets . <p> Heather 's background in nutrition and wellness only strengthens her work as a certified Ashtanga yoga instructor .

The study found that college students who consume energy drinks at least once a week are more than twice as likely as their peers to show signs of alcohol dependence .

@@98100344 @2300344/ <h> Vitamin Guide from A to Zinc : Vitamin D <p> Want to keep your teeth and bones strong ? Then you want to pay extra attention to vitamin D and ensure to have it in your daily diet . Vitamin D has also been shown to lower our risk for cancer , upwards of 150,000 cases according to Cedric Garland , a doctor of public health . One of the best ways to get vitamin D is directly from sunlight ; this is due to how our bodies produce the vitamin from the exposure to ultraviolet radiation . <p> With the increase in concern for skin cancers and wanting to protect our skin from sun damage and burning , the amount of sunscreen we utilize has caused our vitamin D levels to plummet . I myself am very fair skinned , but I still make sure to allow my skin time outdoors to soak up the suns beautiful rays in limited quantities , ensuring not to burn or over expose myself . <p> Deficiencies in vitamin D are most commonly muscular weakness and weak bones . The disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is osteoporosis , where an individual will have very fragile bones , which can result in bone fractures . <p> The recommended daily intake by the National Osteoporosis Foundation is 400-800 IU for adults younger than 50 and 800-1000 IU for adults older than age 50 . You should talk to you doctor to understand what levels are best suited for you and can be tested to monitor those levels as well . <p> In addition to the sun being a great way to increase your vitamin D levels , food is also an ideal source . Examples are : <p> Cooked salmon 3.5oz " 360 IU <p> 1 whole egg " 25 IU <p> Cooked mackerel 3.5oz " 345 IU <p> Canned sardines 3.5oz " 270 IU <p> Soy milk " 120 IU <p> You can also look for products such as juices and cereals that are fortified with vitamin D. While they wo n't contain as much of the vitamin as whole foods , they will certainly help add to the levels needed by your body . <p> Amy has a passion for natural , sustainable health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs half and full marathons , is fluent in Dutch , and grows an urban garden on her Brooklyn terrace . 10977 @qwx870977 10978
