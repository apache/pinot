There is a fable that the lands were named by an early Scots king after a fisherman gut three ' fish to serve to his hungry monarch . A more likely origin lies in the Gaelic gaothairach ' , windy place ' . King William the Lion granted the lands of Gutherin to the Abbey of Arbroath around 1178 . The family , who were royal falconers , subsequently purchased these lands . In 1299 the Laird of Guthrie was sent to France to invite Sir William Wallace to return to Scotland .

First of all , St. Patrick was n't Irish ! He was born in the British Isles near the modern city of Dumbarton , located in Scotland around 373 C.E. His orginal name was Maewyn Succat , and only became Patrick after he was ordained as a priest . When Patrick was 16 , he was seized by raiders from his homeland and brought to Ireland and sold as a slave . In captivity for six years , he heard God 's voice telling him the time was right to escape . In later years , after his escape , he would again hear God 's calling to return to Ireland and convert the Irish to Christianity . St. Patrick is attributed to Ireland 's conversion to Christianity . It is celebrated on his religious feast day and the anniversary of his death in the fifth century . <p> Products <h> Products Available in the St Patrick Tartan <p> You can find the products we can make for you below in St Patrick tartan .

Ewan MacPhee was a 19th century army deserter who went on to become Scotland 's last outlaw . MacPhee fled the army and went to live on a small island in Loch Quoich where he married a fourteen year-old girl . As the years passed , MacPhee began to gain a reputation as an oracle of sorts and he believed himself to have supernatural powers . All this time , MacPhee was stealing cattle from his neighbours who got fed up and sent the sheriff after him . MacPhee 's wife saw the Sheriff coming and so started shooting at him , prompting the Sheriff to turn and flee . Later an armed mob came and took MacPhee away to prison where he would eventually die .

Ulster and Connaught were the two most powerful kingdoms . However , by 300 AD , Ulster had lost much of its power . The ruling houses in Connaught and Mide emerged and expanded their kingdoms , essentially splitting Ireland in two . The people of Ulster were pushed to a northern section of Ireland bordering the Irish Sea , and their name was changed to Dal Riata . Eventually the Sons of Niall , the ruling family of Connaught , ruled the Dal Riata . Unhappy with the natural borders of the sea , they began to colonize the land of the Picts . <p> Products available <h> Products Available in the All Ireland Red Tartan <p> You can find the products we can make for you below in All Ireland Red tartan .
