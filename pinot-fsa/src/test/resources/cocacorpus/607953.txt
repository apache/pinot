According to a study published on Aug. 19 in the journal Nature Communications , the grooves on the Martian moon are actually caused by impacts . <p> Previously , scientists believed that the grooves are the result of stress fractures caused by the tidal pull of the Red Planet . However , according to the study 's first author Michael Nayak of the University of California Santa Cruz , this does not explain the formation of other grooves . <p> Now , the new study reveals that the debris ejected by the impacts eventually falling back to the surface caused these , forming a long line of craters . To come up with this conclusion , the researchers had to develop computer simulations that showed how these grooves resulted from impacts . This also allowed them to track where the ejected objects would hit . <p> " A lot of stuff gets kicked up , floats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falls back in a linear chain before it has a chance to be pulled apart and disassociated by Mars gravity , " says Nayak .

They observed that when the ejected debris fell back onto the surface , the pattern it followed was similar to the one observed on the crater chain of Phobos . <p> The research team believes that this phenomenon only occurs on Phobos due to its low mass and close distance to- Mars .
