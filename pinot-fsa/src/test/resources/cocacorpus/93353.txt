Destin , Florida <p> One of the best places to visit in Florida <p> In Destin , the beaches are filled with soft white sand and the water is crystal clear with a hint of emerald green . <p> The sunsets are phenomenal and there is nothing like sitting on the beach , listening to the waves , as the sun beams down on you . <p> What we love about Destin is if you want a quiet beach scene you get that when you are on the beach . If you want activity and action you head to the main road which is about a half mile from the beach and you have every shop , restaurant , and activity you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to do in Florida with kids . <h> Buccaneer Pirate Cruise <p> The crew of the ship keep your kids busy from the time they board the ship until you are back in the harbor . They include a water gun fight , pulling a sunken treasure chest up from the ocean , and plenty of dancing and games for everyone to enjoy ! <h> Southern Star Dolphin Cruise <p> If you want to see dolphins in the wild , this is the cruise for you . We saw tons of dolphins swimming and playing in the ocean and some of them even came up to swim next to our boat ! <p> The captain said all day their crews are talking to each other so that they know where the dolphins have been so they can almost guarantee you will see dolphins on your trip . <p> One of the coolest things to do with kids in Florida . <p> The other highlight of our cruise was the kids getting a chance to drive the boat ! They had so much fun getting in the Captain 's seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookout for more dolphins . <h> LuLu 's Destin <p> When in Destin , you do n't want to miss out on dinner at LuLu 's . <p> The menu has a large variety and also caters to any food allergies or requests . The food was great and so were the drinks , but the best part is the setup . <p> The restaurant has outside seating with a beach that is filled with toys for the kids to play with . Anyone that has gone out to eat with kids knows that kids do n't like to sit still . <p> LuLu 's was perfect . We could sit outside at the picnic table while the kids played in the sand while we waited for our food . <p> We spent a month in Destin and ca n't wait to go back . Its one of our favorite places to see in Florida ! <p> The sunsets are amazing and the white sand beach and crystal clear ocean water are always calling our name ! <h> 3 . St. Augustine , Florida <p> One of the best places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As you walk down George Street you feel like you are walking back in time and drinking from the Fountain of Youth feels surreal . <p> The city itself is beautiful then add in the ocean and the surrounding attractions and you have a great family travel destination . <h> St. Augustine Alligator Farm <p> We almost did n't visit the Alligator Farm since we were short on time , but we are so glad that we did ! <p> We ended up spending a whole afternoon there . They have a huge collection of alligators , crocodiles , and caimans including a 15 foot 3-inch saltwater crocodile named Maximo that you can view from underwater viewing window ! Plus we got to see a mama albino alligator and her albino babies . <p> Plus we got to see a mama albino alligator and her albino babies . <p> We then headed to Alligator Swamp where there were literally hundreds of alligators that we could drop food down too . It was definitely scary being out on the pier , but wow , what an experience ! <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alligator Lagoon . All of the alligators are named and from what we could see it definitely looked like they understood their names . <p> We were also able to hold a baby alligator when we were here and got a few fun pictures with it . As you can see our youngest was OK being back by the tail , but did n't want anything to do with being by the alligators mouth . <p> They have an amazing collection of alligators and also have an array of other animals from birds to reptiles . <p> When in St. Augustine you do n't want to miss the Alligator Farm and be prepared to spend the whole afternoon exploring the farm and also catching a few of their shows . <h> The Fountain Of Youth <p> Yes , at first I thought it was cliche and was going to just be a little fountain where we all went and drank the water and that was it . I was wrong . <p> The grounds are really cool and tell a great story about the history of the area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we visited the Fountain of Youth and they were able to drink from the fountain too ! We thought that was really cool . Who does n't wish their dog could live forever . <p> St. Augustine is a very dog-friendly location and a lot of attractions and restaurants in the area let you bring pets with you . <p> We were then able to explore the grounds where they had a large Timucuan family house , and a Nihi Paha , a special meeting house recreated to show how the Native Americans used to live in the area . <p> There was also staff on hand to give demonstrations and presentations about how the Timucuan lived . <p> The next stop was the cannon demonstration . Wow , that was loud ! <p> There is also a 600-foot pier that goes out over the water and back through the beautiful grounds . It had such a peaceful vibe to it and we are glad we went , drank the water ( was worth a shot right ! ) , and walked around exploring the area . <h> Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit in Florida <p> This 17th-century fort is a breathtaking structure in St. Augustine that looks out over the water . <p> It was built with a form of limestone called coquina . It is a softer stone and would seem to not be the right choice for a fort , but it was the exact opposite . Instead of a cannon ball destroying a wall it would just burrow its way into the wall and get stuck there ! <p> There was so much history to see , hear and feel when at the fort . Plus there were tours , a cannon demonstration , and a Junior Ranger program . <p> Put this on your list of places to see in Florida with kids ! <h> Old Trolley Tour <p> If you are looking for an overview of St Augustine and to learn about the history jump on an Old Trolley Tour . <p> The tour will take you around the city with 23 stops where you can jump on and off the trolley all day long . It highlights over 100 points of interest . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn some great trivia about St. Augustine . <p> P.S. we recommend jumping off at the winery for a free wine sampling as well as the distillery ! It will be the best ride you 'll never remember ! <p> Northern Florida is beautiful and is n't always as hot and muggy as central or southern Florida . We recommend visiting Northern Florida in the fall ( September , October , November ) if you are looking to go when the weather is just starting to cool off yet warm enough to still enjoy the ocean . <p> We recommend the fall ( September , October , November ) if you are looking to go when the weather is just starting to cool off yet warm enough to still enjoy the ocean . <h> Places to visit in Central Florida with kids <p> Kelly Rock Spring one of the best places to visit in Florida <p> Then we move on to Central Florida . As you can imagine most of the busy cities are located on the coasts . Except for Orlando where the main Florida attraction is located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot of other cool things to do in Central Florida . <h> 4 . Siesta Key Beach <p> Siesta Key Beach is known for its huge stretch of soft white sand . <p> Seriously , once you park which can be a challenge at this uber-popular beach , you will walk for what feels like a mile to get from your car across the beach to a spot by the bright blue ocean . It is worth it . <p> Just keep in mind the trek to the beach and do n't bring every beach chair and sand toy that you have . There is a concession stand and bathrooms located by the parking lot so you do n't have to bring your own food if you do n't want . <p> The surrounding town is a cool beach town if you are looking to stay for a night or head out for dinner . <h> 5 . Clearwater Beach <p> One of the best places to visit in Florida with kids <p> Clearwater Beach is located a little north of Siesta Key and has the same beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This gives the whole area more of a beach city vibe since you can easily walk from the beach to the local shops and restaurants . <p> This is another popular beach area so if going during spring break or another holiday expect a lot of people and some issues with parking . <h> 6 . Orlando <p> We have such a love/hate relationship with Orlando . <p> There are so many cool things to do in the area and its probably the most popular place to visit in Florida with kids , but everything is pretty expensive and you can literally spend thousands of dollars in a mere day or two . Be prepared . <h> Walt Disney World <p> Walt Disney World one of the best places to visit in Florida <p> Our recommendation is to pick one park and plan on spending a day there . Get there early , plan on spending the whole day , and bring your own food ( this along will save you a LOT of money ) . <p> We chose the Magic Kingdom and have really enjoyed ourselves each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chaos you still get a magical feeling when you go to the Magic Kingdom , its definitely one of the most fun places to go in Florida ! <p> I do n't know how they do it , but ALL of the employees are super nice and they do an amazing job with all of their shows/entertainment . <p> Must be something in the water . <p> So , yes , if you visit Florida you should spend at least a day at Disney World , but just know Florida is so much more than just amusement parks and Mickey Mouse . Save some of your money so you can enjoy the other parts of Florida too . <h> Legoland <p> If your kids are between 4 and 10 years old and you are looking for a less expensive option , then Legoland is the place for you and another popular Florida attractions ! We had such an amazing time at the park and the hotel was an awesome experience . <p> The majority of the rides are geared towards younger kids so there are a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can also bring Lego figurines from home and trade them with the employees we love little touches like that ! <h> Tubing by Orlando <p> Tubing by Orland was such a pleasant surprise . I have always said why visit Florida if you ca n't be by the beach ( with Disney and Legoland being the exception ) ? <p> Then we found Kelly Rock Springs . WOW ! <p> The water is crystal clear and you feel like you are in a fairytale world as you float down the river with greenery surrounding you on every side . <p> It was a surreal experience with a little fear mixed it . You felt like an alligator or a panther was going to jump out of the trees along the river ! <p> Some of the kids really enjoyed it and were swimming along with our tubes and diving down into the water . The other ones wanted out ASAP ( I think they had the same fears I did ! ) . <p> In any case , it is well worth making a stop at Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the beach there . We have visited a couple other springs in Florida and it really is amazing how clear the water is and lush the greenery is . <p> Central Florida offers such a variety of things to do in Florida with kids from amazing beaches to some of the best amusement parks in the world , to an amazing nature experience . <p> Do n't just think Orlando when heading through Florida there are so many other great things to do in this part of the state . <h> Highland Hammock State Park <p> Another reason we are glad we spent time exploring more of inland Florida was Highland Hammock State Park . This state park is one of the oldest state parks in Florida and definitely had a feel of going back in time . <p> You could tell the trees were hundreds of years old and there was history throughout the park . We went on an amazing hike that took us over a swamp area with a small walkway and through trees that were made for climbing . <p> Definitely worth visiting Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highland Hammock . <h> Places to visit in South Florida with kids <p> We now head down to South Florida which includes Little Havana , the Everglades , and the Keys . You could spend months just in southern Florida with everything there is to do here . <h> 7 . Palm Beach <p> Before getting too far south , you can make your first stop at Palm Beach . This beautiful city is filled with million dollar houses and a beach that goes on for miles . <p> The beach itself is n't the prettiest in Florida . It is on the Atlantic Ocean side so the water is n't as blue and is normally more wavy . <p> We really enjoyed the Palm Beach Zoo . Both were the perfect size for younger kids and we were able to spend a whole day exploring the Zoo and even got a chance to feed a sloth ! <p> We also spent half a day at the Science Center and had a blast doing all the <h> A1A Beachfront Avenue <p> It was just what you would imagine it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2pm in the afternoon , muscle men walking around flexing their muscles , and girls in teeny tiny bikinis . <p> We tried to park to get out and explore a little bit , but unfortunately , parking was impossible ! We were glad we took a drive through . <h> Wynwood <p> You drive through this up and coming retro part of the city and see amazing graffiti artwork on all of the walls of the old warehouse buildings . <p> Then you get out and walk among the artwork and it is so bright and colorful . There are amazing and unique restaurants in this area of the city as well . <h> Knaus Berry Farm <p> This farm is on the outskirts of Miami , but so worth the drive . <p> These were the BEST cinnamon rolls we have ever had . And we have sampled a lot on our travels . Make sure you get there early , they sell out almost every day . <h> Everglades Shark Valley <p> The Everglades National Park is a must stop location and one of the best places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park covers the majority of the southern tip of Florida and contains miles and miles of wilderness that are filled with alligators , snakes , birds , and who knows what else is lurking in the water ! <p> One of the highlights of our time in Florida was biking the 15 mile Shark Valley trail in the Everglades . <p> You start at the Shark Valley Everglades National Park visitor center ( expect possible delays when entering the park there is limited parking so you sometimes have to wait until someone leaves before you can enter ) . <p> You park your car , unload the bikes , and head out on the trail . <p> The trail takes you about 7 1/2 miles into the Everglades where you are biking right past alligators that are 8 feet long sun bathing on the side of the bike path . <p> You then reach the look out tower where you can climb up to the top and look out at the Everglades as far as your eye can see . <p> It was a surreal experience standing there looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was out there in the waters and trees . <p> You then head back down to bike another 8 miles back to the visitor center . The trail is a circle so you have different scenery on the way back then you did on the way there . <p> The trail is a circle so you have different scenery on the way back then you did on the way there . <p> We went after there had been raining and we did have to bike through a couple of inches of standing water at some points . It was an unforgettable experience when we biked through the water with an alligator laying in the water right next to us ! <p> If you are n't up for biking , you can take a tram ride ( though you do normally have to book tickets days in advance during the busy season ) . <p> We recommend biking . <p> The tram was driving a lot faster than- we were biking , so I know they missed a lot of the alligators that we saw . However we were glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our rusted old bikes , plus we have never biked this far before . <p> When it was said and done we were so glad that we did it . <p> There was some tears from the kids ( based on fear of biking right past alligators ) and some shaking by me as we rode by a humongous alligator . But it was one unforgettable experience and we would recommend it to anyone that visits the Everglades . <h> Places to visit in the Florida Keys with kids <p> Our home away from home . We love the Florida Keys and its at the top of our list of favorite places to visit in Florida . <p> When people think of the Florida Keys , they normally think of Key West . So they 're probably thinking lots of drinking , partying , and naked people . <p> Yes , that does happen in Key West , but if you leave before sunset , you should n't see much of it . During the day Key West is a great family travel destination . <p> Plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more to them than just Key West . <h> Places to visit in the Upper / Middle Florida Keys <h> 9 . John Pennenkamp State Park <p> This beautiful state park is located in the upper part of the Keys and is known for its snorkeling . You can literally swim off the beach to go snorkeling . <p> Make note that beaches in the Florida Keys are not like other beaches in Florida . Since the Keys are surrounded by a reef it stops the beaches from having that beautiful white sand . But no worries the water is still beautiful ! <p> You can also take a glass bottom boat tour from John Pennekamp to get out on the water and see underwater without having to get wet . <p> Beware sea sickness can occur so be prepared ! Or you can rent a kayak and kayak through the mangroves . Or go out on a snorkeling adventure off the beach . <h> 10 . Dolphins Plus <p> If swimming or being in the water with dolphins is on your bucket list , Dolphins Plus is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 8 to swim with the dolphins , so if you have younger kids you will be doing the in-water experience . You stand on a platform and are lowered into the water to about waist height and an instructor works with the dolphins as they swim up to you and you can kiss them , play with them , and pet them . <h> 11 . Robbies Feed the Tarpon <p> Not to be missed on your trip to the Keys is Robbie 's , where you can stop to feed the tarpons . <p> For a $1 you are given a bucket of fish . You walk out onto the pier and see a swarm of humongous tarpon just waiting for your fish . <p> You drop them right in the water or if you are feeling brave you can hold a fish out and wait for the tarpon to jump out of the water for it ! <h> 12 . Sombrero Beach <p> Here is one of the few beaches in the keys that does have nice sand . If you are looking for a beach day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day lounging on the beach , swimming , or playing in the playground . <h> 13 . Seven Mile Bridge <p> As you head down to Key West you will drive over the 7 Mile Bridge . It is quite the experience and filled with breathtaking views . <p> Before you start your drive across the bridge you can pull off and park to walk out on the old 7-mile bridge for a few miles before the bridge ends . <h> Places to visit in the Lower Keys <h> 14 . Key West <p> Key West has a very Caribbean vibe to it . It is a great location to get an island vacation without leaving the US . <p> You can spend the day walking the streets and checking out the shops and restaurants . Be sure to stop to get a Key Lime Pie . Or you can spend the day on the beach or out on the water . <h> 15 . Fort Zachary Taylor <p> This is another beach that has a little bit more of a Florida beach feel to it . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing sunset . You can also explore Fort Zachary Taylor from here . <h> 16 . Fury Adventure <p> If you want to spend the day on the water , the Fury Ultimate Adventure is for you . <p> This 6-hour catamaran ride that includes snorkeling , jet skiing , parasailing , and playing in the ocean on inflatable climbing structures . All with food and all the beverages you can drink . <h> 17 . Key West Aquarium <p> If you are looking to feed sharks and pet sting rays , make a stop at the Key West Aquarium . It is n't a big aquarium , but it has a lot of hands-on activities and you can walk right up to an open shark pool to watch these amazing creatures . <p> They also have a variety of programs that you can listen to and learn about sea life . <p> For other things to do in Key West , check out LONG ... <h> 18 . Dry Tortugas <p> One of the best places to visit in Florida <p> If you have the time , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be an experience like no other . <p> If you do n't have time for an overnight , plan on spending the day , its beautiful and one of the best places in Florida ! <p> You take a 70-mile boat ride out to the island and once you reach it , you have a few hours to walk around the island and explore the fort . <p> If you walk to the far end of the island you can see hundreds of conch shells that have washed up on the shore . There are some that are as big as your head ! <p> The water is shades of blue and green that you will think someone Photoshopped . You can hang out on the beach and watch the birds fly around and listen to the waves hit the beach . <p> Then you can explore the fort and get a feel for how the soldiers use to live on this island out and in the middle of the ocean with no one around for miles and miles ! <p> There is a dry campground on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over night- but know people who have and they said it was an amazing experience . <p> We ca n't wait to plan a trip back to camp for a few nights . To see the stars here and to experience the remoteness would be quite the experience . <p> You could do this in a fast moving 2 to 3 week road trip , or become a snow bird ( people who head south for the winter ) like we did for 6 months and take your time exploring all this state has to offer ! 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Bryanna Royal <p> Bryanna , her husband Craig , their 4 kids- and 2 dogs sold their house , everything in it , and bought an RV and are now traveling around the US . They blog about their adventures at **28;0;TOOLONG . Their goal is to inspire families to get out and travel more ! When they are n't out hiking to the top of mountains you can find them on the beach or at the local donut shop searching for the best donut in the US ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pinterest , and on Periscope ( @cfadventure ) . <p> Well Florida is a place with attractive destinations and the northernmost islands lie along the Florida straits covered by seven seas . If we talk about map of Florida Keys , from key west to the ragged keys in Biscayne National Park . Island can be traveled by motor vehicles on the overseas highway . Great information shared keep it up . 
@@21820450 @1820450/ <h> Why we think the Gold Coast is THE best place to live in Australia <p> Once we made the decision to go on our USA road trip , I 've questioned whether it 's the right decision . Mostly because I love our lifestyle in Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast . <p> If you follow our life on the blog or social media , you 've had a great insight into life in Burleigh , and it 's now possibly on your bucket list of places to visit , or possibly even live . <p> We travelled around- Australia with eyes wide open to find a place for us to settle . There were many places we loved like Broome and Margaret River in Western Australia , and Bright in Victoria , but none of those checked off all the boxes . <p> Burleigh did . <p> So we can tell you that after 18 months of exploring Australia and living in several places in the country , and outside of them , that Burleigh and the Gold Coast is the best and the only place we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with it , which is why I feel a little insane for wanting to leave it . <p> I 'm writing this post while I 'm in Denver , Colorado . Ten days back in the US has reaffirmed for me that , although I love my life on the Gold Coast , the US is where my soul most wants to be . <p> So I 'm reflecting on my life in Burleigh and why I think the Gold Coast is a lot less the glitter strip you might imagine with retirees , schoolies and a lack of soul and much more a city full of rich gold . <h> The old Gold Coast <p> I never thought the Gold Coast would have been the place to live in Australia for me . In fact , I used to turn my nose up at it , despite Craig and I getting engaged in Coolangatta . <p> I felt the Gold Coast lacked a bit of depth , was more for retirees and schoolies and felt a little run down . So back in 07 , we chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equate the Gold Coast with Surfers Paradise , and Surfers- has always felt too touristy and tacky with a 24/7 party scene that- is way beyond our age ( Although it has improved somewhat and does have a great ice cream store , and a few great restaurants and hotels like the QT . ) <p> But , the Gold Coast is so much more than Surfers Paradise and has grown up tremendously over the past few years . <h> The Gold Coast moves from glitz to gold <p> Over the past six years , we 've explored the Gold Coast more on short trips and began to see changes . We 'd stay at the Southern end of the Gold Coast around Coolangatta and Rainbow Bay and fell in love with laidback lifestyle and surfing culture . <p> Burleigh was never on my radar , though " in fact , I used to feel that it was a bit drab and lacked something . <p> Until 2014 when on our road trip we stayed at the caravan park across the road from the beach in Burleigh . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vintage- vibe and evolving cafe scene and one of the best family friendly beaches in Australia . No manufactured glitz , just home grown raw goodness . <p> When it came time to decide where to live in Australia , my inner voice spoke so clearly " Burleigh . It has everything that aligns with my soul . <p> It 's incredible how much a place can change " from boring to bountiful in just a few short years . <p> We 've even seen huge evolution since living- in on the Gold Coast in one year even . The cafe and restaurant scene is exploding , craft brew is on the rise , and the farmers market keeps getting better and better . <p> We have many people ask us why we chose Burleigh and the Gold Coast , after seeing the whole country . So I 'll share with you now more why we think it 's the most livable destination in Australia . <h> Why the Gold Coast is the best place to live in Australia <h> Family friendly and safe <p> I 'll keep this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie into this . <p> The Gold Coast is a great place to live for families . I never feel unsafe , and my children have access to a wide variety of experiences , opportunities , plenty of activities and facilities , and a good-natured upbringing by the beach . <p> There 's not an ageing population on the Gold Coast as is commonly perceived by many people . The average age of those on the Gold Coast is 37 . No wonder we feel so at home here ! <p> Just for the record , yall know I do n't  have a great opinion of the education system , and its hard to impress me , but Kalyras school does . Theyre focused on real learning , are very encouraging and supportive , they did not pressure her at all for this yearss NAPLAN test , and they do cool things like gardening , cooking , violin lessons , and night time art shows showcasing the childrens exceptional work . <h> Vibrant , active , outdoor lifestyle <p> I ca n't begin to tell you how much I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burleigh come to life . <p> The Esplanade is packed at 5 am : walkers , runners , surfers , SUPpers , kayakers , boot campers , and those taking advantage of the free exercise stations . <p> On many mornings ( or equally busy afternoons ) we join them . This vibrant outdoor activity- beckons you to- embrace a fit and healthy lifestyle . <p> We decided not to own a car so we 'd appreciate it more . We walk along the Esplanade almost every day to get to places . The girls often buzz around on their scooters and bikes , and I love that being so close to the beach and out in the sunshine , is a natural part of my day . <p> The council implement programs to encourage Gold Coast citizens to be fit and healthy . In fact , it is the largest active and healthy program run by a Council anywhere in Australia . <p> When we first moved to Burleigh , I would attend early morning boot camp on the Esplanade . They 're held three mornings a week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groan , and see results . My Mum often attends the free tai chi classes down at the beachfront , and there are often free , or cheap , yoga classes . <p> All along the beachfront are free BBQ 's and stations that even have hot water . The grass is well kept and constantly maintained to its lush green state . There are playgrounds for our girls every couple of hundred metres we walk along the Esplanade . <p> My mother in law and I often like to stand on our balcony and watch the boys working out the chin-up bars ! <p> This past weekend , I competed in a mock Commonwealth Games event ( which I 'll write more about later ) and met many local Gold Coast professional athletes ( some about to go to the Rio Olympics ) , and those in training at Griffith University . <p> All of them commented to me how the Gold Coast provided an optimal lifestyle to help them train . <h> Amazing climate <p> The climate on the Gold Cost is almost perfect . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough sunshine to keep you enjoying the great outdoors . And when it does storm , it 's so fantastic you ca n't help but be impressed . <p> I 've seen cyclonic waves roll in and take away half the beach , and I watched it all morning so in awe of the power of Mother Nature . <p> It has a cooler winter , but realistically , I wore a sweater/jumper about five times during winter last year. - Summers are long and hot , but not so hot that I get bothered by it " again there are- maybe just a handful of days I turn on the air con . <h> Surfing culture <p> Kalyra took up surfing lessons during the past year . I 'd get out in the surf with her to help , and even though I spent more time getting smashed about then assisting , I loved this time with her in the water and how being at one with the ocean helped to shape her . <p> One of my favourite things to do in Burleigh is a walk along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We pick up a coffee from Nook Espresso , a hole in the wall local 's favourite , and sit on the grassy hill to watch the surfers . <p> Surfers Point is also the place to be on a Sunday . The locals gather together bringing down their picnics and bottles of wine to hang out and watch the surfers . It 's super chilled , safe and friendly . <p> In March , one of my best friends scored tickets to the Corona tent at the Quiksilver Surf Pro at Snapper Rocks and dragged me along with her . Attending that event has been a bucket list dream of mine since I was a teenager . We had the best day ever , with the best seats and saw our favourite female surfer Stephanie Gilmore carve it up . <p> Gold Coast is home to many- surfing world champs . <p> Mick Fanning is one and Kelly Slater ( although American ) - has a home at Palm Beach , the next beach south of Burleigh . We 're yet to see either of them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point . <h> Incredible coastal walks and beauty <p> Burleigh Heads National Park <p> The walk between Greenmount Beach and Snapper Rocks and the Burleigh Headland coastal track are some of our favourite walks in Australia . They 're short and easy , yet pack in a lot of wow moments . <p> The beaches , particularly on the Southern end of the Gold Coast are beautiful . <p> One of our favourite things to do is walk around to Tallebudgera Creek , and either swim in the calm , family friendly beaches or Stand Up Paddle Board in the crystal clear waters . I think it 's one of Australia 's best-hidden gems . <p> Tallebudgera Creek <p> The Gold Coast has many- clear creeks , - pristine beaches and rivers , hidden- rock pools , and- more canals than Venice . There is an abundance of water activities you can do . ( You 'll learn more about the inland activities next ) <p> The Broadwater north of Surfers Paradise has a fantastic playground for kids , a safe swimming beach , and activities to enjoy such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarding . <p> As I tell anyone- when I give them tips on the Goldie get down to Snapper Rocks for sunset , it 's my favourite on the East Coast . <p> Sunset from Snapper Rocks <p> There is something magical about sitting on those rocks , watching the surfers and their silhouettes against an orange glowing sky . I 've often seen dolphins swimming around the point as well. - There are- walkers , unicycle riders , yogis , and all sorts of people- watching to enjoy . <p> Head up to Rainbow Bay Surf Club for a sunset beer and cheap meal . The surf club maintains rustic seventies charm and with views out over the ocean and hinterland . For a moment , you 'll feel like you 've been transported to a Hawaiian island . <h> The Gold Coast Hinterland <p> Until two years ago I did n't even know the hinterland existed . I thought it was just a mountain range in the distance . I ca n't believe that ancient rainforests and mountain retreats are right on my doorstep . It 's untouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to disconnect and reconnect . <h> Emerging food and craft beer scene <p> Burleigh Brewery <p> The Gold Coast is taking off with the food scene . When we moved here , it was the only place I could get almond milk in my cappuccinos . I could n't even get it in Sydney ( you can now ) . <p> Burleigh , in particular , seems to be on the pulse with current food trends . I can easily find gluten free , dairy free , sugar-free foods that taste great and are unique and interesting . New cafes are popping up all the time and places like Mermaid Beach , and Palm Beach are on the move for exciting eateries . <p> Many cafes- like Commune , have a retro , eclectic vibe , and many have beautiful beach views , like Dbar on the NSW/QLD border . Justin Lane has an incredible rooftop bar in Burleigh and often has line ups to get in for their highly recommended pizzas . <p> Justin Lane Pizza Bar <p> Diners spill out onto the pavement of a weekend in Burleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best restaurants in Australia . We 've not been yet but have heard the views and food is amazing . <p> Jupiter 's Casino has recently opened their latest restaurant , the Garden Kitchen &amp; Bar , which we 've visited several times in the last few months . The food is delicious as is the ambience with inside and outside seating , modern contemporary design and cascading foliage of the vertical garden walls . The outside space is fabulous for the kids to run around on and our girls enjoyed a game of croquet that was set out on the lawn for guests to play . <p> And food trucks are popping up everywhere from events to day and- night-time markets , to festivals dedicated to feasting on their yummy and cheap fare . <h> Access to amazing travel experiences <p> I love the location of the Gold Coast . <p> Just over the border are the NSW towns of Kingscliff and Byron Bay , in particular , the Byron Bay Hinterland . I- have several friends who live in the region from Byron to Sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more often than ever before . <p> The Gold Coast has an international airport at Coolangatta . It 's an easy 15-minute Uber ride , or we jump on the- express bus 777 , which stops virtually outside our door . It 's effortless , and the airport is small , so it makes plane travel a lot easier with fewer lines and hassle . <p> We have spent some time over the past year exploring many areas of South East Queensland that are only a few hours ' drive away . We 've been so impressed with all the places we 've discovered " even amazing mountain retreats that get snow . Here are some of the incredible places we 've discovered . <p> If you live on the Gold Coast , you are spoilt for easy getaway destinations . And it 's a beautiful place to return once your break is over . <h> Festivals , arts , and markets <p> Imagine going for your afternoon beach walk , finding a lot of people sitting on blankets at Burleigh Point with picnics and learning that Ben Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know , he 's a famous Australian musician with upbeat , groovy tunes and who I first saw play live when I was 19 . I was over the moon and pulled up a patch of grass to sing along . <p> It was part of the Bleach Festival , - whose aim is to connect the community- with culture through an expression of music , theatre , dance , visual arts , outdoor events and much more . <p> The Gold Coast has an incredible amount of festivals , events and growing arts scene that have a casual street party vibe . Every year , Broadbeach also hosts the Country Festival and the Blues Festival , which we attended with the girls and loved . <p> We have not yet been to the Arts Centre but have many friends who attend musicals , cinema showings , and some of the festivals and events held there . It 's bringing a lot of culture to the Coast . <p> The Village Markets is one of my favourite places to visit every first and third Sunday of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of designers , artists , creatives , foodies and musicians providing a hip experience for those who come . There 's also other markets held along different beach fronts every weekend . <p> One of our favourite places to go to on a Friday or Saturday night is Miami Marketta- " an outdoor- nighttime gathering of food trucks and live music. - We usually meet up with our friends , the kids all hang out eating lots of yummy food and dancing to music , and we can catch up in a relaxed , funky and safe place . <p> The newly opened Night Quarter Markets at the northern end of the Gold Coast at Helensvale have become a hugely popular and successful music venue and night market shopping area . <p> Every Sunday evening in James Park , Burleigh there is drum playing , fire throwing and one of the local stores brings down juggling balls , hula hoops and lots of fun things for the kids to play with . <h> Emerging entrepreneurial scene <p> We love living on the Gold Coast as we have many entrepreneurial friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a lot of people who think like us we can connect to on a regular basis . <p> A lot of movers and shakers are moving to the Gold Coast as a place to run their business , and there is such a creative spirit and freedom here . <p> There are- our Instagram superstar friends , Lauren Bath , Jewlzee and Gary Norris . Dan Norris is the founder of WP Curve and Black Hops Brewery , which has just opened up behind our house . The Merry Maker Sisters have just moved to the Gold Coast and transforming people into healthy , happy people . <p> These are just the people we know . There are many others creating their own products , services , and skin care lines . There 's a lot of fresh , creative energy here . <h> Alternative healthy living <p> Farmer 's markets abound . <p> I love that I get more of my produce now at my local farmer 's market ( and organic at that ) rather than Coles or Woolworths . I can walk to Burleigh farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's my favourite way to spend a Sunday morning . <p> They say that Byron Bay has a special healing energy , but I think that extends to Burleigh . <p> We have met some of the most amazing healers and alternative therapists on the Gold Coast . We regularly visit Matt , our chiropractor , Melanie our NLP therapist , Cheryl our chakra rebalancing and energy healer , Lani our kinesiologist and my good friend , Belinda Davidson , a white light healer who lives just on the border down in Tweed . <p> I- love having access to this right in my hometown and is one of the major reasons I am so in love with Burleigh and the Gold Coast . Yep , my love for the US must be so damn strong for me to leave it behind . <p> And it 's only going to get better . With the Commonwealth Games set to be held here in 2018 and three Universities and research development , exciting growth and opportunities are on the rise . <p> Sigh . I must be crazy right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever wanted in a place I 'd call home . Even though my eyes are set on a move elsewhere , it will always have a home in my heart- " a large , soft chunk of it . And I 'll never stop telling people who wonderful it is . <p> Press play for further insights into why the Gold Coast is a great place to be . Im interviewed in this video talking about why I love living here . Burleigh is also featured a lot ! <p> This post was brought to you in partnership with City of Gold Coast <p> Be sure to check out More Gold Coast . They have a wealth of stories and information on Gold Coast lifestyle and things to see and do . It 's the resource we have used the most since living here to dive deeper into this region we love so much . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Oh I had forgotten that many Gold Coast BBQs have hot water ! My husband &amp; I have considered moving from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors to consider first though = The Burleigh Headland coastal track is still a favourite of mine from a kid . It seemed so magical to me . The Natural Bridge in Springbrook is pretty stunning if you have n't been you should take a short drive to check it out before you go to the US . <p> I know we have not done the Natural Bridge yet ! When we visited Springbrook it was pelting down with rain so were really limited by what we could see . We loved it even with all that water , which is of course how it is so lush and green ! Were definitely keen to go back . <p> Wow , that was awesome to read through . I definitely agree , further south you go the better on the Gold Coast . Also . Air Asia offer flights to Auckland now so you can cheap flights year round to NZ , weeee . <p> Brrr being in Victoria , early winter , makes me wish we could be moving up there too . Always have loved the vibes and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a lap of Aus next year and go clockwise so we will be cruising slowly down the East Coast on the return leg and soaking up all the spots you have mentioned on the way . Enjoy the U.S. ! <p> I was on the Gold Coast just a month or so ago and we passed through Burleigh on our way to Currumbin Wildlife sanctuary on the bus . I was looking out the window at all the different towns and when we got to Burleigh , I really noticed the great vibe there , without even getting off ! I just knew it was a place I 'd like to come back to sometime . The next morning we took a taxi to the airport , and I asked the driver where he lived , he said " Burleigh , best place on the Gold Coast " . Now having read your blog , I understand even more why he thought so . So it must be the universe telling me something ! I must get back to the Gold Coast and stay in Burleigh next time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds just the place for me too . I am a holistic health and fitness person who lives off raw living foods also is a healer in many disciplines and love the beach scene . I have to live by the beach to feel alive ! I also love surfing having done this since childhood and so just living by a great coastline perfect for surfing will have me in paradise land . I loved reading about the organic farmers market , my supermarket = and how Burleigh is great place to be for alternative therapies and healing . Having started my own business to create an income online and also offline Burleigh sounds again like the place I need to be . At the moment I live in New Zealand and a Citizen so I can just hop and skip over to Burleigh in no time . I was intending to check Australia again in November this year and it sounds like I am heading over to Gold Coast to check it out . Thanks again for sharing = <p> No worries Jane . It definitely is the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love all the options ! I forgot to mention Gwinganna Health Retreat , which is also on the Gold Coast and one of the best places to go on retreat . Its part owned by Hugh Jackman . Were hoping to visit soon ! <p> I love the idea of living in Burleigh ! ! We currently live in Melbourne , and dream about living beachside . My kids are 8&amp;6 , and while I 'm sure there are some great primary schools , I wonder about the quality of secondary education ? ? ? Have you done any research into good public secondary schools ? ? <p> Not too much at the moment , but I have heard relatively good things about the school and the various programs they have to support children with special interests and talents . I think Palm Beach High School is meant to be great for that . <p> Hi there We live in Robina here on the Gold Coast . Would highly recommend Varsity College ( prep -year 12 ) . We moved our son from another school in Year 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the largest school in Queensland , the quality of education and care of students is amazing . We moved here from NZ when kids were 8 and 6 ? BTW. .. winter here is a little warmer than Victoria if that 's not a good reason to move I do n't  know what is ? ? lolx <p> The Sunshine Coast did n't  have the vibe we were looking for . We could n't quite explain it as its a beautiful place with lots to doand we do like it a lot ( more so to travel there ) but if felt like it was missing something for us . Its a bit quieter than the Gold Coast and I do n't  feel not as ahead with current trends , but that could possibly change . The Gold Coast feels more vibrant , holistic and happening . <p> I have traveled all over the Gold Coast and I have to say it really is beautiful ! I especially love the year round warm weather and surfing lifestyle . There are so many gorgeous places in Australia and I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gold Coast is definitely in my top five ! <p> I really enjoyed your post ! I will be coming to living in Australia in September from Canada and have not yet decided where I 'd like to live , but your piece has me intrigued . Would you say the cost of living in this area is average , more , or less ? You say the cafes &amp; restaurants etc. are booming , does this mean possible job opportunities ? I appreciate any thoughts you have ! <p> Hi Ceilidh , I would say the cost of living would be average , certainly no more expensive than Sydney or Melbourne . The Gold Coast has a huge hospitality industry with all the hotels , cafes , restaurants etc so if you have the correct visa you should find something ! <p> I had once visited the Gold Coast and its wonderful atmosphere , culture , breathtaking places made me fall in love with it . It gives people the best experience they could ever have . And that is what made it the best place to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caz , I 'm going to the Gold Coast next year to undertake a Masters program and I 'm looking for a school for my daughter . Could you please recommend me one ? Thank you very much , I 'm even more inspired now that I read your blog . <p> Thank you , Craig ! Unfortunately I believe she will not be able to go there . My daughter will probably be enroled in the 7th year so I think we will need to look for a high school . Shes 11 now and will be 12 next May . Do you know of any nice high schools at the Gold Coast ? <p> I do n't  know yet , I 'd like to choose the location according to a good school . My brother lives in Burleigh though , and I will study at Griffith University . So we will probably live near one of these two reference points . <p> Hi ! We 're Caz &amp; Craig <p> Travel addicts living life unplugged and proving travel does n't stop after kids . 
@@21820451 @1820451/ <h> Step 1 Choose Your Destination <p> Where do you want to go ? - <p> Your first step in how to start planning a trip- is to choose a travel destination that meets your interests and travel budget . <p> Are you planning overseas travel or a domestic trip at home ? - Either way , the whole idea of taking a trip is to have a memorable time , to have fun and relax , and not to spend your whole vacation time worrying about money . <h> How much time do you have ? <p> If you only have 1-2 weeks of vacation time per year , do n't waste too much of that time traveling to and from your destination .

It 's an all in one flights , hotel and car- hire search engine app ! <h> AirBnB <p> When you plan your trip also consider- Airbnb- . They are another one of our favorite accommodation sites when I- plan my trip . <p> Airbnb are in 180 countries and you can book entire apartments- and houses , or just spare bedrooms- allowing you the choice between having the place all to yourself or staying with and getting to know the owner . <p> Even if you never meet your host , you 'll get to feel more like a local . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rent out people 's entire homes. - If you are new to Airbnb , we have a $45 AUD credit voucher for you when you sign up here . <p> During your travel planning research the transport options for your destination . This will save you time and stress once there . <h> Rental Cars <p> If you need a rental car , booking online in advance will almost always get you a better deal than if you just show up at the counter . And it 's easier and quicker . <p> The last thing you want to do after a long flight is deal with rental car companies at the airport and negotiate a deal . <p> The quickest way to compare rental companies is to use an aggregator site that searches all the major car brands at once and checks which supplier offers the best prices for your chosen dates and location . <p> We always start our search with RentalCars.com .

Click the image below to search for things to do in your destination : <h> Step 6 Places to Eat &amp; Drink <p> You can learn a lot about a destination through its food and drink , and you can even plan a trip by eating your way through a destination . For some people that is their favorite thing about travel . Is that you ? <p> When I plan my trips I love to discover new cafes , restaurants , bars and pubs when I travel . I like to try the local delicacies , the local craft beers , and coffee scene . <p> And as a family , its important we learn about the family friendly places to eat , not only from a practicality standpoint but from a budget standpoint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning an overseas trip and do n't  have a passport yet , give yourself enough time to apply at least 6 weeks before departure and preferably as soon as you have booked your flights and accommodation . <p> And if you already have a passport , what is the expiration date ? Most countries require that your passport is- valid for six months beyond your date of stay and it has enough empty pages for stamps/visas . <h> Step 8 Know the Visa Requirements <p> Do you know- the visa entry requirements for your destination ? Do you even need a specific visa and how do you get it ? <p> Each country and nationality will be different , and again , do n't  leave this till the last minute as it could take significant time to organize . <p> If you are worried about how to plan an overseas trip because of visas , you can learn more about tourist visas- for all countries and passport holders at- Project Visa- then double check with each relevant embassys website ! <h> Step 9 Get Immunizations <p> Are you planning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Depending on where you plan your trip in a particular country , its important to get the right advice for any necessary vaccinations before you travel . <p> Your safety and health are essential , and in some instances , you ca n't travel unless you have proof of having been vaccinated . <p> Talk to your doctor or health care professional knowledgeable about travel vaccines . Visit them at least 2 months before departure as some vaccinations need to be started six to eight weeks before departure and require more than one shot spread out over time . <p> And take any records you have of previous shots . <h> Step 10 Make Copies of important documents <p> Image : Dreamstime.com <p> When you are planning a trip sometimes your important documents get misplaced . Companies can lose your booking reservation or there is a communication breakdown between the price you paid and the expected service . <p> For peace of mind , make copies of important documents such as : <p> Passports <p> Visas <p> Flight tickets <p> Itineraries <p> Hotel reservations <p> Rental car reservations <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else you booked for your trip . <p> Print out hard copies and save your confirmation emails into a " folder " in your web-based email account . Consider leaving copies at home with a trusted person , and if traveling with a partner each carry copies . <p> Hard copies of certain documents are important as you wo n't always have access to the internet to search email . <p> US immigration lost our passports when we lived in the US whilst applying for an extension to our visa . Luckily we had copies so went to the Australian Embassy in LA and got emergency passports to leave the country on time , otherwise , we would have overstayed our visa ! <h> Step 11 Phone &amp; Internet Access <p> These days almost everyone travels with at least a- smartphone , - plus other gadgets that require connection to the internet and a data plan . <p> As travel bloggers , we know more than most the frustration at not being able to be connected on the road . But you might just like to update your Facebook account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels . <p> This is what we do when we travel abroad : <p> We have an unlocked phone so we can use local SIM cards . <p> Or , we use our phone only when we have access to free wifi . <p> As for our laptops , we either use the free wifi in our room , at a cafe , or we use a mobile data device such as WiWander and- Tep Wireless . <h> Step 12 Accessing Your Money <p> We all want ease and convenience when traveling , especially when it comes to accessing our money . We also want to reduce our bank and transaction fees . The more money we keep in our own pockets , the more we have to spend on travel . <p> International transaction fees can be hefty when using the WRONG credit cards and checking account cards . <p> Considering there are people reading this from many different countries and traveling to different destinations , it is impossible for us to recommend THE BEST cards or ways for everyone to access their money . <h> How to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you transfer money overseas using the banks they take a 4-7% margin AND add fees on top . We 've found a way to put more money back in your pocket not the banks CEO . <p> With OFX.com you get the best exchange rate the closest to what it actually trades at on the market WITH no fees . <p> The Charles Schwab debit card ( available through their high-yield checking account ) is commonly mentioned as the best travel debit card out there for both domestic or international travel . <p> You can use any ATM in the world and Schwab reimburses all the ATM fees at the end of each month . It seems that if there was an award for most favorite ( and the least evil ) bank ever it would probably win . <p> Benefits : <p> No ATM fees worldwide . <p> No fee for foreign currency exchange . <p> No monthly service fees . <p> No account minimum . <p> Unlimited reimbursement of any ATM usage . E FDIC-insured . <p> While you will still be charged by other ATM 's for taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the month . <p> Free international money transfers from Australia to other CitiBank accounts in 25 countries . <p> This account operates with a Visa debit card so you can withdraw money from your account at any ATM that accepts Visa . If you find a CitiBank ATM , you can use your card free of charge . <p> CitiBank has an international network with over 20,000 ATMs globally . <h> Credit Cards <p> You 'll almost certainly need a credit card when traveling in order to book flights , rental cars , hotels etc online . Providers require this for the security deposit , plus paying with a credit card provides some insurance and security for you . <p> If you have a problem with a hotel room or a tour , you can dispute the payment with Visa/MasterCard . If you pay cash , it 's gone . <p> Make sure when you plan your trip overseas your card is linked to either the PLUS , Cirrus or Maestro networks . This enables you to access cash anywhere worldwide . <p> For a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards are a good option . <h> Notify Your Bank <p> Before you depart , be sure to contact your bank and credit card companies to inform them that you will be traveling , where to and when . This is to stop them putting a freeze on your card if they see unusual transactions from overseas . <h> Step 13 Purchase Travel Insurance <p> If you ca n't afford travel insurance , then you ca n't afford to travel " . Its that simple . <p> Not having travel insurance on an overseas trip ( or domestic ) is not worth the risk . Anything can , will , and sometimes goes wrong . If it does and you are not insured , you can be up for a lot of money AND inconvenience . <p> When you are planning a trip , do n't  shrug off this step . Its one of the most important vacation planning tips ! <p> What happens if : <p> You need to cancel your trip unexpectedly <p> A hurricane damages your destination <p> There is a terrorist event <p> You get sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stolen <p> You lose your passport <p> Travel insurance is designed to cover unexpected medical emergencies and events such as trip cancellation , your personal effects , lost , stolen or damaged luggage by an airline , and other related losses incurred while traveling . <p> Which travel insurance is best for you ? There are different levels of coverage depending on : <p> The plan <p> The insurance company you purchase with <p> The size of your deductible ( excess ) <h> Best Travel Insurance Companies <p> One of the best travel insurance companies we have used many times since 2006 is World Nomads . Simple and flexible to use- and they cover- residents from 150 countries . <p> And World Nomads allows you to buy travel insurance online 24/7 from anywhere in the world , even if you 're already traveling ( love this option ! ) <p> Americans check out IMGlobal- who can separate travel and medical insurance but are mostly suited to expats living overseas . And- Clements also gets frequently recommended within the travel community ( especially for covering electronics ) . Also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance companies , check out Insure My Trip- and Squaremouth. - <p> For Australians , besides World Nomads check out World 2 Cover- ( free cover for your children and grandchildren 25 and under when they are traveling with you ) - and Cover-More . <h> Step 14 Pack Smart <p> Thinking about packing can be stressful when you are planning your trip , but the best thing to do is pack the bare minimum because you can always buy it there ! <p> Encourage your kids to choose and pack their own clothes to minimize complaints and to teach- travel planning skills . <p> Select versatile , comfortable and loose fitting clothes and neutral colors that can be worn in multiple combinations so if something gets dirty you only have to change part of the outfit . <p> Packing cells are a lifesaver . In each packing cell , we roll up each item and arrange clothes based on type and season . And Caz loves her- underwear organizer that rolls up and clips together like a little sleeping bag and sits in your suitcase neatly just like packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of clothes for dinner , pajamas , or what is needed during the day in case of accidents . <h> Top 5 Travel Packing Tips : <p> Know the weather of the destination you are visiting , which helps reduce over-packing . <p> When flying- take a change of clothes in your carry-on just in case your checked-in luggage does n't  arrive with you . <p> Know the activities you will be doing so you can pack appropriately . <p> Know the types of accommodation you will be staying at .

Sahara Desert <p> The Sahara Desert is the main reason why people travel to Morocco . In Merzouga you can see the highest dunes and Morocco is a relatively safe destination to travel in comparison with the other countries where the desert occupies large parts of their territories . <h> 2 . Hassan II Mosque <p> Hassan II is the landmark of Casablanca but also the most beautiful mosque in Morocco . It is a surrealistic experience to walk around its impressive construction surrounded by the mist coming from the ocean . Try to visit the mosque on Sunday morning when many people go to the prayer and the place comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French painter Jacques Majorelle but later the home of the designer Yves Saint-Laurent , this garden is a beautiful masterpiece combining oriental colors and exotic plants . <p> It is a quiet place in the middle of Marrakech , the busy imperial city of Morocco and also the house of the Berber Museum , exhibition of the Berber 's culture , lifestyle , and handcrafts. <h> 4 . The Riads <p> Riads are traditional Moroccan houses that often are turned into small hotels . Feeling cozy behind the thick walls of your guest house after wandering on the small narrow streets of the medina will be your time for indulging in all things Morocco has to offer " good food , excellent service and magical environment . <h> 5 . Medina <p> Walking in the medina can be really challenging for a woman . But the feeling of treasure hunting makes you feel exited in front of all these colorful babush slippers , spices , jewelry pieces , leather bags , tasty food and freshly baked bread . There are hundreds of items that you can choose from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel ? <h> 6 . Moroccan mint tea and pastries <p> Tasting mint tea and local pastries is another thing you should absolutely do while visiting Morocco . It is always a good time when you enjoy these two , especially with a good view and pleasant company . The tea is served everywhere and tastes the same but the pastries vary depending on the place . <p> Be happy , you will always have those for breakfast in your hotel and you can kick start your day with a slice of pleasure ! <h> 7 . El Bahia Palace , Marrakesh <p> This palace has certain melancholy that is difficult to explain but easy to feel at the moment you put your foot on its floor . The beauty of the architectural details and the refreshingly green garden make this place one of the top five to visit in Marrakech. <h> 8 . Morocco Interiors <p> Another of Morocco 's charms are its cozy houses and bold house fixtures . The sofas are large and low , the tables are small but just enough for the tasty food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ochre color of the tiles makes the whole room look warm . Everything in the Moroccan style interior design is rustic but made with clear attention to the detail . <h> 9 . Carpets <p> Having shared my addiction to the Moroccan interiors , it is understandable to share my love for Moroccan carpets . <p> As everything in this country , they are in strong and warm colors , with simple designs that can fit any style . Your house can get a bright retouch with a Moroccan rug . The only problem can be its weight and volume for transporting it back home . <h> 10 . Landscapes <p> Pictures speak for themselves , but you ca n't get the real beauty of any landscape in a photo . Better to see it with your own eyes ! <h> 11 . Oasis <p> Well , you have to go out of the famous cities like Marrakech and Casablanca , to pass the Atlas Mountains and on your way to the south you finally will get to take these unbelievable photos in orange and green colors . Oasis still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence of Arabia . <h> 12 . Colors <p> In my opinion , Morocco is the most colorful country in the world . The colors are everywhere you go . The nature is full of bold reds , mulberry and orange , and ochre ; the houses are overwhelmed with green and even the food has the whole gamma of colors thanks to the spices and freshly collected veggies. <h> 13 . Cats <p> The funny thing about Morocco that totally surprised me was the presence of the cats . <p> They were everywhere " at the town squares , tourist sites , hotel lobbies and even in the corners of the medina , calmly resting on their master 's motorbike . And also like the human , they represent the typical features of their habitats " looking like beggars on the streets or having the look of a king in the garden of Saadian Tombs . <h> 14 . Hotel Mamounia <p> Synonymous for luxury and grandeur , La Mamounia is an obligatory stop for travelers in Marrakech because of its history and notorious clientele . And do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a night stay . You can just go and have a coffee at the hotel 's terrace where you will mix with the rich and famous people of the world . <h> 15 . Architecture <p> Kasbah is another traditional style house in Morocco which is mainly built inside the ksar , the Berber villages made from adobe . <p> You can see these villages at the foot of the Atlas Mountains when heading to the Sahara Desert . Today , the typical architecture and traditional techniques and materials involved in the construction of the kasbah are used for building unique Moroccan hotels . <h> 16 . Hotels with amazing views <p> Moroccan landscapes are some of the most beautiful in the world . They are changing with the regions but also with the change of the sunlight . And very often your Moroccan hotel will have a terrace with such a wonderful view that your time for coffee or tea will last much longer than you planned . You just cant take your eyes off the- magnificent scenery ! <h> 17 . Magical guesthouses <p> Remember the 1001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses feels like you are in a different time and place , an imaginary world that can only be found in . Morocco , of course ! <h> 18 . Todgha Gorge <p> Some places in Morocco are spectacular with their formations and colors . Todgha Gorge is one of them . <p> Its orange rocks are scary and impressive at the same time . The canyon is a favorite place for climbers but if you are not up to this , there is a small market where you can buy handmade goods and beautiful carpets- from local people . <h> 19 . Volubilis <p> It is somewhat surprising to see Roman ruins in the abounding green fields near Meknes . <p> In our minds , Morocco is about the desert and Arabic lifestyle but in the past the life here had a different look . The huge architectural site is full of small and beautiful ornamental details , different architectural styles and you most probably will take the whole morning to walk around these beautiful sites from another time . <h> 20 . Tajine <p> Moroccan food is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so tasty is in the spices used but also in the locally produced fresh ingredients . <p> Tajine ( also tagine ' ) is a method of slow cooking where the ingredients are placed in an earthen pot . There are different types of tajine , but you should definitely try the Berber tajine. <h> 21 . Moroccan pottery <p> Tajine is the name of the dish but also the pot used for its cooking . What you can do is to take one home with you , and every time you have a craving for Moroccan food you can do one at home . <p> When shopping for pottery in Morocco you should have in mind that some of the beautifully colored tajines are not for cooking and you better ask the seller for advice on which one is suitable for cooking and which one just for serving . <h> 22 . Unique places to relax <p> After days spent walking among the desert dunes under the strong sun of the Sahara , you can relax surrounded by traditional architecture , clay walls , palm trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enjoy your time in this unique environment , you will not find it anywhere else in the world . <h> 23 . Unique souvenirs to buy <p> You may not be a person who buys souvenirs often , but here in Morocco you may find yourself seriously challenged . <p> In addition to the traditional pottery , rugs and lanterns , the fossils found in the Sahara desert are one of the best souvenirs that you can bring back home . <p> Desert roses and fossilized snail shells are sold by the Berber people that you will encounter in the desert . Sometimes it is the only way they can make some money and you can take beautiful pieces back home while helping these people to have a better life . <h> Plan Your Trip to Morocco 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 <p> Booking.com has over 3,800 properties in Morocco including hotels , apartments , and guesthouses .

How can you describe the security over there at the moment ? Did you feel safe during your trip ? <p> You are right , it is popular and it is because Morocco is one of the more peaceful destinations in North Africa . You feel secure and people are really friendly and helpful . The only problem is that women often can feel harassed by unwanted attention .

The music is like Morocco itself sounds mysterious but lively and easily digestible ( do n't  know even if I can use these words for music but it is how it felt ) and you can hear it at restaurants or other venues , there are no groups on the streets like in Cuba . People are friendly , kind , helpful , very easy to make a contact and have a conversation .

We had an amazing trip into the desert even though it started with an unpredictable sandstorm . After a thorough exfoliation , we enjoyed sunset , dinner and music in the Berber tents . The next morning was a beautiful sunrise . The camel ride was excellent and a memorable experience . Our guide in the desert was also friendly and helpful .

Just the name of this country transports you to an exotic ancient place full of jewels and Sinbad-like characters . <p> But Oman is also an upcoming travel destination that will give you so much variety of experiences : mountains , canyon , beaches , wildlife , history , and architecture . Discover some of the top places and things to do in Oman and pack your bags ! <h> 8 top things to do in Oman <h> 1 . The wildlife <p> One of the highlights of any trip to Oman is to admire the turtles nesting on the beach and making their way back to the sea just before sunrise . <p> Their effort to find the perfect spot to lay their eggs and then sliding back to the sea is admirable . They are really not meant to be on land . And if you are lucky you could even spot babies hatching and trying to make it to the ocean . <p> The Ras Al Jinz Turtle Reserve offers this experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature reserve and access is limited . <p> Other wildlife activities include snorkeling in the Daymaniyat islands or chasing the elusive Arabian leopard. <h> 2 . The architecture <p> Built between 1995 and 2011 , the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque is a breathtaking piece of Islamic architecture . Located in the flat area of Muscat the building , its garden and 5 minarets stands out in the landscape . <p> You can explore the outside with the long corridors full of mosaics and arches , or admire the decor of the main prayer room with the 21-ton hand woven carpet . It is also home to a magnificent chandelier : 14 meters in height , 8 meters in diameter , 1122 light bulbs and 600,000 crystals ! <p> Another jewel of Omani architecture and technical mastery is the Muscat Opera House with its wooden decor and state of the art sound set up . <h> 3 . The history <p> Selecting the best fort in Oman is not so easy . There are many and several of them are similar . <p> One of the most famous is the Nizwa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the 34-meter high tower for great views of the city . The Souq around the castle is a local meeting point making the visit interesting on many levels . <p> Built at the beginning of the 17th century , it took 12 years to complete . The Omani government does a great job at restoring and maintaining it . Most rooms have displays showing visitors how people used to live and how the fort was protected . <h> 4 . Unesco World Heritage sites <p> The Sultanate of Oman has 4 sites on the Unesco World Heritage List ( as of 2016 ) . The most famous is the Aflaj irrigation systems which can be seen in many old villages . <p> Other fascinating sites are the necropolises of Bat and Al-Ayn . At Ay-Ayn , the beehive tombs are aligned on a ridge with amazing scenery . Built by nomads , they are evidence of life during the Bronze Age in the Omani region . <h> 5 . The beaches <p> Oman has a great variety of beaches : the classic flat stretches of sand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North of Muscat , Al-Sawadi beach is covered with shells . And at low tide you can cross to the Sawadi fort located on an island . It is a favorite for locals in the weekend . <h> 6 . The mountains and Omans Grand Canyon <p> But more than its beaches , Oman is famous for its mountains , especially the areas of Jebel Akhdar and Jebel Shams . <p> The latest is a top destination for visitors as it is home to Omans Grand Canyon . The deep rift , next to the 3000-meter high mountains , has vertical cliffs dropping over 1000 meters . A hike on a balcony walk is definitively not for travelers with vertigo . <h> 7 . The wadis <p> Another one of the best things to do in Oman is to go deep into the wadis . <p> The most famous are Wadi Shab and Wadi Bani Khalid . The latest is easier to access . The first pools are within 10 min of easy walking and another 10 minutes of walking and climbing over boulders will take you to a swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cliffs and rocks . <h> 8 . The deserts <p> Considering its location on earth , most of Oman is covered by desert , the largest one being the Empty Quarter . <p> The most visited one , however , is Wahiba Sands . Located only 3 hours away from the capital city , its longitudinal sand dunes cover 180km of lands North to South . Permanent camps have been set up for visitors but wild camping is also permitted if you feel more adventurous . As always sand dunes offer wonderful sunrises and sunsets . <p> As you can see , you will be amazed every day on a- trip to Oman . <p> Ready to pack your bags and visit Oman ? <p> See more photos and information about those locations , and more things to do in Oman at my- Oman Travel Guide . <p> Funny how new destinations sometimes enter our lives .

@@21820461 @1820461/ <p> When searching online for cheap rental cars , there are a few strategies and tips to be aware of so you end up booking your best deal . <h> 19 ways to save money on rental cars <h> 1 . Book in advance <p> When you book online in advance you will almost always get a better deal than at the counter . And its easier and quicker . The last thing you want to do after a long flight is deal with rental car companies at the airport and negotiate a deal . <p> Be sure to take all your documents with you as proof of hire and your rates to avoid any hassles ( scan and save in your email account ) . <h> 2 . Check prices frequently <p> Just like when you search for flights it pays to check prices frequently as they do change different days can have different rates.If you use an aggregator site that searches all the major rental car companies at once its fairly quick and painless . <p> And compared to flights , the great thing about renting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-booked without fees , and in most cases your credit card does n't get charged until you pick-up the car . <p> So if you do book early with no cancellation penalties and the price drops before you pick up your car you can always cancel and re-book . Sometimes car companies will drop their prices just before a weekend if they have excess stock . <h> 3 . Adjust Pick-Up and Drop-Off Times <p> When searching for cheap rental cars online , the pick-up and drop-off times are typically in half hour increments . Try tweaking these times and see if it affects your rates . <p> Sometimes tacking on an extra day to that weekly rental , or even adding a couple of hours to extend it over a weekend , can actually lower your rate . This strategy takes advantage of lower prices aimed at leisure travelers who are more likely to travel on weekends . Weekend rates are great , but weekly rates can be the best of all . <h> 4 . Book the smallest vehicle you 'll need <p> Think carefully about what type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for the big SUV or the fancy sports car , but always think fuel consumption and the practicalities of your car . <p> Being comfortable is important so you enjoy your road trip . Do n't  go small and cheap if you are crammed in like sardines . <p> Book the lowest class vehicle you 'll comfortably need , and chances are you might get a free upgrade at the counter , which often happens to us ! Just make sure you can afford the increased fuel costs of an upgraded bigger car ! <h> 5 . Avoid the airport <p> Off-airport locations are typically cheaper than airport locations ( they tack on fees ) . Look in nearby neighborhood locations to save money . Just make sure the downtown branch is not on the outskirts of the city limits meaning a long and costly taxi ride . <p> This strategy is best applied in cities that have efficient and affordable public transport to get you to the dealer without hassle . <p> You ca n't beat an on-airport ' pick-up for convenience , but an off-airport ' pick-up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Save on a days rental <p> If you do n't  need your rental car immediately , take the complimentary shuttle to your accommodation and book a car for the next day . Youll save a day 's rental and should pay less being an off-airport location . And do the same at the end of your trip . <h> 7 . Be wary of one-way drop off fees <p> Obvious I know , but one-way drop off fees can be huge and make it difficult to find cheap rental cars . Where possible plan your trip so that you return your rental car to its original location . <h> 8 . Check for unlimited mileage options <p> Make sure your rental includes the unlimited mileage option and you can take your car where you need to go . The last thing you want to worry about is getting stung for any excess miles . <h> 9 . Check the fuel policy options <p> Some rental car companies will require you to return the car with the same amount of fuel it had in the tank at pick-up . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must purchase the first tank of fuel and may drop the car off empty " in which case , there may be no refund for unused fuel . <p> Where the car hire company charges for fuel , the cost may be higher than it would be at a local petrol station . <h> 10 . Age requirements <p> In most locations , the minimum rental age is 21 years . Additional fees can apply with certain car rental companies for drivers aged under 25 years or over 65 years . They are defined as more at " risk " drivers . <p> If you 're not yet over 25 years but are traveling with a companion who is , have them be the designated driver to save on this cost . <h> 11 . Additional driver fee <p> Extra fees typically apply for additional drivers . However in some states and countries spouses are mandated additional drivers by law . But you MUST add the additional driver 's name to the contract to make any necessary insurance claims valid . <p> Again , if you can get by with having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , NEVER run the risk of driver fatigue , a few extra bucks is nothing when it comes to your safety and that of others on the road ! <h> 12 . Additional state taxes and fees <p> Be aware of additional state taxes and fees that may apply if you cross state borders or enter another country . And do n't  lie about where you are taking the vehicle , because if you have an issue you probably wont be covered by insurance ! <h> 13 . Decline the GPS ( Navigation system ) <p> If the car navigation system is an extra add on , skip it and use the Google maps app on your phone to save $10-$15 per day . I did that on my last car rental from Sydney without any issues . <h> 14 . Save on Insurance <p> If you use a certain credit card to pay for your rental car , you may not need to pick up the insurance , as the credit card company does that for you . Ask your card carrier before you travel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Also , check with your current auto insurance company to see whether a rental car abroad would be covered under your current policy . Again , call your insurance provider to see if extra insurance is even necessary . NEVER just assume you 're covered ! <p> But there 's no reason to pay for coverage that you already have ! <h> 15 . Do n't  use your debit card <p> Book using your credit card . Not only for added consumer protection and rewards points if its a rewards card , but rental companies tend to hold a larger deposit for use of debit cards and the hold on your deposit may take days to be returned . <h> 16 . Bring your own child safety seat <p> If you 're traveling with a little one , is it practical for you to bring your own child safety seat to save yourself some coin ? <h> 17 . Ask about specials <p> Do you qualify for senior citizen , AAA , credit card and frequent flier program discounts or add-on offers ? These discounts can all add up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspect your car before driving away <p> Do a thorough inspection of your rental car before driving out of the lot . If you find any damage fill in the documentation ( get a copy ) and take pictures with your phone so you have a time &amp; date stamp . You do n't  want to be held liable for damage from a previous driver . <h> 19 . Check your credit card statement <p> Once you have completed your rental , double check your credit card statement to ensure any extra charges or fees werent added that you did n't ask for or receive . This can and does happen . <h> How to search for cheap rental cars <p> If you are like me and do n't  have much free time , the last thing you want to do is spend days looking for a deal . But searching for cheap rental cars does n't  have to be a pain in the butt . <p> The quickest way to compare rental companies is to use an aggregator site that searches all the major car brands at once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates and location . <p> We always start with RentalCars.com- when searching for cheap rental cars , its a site we have booked through several times over the years when traveling from Australia to the USA , and whilst living in North Carolina for four years . <p> This site has saved us time and money in the past for finding cheap rental cars and we continue to use them . <p> In case you do n't  know , they 're the worlds biggest car rental booking service ( part of the Priceline Group ) and in one quick search you can compare all the major brands like Hertz , Avis , Alamo , Europcar , Enterprise , Thrifty , and Dollar . <p> To be clear , we are an affiliate of this site and earn a small commission if you choose to book through them ( at no additional cost to you ) .

@@21820462 @1820462/ <p> For the amount of effort that is required on our behalf business wise , the pressures of travelling with small children through South East Asia proved too much . <p> Our girls at the time were 5 and 18 months . Kalyra is a pretty good age to travel with , although she can get tired easily and likes to complain . <p> Savannah , on the other hand , is a toddler , hell-bent on exploring the world with the energy of an every ready bunny . <h> The Worst Age to Travel with Kids <p> The Toddler Age , in my opinion , is the worst age to travel with kids . <p> On our Thailand trip there was absolutely zero time to relax or to absorb anything around me . I felt stressed , overburdened , and highly anxious . We should be travelling to experience lightness and joy , not heaviness and stress . <p> At times I feel like a bit of a cop out " you know when the going gets tough , the fake and softies fall apart . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our blog . It can be very tough and full of challenges . Never be afraid to change direction or style to whatever brings you the most comfort and joy . <h> The Challenges of Toddler Travel <p> Here 's why we feel Toddler Ville is the WORST age to travel and how we found it extra burdensome in South East Asia . <h> Toddlers Ca n't Sit Still <p> I was not letting go <p> They 've just learned to walk ; they 've got to practice this new skill . The legs wo n't stop moving and if you hold them in your arms for a moments rest , the battle of the wriggles will begin . <p> Try having a conversation or listening to a tour guide when that happens . <p> Plus the roads in South East Asia are chaos , it 's a lot more challenging to let them walk on the sidewalk , or even in a wider spaced area , the trouble they can get themselves into are more prevalent . <p> On our balcony at the Hilton in Phuket was a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not 100% sure as we did n't test it ) and crashed to the pavement below . We could n't sit and relax on the balcony . <p> When we took a boat trip to Phang Ngha Bay ( probably a stupid decision on our behalf ) I almost had an anxiety attack and felt like I was going to vomit . There were far too many places she could climb and fall overboard . <p> The life jacket was on her and I battled with the wriggles for the journey , not able to enjoy the scenery much at all . <h> Plane Journeys are Taxing with Toddlers <p> Trying to keep her entertained on the plane <p> Long Flights are Not Good with a Toddler ; they will hate the restricted space . <p> They have trouble sleeping and if they get upset and start crying you worry so much about disturbing the peace of the other passengers that your chest and stomach becomes tightly wound and your blood pressure shoots up . <h> Toddlers Need Car Seats <p> Usually , when we are driving at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . It 's one of the only places you can as a parent . <p> Not in South East Asia , they do n't have car seats , half the time they do n't have seat belts . We were driven around a lot , for hours at a time . Trying to keep Savannah still and wrapped in our arms was simply awful . Once they get to the age of around 2 they start to learn how to sit still . <h> Toddlers Need Nappies <p> A headache to carry around , to change and a lot of the time to find rubbish bins to put them in . <h> Toddlers May Still Need Bottles <p> Holy crap this is a logistical nightmare ! <p> First , you have to carry the bottles and the formula and then you have to figure out a way to wash the bottles each day . You ca n't use tap water as it is not safe for drinking . Depending on where you stay you may not even have facilities to wash them . <p> We had a kettle in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the sink with boiling water and detergent and washed them that way . <h> Toddlers Need a Pram <p> Prams are helpful for getting around and naps when you are out . It 's also a gigantic pain in the arse to haul this extra luggage and to navigate crooked Thai streets and busy Sky trains . <h> Toddlers Need Naps <p> This can be a good thing- if you can get them to sleep because it will give you a break . <p> But , their routine will be different and they could be overstimulated . If you do n't get them to sleep during the day , once 5pm comes you 'll be reaching for something stronger than a glass of wine . <p> Also , for night time sleeping , they need a portable- cot . In Thailand , this was hard to come by . We had four nights in a hotel , where Savannah did not have a cot . It 's always fun to chase them around a room at 3am . <h> Meal Time is a Nightmare <p> A rare seated meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changing to new food can prove a headache as they refuse to try new things and you have to resort to fries and cheese sandwiches , which cost more . <p> Judging by the throwing up Savannah did the day after the sandwich , perhaps the more dodgy option too . <p> Because toddlers like to wriggle and move , give up the idea of sitting down to enjoy a meal . You 're up down up down , getting indigestion as a result and perfecting the parent 5 min food throw down . <p> As a parent , pay attention to how quickly you eat " it 's a very common happening . A lot of the restaurants in Thailand are on busy main roads . Panic attacks . Again apartment stays where you can cook your own food while the kids run around are best . <h> Toddlers Ca n't Talk <p> They ca n't tell you what they want or what they need . They ca n't tell you when they are sick or where . <p> Savannah grunts and whines a lot . We soon discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a van full of people . We were stressed for days as we did not know if it was food poisoning , car sickness , or something worse . <h> Toddlers Ca n't Really Entertain Themselves <p> Yes ! They 're playing by themselves . <p> This is not me saying I do n't want to play with my kids or give them attention , I just find it draining to do it every minute of every hour . <p> Even Kalyra is not great at entertaining herself . We could n't ' have a conversation with anyone without her pulling at our attention . When you are dealing with the challenges of travel this extra on demand attention can nearly break you . Sometimes you just need five minutes of quiet . <h> Toddlers are Teething <p> This was the moment for the first time in my life I actually wanted to go home . <p> We had Savannah sick for a couple of days and then the teething hit . The eye teeth notoriously known as the most painful . She screamed for a day and two nights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three days ended with the fist vomit . <h> They 're Too Young for Kids Clubs <p> Kalyra loves Kids Club <p> Not that we ever really have time to make use of Kids Clubs , they are a great way to get a break . <p> Kalyra also loves them and begs us to go . We managed to squeeze in a two-hour visit for her at the Hilton Phuket . The starting age for most Kids Clubs is from 2-4 years of age . <p> Travel with children is rewarding <p> Now , all of this is not meant to put you off travelling with your toddler . <p> Part of our inability to deal with this also came with the fact we are " travel bloggers " and were on a work trip and had certain things we needed to do . <p> And of course to add to this stress , I was sick for a week , Craig ended up sick for a day , and our website had major issues . <p> So when the kids were in bed and we were up late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't working we were dealing with the stress of trying to troubleshoot our website . We are now weeks behind with work . <p> The combination of all these things did us in . <p> We learned a lot , especially about how we really want to travel for the next couple of years . With the nature of what we do we have to simplify and make it a little easier for us and the girls . <p> But for you , you might have less going on and its " just a holiday " and not so much as a " business trip " so more able to deal with the challenges . <p> We ALWAYS recommend travelling with your children no matter what their age . <p> The rewards are worth overcoming the challenges . We recommend that you think more about the following : 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I absolutely 100% agree with you . Even worse than travelling with a toddler as a single child is travelling with a toddler when you have an older child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to do that Inky ( 2 ) cant but that does n't  stop her wanting to do it and it becomes a safety and princesswhingealot nightmare . <p> On the flipside , the older child can " entertain " the younger , but it still is n't enough for me to consider SE Asia travel at the moment ! Kx <p> Yes ! The extra child can cause its own challenges ! Kalyra and Savannah generally get on okay , and Kalyra is good every now and then with playing with her , but they can fight . For example this morning , Savannah whacked Kalyra in the face with her plastic plate . Before I spoke to Savannah , I had to remind Kalyra about how she had learned behaviour like this , like the pinches she likes to deliver sometimes ! ! <p> A year long trip with toddlers ? No , no , and hell no ! Ive been there done that and waiting on them to get a little older is a must for me . Sure , each child is different but there 's no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you have to consider each child but also what the parents are willing to put up with . I think for a lot of people , the stress of it is way too much to bear , therefore its better to wait until they are older . If you had just one child too , I think it would be easier . <p> Sorry Kaz but we had a totally different experience . We backpacked around the world for a year with Raya when she was a toddler and she was a fantastic traveller . It did however take a little while to get our heads around the difference to travelling with a child of this age . We never took a stroller either Just a carrier and thankfully she would fall asleep just about anywhere . Perhaps it is the temperament more than the childs age . I know this is a great time to travel with kids before they start costing MUCH more on plane <p> FAbulous Michelle ! ! Thank you for sharing . I think it is great for the readers to hear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Savannah is a little wilder than Kalyra so that could have been the result of a lot of our hair pulling . And you are right with the cost of the flights , it is much better to travel with a toddler before 2 to grab these bargains . <p> I wonder if the difference is that you were traveling with just one child . One toddler is a world of difference different than two children . When it was just my husband , my daughter and I we were able to take totally different types of trips than we can now with my son who is 3 years younger . A backpacking adveture type trip with one toddler maybe , depending on the child . Two kids including a toddler , probably much harder for most people ! <p> Depends on the personality of the toddler . We only went to the other side of Florida for 4 days , and he s driving is nuts . Weve taken him on trips like this before , and he s been better , but this is the worst . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he s 2 years and 4 months . I enjoyed your post , because he also projectile vomited all over the car on the way here ! Ugh , I miss real travel ! <p> My kids are 19months and 3years . I 'm dreading the flight , but hoping that the rest will be ok . I was thinking of just taking the Ergo and not bothering with the pram , I know its a place to sleep but then its a faff to get about . Thankfully when we go to Thailand in a couple of months were staying in a villa they can shop for us and send in a chef . I 'm optimistic ! there will be 4 adults and 4 kids so were planning a child care rota so that we all get some down time ! <p> The child care rota sounds perfect ! We were talking about next trip travelling with friends/family who have kidsmakes it so much more enjoyable for everyone . <p> The pram is a big decision . You could definitely leave it . We found it did come in handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of times we had room in the van to put her inside , in the pram , which was soooo helpful ! <p> Totally agree ! We went to Singapore with our almost 2 year old last year and he ended up with bronchitis ! We had to cancel a couple of things and just felt awful carrying him round everywhere in such humid weather when he was so sick with high temps ! We are going on a carnival cruise in a few weeks and hope this will be an easier way to travel ! Kids club from age 2 = <p> Oh no ! There 's nothing worse than your child getting sick , you feel so helpless and of course guilty ! That normal parent emotion . You will love the Carnival Cruise ! ! The Kids Club is awesome and there is so much to entertain the kids . <p> My boys are 9 and 6 now but we 've been traveling with them from the time they were a few months old and I could n't agree with you more . The 12-36 month age was THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about long or short trips with them now but part of me wonders if those early experiences , as difficult as they were provided training of some sort for these later years . <p> I could imagine they would Amanda . With Kalyra , I do n't  think we travelled much between the ages of 10- 18 months , so we missed the real hideous part . She is definitely an amazing traveller now . Although , Savannah is a little wilder so it does depend on their temperament too <p> You pretty much summed up our traveling life with our little guy ! He and Savannah must be very close in agehe officially turned 18 months today , and we have also altered our travel schedule due to his needs &amp; stage of development . We had plans of visiting Nicaragua last month &amp; actually canceled the trip , which so not like us ! We 've vowed to take road trips closer to home , and only non-stop flights while we get over this toddler hurdle . And we 've really realized the value of taking things slow . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cant entertain themselves , they also have ZERO attention span ( or at least our little guy does ) . Like you said , you are constantly working ! <p> I agree on the apartment stays option . Staying put and drastically changing your expectations is the key to having a good trip with kids . Weve been on a couple of month-long trips to the US with our kids and staying in home rentals worked out very nicely . <p> Rushing anything will not work with our kids , so just adapting to very slow travel is key . <p> I still think its a very worthwhile age to travel with kids though . Its the highlight of their lives so far and they are constantly still talking about experiences that we 've had . The extra stimulation and entirely foreign experiences also play an important part in early age brain development , so I like to think its actually good for them as well = <p> I think it is always good for them Peter , just sometimes a little more stressful for the parents = I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are far too little to join the Amazing Race . <p> Thankfully we 've been quite lucky with our travel , but weve never really taken abby anywhere after about 9 months .. they 're both coming with us to new zealand ( theyll be two and six months ) but its a driving holiday and they 're both pretty good in the car . Were planning a disneyland trip , but not until pepper is at least three ( maybe even four so she enjoys it a bit more ! ) and it wigs me out that travel will be restricted for the next two and a half years . But I 'd rather travel and enjoy it than travel and be stressed ! <p> Totally agree ! There is no point spending all that time and money to just be stressed and want to go home . Your driving holiday will be awesome . I think road trips are definitely the way to go . We are holding off on the Disneyland trip too for awhile . Savannah would run muck ! ! <p> Let me just chime in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking notes , taking and editing photos , shooting and editing videos , and updating all the social media channels and dealing with emails and tech stuff does add a hell of a lot of stress and focus away from " just having a family holiday " . <p> Without all these commitments I 'm sure our experience would be much less stressful = <p> This is an interesting topic because while I do n't  like flying and therefore havent travelled o/s with my kids , we have taken them on a 10 week road trip through parts of SA and WA . They were then 7 and 10 ( boys ) and obviously this is much easier but if we wanted to go longer , we 'd need to think about educating our own kids ( gasp ! ! ) Yet at that age , they will at least have some memories of the trip . <p> I could n't have done it any earlier . Toddler ville is a tough age and I would n't have been tough enough to manage it . <p> 7 and 10 are perfect ages to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not too challenging for the parents . They would get so much learning from their experiences that school stuff would n't be all that necessary ! ! <p> I will home school the girls if needed but I can already see some of the clashes we would have . My two girls are probably more head strong than me ! ! Poor Craig <p> Whilst we do n't  have kids ourselves , we admire everyone we see travelling with their children . We think its such an important thing to allow them to experience such different cultures to those in the western world , and I 'm sure theyll grow into more rounded individuals . Although saying that I 'm sure it can be challenging at times , especially in countries like India and those in SE Asia the food is so different , and we noted whilst travelling through India that its hard to find food without any spice in it . Keep at it though I 'm sure your kids will feel so privileged that they had the chance to travel when they were younger ! <p> I think travelling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into insanity . <p> Craig and I talk about it all the time , and it is definitely off our bucket list for many years . We have n't even attempted it ourselves yet ! ! I do like spicy foods though , but after 15 years of backpacking and hassle I do n't  think I have the stamina for India anymore . <p> I can totally relate . My kids are insane together now , and we never know what is going to happen when we take the younger one ( he just turned 2 ) out . He does n't  eat anything that has texture , spits out food and throws things on the floor , wont sit in the stroller most of the time , and yells and hits when he does n't  get his way . Our older one was never like this , but the way it is now , we wont be taking the kind of trips we had hoped until things calm down . We did a big trip to Brazil last year and some smaller ones in California , and they all went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling with a toddler is exhausting . <p> Yup , travelling with a toddler is n't easy and strollers are usually useful only in airports and malls . Even then , its a challenge moving with a stroller when there are ONLY escalators . So I always bring a sling with me the now defunct Hotslings and a couple of other brands . People in Asia love kids and are especially attracted to Caucasian kids which can be a blessing and a pain because theyd be giving your kid foods you normally would n't feed them . The positive side : Youll lose a lot of weight running after your toddler = <p> Hi , I blog hopped from ProBlogger . Were an expat family living in Dubai and have two kids 9 year old girl and a toddler , now 16 months . We will be traveling to Japan ( where we previously lived ) in July when the toddler ( a BOY , no less ! ! ) is 1 year and 9 months . I see horror ahead of me ! <p> I try to keep a positive outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be really exhausted before vacation actually begins ! ! <p> Thanks for following us over from Problogger . I think you have to focus on the positive otherwise your expectations might bring about things that otherwise may not have happened . But definitely be prepared = By July he should be settled into his legs a little more . <p> Living in Dubai must be an awesome experience . Craig is going there at the end of March for a couple of days . I am jealous ! <p> Oh I could kiss you both ! We had some of the most hideous experiences of our lives with toddlers . My eldest totally floored us when we lived in Pakistan and tried to travel anywhere . He was very hyper and turned out to have real special needs ( ASD ) but talk about a confidence destroyer . <p> Another low was taking 17 month old very active twins to Fiji to a resort ! ! No holiday for us , could n't believe it . We came back to Oz and decided to buy a beach house , relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only problem is taking four teens/twins anywhere is bloody expensive ! <p> Ha Ha the beach house sounds way up my alley ! ! So craving that lately . Wow you have had some experiences .. living in Pakistan and travelling with twins . And you are still perfectly sane ? = Craig and I have stopped at two kids because we know how expensive travel will get = Best way to travel still then is to explore your own backyard . We have loved doing this this past year . I still feel like I 'm travelling , yet its cheaper and easier . <p> Fortunately , our toddler years are far behind us ( my girls are 16 and 9 ) but I do remember the difficulties that you have listed . The good news is that the toddler years pass in the blink of an eye . The bad news is that traveling with a teenage girl may make you wish you had toddlers again ! = <p> Overalltoddlers are n't  terrible to travel with . Toddlers are just wonderfully " terrible " in general , do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or traveling abroada toddler simply requires more energy and resources than a 5 or 7 year old ! Staying at home wont solve that problem . But the stresses of fast travel accelerate the frustration if you do n't  lower your expectations . Weve slowed down dramaticallynot to mention we 've also upped our previous budget standardsas accommodations and conveniences are a must when traveling comfortably with kids ! We have 3 ( 7 years , 5 years , and a very active 2 1/2 year old boy ) . <p> I love your recent post about the reality of traveling and how your travel style has changed with children and a business ( right there with you ! ) . Were getting more tired , too . Kids and a biz and traveling is like a giant balancing act . In generalI think our expectations just have to change , and its hard not to compare pre-biz/pre-kids traveling with post-kids traveling . They 're just simply different ! <p> Brilliant comment ! Judging by my day with the kids today , terrible toddler years are not restricted to travel ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage a business on top . I think coming to terms with travel being so different to what you were used to as well is completely mind bending . <p> Caz , I was also thinking about how difficult it is to get things done in a hotel room . If we are all in the same room then we have a REALLY hard time getting work for the biz done ( which would often be done at night while kids are sleepingbut how do you do that when they 're in the room TRYING to sleep ? ! ) . 2 rooms is a lifesaver ( which means house rentals and longer stays ) , and many more " slow " days where we do almost nothing ( except work online and let the kids run and around and be kids ) ! <p> Oh for sure . Apartment and home stays rock ! ! I think they are essential for any nomadic family who have a digital business . I love the space to work and for the kids to play . I think the kids really need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping on the keyboard just unsettles them . I like to get up early and work , but it rarely happens if we are in a hotel room , they inevitably arise with me . <p> Our trick to make travelling with kids more bearable : audiobooks , and lots of them . Theres lot of great sites to download them . We just got a couple for free at this one , if anyone is interested . LONG ... <p> We took our little one to India as baby for a month and we stayed put in one location he was 13months old the hardest everno sleep all routines out I do think that if you were to travel and work at the same time with very young children it would be very challenging . We spent nearly 5 months in Europe with a 5 year old and 8 year old and ironically the youngest coped much better we used a mix of hotels and family visits The easiest times where when we were with other families and children around kept the pressure off mum and dad to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champs and wish I appreciated it more at the time.but ultimately it is what works best for each family that makes for great travel <p> We are always talking about how we 'd love to travel with other families so the kiddies can all play and the parents can relax more . Its hard work entertaining all the time . India with a baby I would imagine as being awful . <p> Hi to you both . I discovered you on Pinterest . My husband to had a read of your blogs and he came across this one , and could n't believe how spot on it was for us . We 've only done a couple of Australian flights with our 8yr old and toddler ( then 18mths old ) and they were exhausting ! We could relate to the balcony issue , but opted out of the boat trip out on the reef . Our youngest is also much wilder than our first , who was no problem at 3.5yrs old on a trip to Thailand . Thank you for your honesty , it made us feel " normal " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really is to have children who are a challenge . I find myself often staring at other parents in public who are having difficulty with their children , not to judge , but to witness that it is totally normal and they sound like me . Too often we feel alone in this job , but really we are n't  . <p> I always try to give them an encouraging and understanding smile too . <p> I swear if Savannah was our first we may have stopped ! ! Shes adorable but so full on <p> This was good news and bad news for me . Bad news is , my kid just turned one and he has definitely gotten much harder to handle . He used to be able to actually sit still . Good news , if this is the hardest age for travel , I think I can hack it . He s just a little explorer too . I 'm a bit scared now to try to fly to all the Pacific islands though . I cant imagine trying to keep him still for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said you can handle it . It will be a challenge , but you 'll get through it . The good thing about the Pacific Islands is that once you get there the locals will dote all over Ryder and so you 'll have plenty of helping hands and on the plane there 's plenty of time to walk laps of the plane ! ! Wear him out so he crashes . Consider an evening flight if you can and if he is a good sleeper . It was so awesome to get the night flight home from Bangkok as Savannah slept pretty much the whole way home . It was so much easier . <p> I agree ! Traveling with a toddler is like supervising an educational trip of 45 first graders . I can totally relate . even right now , going to the grocery or dining out with my toddler is a nightmare . Nevertheless , I just focus on the brighter side , that is , my kiddo often hugs and kisses me in public , proudly shouting to the whole world how he loves me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens . So , just enjoy every moment of sweetness = <p> I actually have loved travelling with our toddlers , although I have n't had experience with any other age so perhaps that is the secret ? Start with toddlers so you do n't  realise it could be better to just wait ? ! We spent 7 weeks travelling around Asia last year with a 1 and 2 year old and loved it , and 10 weeks over Christmas in the US and Caribbean . <p> I find needing a nap the most annoying thing as it does rules out some activities we want to do as we have never had much success with getting them to sleep in the pram ( when we take one , we try to stick to a carrier ) . The amount of stuff that babies and toddlers require is definitely number 2 . I am very much looking forward to our next trip to Asia which will just be me and our oldest who will then be 4 . We are just going to carry on luggage which will be a nice change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children at home when your child is not more then 5 years . But i think if we should plan and try some attention for children , then might be possible your tour will be successful and you can enjoy with them . <p> Hi , I came across this post while searching for experience on traveling with younger babies . I thinking about taking my 8 months old baby to South East Asia for 1 week ( family visit ) and i cant decide or figure out if thatd be too much . Would you have any thought on that ? How did your younger child do on the trip ? Thanks much ! <p> I see this is an old blog post so you might not get this message , but I wanted to share that we just got back from a two week trip to Germany from Vancouver Island Canada , with our daughter , who is a month shy of three , and it was so stressful . I would never do it again , though there were some fun moments . Her naps were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is still adjusting from jet lag . I was nodding my head to most of your post . Have you found it much easier now ? I would like to travel again as I love it , but I do n't  know when or if we will ever be able to travel with her again ! My husband does n't  ever want to fly with her again . <p> I think short and slow are keywords . Lazy travels to nearby towns or the beach are better . I trained my kids to sleep on the stroller so I kept it nearby and used it for naps . Going by car and stopping to have lunches or walks . I also trained them to use lidded cups and kept two or three at hand and washed them in the sink at the hotel . To sleep we make them little " caves " below tables or chairs and with a lot of pillows , they like to be cuddled , of course it is best if the hotel has a crib . Actually I had a lot more trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , the wind and were baddly bitten by mosquitoes and sunburnt even when we applied sunblock liberally . Also I breastfed them and here in Mexico it is not considered good manners so I had to hide a lot . What I did n't  like about my kid around 3 was the potty training . Traveling with a potty and dirty clothes , having to clean hotel floors , its not fun . When my daughter is 3 I am waiting until she is properly trained and not the middle of it . <p> I 'm not sure about that.We traveled 6000kms in Thailand with a 1 month year old . Went even off the beaten track .. Found it easy . Just rented a Hilux and off we went . Cost for 4weeks less than $1000 including rent of Hilux .. <p> I envy you . Only am hour flight from UK to Spain . Suncream , water , swimming pool and **31;121;TOOLONG toddler . She is only 15 months . We decided our holidays will strict only to see family in the US and Brazil <p> Brilliat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip abroad with my hubby and baby ( she will turn 2 yr in Aug17 ) . We will be travelling from India for around 7-8 days in any month between April-Jun . We are not able to finalize location that can be South Africa or New Zealand or an european country . Can you suggest me what option shall be the best ( comfortable as well as affordable ) . Thanks <p> haha , I agree with you . Weve been planning to head out for quite some time now . Just got the financials all set up and are now starting a business elsewhere to be able to do the nomadic life without staying connected with our original country . ( tax is 50%+ and we do not intend to go back so that felt like a dealbreaker ) . Our youngest is 3 years old and I he s still acting like that Duracell battery bunny who can go , go , go and never stop = Its going to be fun but probably a lot to bite into . <p> Thanks so much for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip when my mom turns 60 in three years time and my daughter will be 4 . So I decided to check out what people have to say personal experiences help me have a solid frame of reference when making an informed decision <p> We took the girls to Thailand earlier this year and I found it too stressful with a toddler . She just wanted to practice using her new found legs , which was a night mare to control on their transport as there are no seat belts let alone baby seats . I was also sick at the time , as was our baby , and because we were working while on the trip , it was just a little too much even for my usual laid-back self . Places like this are much better once the toddler stage is over ( discussed in my post The worst age to travel with kids ) .

Sydney can be an expensive city to live in but its good to see so many options for travellers .. Bondi to Coogee is my favourite but I also love Manly to Spit Bridge walk ! ! <p> The weather all round is pretty good , but there is nothing like Sydney in summer <p> I grew up in Sydney and hold on to some great memories of the city when the old style ferrys cruised the harbour , lunar park " just for fun " , the bridge , the opera house being built , when the amp building was the tallest in the city ( 25 stories high ) . Hanging out at Bronte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast through waverly cemetary . Walking the cliff tops when the seas were huge and bodysurfing Tamma point . A beautiful city for sure . <p> Hi Craig &amp; Caz , I was in Sydney last weekend and undertook a lot of these free activities . We also went to Icebergs Ocean Pool at Bondi and had coffee from the pool deck and watched swimmers in the pool and the waves pumping into Bondi Beach . Afterwards we caught the $2.50 Sunday bus over to Watsons Bay and got take-away fish and chips and sat in the park . Then we walked through The Gap National Park up to a lookout which has spectacular views of Sydney Head , the entrance to Sydney Harbour . I love Sydney for a short break there is so much to do and see . <p> Sydney is one of my favourite cities in the whole world . There 's always something new to do here even if you 've stayed here all your life .

Loved the city and so much to see and do . We enjoyed walking everywhere , especially hopping over to Manly for the day .

I mean , it the happiest place on earth after all . <p> So for our upcoming USA road trip- across all 50 states , I 've been doing some research on Anaheim to find out what are the best hotels near Disneyland . <p> Its been no easy task. - <p> There are so many hotels in Anaheim to choose from and things to consider when visiting Disneyland , and I figured if I was having trouble deciding on what are the best hotels near Disneyland to stay in , maybe you are too ? <p> So if you 're also planning your dream Disneyland vacation , keep reading , and I hope you find this a useful resource for booking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've created a- short list of properties to save you some time doing your own research , and hopefully some money too . <h> Tips from my Disneyland accommodation research <h> Parking is expensive ! <p> If you have your own car , or fly into LAX and book a rental car , on average you 're looking at $15 per day to park your car at most Anaheim hotels on top of your accommodation costs . That adds up and is something to factor into your budget . <h> Consider the ART shuttle <p> This shuttle connects you to the theme parks , hotels , restaurants , and shopping within the Anaheim area. - Service typically begins at 7 AM and continues through midnight . <p> Hot Tip my sister visited Disneyland earlier this year and said it might be quicker and easier for you to jump on the ART shuttle at a nearby hotel or at a stop on the other side of the street from where you are staying as the shuttle does a kind of loop . <p> Image via : RideART.org <h> Walk to Disneyland <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Disneyland could be to walk . I 've also been told that by the time you wait for the shuttle , and the time it takes the shuttle to stop off at each hotel and pick up point , you could have walked there by then . Which leads me to my next point . <h> Think location <p> There is no point choosing your accommodation in Anaheim if it is miles away from Disneyland and you have to pay extra in transportation costs and waste valuable time . <p> If possible , you want to stay within walking distance to Disneyland , in a property on or near S Harbor Blvd . <p> For those of you that have young kids , you do n't  want to be walking too far before you even enter the gates of Disneyland , the day is long enough as it is , and being able to retreat back to your hotel for a rest during the day or a swim in your hotel pool to freshen up is desirable for many . <h> You do n't  have to stay at a Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anaheim accommodation situation for Disneyland California is different to that of Disney World in Florida . <p> In Orlando , - it seems a big reason for staying onsite at Disney World is for the close proximity to the parks . The non-Disney hotels are n't  as practical location wise . <p> In Anaheim , many of the non-Disney hotels along S Harbor Blvd are within a 5-20 minute walk to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure . <h> Disney accommodation costs vary significantly <p> Depending on the time of year you visit Disneyland , the size of your traveling party , and the status of your hotel , the price of hotels in Anaheim can vary greatly especially during major holidays and school vacation periods . <h> 3 Star Hotels near Disneyland <p> Click on each photo or link to read a longer description of the property and book your stay . <p> To be clear , we are affiliates of Booking.com , which means we receive a small commission if you book through the links on our site .

@@21820466 @1820466/ <h> 5 Extraordinary Places to Visit in Namibia <p> In case you missed our introductory blog post , were Cameron and Natasha and were currently driving across the African continent in our Land Cruiser . <p> As we travel through Africa were going to be writing here on yTravel highlighting destinations across the continent as part of our HashtagAfrica campaign . <p> We spent this past month driving all around Namibia visiting just about every sight to see . Namibia can leave you speechless with its sheer beauty and although photos of Namibia are incredible , it is hard to do these places justice through the lens . <p> However , there are a few locations that stand out the most , and these are the five best places to visit in Namibia . <h> 5 places to visit in Namibia <h> 1 . Sossusvlei <p> Sossusvlei is the one place in Namibia everyone has likely seen a photo of . The name " Sossusvlei " refers to a salt and clay pan that is surrounded by some of the tallest sand dunes on the planet . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sheer size of the dunes and desert here one can still find complete solitude . The dunes tower over visitors at 325m tall and seem to shift around slightly as high winds lead to a constantly changing landscape . <p> One must wake up way before the crack of dawn and catch the dunes at sunrise as the whole park takes on a unworldly feel . <h> 2 . Etosha National Park <p> Etosha National Park is arguably one of the best national parks in Africa for spotting wildlife . The real draw of the park is not in its animal density or natural beauty , but instead the game-viewing venue . <p> A massive salt pan dominates the Etosha landscape with a number of watering holes dotting the southern edge . <p> Simply sit at one of these watering holes and watch the Namibia wildlife come from kilometres away to have a much-needed drink as they try to escape the Namibian heat . <p> Over the course of just one afternoon , we saw lions , hyena , jackals , vultures , zebra , wildebeest , giraffes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having to even move . <h> 3 . Fish River Canyon <p> Fish River Canyon by some accounts is the second largest canyon on earth . The size of the canyon is awe-inspiring and a stop that beckons many when they travel to Namibia . <p> It is a place that is difficult to convey or conceive in photos . The adventurous can descend down the 550m to the canyon floor , but that hiking option is only available a few months out of the year due to heat and flash flooding . <p> The hike takes roughly five days and covers 88km of the canyon floor . Our tip for visiting the canyon is to get there in the evening with some cold Windhoeks , the local beer , in hand and watch the sunset . You can learn more about the park here . <h> 4 . Kalahari <p> A sunset in the Kalahari Desert is one to behold . The vast expanse of deep red sand stretches across all of Southern Africa and occupies 1.2 **25;154;TOOLONG . <p> Despite its desert environment there are many animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Lions , gemsbok , meerkats , zebra , and cheetah can all be found here . <p> The Kalahari is a land of contrasts as the deep red sand draw out the thorn bushes and acacia trees that dot the horizon . <h> 5 . Skeleton Coast <p> The coast of Namibia was once referred to by the Portuguese as " As Areias do Inferno , " or the sands of hell . It is little wonder where the phrase originated from when traveling the Skeleton Coast of Namibia . <p> This part of Namibia is one of the least hospitable places on earth . On the coast , the colossal sand dunes of the Namib Desert meet the Atlantic in violent fashion . <p> Strong winds and heavy fog create a treacherous coast that has shipwrecked many seamen leaving them to an almost certain death . Still , marine life along the coast flourishes and a massive colony of seals call the Cape Cross Seal Colony home . <h> Need more tips on what to see in Namibia ? <p> This only touches on a few places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the least sparsely populated in the world . <p> Most tourists , including us , self-drive through the country as the roads are smooth gravel and offer interesting sights along the way . <h> About Natasha Alden <p> Natasha is a five-foot blonde that believes she was made short so she could fit in air , train , car , and bus seats comfortably while traveling . She lives out of her backpack and documents her travels on The World Pursuit , along with her partner , Cameron . She has traveled to over 50 countries across 6 continents .

@@21820467 @1820467/ <h> 12 things to do on Fraser Island <p> Discovering all the incredible- things to do on Fraser Island will live long in my memory from our big 18-month lap around Australia . <p> Whilst Fraser Island is well known as one of the best places in the country for hard-core four-wheel driving enthusiasts , it offers so much more , for kids , for families , for everyone . <p> This is east coast Australia at its best , going off-road and creating your own tracks , or following those created by nature . The ever changing landscape of an island made of sand means no day is the same , and no return visit will be the same either . <p> If you 're planning your first visit to Fraser Island , below are our highlights that I encourage you to create time for in your itinerary . We did n't  get to see it all , but this list will give you more than enough inspiration and tips on things to do on Fraser Island to make your visit a reality . <p> Quick Fraser Island facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km wide and is the largest sand island in the world , dumped over 800,000 years ago from places as far as Antarctica when it was still joined with Australia . <p> Fraser is a World Heritage Site that 's constantly moving and evolving and is the only place in the world where tall rainforests are found growing on sand dunes at elevations of over 200 metres . And then there are the 1,000+ freshwater lakes . <h> 1 . Sunrise at Eurong Beach <p> One of the benefits of staying at Eurong Beach Resort on the east coast of the island is that you 're only steps away from 75 Mile Beach and witnessing the sunrise of a morning is a spectacular way to start your day on Fraser ! <h> 2 . Drive 75 Mile Beach <p> 75 Mile Beach is- Fraser 's National Highway , - the main long stretch of beach on the eastern side of Fraser Island and- is classed as part of the Bruce Highway . <p> This is coastal four-wheel-driving at its best , and the first time we had experienced hard core 4+4 action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean is wild and pounding , the beach landscape ever changing from the tides , there 's camping , beach fishing , and its along this stretch of sand where you gain access to many of the best things to do on Fraser Island listed below . <p> When driving 75 Mile Beach its important you understand how the tides work so you do n't get cut off and cant make it back to your accommodation . Low tide is best , you want to drive it when it 's flat and hard , - and avoid driving during the two hours either side of high tide . Check the current conditions report here . <p> And make sure you 're paying attention to the steady stream of other 4WD 's , the washouts , wild roaming dingos , the ambling tourists and beach fishermen , and the joy flights taking off on the beach . <p> Because its classed as a highway , - strict road rules apply and there are police present ready to nab those who speed or drink drive . <p> And if you can time your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humpbacks breaching and playing- Another incredible experience of our drive was spotting migrating whales breaching a few hundred metres off the beach . <h> 3 . Eli Creek <p> Eli Creek is one of the most popular stops along 75 Mile Beach , especially busy when all the tour buses congregate- so try and avoid that if possible . <p> The creek has water so clear you only know its there when a leaf floats past you . It 's water that 's been filtered by the sand for up to 100 years " such purity ! <p> Eli Creek is famous for wading , tubing , or swimming through and pumps nearly 3.5 million litres of fresh water in the ocean every hour. - There is no place on Fraser quite like it . <h> 4 . Maheno Shipwreck <p> Another spot along 75 Mile Beach that is one of the most photographed and visited sites is the Maheno Shipwreck . <p> The Maheno is a former Trans-Tasman luxury liner and a World War 1 hospital ship that was washed ashore in 1935 whilst being towed to Japan a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on Fraser . <p> Sunrises are meant to be picture perfect here with the Maheno as the foreground , as long as the tides are favourable for gaining access . Either way , the Maheno- is a postcard moment at any time of the day ! <h> 5 . The Pinnacles coloured rocks <p> As you drive along the east coast Fraser 's sand will continue to amaze as you come alongside The Pinnacles , a small section of coloured sandy cliffs along the Surf Beach ( I ca n't believe they 're made from sand ! ) , just north of the Maheno . <p> You do n't  need much time at The Pinnacles but its worth getting out of your car and taking a short walk inland for a closer look . <h> 6 . Indian Head <p> Indian Head one of the best things to do on Fraser Island <p> Indian Head is a coastal headland on the eastern side of Fraser Island that you 'll get to when heading north on 75 Mile Beach , and is the most easterly point on the island . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Fraser Island , and this area- was named by Captain James Cook who , whilst sailing his ship the- Endeavour , spotted a group of Aboriginals standing on the headland . <p> It offers panoramic views over the beach and ocean , and is a prime whale watching spot we saw a few humpbacks migrating past , just magical ! <p> Humpback whale migrating past Indian Head <h> 7 . Champagne Pools <p> Just north of Indian Head is possibly the most popular swimming spot on Fraser , and for good reason , especially on a sunny day ! Our kids , and us big kids enjoyed a low tide dip in the clear , bubbling sea water of Champagne Pools , which is aptly named . <p> The view from the top as you walk down the staircase is breathtaking and you 'll want to allocate enough time to make the most of this natural swimming spot , keeping in mind the tides for driving back down 75 Mile Beach . <h> 8 . Lake Mackenzie <p> In the middle of Fraser Island is spectacular- Lake Mackenzie , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to youth . <p> The temperature of the lake was quite cool when we visited , but certainly refreshing after a long day of driving and my feet sure liked it I could see them easily enough , not a murky streak to be found . <p> The crystal clear water glows iridescent blue and the white silica sand so powdery soft and provides a great contrast against the lake edge . <p> And the famous heart-shaped-tree adds to the already pretty landscape . <p> Stay awhile . <h> 9 . Drive from east to west through- sub-tropical rainforest <p> Our drive from Eurong Beach to Kingfisher Bay along the sandy tracks and through the sub-tropical rainforest was equally as spectacular . Its hard to imagine that this whole island is made of sand- and that you get these incredible trees growing to great heights . <p> If you have enough time , stop in for a picnic at Central Station and stroll the boardwalk next to Wanggoolba Creek , which carries clear water through tranquil rainforest- filled with ancient ferns- at Central Station once a forestry township @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dingos <p> There are wild dingos on Fraser Island , - and they are tamer than they should be thanks to the poor choices of humans , and if you have small children like us never leave their side , not for a second , as they have been known to attack and are very cunning . <p> You 're bound to have dingos coming pretty close to you on the beaches , particularly near Eli Creek , sniffing for food . And despite signs warning of the danger all over the island , we saw tourists moving close to them to get their shot of the cute wild dogs . <p> We kept our distance and I relied on my 300mm zoom lens to get these close-up photos . <h> 11 . Take a joy flight <p> A definite highlight of our visit and one of the more unique things to do on Fraser Island is experiencing a joy flight with Air Fraser Island- which take off from natures best runway along 75 Mile Beach . <p> Youll be afforded incredible views up and down the coast , fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spot- migrating whales in season . <p> Air Fraser run 15-minute joy flights all day long- from $75 p/p. <h> 12 . Sunset at Kingfisher Bay <p> If you 're staying at Kingfisher Bay Resort on the west coast , do n't  miss having a few sundowners at the- unassuming Jetty Hut " bottles of champagne and platters of prawns , cheese and crackers are also on offer . <p> Check out what the adventures look like on our YouTube video . Click play and do n't  forget to subscribe to our channel ! <h> Getting to Fraser Island <p> Fraser Island Barges operate ferries and barges for- both vehicle and passengers- daily from River Heads , 20 minutes south of Hervey Bay , to Kingfisher Bay Resort and Wangoolba Creek on the west side of Fraser Island . <p> Manta Ray operates a barge from Inskip Point ( Rainbow Beach ) to Hook Point on the south of Fraser Island . <h> Fraser Island 4wd hire <p> Fraser Island is strictly four wheel drive territory as all roads on the island are sand tracks , and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-vehicle clearance . <p> You can take your own vehicle , we only had an all-wheel-drive , or you can hire a- reliable and fully maintained 4+4 from the friendly folks at Atlas 4wd hire. - <p> Theyll get you your- permit , give you helpful instructions on how to drive safely during your- driver safety briefing ( allow 1 hour ) and they- will even store your vehicle for the duration of your time on Fraser Island . <p> Generic Driving Distances : <p> These driving times are conservative and you should always drive to suit the current conditions : <p> Eurong Beach to Kingfisher Bay Resort " 22km ( approx 1hr ) <p> Eurong Beach to Eli Creek " 30km ( approx 40mins ) <p> Eurong Beach to Maheno Wreck " ( approx 45mins ) <p> Eurong Beach to The Pinnacles coloured sands " 35km ( approx 50mins ) <p> Eurong Beach to Indian Head " 60km ( approx 1hr 20mins ) <p> Eurong Beach to Champagne Pools " 63km ( approx 1hr 30mins ) <p> Eurong Beach to Central Station/Pile Valley " 8km ( approx 30mins ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45mins ) <h> Fraser Island Tours <p> Sunset Safaris offer a 2 day and 3-day tours- departing from the Gold Coast or Brisbane in their speciality designed 4wd buses and mini-coaches . <h> Fraser Island accommodation <p> East coast <p> view from Eurong Beach Resort <p> On the east coast , - Eurong Beach Resort is a great- base from which to explore all the things to do on Fraser Island listed above with its- absolute beachfront position on 75-Mile Beach , including the world class beach fishing . <p> The resort is also centrally located for visiting the southern- lakes , which include Lake McKenzie , Basin , Wabby , Jennings , Birrabeen and Boomanjin , - as well as the sub-tropical rainforests around Pile Valley , Central Station and- Wanggoolba Creek . <p> West coast <p> Kingfisher Bay Resort <p> How does a little bit of luxury sound amidst one of the most unique and pristine parts of Australia ? - Kingfisher Bay Resort is on the quieter western side of Fraser Island , right where the car ferry from River Head drops you off . <p> Kingfisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maheno Restaurant , or you can splurge at the a la carte Seabelle Restaurant . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> This looks fantastic . We are traveling to Tasmania next month on a self-drive tour . One thing that instantly came to my mind are are the 4x4s covered by insurance ? I ask because I was told that self-drives in Tasmania do not cover driving to Bruny Island that do not have proper roads . <p> I cant speak for hire cars in Tasmania , but Fraser Island is strictly 4+4 territory and the Atlas hire company is set up to hire 4wds for Fraser . I just looked at their Terms &amp; Conditions which say : " Our vehicles are insured . It is up to the customer to have personal effects cover with their own insurance " <p> Wow , I cant WAIT to visit Fraser Island now ! Particularly the Champagne Pools and 75 Mile Beach = and I have a bit of a soft spot for dingos ( but I 'll be sure to keep my distance ) . That sunrise looks absolutely phenomenal ! Ah , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't resist jotting down a few more things to check out . I do n't  think my partner will be too happy about the ever-growing length of my bucket list ( although I reckon the 4x4ing will get him on board ? ) Great post as always ! Hope all is well x <p> Driving along 75 Mile beach with the windows open and breathing in that fresh clean air with the sounds of the ocean , AND whales breaching off-shore is something I wo n't soon forget . Hope you make it to Fraser Liam ! <p> I do n't  know about travel companies going to Fraser from Sydney . And you ca n't fly direct to Fraser . Closest airport would be Hervey Bay , or flying into Brisbane or the Gold Coast . Once in Brisbane or the Goldy the guys from Sunset Safaris run 2 or 3 day tours : LONG ... <p> How did you find the self-drive part ? We will be there for a couple of nights in November and we opted to rent a 4+4 and my husband will be doing the driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile now so this is really exciting for us = <p> Wow is all I can say . What a great place to visit . Thank you for sharing all the pictures and the detailed review on the island . I would love to visit there some day . I live in Michigan in the US and it is about the farthest place on Earth from me but I will make it to Australia one day . <p> We are lucky enough to visit Fraser as we have access to a wonderful house at Happy Valley ( north of Eurong ) . For those who are first timers Fraser Island is big . Do n't  expect to do it all in a day or two . Be realistic when doing the walks too .

Over the week , they ate braised bean curd , all manner of dumplings and even steamed buns with taro , pumpkin and sweet potato . <p> Ms10 got a fright when she sucked up the tapioca pearls , I think I like bubble tea most out of the three of us . <h> Taiwanese Desserts <p> The Taiwanese have a passion for delicious desserts . We bravely and fearlessly tried many on our visit to Taiwan . Lots have fruit bases and the kids probably loved those best . <p> The Harry Potter style architecture of a historic dessert house Miyahara in the city of Taichung was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desserts and also eat in the restaurant . <p> But we popped over to the ice cream shop , housed in an old bank and we did not hold back . <h> Visit Taipei 101 <p> The iconic symbol of Taipei , and for a short time the tallest building in the world , Taipei 101 is well worth a visit . The fastest elevators in the world were a thrill . <p> We also learned a lot about physics and mechanics because of the detailed explanation of the damper . This HUGE ball of steel is suspended at the top of the tower and helps to hold Tapei 101 steady in high winds . <p> I have to say the views were great too . <p> NB Definitely get there early in the morning like we did , there were no queues at all . <h> Night Markets and Shopping in Taiwan <p> Night markets are a great attraction for visitors and each city in Taiwan has one or two . Iona is a dedicated shopper so she was thrilled to visit them , especially the Fengjia Night Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Myself and Dexter loved the Liu-He Night Market in Kaohsiung best , for its exotic shellfish , fruit and seafood and its laidback atmosphere. - See a video of this night market here . <p> If you love clothes shopping do n't miss the area called around Wufenpu near Songsang Station . The teenage girls in our group spent literally hours there and bought all sorts of new clothes at bargain prices . <h> Adrenaline " Theme Parks and Other Thrills in Taiwan <p> Each of Taiwan 's major cities has some cool theme parks and exciting entertainment for children and teenagers . Here 's our list with the most popular first : <p> Lotus Lake in Kaohsiung is most famous for its temples , but we bypassed them all and spend an afternoon learning to kneeboard and wakeboard instead . <p> Dexter had to try many times before he got up on his wake board and whizzed away . Iona also face planted often . What a great lesson in persistence . I liked it too and almost made it round the course a couple of times. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hot , tropical city . <p> This new development has the only Suzuka go-kart course outside Japan . You only race for eight minutes but even kitting up is a thrill . Iona was appalled not to be allowed to drive herself , Dexter was thrilled to race alone . <p> This theme park and water park complex is close to Taichung . The theme park has many rides , the Wild River Canyon was a hoot but the Gravity Max is unique : the rail tips up and goes vertical then the carriage free falls and then whizzes around . Terrifying ! Iona loved it , I was too scared to go on . <p> Close to Taipei , this is a large theme park with fun rides and a water park which is open in the summer . There 's also a zoo here where you can meet lemurs face to face and see many other animals . The zoo has areas which are in need of upgrade and expansion , but fortunately changes are happening . <p> In Taipei itself , Taipei Childrens Amuseument Park has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .

Theyre free . <h> Rainbow Village <p> Chiang Kai-shek , and two million of his followers , were defeated by the communists in mainland China , in 1946 and they escaped to Taiwan . <p> With such a massive influx of people , small and simple military dependent housing was built very fast . Over recent years many have been pulled down for new development . <p> One redoubtable elderly gentleman , Huang Yong Fu , - wanted to save his simple home and began painting it in bright murals . He was successful and still lives in there today. - His Rainbow Village has become a popular place to see and he greets visitors with great verve , his fiercely independent spirit still shines . <h> Dragon Eyes Community Farm , Kaohsiung <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained how his crops grow and are harvested . We picked pineapples ourselves and then met other members of the community and enjoyed a pineapple themed lunch . <p> This was so interesting for the kids and very hands on . There was also a bit of political insight as the farmers explained how farm land is often compulsorily purchased and sold to developers . <h> Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry , Taipei <p> We learned to make the famous Taiwanese pineapple cakes at this museum and we also learned the history of the cake shop , founded in 1867 . The museum explained the important role of cakes and sweets in Taiwanese culture , both in the past and present . <p> Iona loved dressing up in Chinese bridal clothes though we reckoned the girls looked more like ninjas than anything else . <h> Tea Making at Maokong <p> Visiting the hills around Taipei makes a terrific day trip . You take the gondola from right beside Taipei Zoo and swing high over the trees and far away to the tea plantations . <p> We learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked by hand in Maokong . The complex drying , fermenting and rolling process was explained and then we tried a type of tea called tiekuanyin . <p> A walk through the tea plantations and then a tea-themed lunch at the Dragon Inn was followed by the gentle gondola ride back to Taipei . Quite a magical , and certainly an educational , day out . <h> Hot Springs in Taiwan <p> Taiwan is famous for its many natural hot springs . We visited Beitou a renowned hot spring area which is within the Taipei metropolitan area . <p> But at first , we could n't work it out at all Beitou looked like any other suburb . In fact , you need to walk about half a kilometre to find where the hot springs steam forth from the ground . And the water really is very hot and can not be touched at all . <p> There are public hot spring baths but we did n't use these as most hotels pipe hot spring water into each room . So our room at the Hotel Royal had its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap . <p> There was also a pool on the top floor of the hotel , plus some single-sex nude hot spring tubs . Neither Iona nor Dexter was keen but I joined other ladies in the nude tubs joyfully . <p> My favourite part of Beitou was visiting the Hot Springs Museum , a very beautiful building made by the Japanese. - It 's such a beautiful piece of architecture and the information about the hot springs and the history of the area was very detailed and beautifully illustrated and explained . <p> I got to enjoy this museum in peace and at length as Dexter and Iona and the other kids had decided - to explore the local 7-Elevens and other shops. - - So we all enjoyed the local culture in our own way . <h> What 's On The List for Next Visit to Taiwan ? <h> Bike Trails in Taiwan <p> Biking is very popular with Taiwanese families and there are some excellent trains we 'd love to explore . <p> We 've heard good things about the Old Tsaoling Bike Trail which goes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulong , just an hour from Taipei . The Houfeng Bike Trail near Taichung comes highly recommended too . <h> Taipei Must-Dos Next Time <p> Dexter and Iona claimed not to be keen to visit the National Palace Museum with the best collection of imperial Chinese treasures in the world. - I 'd love to spend hours there myself though so that would suit me on another trip . <h> Cool and Kid-Friendly Hotels in Taiwan <p> Dexter and Iona both gasped with joy when they saw the huge slide in the foyer of the Red Dot Hotel on our first night in Taiwan . They then immediately belted up to the first floor to slide down it . <p> I 'd actually thought that at 16 and 10 they might feel they were too old and cool for a slide , but no such thing . <p> This child-friendly feature at a boutique art house hotel was a great introduction to the design style of Taiwan for us adults too . <p> Other hotels we can recommend ourselves are : <p> Leofoo Resort Guanshi is on the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theme park , water park and a zoo . There are zoo animals living right alongside the hotel rooms . So expect to see rhinos and giraffes and all sorts of other animals from your room . <p> Grand Hi Lai Hotel - in Kaosiung has a terrific swimming pool which both my kids loved , it has wonderful views over the city and beyond . This five star hotel shares a block with a huge department store which was also popular . <p> Home Hotel Da'an is very centrally located in Taipei , near Taipei 101 and many other attractions . It has a very eclectic design style , a great example of the new boutique hotels now popular in Taiwan . <p> Hotel Royal Beitou Hot Spring Resort is very close to the Beitou station and is a luxurious five-star hotel . Each luxurious room has piped-in mineral-rich hot water so you relax in the hot tub in your own room . There are also larger hot spring pools in the hotel , plus it 's close to the Thermal Valley , Hot Springs Museum and Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in Beitou is called Villa 32 , though it may be more adult-orientated . <h> Tours of Taiwan <p> My ideal would be to start with a three-four day tour with an expert guide and then to have one or two weeks to travel by ourselves . <h> Taiwan " Take Me Back ! <p> There are heaps to see and do in this rather tiny jewel of an island , so many areas of natural beauty and a rich and complex history of colonisation by both the Japanese and Chinese . This has led to a very individual and independent spirit in the Taiwanese , and a unique culture of their own . <p> Taiwan is also one of the safest countries in the world for tourists , so that 's another plus for family travellers , as is the deliciousness of the desserts and ice cream ! <h> Pin to share to Pinterest : <p> Seana , Dexter and Iona travelled to Taiwan on this occasion as guests of Taiwan Tourism . <p> Love this post . Taiwan has so much to offer families and solo travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still have close friends there . We went back with the kids for a few months recently to show them the place we love so much . The place just gets better and better . Its shocking how little organised tourism there is for Westerners there . I 'm sure this will change . <p> On your next visit to Taipei , I 'd highly recommend a visit to Jiufen , the town whose teahouse street inspired Hayao Miyazakis anime movie " Spirited Away . " It not far out of town and is one of my favorite places in northern Taiwan . <p> As for Taipeis night markets , the major ones are all pretty good , but for families , I think Rao He is best because its just one long street ( harder to get lost ) and right next to the river , so you can step out of the crowds fairly easy . Great variety of stalls , as well . <p> But much of what I love best about Taiwan is out of Taipei . Tainan ( the old capitalkind of like Taiwans Kyoto ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains of Taiwan are exceptional places for hiking , canyoning , and birding . The east coast of the island is stunningly beautiful and surprisingly empty ( just do n't  go in the typhoon season ! ) . And of course , Taiwans many aboriginal tribes are vibrant , active , friendly and fascinating to learn about . One of the easiest places to get a primer is the aboriginal museum in Taipei or the center near Sun Moon Lake .

I have been to Melbourne a few times and are ashamed to say I have never seen this lane or heard of it before now . Heading there later in the year so thanks to you guys I will be checking it out ! <p> Ah this brings back memories of when I wrote about street art in Melbourne , in particular Hosier Lane . The art has certainly changed a lot in a year . I understand it can change every few weeks hence one of those spots you have to keep revisiting . <p> I first came across it on those I 'm Free Tours but like you say it is easy to find . I often stop off for a drink and snack on those side streets . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I 've only visited the lane a couple of times , but every time its been full of tourists and other people posing for photographs which makes it seem a whole lot less edgy and cool , as well as making it less relaxing way to view the art .

The Bilby is the most endangered . You can visit the Bilby Centre in Charleville to learn more and help support programmes to help them thrive again . <p> The cane toad is disgusting and can not be stopped with its mission to destroy our native flora and fauna .

Whenever I get a whiff of it in the bush , I feel like I 've returned home . <p> The gum tree is the lifeblood of our country and forms a huge part of our identity . The sight and smell of them defines Australian life and signifies home for me . I cant help but hug them on a regular basis . Eucalypt trees light themselves on fire , which helps the land regenerate . I love seeing a blackened gum tree covered in green , fluffy new growth . The most beautiful gum trees Ive seen are in the Barossa Valley . <p> Gum trees one of the things I love most about Australia <p> The sight of the blue haze from the eucalyptus oil arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the Blue Mountains their name . <p> More than 80 percent of Australians live within 100 kilometres of the coast . Beach life is important to us and surf lifeguards are revered . <p> Australia is a huge sporting nation and considering our low population , rocks it on a global scale . <p> Australia helped revolutionise wine making around the world because they did not have traditions to adhere to . Creativity allowed us to grow as one of the best wine producers in the world . There are 60 designated wine regions in Australia . Our favourites are Margaret River , Barossa Valley , and Mudgee . <p> Some of our cattle stations are bigger than European countries .

Longreach is the founding home of Qantas and Winton is the birth place of Waltzing Matilda just to name a few . I also think it has Australias friendliest people . <p> The School of the Air was created so that children on remote cattle stations could still learn and attend school , Distance education has sprung off from that which is how we educated Kalyra as we travelled around the country .

We raced Emus and dodged kangaroos who loved to jump out from anywhere . And the most beautiful and breathtaking was cycling in the sun rise with multi-coloured birds of all sizes flying and swooping along the road with us , sitting on our shoulders and panniers and hanging on for the ride . I will never forget the smell of dead python snakes that were so long and huge they did not make it across the other side of the road before being squashed by one of those huge road trains .

@@21820482 @1820482/ <h> 5 things to consider when living abroad <p> Young people are well renowned for globetrotting and settling in almost every crevice of our glorious planet . However , after they have found themselves on their spiritual quest , its back to their cosy living quarters- at home . <p> This is a far cry from uprooting your life and calling a new land home ; a feat many of us will never accomplish . Yes , we 'll parade around the nation finding work in other major cities but this still is n't comparable to leaving the country for an alien realm . <p> While living abroad remains a task only taken by the brave , that courageous bunch come in the thousands . <p> Thousands of immigrants come knocking at the doors of first world terrain every day , why would anyone flee from a land filled with opportunities ? <p> Many reasons . The cost of living , the excitement of the unknown , weather , and , most of all , the rewarding independence . <p> The intimidating liberation that comes with packing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never feel and something , some would argue , they 're missing out on . <p> As intense a sensation living abroad may be , there is n't always a pot of gold at the end of the intercontinental rainbow . No , there are many factors to consider before the transition can be made . Let 's look at a few . <h> 5 things to consider before living abroad <h> 1 . Language barriers <p> This obviously does n't apply to those who speak the tongue of their intended nation or those travelling to countries whose first language is the same as their own . <p> This applies to those moving to China , with no Mandarin or Cantonese experience , those moving to France , having no French in their arsenal you get the picture . <p> Living abroad with no knowledge of the national language will be near impossible , however , not completely impossible . Knowing just English will suffice for the bare necessities , but when it goes beyond that i.e. making relations or creating a career , it wo n't cut it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have shown that it is very possible , with the correct process , to learn a language in just three months , which is especially applicable if immersed in the culture . <h> 2 . Living Arrangements <p> Unless you 're feeling wildly spontaneous , you 're unlikely going to change countries without living arrangements completely sorted or at least an idea of the next steps . <p> Upon immigration to the UK , there are several tools such as Tepilo or Castlesmart , that allow you to enquire , rent and even buy properties . The US offers Realtor with the same abilities , and Australia , - Domain . As these are sovereign states , it 's unsurprising that their housing options are wide and varied but not all nations have these luxuries . <p> This would mean researching locations , reading reviews , maybe finding roommates , calling and emailing estate agents and then deciphering all of the information as it probably is n't in English . While this is a lot of effort , it can be done . Many emigrants have said contacting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location which very much helped when deciding on living arrangements . <h> 3 . Culture <p> Do n't be too surprised if you wake up bright and early 25th December to be greeted with a regular working day . Even countries that seem similar on the surface , such as the trifecta of the United States , United Kingdom and Australia could n't be more different culturally . If these English speaking , predominantly Christian states differ so greatly imagine the gap between other foreign lands . <p> Adjusting to the culture of a new realm is not easy , the work days may be different , the greetings , their bathroom arrangements , everything could be different . Yet , as is human nature , we adapt to our surroundings and slowly but surely become used to our new environment . <p> Regardless of culture change , the commonality of just being people remains . <p> Ready to start your travel planning ? Grab our free audio with our five tips to help you get going ! <h> 4 . Work &amp; School <p> Countless up-and-move escapades have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative to miss . In these situations there is the simple matter of acclimatising to the new role , gelling with other colleagues and living in a whole new country ! <p> While many have their jobs or schools secured before leaving for their new life , others are bold risk takers and just know they 'll be able to figure it out . <p> Unless there are extenuating circumstances , wannabe be movers should be actively looking for work . Most countries will have sites like US 's Monster job search or the UK 's Indeed , and Australias Seek . <h> 5 . Friends and family <p> The main reason that few will ever leave the city that they are born in is friends and family . The extent that loving interaction is needed differs from person to person , but the average joe needs their support system . <p> In foreign territory , it 's likely that you 'll go months and sometimes years without seeing your nearest and dearest . While this may be standard procedure for the lone wolves in our world , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of living abroad and the experience of missing loved ones must be weighed up as every situation will have a different result . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Love this article ! I 'm from Amsterdam , but moved to Oslo after a 1-year world trip and its been such an interesting adventure . Moving to a new country definitely comes with challenges , but its SO worth it : ) <p> This is a great post and one that I agree with on many levels . As a teacher who has been living abroad for 5 years ( UK for 3 years , China for 2 plus 2 more coming up ) I will likely spend the remainder of my career abroad , because I 've been very successful at adapting . I 've shown resilience , and not everyone has the same amount of it . I did a blog post myself about living abroad successfully and I pointed out that it really a is n't for everyone , and that 's okay ! What if everyone left their home nations ? ! The world would certainly be a very different place . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6th point would be to have a really honest conversation with yourself : are you resilient and adaptable enough to move to another country and be successful living there ? If so , living abroad will be a good choice . But if you are n't  , and you try to fool yourself into thinking that you are , it might only end in heartache . <p> Something that I had trouble with then I moved from New York to Singapore was the time difference . It meant that I only had a small window of time , usually restricted to the weekend , during which I could Skype or call home . But when I think about my parents , they left their homes in China and only returned twice in 30+ years . Thanks to WeChat , they can message with their siblings and family now , but most of the time I was growing up they would call China once or twice a year ! 
@@21820484 @1820484/ <h> 7 Amazing Stops on a Road Trip from Edinburgh to the Isle of Skye <p> One of the most beautiful road trips in Scotland- you can do is driving from Edinburgh to the Isle of Skye . <p> From the hilly and historical capital , through the scenic Glencoe area and all the way to one of the most beautiful islands in the world , Skye . <p> Discover seven of the most beautiful stops you could enjoy along the way ! <h> 1 . Calton Hill <p> As you start your Scotland Travels in Edinburgh , I recommend spending some time on Calton Hill , especially at Sunset . <p> From there you have unobstructed views of the old town , Edinburgh Castle , and the volcanic Arthurs Seat . Locals and tourists alike ( and wedding photographers ) come to enjoy one of the most beautiful views in the country . <h> 2 . Buachaille Etive Mor <p> When you reach Glencoe , you will see the impressive Buachaille Etive Mor Mountain from far away ( 1022m ) . This is probably the most photographed peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you drive towards it , the excitement builds up , as you know it is the beginning of a scenic valley . <p> And if you are a James Bond Movie fan , take the dead end road at its foot called Glen Etive , to see some filming locations of the Skyfall movie ! <h> 3 . Etive Beag <p> Not much further after that is another stop with a grandiose view of Glencoe . I just wish I had had the technology to take a 360- panorama for you . <p> From there you can see many of the Glencoe summits . It is the departure point for several hikes including Munro Bagging options like they say in Scotland ( meaning climbing peaks over 3000ft-915m ) . <h> 4 . Loch Atriochtan <p> As you continue your road trip , you drive by other famous stops like the 3 Sisters but I recommend a stop often overlooked , the one near Loch Atriochtan . <p> At this point the valley is narrow and the small loch offers a great perspective of the mountain wall . <h> 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Isle of Skye , the main road takes you through Glen Shiel . There the road winds through the valley , following River Shiel and nested between towering mountains . <p> One of its most famous stops is the view of the 5 Sisters of Kintail , a ridge with peaks rising to 3505ft ( 1068m ) . <h> 6 . Eilean Donan <p> Our last stop before the Isle of Skye is the famous Eilean Donan Castle . Built on an islet from the 13th century , it was protection against the Vikings at the meeting of 3 lochs . <p> Abandoned in the 18th century , a passionate man restored it in the early 19th century and it can still be visited today . <p> One of the best views is actually not at the main parking spot but from the other side of the bridge . From there , you can capture the Castle , its bridge and the stunning mountains of Glen Shiel in the background . <h> 7 . Old Man of Storr <p> As you arrive at Kyle of Lochalsh , you drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The road does not stop there though as the island is bigger than you think . <p> You still have to drive to the main town of Portree . And to finish your 7 stops on the road between Edinburgh and Skye , I recommend driving just a little North of Portree to admire the icon of the Isle of Skye- the Old Man of Storr . <p> Legend says that the 48m ( 160ft ) high pinnacle is the thumb of a giant lying in the Earth . <h> Planning a road trip in Scotland ? <p> The drive from Edinburgh to the Isle of Skye ( Portree ) will take you 6 hours if driving via the Trossachs and Glencoe and not stopping . <p> For more ideas about things to do on that road trip , planning information , beautiful photos , and practical maps to help you plan your travels , check out ZigZag On Earths eBook : The Road Trip Guide : Edinburgh to Skye . <p> Accommodation in Scotland <p> Booking.com has over 6,000 properties in Scotland .

Its the best view . The tragedy of the day was that the only day I could make it I had bad exposure to my film . Yup , that trip was a while ago , when cameras had film .

@@21820485 @1820485/ <h> 4 Best Things to Do in Tulum , Mexico <p> Tulum is one of Mexico 's most popular beach towns and features historic ruins , great food and endless beach clubs set along the spectacular Caribbean Sea on the Yucatan Peninsula . <p> Although Tulum 's popularity continues to increase , it remains quieter than nearby Cancun and Playa del Carmen , offering a more laid back and authentic experience for travellers . <p> Tulum is split between a central area with shops , restaurants and hotels that run along the main road to Playa del Carmen and Cancun in the north , and the beachfront , approximately five kilometres from town . <p> The small road running the length of the beach has hotels and restaurants on both sides and is where you will likely spend most of your time while in Tulum . Whether you stay by the beach or in the centre of town , it is easy to get between the two areas . <p> If you 're on a budget , it 's cheaper to stay in central Tulum and make your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While you could easily spend all your time in Tulum eating , drinking , and swimming , the town is close to a number of popular attractions in the surrounding area . <p> Here are some activities you should not miss during a visit to Tulum . <h> Things to do in Tulum <h> 1 . Spend a lazy day at one of Tulum 's beach clubs <p> There are more than 50 beach clubs along Tulum 's main stretch of beach . Many are hotels as well , with most offering access to day visitors either for free or for a minimum spend at a bar or restaurant on site . <p> Spending the day at a beach club is one of the best things to do in Tulum if you are staying in central Tulum and not on the beachfront itself . There are a couple of public sections of beach , but if you want to relax on a sunbed under an umbrella with a choice of food and cocktails a beach club is the way to go ! <p> Not all beach clubs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out which ones suit you best . <p> A great way to do this is to go for a walk along the beach . From the ocean side you can check out the different set ups of each club , something you ca n't do from the road . <p> Personally , I loved Viento De Mar . This was a smaller beach club with a minimum spend that seemed to help keep numbers down . From my research , Viento De Mar had among the best sunbed set up of any beach club and has the advantage of not being listed in the tourist map handed out by most hotels in town meaning people wo n't come searching it out . <p> If there are two of you and you have the choice , select an umbrella with two single beds , as opposed to doubles as during busy times you may find they put another couple next to you under the same umbrella , which kind of kills some of the exclusivity . Pack a book or two and you 'll be set for the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ruins of the former Mayan city at Tulum have to be the most beautifully situated I saw in all of Mexico . Right on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean Sea , many people come to the Tulum ruins for the photo opportunities alone . <p> The most impressive structure still here today is the Castillo , which sits atop a limestone cliff above a small sandy beach . There are palms below and turquoise water laps at the shore . It is easy to see why this is one of the most iconic images of Mexico . <p> Ancient Tulum was at its most powerful between the 13th and 15th centuries . The city served as a port and was the only Mayan city built on the coast , as well as one of only a few walled cities ever built by the Mayans . This makes the well-preserved ruins unique to explore . <p> It 's best to arrive early to visit the ruins at Tulum . The site opens at 8am and if you are there for opening time you can make your way through the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive meaning you 'll get some great photo opportunities as well as some time to appreciate the site before it gets busy . <h> 3 . Swim in the Gran Cenote <p> Gran Cenote one of the best things to do in Tulum <p> Just three kilometres from Tulum on the way to Coba and Chichen Itza is the Gran Cenote , a popular swimming and snorkelling spot . <p> Cenotes are like natural sinkholes , created when limestone collapses to reveal the underground river systems below . Cenote means sacred well and the Mayans built cities close to cenotes as they were a reliable water source in an otherwise dry landscape . <p> There are many cenotes on the Yucatan Peninsula but the Gran Cenote would have to be one of the best for swimming . <p> The water is so pure and fresh that it is as clear as glass . Plenty of fish and turtles are at home in the cenote and they do n't seem to be too shy so you 'll likely run into a few while you are swimming . <p> As you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stalagmites and just like in any cave , lots of bats . As well as swimming and snorkelling in the Gran Cenote , you can also arrange scuba diving . <p> Like the ruins at Tulum , try and get here for opening time ( 8am ) so you can be the first in the cenote . The cenote is not particularly big so you will have a much nicer experience if you are one of just a couple of people silently swimming around . The ambiance can be lost when noisy groups arrive . <h> 4 . Ride a bike through the jungle at Coba <p> The Mayan ruins at Coba , about 40 minutes from Tulum , are set among dense jungle and are different again from the ruins at Tulum and other popular Mayan sites such as Chichen Itza or Uxmal . <p> Large sections of this former city are still to be discovered and restored , meaning Coba has a much more wild and untouched feel to other ruin sites . <p> The site is huge and was once home to around 50,000 people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seventh centuries and you can see the remains of roads , homes and temples still today . <p> There are bikes for rent inside the complex and I really recommend you grab one for exploring Coba . It means you can cover more ground and it 's also lots of fun . The site is so large that at times you can find yourself in a little pocket with no one else around . <p> You 'll also ride past plenty of mounds that upon closer inspection prove to be pyramids and other structures not yet cleared of the vegetation that has taken hold over the years . <p> You are able to touch and climb the structures here and although it feels a little disrespectful to begin with , it is actually a great way to get up high and look out over the site . <p> Once you see all the people climbing the giant pyramid , known as Nohuch Mul , at the back of the site , you 'll want to give it a go to . <p> It 's a steep ascent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times , particularly on the way down . At about 42 metres , be sure to only look a step or two ahead if you 're not a huge fan of heights . <h> PIN THIS : <h> Plan Your Trip to Tulum <p> We rely on a few trusted websites that save us money and time when booking accommodation , flights , and car rental .

@@21820488 @1820488/ <h> Things to do in Bright , Victoria <p> The town of Bright in Victoria checks off most of our criteria for making a place liveable . Except it 's a little too far from a major city ( 3 hours drive ) . I ca n't shake Craig off this point to consider it as a place to eventually live . <p> I LOVE beautiful Bright . Kalyra is also a major fan and has emphatically declared that she will live there one day for 10 years . I hope she invites her Mamma to visit often . <p> Thanks so much to our beautiful friend Kim who lives in Bright and who runs the 356 things to do in Bright website who invited us to visit Bright back in 2012 for her Bright Delight social media campaign . We fell in love and were determined to return for a longer stay . <p> Again , Kim invited us back , but this time to house sit for her over Christmas while she went away . How could we say no ? <p> Two weeks over Christmas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Hotham and kangaroos visiting of an evening and early morning . Who would n't want that , right ? <p> It was sublime and one of the most serene , enjoyable Christmases I 've had in a very long time . <h> Things to do in Bright <h> The Rail Trail <p> Our favourite way to get into town from Kim 's place was along an overhanging , tree-lined section of the 94km Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail ( cycle way ) . <p> The bitumen sealed track is well suited to both cycling and walking and links the townships of Wangaratta , Beechworth , Myrtleford , Porepunkah and Bright . <p> We also cycled the 6km track to Porepunkah to have lunch at the Rail Trail Cafe , which is where you 'll find some of the best Mexican food in Australia for real . We recommend going a little further if you can to Feathertop Winery ( 10km one way trip from Bright . ) <h> Bright Brewery <p> You know that rail trail into town ? It took us right to the Bright Brewery and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . They also have pretty good beer . <p> And get this parents of small children the beer garden looks straight out over the kids playground . Perfect for parents and kids .

It 's also a great place for a picnic . <p> The Make . Bake .

There is an amazing number of choices and so many of them are family friendly . <h> Food Wine Friends <p> Treat yourself with a gourmet picnic hamper to take up to Mt Buffalo . We loved what Luke prepared for us and I loved not having a hand in the making and gathering of it . For time strapped parents like us its such a great idea . <h> Riverdeck Cafe <p> A pleasant spot to sit with a cuppa in the sun is the Riverdeck cafe overlooking the Ovens River and play area . <h> Ginger Baker <p> Ginger Baker has a lovely outside eating area , overlooking the Ovens River . There is plenty of space here for the kids to feel comfortable . <p> Ginger Baker Cafe <h> Day trips from Bright <p> WE recommend staying in Bright and using it as a base to explore the beauty of the surrounding High Country . <p> There is so much to see and do in this area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional Australian beach summer holiday . <h> Mt Buffalo <p> Only a short 40 minute drive from Bright is Mt Buffalo , a beautiful place to explore for the day . It 's perfect in the summer as it 's usually much cooler than down in the valley . <p> We spent the morning kayaking at Lake Catani , and enjoying a picnic at The Horn , the highest point of Mt Buffalo . You can walk up the top for 360 degree views of the plateau and Australian Alps . On the way back down stop at Ladies Baths for a dip in the refreshingly clear waters . <h> Feathertop Winery <p> You can make your entrance to Feathertop an experience in itself by cycling the stunning Rail Trail from Bright . We did n't feel Kalyra would cope with the 10km one way cycle , so we drove . Since I love wine more than Craig he nominated himself as the DD . <p> Feathertop winery <h> Berry picking Mt Stanley <p> Just up the road from Beechworth at Mt Stanley is one of the best berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fun running from rows of blueberries , boysenberries , raspberries and berries we 'd never heard of like Logan berries . <p> The best thing about this farm is that for $2 you can eat all you like while you pick . The girls learned how to find and pick a ripe berry and how to taste one like a connoisseur of wine , we shared our thoughts on each one and whether it was worthy to make the bucket . <p> Only blueberries , boysenberries and raspberries made ours . These berries are also super cheap to buy . <h> HOT TIP for visiting Bright <p> Avoid visiting Bright for the weeks after Christmas if you can . The town population swells from 2,000 to near 20,000 . Yep , told you it was good . The weeks leading up to Christmas are just divine . <h> Getting- to Bright , Victoria <p> Bright is approximately a 3 hour drive from Melbourne .

We are seriously considering making the move up to Bright perhaps in the next 12 months if we can . Our 4 year old son wants to move up there right away ! = Great article . A few more sleeps and well be there again . <p> You have convinced me to add Bright to my travel wish-list ! I never knew there was so much to do and see in and around Bright .

@@21820489 @1820489/ <h> Top 20 Places in Australia For Your Bucket List <p> After recently finishing an 18-month road trip around Australia Im often asked what are the top places in Australia to visit ? And what experiences should be on my bucket list ? <p> Let me start by saying its always a good idea to visit Australia , but its currently an even better idea to travel in Australia at the moment with the weakening Aussie dollar . <p> If you 're an Aussie like me , not travelling overseas to destinations where our money does n't  travel far but exploring more of our own backyard probably makes sense financially . And if you 're from places like the USA or Europe , then the US dollar and Euro offers good value for your money . <p> But regardless of where you 're from , and what the dollar is doing , visiting Australia is on most peoples bucket list at least once in their lifetime , and if you really want to come down under , make it a priority and do it . <p> Its a tough choice narrowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia , and I 've had to leave out some fantastic destinations , but if you 're only going to visit Australia once , these would be my top suggestions for seeing the best of what our country has to offer . <h> 1 . Whitsunday Islands , Queensland <p> 74 islands make up The Whitsundays and what 's not to love ? ! Its- home to our favourite beach in Australia , Whitehaven Beach , and numerous other magical beaches and secluded bays with that turquoise water and pure white sand . Throw in tropical sunsets , every watersport imaginable , and the fact you 're in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef. - The mainland town of Airlie Beach is a happening place with Hamilton Island being the most concentrated for accommodation and activities . <h> 2 . Kakadu National Park , Northern Territory <p> Some people call it Kaka-dont , but do n't  listen to them . They probably raced through the park on a day trip with a tour group and it deserves so much more time than that . We spent 5 days in Kakadu and still only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places in Australia list . From wetlands to sandstone escarpments , waterfalls , swimming holes , billabongs , rivers , wildlife , and aboriginal rock art , it has it all . <h> 4 . Sydney , NSW <p> Sydney Harbour and Opera House <p> You ca n't visit Australia and not spend at least a few days in one of the worlds most beautiful cities many of you will fly through here anyways . Sure it has a reputation of being on the expensive side , but most of the best things to do are free or cheap walk across the Harbour Bridge , picnic in the Botanical Gardens , walk around Circular Quay and admire the Opera House , - take the ferry over to Manly , - explore The Rocks District , and my favourite the Bondi Beach to Coogee Beach coastal walk ! <h> 5 . Broome , Western Australia <p> If you 've been following us for a while you 'll know that Broome is our favourite place in Australia. - Our love affair with Broome dates back to our days working on a pearl farm in- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 weeks there and did n't  want to leave . Its the striking red earth against the turquoise water of the Indian Ocean , the most amazing sunsets over- Cable Beach , and perfect weather it has the vibe of - a charming country town by the sea ! <h> 6 . Byron Bay , NSW <p> Sunset at Byron Bay Main Beach <p> This legendary beachside town in Northern NSW has been attracting surfers , - the spiritually minded , spa lovers , yogis , backpackers and those trying to find themselves for years . With some of the most famous surfing breaks in the country , the alternative lifestyle , and the stunning hinterland , Byron is the place to be , and be seen . Do n't  miss the lighthouse walk past Wategos Beach , sunrise and sunset , Bluesfest over Easter , and take a surfing lesson ! <h> 7 . Freycinet National Park , Tasmania <p> Wineglass Bay , Tasmania <p> Freycinet is our favourite place in Tasmania and one of our top three favourite National Parks in Australia . Youve probably heard of world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , Friendly Beaches , Coles Bay and that this park has some of the best walks in Tassie ? Give yourself more than one day here to do all the hikes , go kayaking , and take in the beauty of the Hazards . <h> 8 . Uluru , Northern Territory <p> Visiting- Uluru in the Red Centre of Australia is an experience I 'll never forget . Known as the " spiritual heart of Australia " Uluru is one of those places you just have to see , and feel , for yourself . Do n't  rush through here like most people , stay a while and take it all in . Experience sunset and sunrise , walk around the base , take a camel ride , maybe a helicopter flight , and visit nearby Kata Tjuta. <h> 9 . Great Barrier Reef , Queensland <p> Getting out on the- worlds largest coral reef and the largest living structure on the planet has to be on your Aussie bucket list . Stretching- 2,300km long , the GBR is a natural wonder of the world and in my opinion lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even just a snorkeler , the options are endless . Most people visit the reef from- Cairns which is known as the unofficial- gateway . <h> 10 . Daintree Rainforest , Queensland <p> Cape Tribulation , Daintree National Park <p> How can something so old be so beautiful ? I mean , at 110 million years old the Daintree Rainforest is pretty damn old , and possibly the oldest existing rainforest in the world . My favourite spot is- Cape Tribulation " a headland located within Daintree National Park , a- place where- two World Heritage Listed sites collide the- Daintree and Great Barrier Reef . Other spots to visit include Daintree Discovery Centre , Cow Bay , Myall Beach , Emmagen Beach , Cape Kimberley and Masons Cafe and swimming hole . <h> 11 . Fraser Island , Queensland <p> If you 're a hard-core 4+4 driving enthusiast put Fraser Island at the top of your Aussie bucket list. - Fraser stretches 123 km long , 23 km wide , and is the largest sand island in the world dumped over 800,000 years ago from places as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant get enough of Fraser , its an adventure with nature you 'll crave more of . My favourite spots are 75 Mile Beach , Eli Creek , Maheno shipwreck , Lake Mackenzie , Indian Head , and Champagne Pools . <h> 12 . Melbourne , Victoria <p> I could live in Melbourne , and I 'm not the only one apparently as it consistently ranks at the top of most liveable cities in the world , I just do n't  know if I could live with the four seasons in one day weather pattern . Anyhow , Melbourne is an awesome city to visit . If you 're a sports nut like me its got the Australian Open Tennis , the Grand Prix , the Melbourne Cup , and the AFL . For everyone else its got an incredible food scene , some of the best coffee and cafes in the country ( if not the world ) , cool pubs , endless shopping , great festivals , awesome markets , handy public transport , and just an all round addictive vibe ! <h> 13 . Great Ocean Road , Victoria <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda famous around the world as one of the best road trips . We spent 2 weeks driving the GOR and it lived up to expectations . If I have one tip , do n't  rush it , do n't  drive it in one day like the tour buses , slow down and give it the time it deserves . But if you only have time for one place , then Port Campbell National Park is the highlight , its where most of the top scenic spots are located like the Twelve Apostles and Loch Ard Gorge . <h> 14 . Rottnest Island , Western Australia <p> Rotto as the locals call it , is something special. - With over 60 picturesque beaches and bays and top spots for snorkeling , diving , kayaking , swimming and fishing its possibly my favourite island in Australia and if you make it to Perth , do n't  miss Rottnest . Stay over if you can , but if you only have half a day make sure you visit The Basin and Pinky Beach . Grab a bike , its the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera ! <h> 15 . Hobart , Tasmania <p> I 'm not CRAZY about Hobart , but its definitely a nice enough place with lots of history its Australias second oldest city and I really enjoyed a few other places within easy reach of the city so that 's why I 'm including it in this list . I do love the fact that its walkable , my favourite spots being Salamanca and Historic Battery Point , and of course , - the famous- MONA- museum is a must visit . The other places close enough to Hobart I highly recommend are Bruny Island , Port Arthur , and historic Richmond . <h> 16 . Barossa Valley , South Australia <p> If were just talking wine and food , then the Barossa Valley and nearby Adelaide Hills is probably my favourite place in Australia for satisfying the taste buds . Its a short drive from Adelaide- and with over 80 cellar doors and 150 wineries from big names to boutiques including- Jacobs Creek , Penfolds , Wolf Blass and Grant Burge , you 're not lacking in options . And the scenery is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stunning scenery . <h> 17 . Karijini National Park , Western Australia <p> We had high expectations for Karijini . So many people we met on our 18-month trip told us that Karijini was their favourite national park . And they werent lying . This place is spectacular , and I cant believe that three years ago I do n't  think I 'd even heard of this place , but were doing our best to share it with as many people as possible . The colours of the rock , the gorges , the swimming holes , the waterfalls , the hiking its off-the-beaten-path in WA but totally worth the effort ! <h> 18 . Gold Coast , Queensland <p> We chose to call the Gold Coast our current home for a reason . Whilst its a region well known for tourism with a tagline famous for fun , it has a great mix of beautiful coastal and hinterland scenery , - with some of the best beaches in the country . My favourite spots on the coast are Burleigh Heads , Rainbow Bay and Coolangatta . Whilst in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Binna Burra National Park ! <h> 19. - Wilsons Promontory- National Park , Victoria <p> Another place we new little about until we travelled around Australia , and it was n't until friends in Melbourne suggested we go here , its a 3-hour drive from the city , that we did. - It 's a 50,000-hectare coastal wilderness area and so popular they have a ballot system to stay in the accommodation during peak season . You 're reward stunning vistas of pink granite boulder mountains , turquoise water , squeaky white sand , intimate coves , forested valleys , and incredible hiking . <h> 20 . Kangaroo Island , South Australia <p> image : Shutterstock.com <p> Ok , Kangaroo Island is the only place on this list that we have n't personally been to , yet . But we 've had that many people we trust rave about this island that I 'm adding it in for you guys to learn about . What 's so good about Kangaroo Island ? From what I 've been told the wilderness and landscapes , the diverse wildlife , and the food is amazing . I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists . My Australian travels were limited to Melbourne , Hobart &amp; Sydney . I 've heard other people say Hobart is n't their thing but it was my favourite . Being from a small town , I just found it really homey and the people were so friendly . There were things I liked about Sydney ( the Bondi to Cogee walk was awesome ! ) , but there were just too many people . Melbourne was a nice middle ground between the two for me . <p> I 'm in Melbourne for the next year ( longer if I can get sponsored ! ) and cant wait to explore these places ! I 'm running the Kangaroo Island marathon in August and I have a feeling it will be one of the highlights of my time here . = Thanks for whipping this up ! <p> I 've always wanted to visit Australia .

But I do n't  know if it is a good idea to travel in the Northeastern of Australia . At that time is the raining season . <p> You guys have been to so many incredible places in Australia . I 'm so jealous ! But not for long as we will be covering all this and more over the next three years as we slowly make our way around the country . Top on my list is driving over the Nullabor ( which people tell me is boring but something about it makes me excited and intrigued ) , wine tasting through Margaret River and hopping from one incredible beach to another . We are so blessed to live in such a beautiful country . <p> Love this list ! Brings back such fond memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list is #17 , Karijini not on the typical tourist circuit but that 's why its so amazing . I liken it to the Grand Canyon , but with a lot less people . I had so much fun in WA and this was the highlight for sure . <p> I 'm planing to go to Australia Sidney for the first time this march break , reading your site I have no idea of places that you recommend is located where in the country ? Can you show the places on a map , I will stay 4 days in Sidney and do n't  know these top 20 places which one is close to Sidney ? <p> Ive been to Australia once , after dreaming of going for 25 years . I made my visit as part of a larger trip that took me to Singapore and Indonesia . I flew into Sydney , then headed to Perth , came back to Perth from Singapore , headed back to Sydney , and made it down to Melbourne . In those 25 years I dreamed of visiting the Sydney Opera House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also found myself camping on Cockatoo Island . What a rush . The kicker is that those tiles that line the outside of the Sydney Opera House are kitchen tiles , and were made by a kitchen tile manufacturer . Oh , the things I learn . And I made it to Bondi Beach , too . I squeezed it in on the way to the airport to come back to the United States . As it was winter in Australia at the time there werent too many beach goers there . I did n't  care . I took off my shoes and wondered the beach , with a quick splash in the ocean . All in 20 minutes . I almost missed my flight ! <p> My final comment is this . When I graduated from college in 1983 I took a trip to China . My roommate was a Texan whod lived in Australia for 10 years because of his dads job . Hed tell me everyday I had to go to Australia . I put up a poster in my cube , and vowed someday I 'd touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera House . It said something about submarines . <p> The day before I left Australia I took a cigarette boat tour of Sydney Harbor , we docked at the opera house . Strapped in my seat on the water side of the boat , I looked to my left . There it was , the sign I 'd vowed to touch 25 years earlier . I did n't  unstrap my self , but I figured that being within in 5 feet of it was close enough ! <p> Ive been back from 11 months in Aus and NZ for about 6 months now ( we used your blog a couple of times for hints and tips thanks ! ) and am planning my return to see some of the places on this list that we did n't  make it to , Karijini and Kakadu in particular . Loved Rotto ( and the quokkas ) , even in the winter rain and agree with Whitsundays at the top spot . <p> Its not on here but I really want to visit Ningaloo reef too so many places , need to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel so lucky to live in this amazing country ! But it also makes me realise that I 've only been to four places on the list- Byron , Daintree , Whitsundays and Barrier Reef . There are so many places I want to visitI think I will need to live to 120 to see them all ! <p> We will be visiting Australia in January , but only for 2 weeks Its going to be hard to pick which area we should restrict ourself to = Thanks for that list , some places will definitely be added in our bucket list . David &amp; Caroline . <p> Hi , I 'm traveling to Australia during July . I was reading you blog , and I realized you always mentioned one of the YHA hostels , do you recommend them ? I 'm 20 years old travelling alone to Byron Bay , Gold Coast , Brisbane and Cairns so I want a good place for my age and good for solo travelers I want to meet people . I had read a lot abou yha but I 'm nt sure yet . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay YHA and Byron Bay YHA , do you know which one is better ? How in advanced should I book hostels ? Thanks ! ! <p> Yes YHA hostels are good . They are held to a certain standard and 95% of them should be good quality . Not sure which is the best on in Byron Bay but we have stayed at the Cape Byron Bay YHA which is in the center od town and was fine . Enjoy your trip .

It 's why they are represented on our national emblem , as Australia is a nation always moving forward . <p> I could tell you many incredible facts about kangaroos . The last one being that they are actually part of the macropod family , which includes 65 species such as wallabies , tree kangaroos , - pademelons , and quokkas . <p> When you visit Casuarina Beach at Cape Hillsborough for sunrise be prepared to meet lots of kangaroos and wallabies , in particular , my favourite , pretty faced wallabies . <p> As the name suggests , they are so pretty and sweet . <p> Not long after we arrived at Cape Hillsborough Tourist Park we were getting ready to go up to the bar for dinner and a pretty faced wallaby came to say hi to us .

Botswana is a land of pristine wilderness and draws in safari enthusiasts from all over the globe . <p> The country is made up of wetlands and the massive Kalahari Desert . Besides the sheer natural beauty of Botswana , the country is also one of the most financially and politically stable countries on the continent . <p> We may have caught the sunrise in the Namib Desert and relaxed on the- white sand beaches of Mozambique , but traveling Botswana was unforgettable . Here are our five favorite experiences and things to do in Botswana . <h> 5 Things to do in Botswana <h> 1 . A Mokoro Ride in the Okavango Delta <p> Taking a ride in a mokoro is the perfect way to experience the Okavango Delta . <p> The mokoro is a traditional dugout wooden canoe . They are used in shallow waters where the- poler- can steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow waters of the Okavango Delta . <p> A mokoro ride through the delta is an incredible way to get up close and personal with one of Aricas top destinations . Safari-goers float through tranquil channels in the heart of Botswana . Just watch out for the hippos ! <p> Insider Tip : A trip to the Okavango Delta does n't  come cheap . To get the most bang for buck try self-driving into Moremi National Park and camping . Mokoro trips can easily be arranged at these campsites or in Maun at Old Bridge Backpackers . <h> 2 . Take a River Cruise Around the- Chobe National Park <p> Seeing elephants in Chobe National Park was one of our favorite experiences in Botswana . <p> The base for the Chobe National Park , Kasane connects Botswana , Namibia , Zimbabwe , and Zambia together making Chobe National Park one of the most accessible in all of Africa . Besides the ease , Chobe National Park has one of the largest concentrations of game- in all of Africa . <p> The park is- home to all of the Big Five- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopard ) . It is even estimated that there are over 120,000 elephants in the park . So with just a few hours in the park , you are almost guaranteed to see an elephant on safari . <p> The best part about visiting Botswanas first park is that you can take either a traditional land safari or a river cruise . We decided to try out both and saw just about everything you could hope for while in Botswana . <p> From the Chobe River , we were able to get up close with crocodiles , buffalo , beautiful birdlife , and baby elephants bathing . While on land we could view things like baby impala , vultures , and lionesses with their cubs . <h> 3 . Take an ATV Across the Great- Makgadikgadi Pans <p> Vultures another interesting animal to see in Botswana <p> The Botswana salt flats are one of the largest salt flats in the world . The landscapes here are some of the most- unique in all of Botswana . <p> The Makgadikgadi Pans are in close distance to the town of Nata . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the park . The park is 4+4 recommended , but another popular option is to take ATVs and drive off into the never-ending sunsets in the pans . <p> If you 're feeling adventurous then be sure to set up an overnight stay within the park . Here you will be able to spend the night watching the shooting stars on a bedroll next to a blazing fire , or " bush TV " as the Africans like to call it . <p> Insider Tip : We found great- value at Nata Lodge . They organized trips into the pans for less- than $100 per person . <h> 4 . Get Hot in the Central Kalahari <p> The Kalahari is an inhospitable environment , but you 'll still see lots of animals . <p> There is so much beauty in the Kalahari between the sand acacias , apple leafs , sand dunes , and grasslands . By some measurements , the Kalahari Desert holds the largest volume of sand in the world when compared to other deserts . <p> The Kalahari encompasses and humbles visitors who are at will to nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert can do that to you .

Wildebeest , zebra , red hartebeest , lions , and more roam free across their giant home in Botswana . <p> Insider Tip : To self-drive the park a 4+4 is a must . When going into remote places like the- Kalahari its also important to pack enough water , food , and fuel to get you through your journey . Its not for the faint of heart . <h> 5 .

Its estimated that there are- less than 30,000- rhinos left in the world , and if poaching continues we could lose them all . <p> Its a sad situation and that 's why I love the work that Khama is doing . Even if you get rhino-ed out ( which you wo n't ) , there are over 30 other species of animals in the sanctuary as well as abundant African bird life . <p> Insider Tip : - Bring your- swimsuit. - The Khama Rhino Sanctuary has a restaurant and a pool to cool off from the hot African sun . <h> About Natasha Alden <p> Natasha is a five-foot blonde that believes she was made short so she could fit in air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling .

We went there with our teenage boys in 2015 and did Chobe River cruise , Makhadikgadi and 3 days into the Moremi Game Reserve with Old Bridge Backpackers . That was a fantastic time which we wont forget . Boys loved it , especially the walking safaris when you experience the savannah without the shield of your car . <p> This year we are coming back to Botswana to see Central Kalahari Game Reserve and drive the 4WD from Maun through Savuti to Kasane .

Those F roads sometimes have significant river crossings . <p> There is already a lot to see not far from the Ring Road and the access gravel roads are manageable with 2WD cars . <p> I rented a 4WD vehicle- and I must admit it was much more comfortable for longer gravel roads . <p> In winter the roads can be covered in ice and snow . <p> But do n't worry , the Ring Road and side gravel roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneity <p> Berserkjahraun <p> Make sure you have time to take a road when you have no idea where it leads to . This is how you can find some of the most memorable landscapes . <p> During my own trip , I was touring the Snaefellsnes peninsula . Based on the recommendation from a local , I drove through the lava field of Berserkjahraun . It was not planned and yet it was one of my favorite places in Iceland . <h> 5 . In Summer , book accommodation in advance <p> Iceland 's tourism industry is developing quite fast , however there are still huge areas without any towns . So it is important to book your Iceland accommodation in advance . <p> The few hotels or guesthouses in the countryside fill up quickly . Another option for summer is to camp . <p> It is less of a problem in winter . However , during that period , many establishments shut down , so you could face the same problem . <h> 6 . Pack Layers <p> Jokulsalron Beach <p> This is not a legend . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you need layers : some to keep warm , some to protect from the rain and some to stop the wind . And on top of that you should bring a hat and gloves . <p> Onn time I was on Jokulsarlon beach , a stretch of black sand where icebergs wash off . It was all foggy and wet , an incredible mood ! But a little while later we had a beautiful blue sky ! <h> 7 . Plan to alternate drivers <p> Kirkjufell <p> I am going to repeat myself but Iceland is STUNNING . It is hard to keep your eyes on the road . And yet , you should ! Sheep can appear suddenly . <p> Roads sometimes become one lane bridges , so my advice is to plan in advance to alternate drivers ( if you are not on a solo road trip like me ) . <p> Or plan to stop every couple of kilometers so that the driver can enjoy the views .

They have great detours written into them for places to visit . They are part of HI International . In our experience they are also the cheapest . I 'm sorry if I 'm not supposed to put a link to a website . <p> We found that the best place to go whale watching is Husavik in the north . It is so much nicer than going from Reykjavik . But I definately recommend on going to Iceland . But do travel around with a car . Do n't  only go to Reykjavik and the Golden Circle ( Godafoss , Thingvellir , the Geysirs ) . There is so much more to see . Sorry for the ramble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about then the biggest crowds come to the country and about the road conditions .

Ill be travelling in May and absolutely can not wait . We plan to do the entire Ring Road in 9 days which is ambitious but because the weather hopefully will be more co-operative Im really keeping my fingers crossed that we can do it .

Except for the famous White Beach " that was a little too much like Hat Rin on a full moon . <p> White Beach is worth a visit , but when travelling to Boracay with kids , I recommend staying elsewhere . <p> The other beaches on Boracay Island are just as good , if not better . <p> Our family holiday to Boracay was short only four days but we loved it . We were sad to leave , the girls especially , and are determined to return to explore Boracay , and the Philippines , in greater depth . <p> If someone were to ask for my recommendations for a great Asian family holiday , I 'd recommend Boracay over the more popular Phuket or Bali . <p> I do n't think the food is as good as Thailand , but the people are just as friendly , the lifestyle super chilled , the beaches some of the best in the world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in Boracay . It 's a relaxing island getaway . <p> We visited in partnership with GoLocal , a portable wifi rental service that provides travelers with all day data for all their mobile devices throughout their stay for as little as $1.67 per day . I 'll share more about it below , but the service is perfect for families wanting to connect more than one device at a very low price in the Philippines . <p> Here are some of the things to do in Boracay that we experienced on our short visit . <h> Punta Bunga Beach <p> Punta Bunga Bach has pristine powdery white sand and turquoise waters and no crowds . It was our pick of Boracay Beaches and one of the most beautiful beaches Ive seen in the world . <p> Punta Bunga is a private beach for guests of Movenpick Resort and Shangri-La . I 'm not sure if you can get access otherwise , but its worth a try ! <p> We had a spectacular morning kayaking and stand up paddling in the water . <h> Puka Beach <p> We loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be white , but it 's a golden colour I like just as much . Puka Beach is much quieter than White Beach and reminded me of the Thai beaches like Railey 's Bay back in 1999 . <p> We got caught in a torrential rain storm ( the tail end of the typhoon ) , but it soon passed and added to the fun and moody drama . <p> You can hire a beach chair and umbrella- " payment by way of overpriced shakes and food . They line the beach so go for a walk first to find one that suits your vibe . It 's worth doing if you intend on hanging around for the day . <p> I 'd buy your one drink to reserve your seat and eat at the restaurant at the entrance to the beach . It 's about a third of the price to what they charge for food from the chair rental shacks . Beer is way cheaper than fruit shakes , so why not make that your one drink ? <p> Our chair rental shack came with free tubes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . Savannah was n't brave enough to do it , but she loved playing in the waves with Kalyra . <p> The rest of the time she hung with me on the chairs and had her photo taken by passing Filipinos who adored her blonde hair , blue-eyed look . <p> While Kalyra was floating , Craig and I had a cheap foot massage and watched the local boys on their skim boards riding the waves . You can rent them also . I was pretty impressed with the aerial manoeuvres they were performing . <p> See more of Puka Beach in the video : <h> Snorkelling and Boracay Island hopping tour <p> On our last day in Boracay , the sun shone brightly , and Boracay glimmered . We joined a snorkelling and Boracay Island hopping tour on a banca boat organised by Movenpick Resort . You can join these from anywhere in Boracay . <p> It was a fantastic way to spend the day . We loved visiting some of the other beaches and enjoying pretty decent snorkelling . I say pretty decently because after you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be pretty decent ! <h> Balinghai Beach <p> We jumped off the boat for some snorkelling in the waters just offshore from Balinghai Beach . Balinghai is a private beach that looks like it belongs in the Greek Islands . It would be worth a visit if you can get there . <p> Balinghai Beach covers over at high tide , and you do have to pay a fee to enter the beach . <p> Savannah had a brilliant time snorkelling and could n't wait to jump back in the boat with the sea animal chart to point out to me what she saw. - Our guide told us that close by to this snorkelling spot in the deeper waters ; he has seen whale sharks before when scuba diving . <h> Diniwid Beach <p> Diniwid is a quiet and pretty beach . You can walk here from Station One or catch a trike . Or , like us , visit on your Boracay Island hopping boat tour . Diniwid Beach looks very family friendly . <p> The highlight of most travellers to this beach is The Spider House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous little beach on the north east of the island is secluded , but accessible by road via motorbike , bicycle or hiking . <p> I loved our journey to Ilig Iligan past Puka Beach and the bats hanging upside down in the trees on the jungled and rugged coastline on our boat tour . <p> The sand is white ( although not as powdery as White Beach ) , the water is clear and turquoise , and the beach quiet . It 's a good spot for a seafood lunch and snorkelling a little further out from shore . <p> I found the snorkelling at Ilig Iligan Beach better than Balinghai Beach . <p> You can see more of our Boracay Beaches and Snorkelling tour by pressing play on the video : <h> Spider House for lunch or sunset <p> I do n't  think it matters when you visit , the Spider House will exhale a few wows out of your system . <p> Built on the edge of the cliff on the north side of Diniwid Beach , and accessed via a small tunnelled cave , its bamboo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back towards Diniwid Beach . <p> We arrived by boat on our island tour for a quick snack stop . We picked up calamansi juice and enjoyed the views out over the ocean . You can walk down the stairs from your cliff top position straight into the water and on the reef for a snorkel . <p> Apparently , sunsets on Boracay from the Spider House are spectacular as the sun appears as a giant orb in the sky . <p> Hopefully , you 'll get lucky and jag this spot for your sunset cocktail . <h> White Beach area <p> White Beach is consistently known as one of the best beaches in Asia for its stunning white sand and turquoise water . We did n't get to see White Beach in its full glory as it was overcast " it still looked pretty gorgeous in the grey light . <p> The locals call it Long Beach , as you can also guess , it 's quite long . It 's broken up into three sections called Stations . <p> Station Two is by far the busiest area ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little quieter with some excellent views overlooking a small island just off the beach , and Station Three is further south near the jetty port . <h> Real Coffee <p> It as recommended to us to try a real coffee with a calamansi muffin at the Real Coffee in Station Two , Boracay . It was a delicious combination and we loved watching them froth up the milk over the hot stove . <p> There are beautiful views from Real Coffee over White Beach as well , although the ocean views were obstructed by the protective typhoon walls . Damn typhoons . <h> Jony 's shakes <p> Another community member recommended the shakes from Jony 's Shakes at Station One . The papaya and lemon shake- was delicious . But , the standout was Kalyras Bananatella . Very naughty for my standards , but oh so delicious . <h> D Mall <p> When you arrive on Boracay , you 'll hear everyone talk about D Mall . It 's quite the centre point of White Beach and a good marker to know where things are located . <p> Its the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cafes to eat at . <h> Dinner at PauPatri <p> There are hundreds of restaurants that line White Beach " take your pic and enjoy some ocean views and scenery . <p> I loved the look of several of the bean bags laying on the beach and pre-kids I would have cemented a spot in them with a bucket of beers or tow . ( beers are cheap on Boracay ! ! ) <p> For a more local place to eat in Boracay , head down the alleyway off Station Two ( you 'll have to ask someone to help you ) to find PauPatri , but it 's worth it . <p> Dining at PauPatri Restaurant was a tip from the Italian pizza chef at the Movenpick Resort . It 's Philippine cuisine in a rainforest setting . You have to take off your shoes and walk down a long wooden bridge over a waterway to reach the main restaurant area . <p> Once there , little alleyways like spider web strings lead down to private wooden cabanas over the water . <p> The prices are maybe slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach . Eating out in Boracay is not as cheap as you 'd think for an Asian destination , but for us , our meal came to around $55 Australian dollars . <p> We ordered a lot of food too including beer , calamansi juice , and two juices for the girls . <h> White Beach sunsets <p> Sunsets on White Beach is an infamous experience on Boracay . <p> We visited in low season , and I could not believe how many people there were on the beach . There is also an insane amount of boats going out for a sunset tour . I 've heard these are good to do , but , for myself , I could n't stand going out on one of those with all the masses like that . I 'd opt for other places on Boracay for sunset instead . <p> Despite the crowds , I did enjoy walking along the beach at sunset amongst the atmosphere and checking out all the sand sculptures . The sunset was n't brilliant due to the weather , but I could see how amazing it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lots of young boys who 'd be happy to sculpt your name in the sand for a price . It was n't until the boys were halfway through carving out Savannahs name that I twigged with what was happening . I thought when they asked me to write- her name in the sand they were curious and friendly . <p> Welcome to Boracay ! <p> I was more than happy to give them a few dollars . I was most impressed with their entrepreneurial spirit , and it offered a lovely exchange for the girls with some local kids . It also gave them an insight into creation and innovation ! <p> See more in the video : <h> Stay at the Movenpick Resort Boracay <p> We have a separate review post coming on the Movenpick Resort Boracay . It 's possibly one of the best places we 've stayed , especially for families . <p> The service at the Movenpick Boracay was exceptional , there were plenty of facilities and activities , it 's brand new , and best of all , its on its private beach " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more stunning than White Beach . <p> The girls will argue that the pool was better " it 's the largest we 've ever seen . <p> There are amazing things for kids to do at the Movenpick Resort including free hair braiding , art and face painting around the pool . <p> Mocktail lessons and free chocolate hour every day . You might want to tell them about that one on your last day there else theyll never let you leave the resort . <p> By the grand opening in December , they will also have a hip and happening beach bar with live music . <p> If you 're looking for a Boracary resort for families , you cant go wrong with Movenpick Resort . <h> Getting wifi connection in The Philippines <p> Wifi is one of the most important features travellers look for now when making travel decisions .

Theyre free . <h> Romantic things to do in NYC <h> 1. - Steve Cohens Chamber Magic <p> Me and my boyfriend at Millionaire Magician one of the most romantic things to do in NYC <p> Without a doubt , one of the most unforgettable date nights in New York City is an evening with the Millionaires Magician . <p> The show takes place in a private suite in the Waldorf-Astoria and requires cocktail attire , but the absolute star of the show is the magic itself : you 'll leave in awe , and spend the rest of the evening wondering if magic is real ( and if it 's not , how exactly did he pull it off ? ) . <p> Pop into the bar of the Waldorf-Astoria after the show to discuss the tricks over a martini . <h> 2 . Dizzys Jazz Club <p> Dizzy 's Jazz Club features world-class jazz musicians with an epic view overlooking Central Park . There 's also a late-night session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes a dance floor ! ) and the cocktails taste just as good . <h> 3 . Sunset sail to the Statue of Liberty <p> a sunset sail overlooking Manhattan is one of the most romantic things to do in NYC <p> A sunset sail to the Statue of Liberty offers an incredible view of the skyscrapers , the sunset and the Statue of Liberty . Complete with cocktails , it 's one of the most romantic dates in the city . <h> 4 . Museum Hack <p> Museums can sometimes seem stale , but Museum Hack is a fun twist on the typical boring guided tour . They take you through the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Natural History Museum with the strangest , wildest and sexiest stories hidden in the exhibits . <p> I especially like the VIP tour of the Met : you 'll get to have the entire museum to yourself right before closing time . <h> 5 . Comedy Cellar <p> My boyfriend is a comedy nerd , and he introduced me to Comedy Cellar . You never know who exactly will perform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test out new material . <p> We 've seen stars like Louis CK , Chris Rock and Amy Schumer and the lead-up comedians are always just as solid . <p> Have a drink or dinner at Olive Tree Cafe upstairs , and keep your eyes open : comedians often hang out in the back in between their sets . <h> 6 . Nitehawk Cinema <p> Dinner and a movie is a standard date night around the world , but Nitehawk Cinema does it best : quirky classic cinema trailers , whiskey root beer floats and artisan mozzarella sticks served during the show and the best indie new releases . <h> Places to drink on a date in New York City <p> Going out for a drink is one of the most romantic things to do in NYC . Consider these establishments . <h> Bemelmans Bar <p> Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel is old-fashioned , upper-crust New York at its finest : proper classic cocktails , live piano music and sumptuous leather banquettes . <p> The walls are covered in playful murals by Ludwig Bemelman , author and illustrator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to NYC just for this reason ! ! awesome post and I will defiantly be taking up some of your ideas .

Sadly the cost of travel in Australia and the size of the country means it 's not a reality for most people . <p> We 're often asked a lot about how you can work and travel in Australia . <p> There is nothing we like more than to help people find ways to travel more without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings . It can be done by getting your hands dirty and in lots of fascinating ways . <p> Today , we 're sharing a list of work and travel possibilities and useful resources . This is work we 've done or witnessed others do on our 18-month lap around Australia . <h> 20 ways you can earn money on an Australia road trip <h> 1 . Freelance writing &amp; design <p> We met a couple of people who were freelance writers on our road trip around Australia . Some wrote for publications , others had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves ! <p> There 's nothing like writing a travel article from your beachfront camp chair . And it does n't  have to be " travel writing " , if you have other industry writing skills , or editing or design skills , seek those out ! <h> 2 . Be your own boss and take leave <p> She hired someone to take her place while she travelled around the country for a year and still had money flowing in . Such an inspiring story . She 's also just been nominated for Australian of the Year . Woop Woop ! <h> 3 . Mobile coffee seller <p> This one is great . It is a challenge to get decent coffee in certain regions of Australia and at popular festivals and events . Particularly at the top end of Australia and from the months of May Oct there are a lot of road trippers passing through craving a good cuppa . <p> We met a man who had an espresso machine in the back of his van and sold real coffees on the road ! So clever . Got dietary requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might be on a real winner . <h> 4 . Chef / cook <p> Another friend of ours Pete ( a chef ) who we met on our trip , stopped to work at various cattle stations on his trip around Australia , cooking for the station workers . They earned money , were given food and accommodation for free , and the chance to explore the region when not working . <p> A handy site Pete used to seek out these jobs was via the Ringers from the Top End Facebook group . Such a useful resource . <h> 5 . Governess <p> Petes wife Julie worked as a governess while he was cooking . Cattle stations are remote and huge in Australia . There are plenty of opportunities to pick up some casual or part-time work . <h> 6 . Mustering <p> Another option when travelling around Australia ( if you have the cowboy skills ) is to offer your mustering services . What an adventure to be a Jackeroo or Jillaroo ( that is male or female cowhand on horseback ) on cattle stations around Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we met a few months back , mustered on his road trip around Australia and loved it ! <h> 7 . Have your own travel TV show <p> Our friends , Jenn and Clint from the TV travel show , Places We Go , travelled around Australia for four months shooting footage for their TV series . <p> This one might be a difficult one for most people to achieve , but it all starts with a dream right ? And if you have previous video and TV production experience , the world is full of endless and surprising possibilities . <h> 8 . Hospitality <p> A certainty for when you work and travel Australia is to pick up hospitality work . This is often a favourite of backpackers on the Australian working holiday visa . Find the nearest cafe , pub , hostel , and offer your services for a wee while . <h> 9 . Whip cracking <p> We were thoroughly entertained one evening at our campsite in the Northern Territory by a travelling whip cracking champion . He travels the country putting on shows in campgrounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick could not resist buying one and would wake us up of a morning practising his whipping skills " only to end up with whipping elbow ! <p> ( What other unique skills and talents might you have that you can show off in campsites around Australia ? ) <h> 10 . Online business <p> An online business is the ultimate in flexibility and what we do . You do n't need a travel blog to make it work ( it 's actually a difficult way to make it work ) , but you do need good internet , not the pathetic internet we have , argh ! ! ! <p> My online naturopath friend Jess , is about to travel around the country taking her business ( she has online courses as well as Skype consultations ) she can take with her . <p> Our good friends Nick and Emma , The Blockshoppers , who we traveled with across Outback Queensland , the Northern Territory and Broome actually run The Block Shop online store ( yes the one connected to the TV Show ) while lapping around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Travelling musicians <p> Would there be anything better than travelling and being a musician ? If only I could sing ! We saw plenty of musicians playing in caravan parks , cafes , restaurants , bars and on the streets , earning a few dollars as they travelled the country . <h> 12 . Fruit picking <p> There are plenty of opportunities to pick up agricultural work when travelling around Australia . Fruit picking is popular for backpackers on an Australian working holiday wanting to fulfil their rural employment requirements to gain an extra year on their working holiday visas . <h> 13 . Photography services <p> A friend of ours , Greg Snell travelled half of the country , taking incredible photos and selling them to the tourism boards and travel companies to use for their marketing materials . If you 've got the skills think about all the businesses that might love your images . <p> Greg also won the Best Job in Australia for South Australia and had incredible travel experiences in the State . Greg is now travelling the world producing videos of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the amazing videos here . <h> 14 . School of the Air <p> We met a lady who continually lapped around Australia picking up jobs . One of those was to work in the School of the Air office in Alice Springs . Plenty of the teachers we met at the same School of the Air were passing through and decided to stay awhile to teach . <h> 15 . Provide educational services <p> Our friends , Israel and Belinda from- The Root Cause , just left on their Australia road trip in a big green bus " The Root Cause . They are planning on educating children around the country about the importance of diet and good lunchbox nutrition . How super cool is that ? <p> The Root Cause on the road <h> 16 . Landscaping and labouring <p> You can usually find work labouring or landscaping pretty easily in Australia . There are plenty of jobs around for those who are good with their hands and using their muscles . <h> 17 . Mining industry <p> Although , mining is on the decline and jobs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's one way you can pick up work around Australia that is paid well . There are plenty of mines in Australia with Western Australia reigning over the mining industry ! <h> 18 . Pearl farming <p> My least favourite adventure in Kuri Bay <p> Again , another industry on the- decline in Australia . It took a huge hit in the Global Financial Crisis . But , you still might get lucky . Back in 2003 we worked for 5 months on a pearl farm in Broome . It was an awesome experience , allowed us to explore the region and made fantastic money . Kuri Bay farm is no longer open . But we met plenty of transient workers when we visited Cygnet Bay pearl farm at Cape- Leveque in the Kimberley. <h> 19 . Tour guides and hosts <p> Of course , if you find a place you love and a great tour company , you can always see if you can become a tour guide or host . We met plenty of transient travellers doing that . Some stayed on more permanently , others moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks <p> We met a lot of people pausing their travels for awhile to help manage caravan parks . There 's an endless amount of jobs you can do : maintain the gardens and grounds , cleaning , office management , hosting entertainment and kids clubs , shuttle bus drivers . <h> How to find jobs on your Australian road trip <p> Be prepared with the right certification , visas , and tickets . Australia can be strict with having the right safety tickets for construction- and mining , and RSA for hospitality , and all sorts of things . <p> When you work and travel Australia , have an idea of the types of jobs you want to pick up and research what you might need for it . <h> Ask people in the area <p> Locals do n't only know the best things to see and do in an area , they can also let you know of any developments happening and work opportunities . Strike up the conversations and ask what they know . <p> Craig found his first construction job in the USA by chatting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend looking for workers and he started the next week . <h> Ask your accommodation <p> Accommodation providers are often looking for an extra pair of hands . We saw plenty of signs up on our travels around Australia . Ask and be careful to check the conditions . <p> It might be just for accommodation exchange , but if that suits then go for it . They might also be able to point you to the right job opportunities within the town . <h> Look at community notice boards and papers <p> There are plenty of them around in supermarkets , visitor centres and community gathering places . You might be surprised at what you might find . Of course , the papers will list many opportunities as well . <h> Look online <p> Gum Tree- is a popular classifieds website offering all things for sale , plus jobs and services for hire . Similar to Craigslist in the States . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> This is nice post ! I liked it very much .

We are packing up our things into storage and setting out not even knowing when and where we will stop and where we will find our next family home . In the meantime home is where the tent is . And somehow this seems like a very satisfying and homely idea . <p> By the way you made it onto our top family travel blog list . Not a huge boon for your already successful blog I grant but appreciate your work and perhaps working with you down the rambling road somewhere . 
@@21820511 @1820511/ <h> Best Hong Kong accommodation options from budget to luxury ! <p> Need advice on where to stay in Hong Kong ? I 've created a short list of the best Hong Kong accommodation options for 3 , 4 , and 5-star- hotels , plus apartments and hostels . <p> There are literally hundreds of places to stay in Hong Kong and to save you some time , and hopefully- some money , Ive done the research for you and narrowed down your choices to a few select properties . <p> If you are planning to visit Hong Kong for the first time , I 've focused the location of the properties within Hong Kong Island or Kowloon Peninsula so you have relatively easy access to most of Hong Kongs attractions , shopping , dining and market areas and its excellent MTR subway system for getting around . <p> Kowloon is connected to the mainland and typically has better options for budget accommodation , whilst Hong Kong Island is on the south side of Victoria Harbour and is the location of the iconic Hong Kong skyline . <p> Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> MTR system map <p> Keep in mind that Hong Kong is short on land mass and everything is built upwards , meaning hotels in Hong Kong can have smaller rooms than you 're used to and prices a little higher than other Asian cities , especially if you visit in peak season or over a Hong Kong holiday . <p> For my list of the best Hong Kong accommodation options , each property had to meet a specific criteria and for my research I used the Booking.com website . <h> Why book your Hong Kong accommodation with Booking.com ? <p> I like that you can book a variety of accommodation types on the one website hotels , apartments , hostels , even vacation homes and- I love how simple their website is to use ! <p> Booking.com is- the world leader in booking accommodation online and- has over 800,000 properties worldwide , and over 500 in HK . There 's a lot of competition on Booking.com which creates lower prices so hopefully you can find a deal ! <p> You get free cancellation on most rooms and a best price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have actually stayed at the property ! <p> We are partners with Booking.com , which means well receive a small affiliate commission if you choose to book through the links on our site . We book our own accommodation through them , which is why we recommend them as our preferred accommodation provider . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Great to see the recommendations for Hong Kong . Have you considered Yesinn Causeway Bay as well ? I travel to Hong Kong almost every month and when travelling alone I like to stay in that hostel . This hostel is my personal favorite as it is close to the MTR , clean , it has free wifi &amp; computers , the bunkbeds are tailor made to accomodate tall people , they have a rooftop terrace , it is not a party hostel and they have a free massage chair . The hostel has dorms &amp; private rooms . Yesinn is actually a chain and the other properties also offer family rooms , serviced apartments and office spaces . <p> Hey Ilona , thanks for suggesting that Hong Kong accommodation option . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of benefits . I like the sound of it not being a party hostel , those days are unofficially over for us =

Its insane ! ! <p> Especially considering photography learning and implementing it is not cheap . This is crazy good and what I love the most from a lot of the courses Ive taken so far , is that the instructors take you behind the scenes . <p> Its one thing to learn all the tips and tricks from these pros , but to actually see how they pull it all together in real life , is so helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate about the same thing coming together to equip , empower and educate a new generation of aspiring photographers and helping them pursue their dreams . <p> By joining forces and doing it together , they can help so much more people than they could on their own ! <p> Im stoked to be learning from them and to be able to share it with all of you ! <h> 3 resources to help you improve your photography ( and make money from your photos ) <h> 1 . Learn how to master your camera and take photos out of auto <h> Master Your DSLR by David Molnar ( $297.00 ) Featured eCourse <p> If you want to take amazing pictures ( especially ones to sell ) getting out of auto is essential . It can be super confusing trying to learn about aperture , shutter speed , ISO , focal points lenses etc . <p> You do n't  want to invest all that money into good camera gear , only to remain in auto mode and clueless as to how to use your camera . <p> Auto can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional and celebrity photographer . David Molnar . He breaks down concepts so simply your brain will connect the dots and know how to do it in real life . <p> I love that it 's a video course format because you can see what he 's doing as he explains and he takes you out onto the field so you can see how he thinks on a photo shoot and puts it all together . <p> I like David 's teaching style too . He 's likable and engaging and it does matter . <h> 2 . Learn how to organize and edit your photos like a pro and save time <p> Another course you can more than make your money back with is the Master Editing in Lightroom eCourse by David Molnar . <p> We 've used Lightroom for some time without even knowing how to use it . We did n't  have time to search for free training or go through the Adobe training on how to use Lightroom . Tried that and could n't relate to their instructional choice of language " Right Over Your Head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizational systems set up . <p> In this course , he shows you his system for organizing , importing , culling and editing his photos in easy to understand language and instructional videos . <p> I 'm elated I did this course before embarking on our America Unplugged Adventure . All the photos from our Australian travel for the past three years is one chaotic mess . All because we did n't  know how to organize , use a system , nor how to use Lightroom . <p> Now I know a lot of Lightroom tips and tricks , which will help us be way more efficient with our time and travel photography editing . <p> That , in turn , will only enhance our ability to produce and make more money ? <p> I was more excited by this training than anything else in the bundle . <p> Plus , David also gives you access to some of his presets , which help me edit photos in minutes . <h> 3 .

I know many of you have told me over email that growing a photography business is something you want to do , but feel clueless about . <p> If you have the photography skills already , you 'll want to- dive straight into this course . <p> Creating and growing a business is not easy , with this course you learn from photographers who have done it . Theyll teach you the system. - Learn and replicate . <p> 6 weeks to 6 figures may seem a little undo-able , but I think anything is possible once you learn how from those who have done it . Whether you do it in six weeks or six months , is not the issue . <p> What is , is that you are empowered to follow your photography dreams and make them happen . Whether its related to travel photography , family photography , wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> This course will teach you how to create the foundations for business , how to brand yourself , how to generate leads and price your services , and offers tips on how to grow your business . <p> Their pricing structures have opened my eyes up to how we can increase our offering .

I 'm still pulling out courses and ebooks from them as the need for them arises . Instead of searching online for particular courses related to that skill , and spending even more money , I just pull it from my library of resources . <p> I 've made one small investment , to have access to- learning for life , saving thousands of dollars and oodles of time . <p> I love presets !

But.full time travel , kids to educate , blogging.no time ! <p> I took an online course a year ago on Photography it was really in depth but I cant remember who the training provider was ! It was certainly useful to do the course , at the time I knew what a few of the settings on my camera did but I did n't  actually know what they meant , the proper names etc . I 'd recommend a short course to anyone looking to improve their skills in this area . <p> Also I love Canva too its one of the best online applications in the last few years ! I cant get enough of Canva = I use that in combination with another site called Pixlr and of course Lightroom so barely have any reason to open up Photoshop anymore . <p> Sounds good Tamsin . Always learning something from each short course or tutorial . Have only ever used Lightroom , not photoshop , and we use Canva a lot too for featured images within blog posts that we share to Pinterest.

They 're selling it for a crazy 98% off of regular price ! <p> I know , it sounds too good to be true , but I promise it 's not . Ultimate Bundles has been around a long time and creating these packages is really their thing ( they 've sold over 180,000 of them on all sorts of topics ) , so you can trust this is the real deal . <p> Even better , they 're all about making sure you LOVE this toolkit . There 's a full 30-day happiness guarantee , so there 's really no risk in trying it out . <p> The most important detail , though , is that this toolkit is available for seven days only . On- Tuesday night , Tuesday , April 4 @ 11:59 p.m . EST , the sale ends and you 'd have to buy all of these products individually . <p> I 'd hate for you to miss out , so click the button to learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You know I 'm a partner of the bundle , which means I receive a commission , at no extra cost to you , if you purchase the Genius Blogger 's Toolkit via my link . My way of saying thanks , and to make the bundle even more valuable to you , is to offer you inclusion into my blogging Facebook group . <p> It 's a place for you to share , ask questions , get the help you need from me and the others in the group . Craig and myself- regularly answer your questions , provide feedback and share useful tips and resources . <h> Training I loved in the Genius Blogger 's Toolkit <p> As mentioned with the Start Up Bundle , there is a huge amount of resources you get access to for life . It can be a bit overwhelming knowing where to start . <p> The Ultimate Bundle Crew have created a Genius Blogging Essentials eCourseto go with the toolkit with short video lessons to help you evaluate and prioritize so you can work through the bundle systematically and use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blog first . <p> You may only have one or two areas of your blogging that you wish to grow and improve on . That 's what I love about this bundle , it covers everything , you only have to do one or two of the courses to get your moneys worth . <p> That way , in the future , if you get stuck in another aspect of your blogging business , you wont have to purchase another course , you can just tap right back into the Genius Blogging Toolkit . <p> Here are the courses I 've done so far targeting the areas I most want growth in . <h> Sticky Blogging SEO : Climb to the Top With This 21-Day Course by Kelly Holmes ( $99 ) <p> SEO is hugely important , but also confusing . I 've done a lot of training on it before , but none has been as simple and as easy to follow as what is presented in this course . Kelly lays out a strategy for you . All you do is follow the step by step processes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implement immediately . <p> Shes written it in a way that is so clear and easy to understand . I highly rate this course . <p> SEO is so important for us . We receive 180,000 + visitors a month and a steady stream of passive income because of it . Its how my business has managed to keep running for me despite not being able to produce much content during the past five months . <h> Asana for Bloggers by Matthew Giovanisci ( $25 ) <p> This has to be one of my favourite courses of the past year . I do n't  have strong organizational skills . To leverage your business and growth ( something I talk about in my premium blogging training you get in this bundle ) you need to have a system and be organized . <p> Asana is a free productivity tool to help you do that . I 've never known how to use it until this course . It has changed everything for me , even my personal life . <p> Now instead of having ideas and resources scribbled on bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to implement . <p> My to-do list is no longer overwhelming my brain , it is being done . My inbox is clean because project communication with my team is now done via Asana . <p> I 'm not a beginner user for Instagram , yet I ca n't get the platform to work for us so I 'm obviously missing a few things . The week before I knew what was in this pack , I purchased an Instagram course for $137 . It was great and I learned some useful tips and strategy . <p> Although , one of their main strategies to grow your following was by following/unfollowing people in mass numbers . It 's totally not my style , so I was disappointed to find that was the only strategy they had for growing your account . <p> Instavaluable , on the other hand , is cheaper and has that authentic integrity of building an Instagram account with purpose and the intention to give something back . <p> It encouraged me to start up my own Instagram account again so I can share a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into my travel Instagram account . The course helped me to get clear on what I wanted that to look like . <h> Pinaffiliate Masterclass by Adeline Ganley- ( $97.00 ) <p> Pinterest is our biggest and favourite platform , but we still do n't know everything about it . We had enormous growth which we did n't know what to do with and so have barely tapped into its potential . <p> I 'm only a couple of modules into this course and have already applied a few little tweaks mostly with setting up my boards and descriptions . <p> I like how each video has a clear actionable task , which I do straight away . We 're putting a lot of effort into affiliate marketing so I 'm super keen to learn more about how I can make it work through the powerful Pinterest platform . <h> Strategies Worth Sharing eBook &amp; Workbook by Brittany Ann ( $30.00 ) <p> Sadly , I had purchased this eBook only a couple of weeks before I received the Genius blogging toolkit . Bummer ! It 's a valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how Brittany was actually able to grow her Facebook account and continue to maintain a sense of community . Facebook has tanked for us recently and not even worth my time . <p> We had such a vibrant community , which has been lost with Facebook 's algorithm change and emphasis on now trying to force people to pay to be seen . <p> This eBook offers many good tips and a firm foundation for community building . I knew most of them , but for beginners , its superb training . I did pick up a few little things I can use to tweak and it was a great refresher for me to get back to what works . I 'm applying some of the strategies and seeing improvements already . <p> There is an amazing tip here for growing your community which works really well for me " definitely worth the inclusion in the Genius Blogger 's Toolkit to learn it ! <h> 17 Strategies I Used to Go from 17K to 350K+ Page views in 9 Months by Lena Gott ( $25.00 ) <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase your page views and grow your platform . These strategies are based on an actual case study from a blogger who implemented each one and tracked results . It 's easy to read and follow and anyone can apply the strategies . <p> As an experienced blogger , I can tell you these strategies work and are what we do ourselves . Start with this ebook when you purchase the toolkit , so you can get it right from the beginning . Do n't worry if you are an advanced blogger , you will still pick up a few things . <p> I 'm extra motivated now to refine my strategies and apply a few new things . The Google+ tip was excellent and I have noticed results from this myself , without even consciously applying the strategy . I 'm now making it a standard procedure for us . <p> So you can see with those 6 incredible courses alone you get a $373 value for only $97 . You cant lose with this investment . As a savvy blogger , its an ROI to LOVE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incredible ( and brilliant ) bonus offers from blogging companies , like Board Booster , ViralTag , The Hungry JPEG , and Convertkit .

@@21820520 @1820520/ <p> Now that I understand the benefits they offer , and the small cost to use it , I wo n't be traveling , or using unsecured Wi-Fi , without one again . <p> Note to self Caroline : You went to the local cafe yesterday and forgot to use your VPN . It does n't just apply to the travel road ! <h> What is a VPN ? <p> A Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) is a network technology that creates a secure network connection over a public network such as the Internet or a private network owned by a service provider . <p> To access the private network , you connect to the server with a unique personal I 'd and password <p> When you connect to a VPN , you launch a VPN client on your computer ( or click a link on a special website ) , log in with your credentials , and your computer exchanges trusted keys with a remote server . <p> Once both computers have verified each other 's identity , all of your internet communication is encrypted and secured from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easy to use and keeps you secure . <h> Why use a VPN when you travel <p> Protect your online activities when you are using public Wi-Fi . For example , if you are shopping online or doing online banking , you are vulnerable to hacking attacks , even by a hacker or software . <p> Access banned sites : Many countries ban access to certain sites , like Facebook in China . If you use a VPN you can connect to this . You can choose to connect to a VPN network from multiple countries . So connect to a VPN via Australia when you 're in China and you get Facebook access . <p> With a VPN , you can access most streaming services that have local restrictions just as if you were in your home country . You can also connect to live streaming from other countries . For example , with our VPN service provider , we connected to the US Netflix the other night and had access to different movies than what is in our Australian account . Did you know US Netflix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VPN providers that get this Netflix access anymore . NordVPN , is our provider and one of the only ones that still can ! <p> Save money on flights . We 've written a post on this trick before . If you can make it appear like you are accessing a flight booking website from another country , you may be able to buy flight tickets at a much lower price . That alone makes the small cost of a VPN worth it. - Experiment by switching between different countries with a VPN to find the- lowest airfare . <h> What to look for in a VPN <p> Ensure that the VPN provider you 've chosen is open and honest about its traffic and security policies . <p> Find a VPN service with accessible documents that detail how your data is handled from point to point . <p> Make sure that the VPN provider you sign with wo n't cap the bandwidth or the quantity of the data going through the tunnel . Sign up to a plan that does n't limit your traffic or cap you based on certain download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VPN , only to have it cut you off halfway through the month ? <p> Keep an eye out for a VPN provider that will give you mobile options as well as desktop support . The internet goes everywhere with you on your smartphone , so your VPN should be able to as well . <p> Easy to use and install and look for a VPN provider that gives you instructions on how to do this and use the VPN service <p> Fast and reliable speeds . A VPN will slow down your internet connection as it is passing through a server rather than direct . But , find a provider that can give you the best possible speeds . Test it with their trial versions first . <p> One that works in multiple countries . China probably has the strictest rules so if a VPN service works there you will most likely be covered in a lot of countries . <p> Can connect multiple devices . We rarely travel with only one device anymore . Geez ! Remember when we travelled with none ! ! <h> NordVPN " our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from . Do your due diligence and find one that suits your needs . I have not tried multiple VPN service providers so can not tell you what the best VPN service is . <p> I did some research , tested NordVPN and liked them . I 'm not great at shopping around - I bought the first wedding dress I saw and the only one I tried on . if you find something that works , why bother wasting your time trying to validate or verify your gut decision ? <p> I used NordVPN recently for my trip to Downtown LA for the BlogHer conference . I used it as soon as I arrived at LAX because I had to top up my AT&amp;T phone account so I could text my friend and order an Uber . <p> I went to do it using the free LAX Wi-Fi . It would n't let me top up my account because it was an unsecured connection , which reminded me to use my VPN . I manage to connect straight away , top up my account and wipe the sweat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secure . <p> Accessing NordVPN is a simple as installing a software on your computer and the clicking the connect button when you want to use the VPN . Sometimes I do n't get connected straight away . I have to try a few different servers first , which can be annoying. - Once I do get connected the speed , so far , has been fast and secure . Weve been able to watch Netflix on it without any interruptions , so speed has been good . <p> I love the cool way the NordVPN interface helps you choose the right connection for you . Select what your main aim is for when using the VPN for your session and it will show you which country the best servers are to fulfil that purpose . <p> You can also choose your server based on the map or a list of servers . <p> Internet security and VPNs are n't  really a sexy topic so all I can say is it does its job of keeping me securely connected to the internet and allowing me to continue my current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts about NordVPN and their VPN service <p> NordVPN has been in business since 2012 and is registered in the Republic of Panama . This is useful for VPN purposes as the country does not include legislation to spy on internet users through enforcing communications providers to maintain logs of their customers ' internet use . <p> NordVPN is a free download with a subscription . Pricing is very flexible , with three tiers : $8 per month , $42 every six months , or $69 annually . NordVPN does offer a 30-day money back guarantee , but it applies only if the NordVPN service does n't  work . <p> NordVPN let 's you select one of the companys 80 VPN servers located in 27 countries . NordVPN let 's you select the type of connection and server location . Connections are grouped by type , including ultrafast servers for streaming video along with DoubleVPN and Tor-over-VPN servers to better protect your privacy . There are FAQs and tutorials to help you understand what they all mean . I still do n't  get it . I just choose the fast one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect which ones are for Netflix ! ! ! <p> NordVPN also provides a Kill Switch feature . When configured , this monitors applications and processes you select . If your VPN connection is interrupted or dropped for any reason , those processes on the Kill Switch list are automatically closed . This is great , as it ensures that no unsecured data sneaks out . <p> NordVPN also allows unmetered access for up to six devices , so you can keep all your devices secure at the same time . <p> As mentioned , NordVPN is one of the few that can get you access to Netflix in other countries . <p> VPNs are becoming the future in the world of tightening online security , and soon using a VPN will be as common as going online . They 're now- a part of my digital toolkit its cheap , effortless and gives me a lot back in return security , safety , access to variety , and freedom to move around geographical restrictions ! <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> I do n't  know of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good free VPNs would be . I 'm guessing you would n't get as many features and possibly it would n't be as safe or secure . I often find free usually gives a reciprocal return in value . <p> I have recently found out how important to be safe on internet when surfing . If only I realized it before my laptop got infected and my website is hacked . So now I am extremely careful about these things . These additional tips highly appreciated . Thank you Caz.

A slow , steady , unsurprising season that assists the process of change . <p> Why then do Australians spend so much time trying to avoid this necessary and promising season ? <p> Data from Cheapflights.com.au shows that Aussies look to escape the winter chill by jetting to the Northern Hemisphere . <p> There 's a small problem with that at the moment- " a weak Aussie dollar ripping a hole in your travel wallet . <p> Domestic travel has never looked better . <p> This winter , pull out the UGG boots , crackle the fire , pour yourself a glass of red wine and do something different enjoy an Australian winter getaway . <p> Guess what though Australia ? We have to be the luckiest country in the world . There 's only half of the country that experiences the cold snap , the entire Top End of the country is warm and dry , offering you that desired winter escape . <p> But first , <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ski fields , NSW &amp; Victoria <p> If you 're contemplating a ski holiday in Australia , you wont ' have too much decision angst over where to go . You 've got two choices : the Snowy Mountains in NSW or the Victorian Alps in Victoria . <p> Each year , the debate rages as to whether NSW or Victoria has the better snow . Do n't  waste your time wondering , or caring , just hit the closet snowy slope you can and enjoy it . <p> Falls Creek in Victoria has some of Australias steepest expert terrain ; Mt Buffalo as some great snowshoeing , cross-country and gentle downhill skiing ; Mt Buller has fun toboggan runs ; and Mt Hotham is considered the powder capital of Australia . <p> The Snowy Mountains are the highest Australian mountain range and contain Australia 's highest mountain , Mount Kosciuszko . <p> Thredbo is possibly the most well-known and loved alpine village with plenty of runs for all skiers ; Perisher is one of the most bustling ski resorts in the Snowy Mountains with four main skiing parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caters to all abilities , and Selwyn Snowfields are great for families . <h> 2 . Bunya Mountains , Queensland <p> I bet you never expected a Queensland destination to make this cold winter holiday in Australia list . The Bunya Mountains has enough freeze to snap a twig or two , and on rare occasions , welcomes in a little snowfall . <p> Settle into your chalet surrounded by curious wallabies and ancient bunya pines , recognisable by their- rounded tops- and large pineapple-shaped cones with 50-100 edible nuts . The cafe amongst the chalets makes a delicious carrot and bunya nut cake which you can enjoy by the fire at night with a glass of red wine . <p> Bunya Mountains National Park is situated between Kingaroy and Dalby and is a spectacular wilderness range overlooking the South Burnett region . You can even pop down into the valley for a bit of wine tasting ! <h> 3 . Blue Mountains , NSW <p> The Blue Mountains reminds me of the Grand Canyon , one is covered with a lush forest , while the other , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places willing to share their secrets if you just take the time to sit and absorb . <p> To understand its soul you have to go down . <p> The Blue Mountains has a depth greater than the sandstone escarpments and- infamous Three Sisters . We snapped our I was here photo and then went down , 900 steps into the valley below into a forested fern bower . <p> We explored an emerald wonderland that belonged to us and the ancient trees . Towering sassafras and coachwood trees blocked off the sunlight , and the ferns stretched across the forest floor . They whispered their stories , and we heard every enchanting word . <p> There 's no rush to get out early to beat the summer heat . You can linger your early morning gaze over the rainforest covered valleys and hit the trails later in the day . The crisp , - cool mountain air perfect for hiking. - It 's also possible you may get a slight dusting of snow . <p> The Blue Mountains offers- relaxation , adventure and rejuvenation , unbelievably good local produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining . <h> 4 . Barossa Valley , South Australia <p> The Barossa is known for their shiraz and what goes better with that then a chill to the air , local artisan cheese , and a roaring fire ? <p> There are n't as many people around and its a great time to admire the vines , meet the winemakers , snap up some bargains and be among the first taste some brand new releases . <p> Pindarie and Kellermeister are the wineries to watch the weather roll across the valley with a bottle of vino and a cheese platter . Pindarie is a working farm so offers kids plenty of space to explore and scramble over haystacks . <p> Yelland and Pappas tasting room , with their Chesterfields and open fire , will make you feel like sitting in the warm , cosy home of the winemakers , Susan and Michael . <p> Ever wondered what your birth year tasted like ? A trip to Seppeltsfield will give you an insight . You can taste it through a vintage year Tawny Port . Or perhaps , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be responsible for getting around , or finding the best spots in the Barossa , jump aboard the Hop On &amp; Hop Off bus " Barossa Explorer . This 20 seater coach that picks up and drops off around the Barossa at stops including the Barossa Valley Brewery , Langmeil Winery , Maggie Beers Farm Shop and Chateau Tanunda. <h> 5 . Hike the- Overland Trek in Tasmania <p> I love the idea of this adventure , but not sure I could follow through with it . <p> However , if you are daring , fit , and ready to embrace a winter challenge , completing the Overland Track in the Tasmania Wilderness World Heritage Area- may be for you . <p> During winter the high peaks along the Overland Track receive a generous dusting of snow , turning the Cradle Mountain National Park into a winter wonderland . <p> Highlights of walking the Overland Track in winter include fewer people , crisp winter air , frozen lakes and frequent snowfalls , which change the vistas of the surrounding landscapes. - Walkers will also often meet wombats , echidnas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw so many wild Australian animals just walking around Dove Lake at Cradle Mountain . <h> Best winter " sun " holiday destinations in Australia <p> Tired of frost on the car window and being wrapped up in a scarf and beanie ? Okay , so you 're determined to beat the winter chill , even though it 's a season worth celebrating . <p> You can still get the warmth you seek while technically still travelling in Australia during the winter ! <p> Winter is the time to explore the Australian top end. - The rainy and cyclonic season is over ; the warm sticky heat has gone , the stingers have disappeared , and you can enjoy swimming in the ocean . ( Perhaps . Be croc aware ! Some places are no swimming zones ) <p> Here are a few sun holiday destinations for your winter getaway <h> 6 . Broome , Western Australia <p> The best place in Australia for a warm winter holiday , in our opinion , is Broome . <p> Y'all know how much we love the vibe of this Outback coastal town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter getaway , but that is part of its small-town , slow-paced charm . <p> Broome Town is an eclectic pot of grunge and bohemian with an edge of posh creeping in . You 'll find great shopping , cafes and restaurants , and the nightlife , which was much wilder when Broome was mostly a pearling town . <p> From sunrise to sunset there is so much to love about a day on Cable Beach . Consistently ranked as one of Australia 's best , it 's 22km wide , flat sweeping beach is perfect for beach cricket , polo , long walks , meditation , building sandcastles , and just chillaxing . It 's also the spot for 5 pm sunset drinks . <h> 7 . Darwin and surrounds <p> Darwin is eclectic , tropical , laid back and is a hot destination to visit- " literally and- figuratively . With a dry-season average temperature of 30C travellers are flying there by the plane full ! <p> There are thriving markets , a rich multicultural and indigenous vibe , an emerging food and bar scene , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying it with a beer and your bare feet at the Darwin Ski Club . <h> 8 . Hervey Bay and Fraser Island <p> This region is one of the best places on the East Coast of Australia to see whales who love to visit during the winter . Humpbacks swim into Hervey Bay for a relaxing time in the calm waters with their babies before making their way back south . <p> You can join a whale cruise from Hervey Bay , but do n't be surprised to see many breaching whales just offshore from 75 Mile Beach on Fraser Island . <p> With more than 100 freshwater lakes , ancient rainforests , and long white beaches , Fraser enjoys daytime winter temperatures around the pleasant mid-20s. - It still can get cold so pack your beanie and scarf . <p> While Fraser Island is well known as one of the best places in the country for hard-core four-wheel driving enthusiasts , it offers so much more , for kids , for families , for everyone . <p> A short walk through Mossman Gorge takes you to the Mossman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to be the second purest in the world . <p> Stand up Paddle Boarding is great to do on the Mossman River and we highly recommend that you take one of the Ngadiku Dreamtime walks into a private section of the forest to learn about Aboriginal customs , the food and medicinal properties of the plants , and to hear a few Dreamtime stories . <p> In the Daintree , explore the beaches , sample exotic Daintree ice cream , and adventure out with jungle zip lining , kayaking , or beach horse riding . A trip to the Daintree Discovery Centre will guide you through the rainforest to learn about its twisting vines , strangler figs , epiphytes and cycad trees that date back to prehistoric times . <p> Do n't ignore the Daintree Valley either ! <h> 10 . Uluru <p> We visited Uluru during the summer and experienced intense heat and absurd flies . If you visit Uluru in the winter , you 'll escape that horror . <p> When you visit Uluru in the winter , you experience a warm and cold getaway all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and perhaps ditch the tent for a cosy apartment or hotel room , - but the days will be warm and dry . <p> Uluru in the winter has the perfect temperature to walk or bike around the base of the rock which is the best way to appreciate its spiritual essence . <p> The hikes through Kata Tjuta are more intense , so you 'll be grateful for those cooler temperatures . <p> For those travelling with kids , the sun sets earlier and rises later which means happier , well-rested children and a better experience . <p> Stay awhile so you can appreciate Uluru during sunrise and sunset from many different vantage points . <h> Want to save money on your winter holiday ? <p> Here are a few tips from Cheapflights.com.au to get the best flight deals for your winter holiday destination . <p> Delete your browser history : prices can increase based on the number of times you re-enter a particular website . <p> Avoid booking late : generally , 50 days ahead of departure will get you the best price with airfares are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book on a Tuesday : Cheapflights data shows this is the cheapest day of the week to lock-in holiday plans . <p> Do n't fly on a Friday : it 's consistently the most expensive day to fly . <p> Travel between 6 pm and midnight : flights are typically cheaper than early in the morning <p> Do n't sleep over : - Save on accommodation by travelling at night !

For example , an Art museum probably is n't the right place for us to be at this point . . . <h> What do you love most about travelling with your kids ? <p> I love seeing and experiencing new things together as a family .

Spend hours swimming together in the pool or at the beach . Do n't worry there will still be time to do some activities . Some of the best moments are on the unscheduled and unplanned time you have together as a family . <h> What are your biggest fears with travelling with kids and how do you overcome them ? <p> Since we travel full time , I want to make sure our kids do n't get jaded !

Oh , and are there plenty of places to stay with your rv ? <p> Love this interview ! With 4 kids and dogs in an RV We live in an RV with only 2 kids , and they do n't  take many space ( yet ) as they are 2,5yo and 7mo .

Thanks for sharing ! Love it ! <p> 8,000 islands . Wow , I had no idea Australia had that many ! Rottnest Island looks particularly dreamy , and I love the fact that there are no cars on it . It reminds me of Gili islands in Indonesia , its so laid-back . <p> We have enjoyed our visits to most of these islands listed above . We recently had a short break on Dangar Island , a ferry ride from Brooklyn just 40 mins north of Sydney . We felt like we were in the middle of nowhere and it was totally peaceful and relaxing ! Its a private hidden gem if you need a weekend away that wont take up too much travel time . 
@@21820536 @1820536/ <h> Getting settled in the USA + where to next <p> The girls were very excited on the plane and could n't help but list all the things they wanted to do . <p> First to go to Raleigh to see where Kalyra spent two years of her life . And of course Harry Potter World . ( Its on the list , Kalyra ! ) <p> We have a ton of content to come on our time in Hawaii , so be patient while we get it all written ! Its been a crazy few weeks getting settled into our new US life . <p> We flew as guests of Hawaiian airlines into LA , which was a great way to transition from that Aloha spirit into LA . I loved how we had already cleared immigration in Hawaii so breezed through customs in LA for the first time ever . <p> Hawaiian airlines are definitely my favorite US airline . <h> Brief stay in Manhattan Beach <p> Before heading to Raleigh , we stayed for two nights in LA . Even though the flight from Honolulu was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg to get to the East Coast can be a killer when combined with other flights . <p> When we go to LA , we prefer hanging near the South Bay Beaches so the hotels near LAX work well , especially if our LA stopover is brief . You do n't have to mess around with LA traffic too much and the hotel had a shuttle to the airport which was good . <p> We have stayed at the Westin LAX before and loved it . They had great airport views , a shuttle to the hotel , and a free shuttle to Manhattan Beach which we loved . <p> We popped down to Manhattan Beach for the day so we could catch up with our friends Johnny and Natalie Discala and meet their gorgeous new baby Jack . <p> We had a delicious lunch at the groovy Lemonade " cheap and healthy meals and I had one of the most delicious smoothies ever at SunLife Organics . Be sure to order the Wolverine if you visit . <p> We then watched Johnny play a bit of beach volleyball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach . Everyone is so outdoorsy and I love the volleyball beach culture. - It is known as the beach volleyball capital of the world <h> Raleigh-Durham <p> We 've had a wonderful time in the Raleigh-Durham region while we get our lives set up in the US . We never expected anything different . <p> Coming here first has made getting set up so much easier as we are familiar with the area , we have friends and contacts , and the semi-remains left of our previous life here . That is bank accounts , addresses , social security numbers , and old driver 's licenses . <p> Raleigh-Durham region has to be one of the friendliest we 've ever encountered . It 's incredible how many people stop to talk to us . This is just not people curious because of our accent , but people who chat away without even hearing you speak first . <p> I 've had so many people yell out to let me know my dress is pretty , or pay some nice compliment . Its like everyone is on a mission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in growth since we last lived here . We loved it before , but even more now . The food and craft beer scene has taken off and we are loving the options . It 's an incredible place to live especially for young families and millennials . <p> We 've spent our time here getting settled and catching up with our old friends . - The girls are making new friends and Kalyra even went to gymnastics class with her friend and is now hooked . Both girls are booking lessons in for when we settle and get a house ! ! <p> We had a fun evening at the Durham Bulls game . As our friend , Gary Arndt said , " you 've done the iconic American thing now ! " <p> Apart from doing a lot of eating and drinking , and a little exploring , we have been getting settled with the following : <h> Getting set up with phones <p> Unlimited data ! ! Thank you , America . <p> We decided to get phone plans with Verizon Wireless . Many people recommended T-Mobile as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best for Americans traveling overseas . If you plan to travel domestically , they are not a great option as their coverage is not as good . <p> We have two new Samsung Galaxy 8- phone on the plan , which we love ! The camera on the S8 amazing and I love the infinity screen . <p> The data is unlimited . In reality , they say 10GB , but as was explained to us , it only kicks in if you are trying to access a busy tower and have already consumed a lot of data that day , then they 'll slow you down . Our customer service agent told us he has gone up to 60GB and been near a busy tower and has not been slowed down yet . <p> We also purchased a mobile hotspot with unlimited data on it , just so we are n't tethering the computers to our phones all the time , which can put a serious strain on the battery within your camera . <p> So for the two phones , and hotspot and unlimited data we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its going okay , although the speed has been a little disappointing . The only issue seems to be when it comes to using Instagram , which could be a problem with their platform . <p> I LOVE the freedom of accessing anything on my phone and doing all necessary tasks and not having to worry about exorbitant fees . <h> Getting our NC Drivers license <p> Lucky for Craig , his old North Carolina driver 's license had only expired last year . He could easily renew his license with a simple eye test . <p> Mine expired in 2010 , which meant I had to resit the driving test " written and practical . I spent several days reading the North Carolina drivers license handbook and taking practice tests . <p> I nailed it . It was easy and my road test was a simple drive around the block . This time I was very conscious to stop completely at the stop sign . I did n't do that in 2004 and nearly failed . It 's because there so many stop signs in the US where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suburban neighborhood where there is no traffic at all . <p> It was easy and my road test was a simple drive around the block . This time I was very conscious to stop completely at the stop sign . I did n't do that in 2004 and nearly failed . It 's because there so many stop signs in the US where a yield sign would typically be in Australia " like in a suburban neighborhood where there is no traffic at all . <h> Here 's a tip <p> The DMV in Raleigh and Durham was packed " at least an hour wait just to take the written test . Plus , doing the test there would have meant I was driving around the city streets . <p> Our friend , Rina , suggested I go out to Hillsborough , a small country town 15-minute drive away . There were no queues and my test was on rural roads . The whole experience only took about 30 minutes . Head to the rural DMV 's to get your licenses ! <h> The importance of a good credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US . It 's the difference between a low and high-interest rate on a loan , or even whether you can get a loan . <p> When we first lived in the US in 2004 , not having credit history made it almost impossible to do anything . We had to put $800 bond down just to get a crappy Nokia phone . <p> We could not believe it when we checked our credit scores using Credit Karma and mine came back in as 727 . That is considered a high credit score . Craig 's was even higher . The Universe was looking out for us ! That 's one reason we got our phone plans so easily this time with no bond requested . <p> The Universe was looking out for us ! That 's one reason we got our phone plans so easily this time with no bond requested . <h> Bank accounts <p> Thankfully , we had kept our bank account open with the North Carolina State Employees Credit Union . We 've been able to use that again and the credit union are great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank and they offer great terms and interest loan rates . <p> We like building a long-term relationship with them . It counts . <p> We have heard that Wells Fargo is a good bank to get set up with when first relocating to the US , especially if you do n't  have social security numbers . <h> Buying a car on auto financing <p> There was no way I wanted to buy a car using Australian cash . It would have wiped away most of our savings with epic currency loss . <p> Plus , we wanted a decent car that would last a long time and cover our road trip needs . We did n't have the spare cash funds for that . <p> So we decided to get auto financing . The interest rates are so good , and length of loans flexible , that you do n't end up paying too much interest . We would have lost waaaay more in currency conversion . <p> The tricky part " auto financing . We had a problem . Our business is run by an Australian company " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only look at US companies . We 're not on salary so our personal income could n't be verified . And because our visa is only three years , our credit union said they could only give a three-year loan . <p> Even though I had a high credit score , the foreclosure was still on my account , so the bank wanted to verify income , but they could n't verify our income as they do n't look at Australian taxes . They recommended we try a national bank or even a car dealer . <p> We looked at a couple of car dealers and learned that their auto financing had good interest loans and this time we just put Craig forth as the loan holder . They told us since his credit score was so high they did n't even need to verify income AND they would n't even ask about the visa terms . That 's how important a good credit score is . <p> We were stoked . <p> We originally found a Ford Expedition , which was everything we wanted . It was 4WD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to tow something . We were thinking future when we might buy a travel trailer . We were returning the next day to sort out the paperwork for it when our minds changed . A couple of things people said to us got our wheels turning . <p> The Ford had a lot of mileage on it , even though it was only a year old . It was a rental vehicle . It was also going to be a fuel guzzler . Were we prepared to spend all this extra money just in case we get a travel trailer in six months time ? <p> We know for sure we would n't before then . We do n't have the time at the moment to search for one , it 's not immediately pressing given we 'll be roaming up and down the east coast and in and out of Raleigh . <p> Then there was the thought of , can we afford a travel trailer ? We 'd have to get another loan and what if we could n't ? <p> It 's always best to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might happen . <p> We decided to downgrade and get a minivan. - If things change in six months or a years time and we are in the position , we can easily upgrade and wo n't be too much out of pocket . It 's a much safer bet . <p> We found a Kia Sedona , perfect for what we wanted and it was half the price of the Expedition . Plus the mileage was less , and the fuel consumption much better . <p> It gives us the space we want . We can fold down the back seats for huge boot space , plus we 'll put on a skybox on the roof racks and a bike rack on the back for the bikes we intend to get . <p> It 's a 2016 model , with 14,000 miles on it , and we purchased for $21,000 . We got the loan no problem at a good interest rate , no income verification , and for 60 months . No visa check ! <p> I want to be clear , we can afford the repayments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We intend to stay here permanently . Were so grateful we could get the loan and the repayments are less than $500 a month . The Ford would have stretched our budget too much . <p> We 're so happy with the car and ca n't wait to get on the road for our first road trip in her . Now the trick is to keep her tidy and organized . We 'll be sharing how we do that as we road trip across the USA . <p> We want to give a shout out to Jamie , Ryan , Pa and the team at University Ford and Kia Durham . I 've never had a pleasant car buying experience like that before . They were very helpful and honest and worked with us to find the right car . <p> They were also very kind to Savannah when she was throwing up on the grass bringing her water and ginger ale . Poor baby has a sensitive stomach and something had upset it . <h> Business structure <p> The hardest decision has been what to do with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company it is making everything so difficult here to get set up . We ca n't get a US bank account for the business yet , which means we 're losing money with fees and currency conversion . I will do anything to reduce bank fees . I hate them . <p> We want to live in the US permanently so not having the tax history here will go against us in the future when we want to buy a house . <p> Plus , since we do have a three-year visa , we basically have intent to be residents here which means we have to switch over to the US tax system soon . Our accountant at home says we can technically push that back for a year and say we 're just trying to figure it out . <p> But we believe switching over is a clear sign that we are serious about making this happen . Both of us know without a doubt its what we want . Being back here , even after the first day , I knew this was where I 'm meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has Aussie clients in situations like that . So he is helping us make the switch to an LLC . I just ca n't wait to get that setup and have a US business bank account ! <p> If anyone else is in our situation , I recommend finding an accountant who understands a little of both systems , or at least how to deal with foreign tax laws . It 's so confusing to me and our US accountant Mario is making it much clearer . <p> It will be a challenging first year , as the US government will tax us on everything made since we arrived in the country . That means we 'll be double taxed , as income is still coming from the Australian side . But the accountant can sort out tax credits for us , but he said it will be a messy first year . <p> We 're trying to wind down and move over as fast as we can . <p> This could also fare stronger in our favor when we attempt to get a green card . <h> Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have no idea what to do here . We currently have travel insurance . But , there 's a finite amount of time you can travel on that . <p> As mentioned were transitioning to be US permanent residents . We spend a lot in preventative care so we can avoid doctors and medication . <p> But , things happen , especially with kids . We want to be adequately covered for the just in cases . It feels like such a mess over here . I do n't  understand it and I do n't  know what will be the best option for us . And I do n't  know how Trump will change things in a few weeks anyway and what to do from there . <h> Our travel plans <p> We had no clue where we were going after Raleigh . I love how plans effortlessly slide together with a few great tips from the locals . <p> Here is a rough plan : <h> Huntsville , Alabama <p> I just finished attending the travel bloggers conference ( TBEX ) in Huntsville , Alabama . I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic story . <p> I had a fantastic time and will write a post about the event soon ! Huntsville was a surprisingly cool destination . I did really enjoy traveling with only my phone for a camera ! ! <h> Nashville and the Grand Ole Opry <p> I took the greyhound to Nashville to meet Craig and the girls , where we are now currently and will be until the 15th . <p> We are here for a couple of days working with Grand Ole Opry to attend and share this amazing experience . More to come on that , but its a definite US highlight . You can check our Facebook and Instagram for pics and video . <p> Music is a big part of my life and Nashville has such an amazing musical story which connects quite deeply with my childhood . <p> We are also now major fans of Nashville the TV show so are triply excited to be here . And we finally got to met our long-term travel blogger friend Kristin Luna from Camels and Chocolate and her husband , Scott . <h> Memphis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so we decided to pop over to Memphis for a few days after Nashville . We might as well , we are only four hours away . I 'm loving having this flexibility to follow our whims at any given moment . <h> Nashville road trip to Raleigh via Smokies <p> Now that we have our car , we 're going to use this opportunity to road trip back to Raleigh via Knoxville , the Smoky Mountains , and Ashville . <p> We love this area and are very excited to share it with the girls . We do n't have a plan as of yet and have no idea how long well be in the area for . But , I am sure it will involve hiking , craft beer , and more music . <h> The Carolinas <p> We think that for most of June and July we will hang around the Carolinas , exploring a bit deeper and connecting with old friends . <p> Atlanta , Savannah , and Charleston are definitely on the list . We are hoping to organize a meet up in Raleigh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be making a quick three-day detour down to Orlando in June for the BlogHer conference . Oops , that reminds me . I have to book my flight . <h> Michigan <p> We had several different Friends tell us that Michigan is gorgeous in the summer . So we thought , why not ? We 're thinking of heading up there July/August . We 'll do Chicago and the Great Lakes while we are there , possibly going as far as Milwaukee . <h> New England <p> After The Great Lakes , we 'll head over to New England for the fall . That 's going to be epic . <h> East Coast <p> We 'll spend the remainder of the year probably heading down the east coast to hit Florida for January . <p> That is our rough plans for now . With us , anything is liable to change . Stay tuned ! <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> You guys must go to Mackinaw when in Michigan !

Hope to see you guys in Mackinaw ! <p> I would recommend heading back to Raleigh via Muscle Shoals and Chattanooga ! We took a road trip from Dallas to Raleigh a couple years ago and spend time in Florence , AL near Muscle Shoals ( we have family there ) and Chattanooga . Both had fun family acitivies ( we have 2 sons , now 8 &amp; 6 ) and I thought Chattanooga was such a cute little city . There is also the US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville , AL that is right off the freeway en route from the Muscle Shoals area to Chattanooga .

We pay about $550/month for a family of 5 with a very high deductible- just an FYI . My friend was just telling me about Petosky , MI- how it has a super cute downtown area maybe something to look into ! I 've also been wanting to go to Sleeping Bear Dune . Its still a 6.5 hour drive from us in Ohio , though , so we have n't gotten there yet . <p> Hey guys Emma from PWG here ! Enjoyed your blog , so much of it so familiar from when I was in NYC . We 've left our bank accounts etc all open too and keep building our credit score from over here in case we want to go back ! One health insurance option that lots of Aussie expats were using in NYC ( when their employer did n't  give them any or they were freelance ) was Oscar maybe check that out . https : //www.hioscar.com/ . Hope you 're all well ! ( We also have a couple of accountants in NYC that deal with both Au and US tax systems if you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its a nightmare , but thank goodness for the treaty ! ) <p> I 've heard Michigan is beautiful , too . Traverse City , Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore , car-free Mackinac Island with the Grand Hotel , where Somewhere in Time was filmed , starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour . While you 're up there : Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore , and over to Apostle Islands National Lakeshore , in Wisconsin . Split Rock Lighthouse , in Minnesota . Duluth . Minneapolis/St . Paul is a cool city . And if you 're in Chicago you might as well go up to Madison , Wisconsin , eat some cheese , walk around Geneva Lake Shore Path around a beautiful lake , through the lakefront properties of behemoth mansions of people like the Rockefellers , Wrigleys , Schwinns , Swfits , etc . <p> As far as Chicago , I cant add much that you cant find anywhere about Chicago except point out my favorites ; Buckingham Fountain , walk or bike the Lakefront Trail , Lake Michigan , Cloud Gate , walking the Magnificent Mile , taking a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oak Street Beach , Wrigley Field , United Center and Chicago Music Exchange . Great architecture and great food . This time around were going to a Cubs game at Wrigley Field , a U2 concert at Soldier Field , the Navy Pier and probably the Shedd Aquarium , which is supposed to be great . Favorite restaurants so far in Chicago : Greek Islands , Lou Malnatis , Ginos East and Wildberry Pancakes &amp; Cafe , the one right by Millennium Park . Uber and walking are the ways to go in Chicago . Avoid having to park downtown . Favorite hotel so far in Chicago : Hotel Palomar . It has an amazing view of some of the most famous buildings , from the pool . <p> If you come down as far as Missouri , I recommend Kansas City . Deep Jazz and blues roots , famous BBQ , great museums , good shopping . Its an up-and-coming city , like Nashville . <p> In New England , after Boston/Cambridge , I 'm most interested in Maine . Places like Bangor , Augusta , Portland , Acadia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast I 'd strongly suggest taking a trip to Pittsburgh . Its a great city . <p> Florida : Jacksonville . St. Augustine , oldest city in U.S. , and supposed to be really nice . Cape Canaveral . Orlando . Miami . Everglades National Park . I 'm most interested in the beautiful white sand beaches on the west side of the state : Naples , Siesta Beach , Sanibel and Captiva Sanibel Island is covered with shells that you can collect . Tampa is a nice city . Clearwater . St. Petersburg . And then up to Grayton , Panama City Beach , Destin . Alabama has some nice beaches , too , like Gulf Shores and Orange Beach . <p> I love reading of your travels ! But I what I really love is all the extra info like financing a phone , car , etc . We relocated to Bangkok for six months back in 2015 but couldnt have done so without some extra insider information from friends whom had already lived there . It made our move so much more smoother . I think for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be tourists there , this information is far more valuable . Thanks for sharing = <p> What an exciting story , I loved your script , I 've been following your blog for a long time , always access to see if there are new things . I love these family adventures of you , I wanted to have the same courage . <p> Great updates , my wife and I just moved to the US ( RTP ) from Australia and I ( as an Aussie ) am going through all the same things , so I could n't help but smile when you mentioned having to get your license , the issues with having no credit and trying to sort out health insurance . Looking forward to reading all about your upcoming travels .

@@21820542 @1820542/ <p> We 're missing almost an entire state from our Australia story and they never make those posts as we have no experiencing travelling there . I do n't  feel that 's fair . <p> Apart from a trip to Adelaide and the Barossa Valley , we 've not really explored South Australia . We decided not to on our road trip because we were exhausted . After writing this post on Esperance , I knew we were destined to visit South Australia with the wrong attitude and I did n't want that to be my experience of this state . <p> One of my tips now for anyone wanting to travel around Australia is to start by going furthest away from where you live . That way , if you end up exhausted and ca n't complete your trip , it will be much easier for you to visit the nearby states and regions on short getaways and two week holidays . <p> South Australia has been just that little far away to make it challenging to get back there to explore it in more depth .

Rental companies are always looking to relocate vehicles <p> Rental companies are always looking to relocate vehicles between cities for various reasons . Instead of paying someone to do it , they allow travellers to do it for free . You usually get the vehicle for a few days , and sometimes fuel is included . <p> I decided to check Transfer Car just before booking our flights just in case , and there was an opportunity for a 4 berth camper ! ( I 'm now hooked on this strategy and get email alerts . Now we have freedom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ! ) <p> It 's saved us around $800 when you consider the price of our flights , the train/Uber to and from the airports , and what it was going to cost us to mail a couple of boxes back to our parents .

It 's still not going to be the best weather there , considering it 's rainy season , but we 're excited to finally visit Boracay that we 've heard so much about . <p> It 's going to be a relaxing family resort style holiday , which I feel is the perfect way to transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin . <p> From the Philippines , we go straight to South Australia . <p> And after South Australia ?

The state has so much more with great beaches , the Flinders Ranges and Islands . Have a great time ! <p> Beautiful Boracay . The travel agency I used to work for used to book trips to Boracay before many Australians had discovered it . My husband and I travelled there and at that time it was many filled with European tourists . It was amazing . So beautiful .

Armchair travelling sometimes has to do and I always feel that you explain your journeys very well and make them accessible for us too . <p> Great news , and how wise to spend money on the road rather than on rent . <p> We loved Kangaroo Island ! You must go on a tour to swim with dolphins and book one of the cottages at the Flinders Chase National Park . We stayed at the Postmans cottage for a night . It was lovely but I wished we 'd stayed longer . Not that many people know about this place . The northern part of Kangaroo island is less visited but beautiful .

Enjoy ! <p> So excited to read you post about your journey . South Australia maybe not that popular for some people , and we do know more about the cities in Australia since many people just visit Brisbane and maybe Sydney but i even do n't  know many popular beach name on Australia and from you post i now know that Borocay is beautiful place which i should visit one day <p> Sydney is a beautiful part of Australia to visit . It is not entirely unique in a metropolitan kind of way , but there is lots of architecture and history and it is very eclectic and modern . Fashion and coffee and creature comforts abound as do seaside restaurants and harbour views . And of course there 's the unmissable opera house

@@21820546 @1820546/ <h> Best Baby Travel Gear <p> We do n't travel with high chairs , eating utensils , or other- kids travel accessories that are- not essential and only add weight . <p> Most restaurants and hotels will have high chairs , if not just sit them on your lap or in their pram . You may feel you ca n't cope without a high chair . No problem . Do what 's best for you and your family . <p> here 's a list of what we think is the best travel gear for babies and what made our life easier . <h> Portable Travel Crib <p> We traveled with a portable crib to New Zealand when Savannah was 8 weeks old . It was brilliant and it came on many road trips with us , or sleep overs at a friends house . <p> Baby wipes , however , I feel are the BOMB ! ! I do n't know how I ever survived without them . They 're good for everything and one of the- best travel accessories with kids . <h> Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I- loved the idea of it , but it was bulky and awkward and I constantly feared Kalyra would fall out or be smothered . Plus it hurt my back . <p> For Savannah , the Baby Bjorn Carrier- was everything- that sling was not " - easy to wear and easy to put Savannah in , - safely secured and- designed to grow with Savannah- allowing us to carry her in it until she is about 15 months old . <p> Savannah loved the Baby Bjorn Carrier and would sleep inn it all day nestled up to my chest . I loved it too ! <h> Travel Gear for Breastfeeding and Bottle Feeding <p> I hated our trip to Thailand when Savannah was 17 months old as we had to travel with her bottles , baby formula and bottle steriliser . <p> It was a gigantic pain in the butt and changed our decision from backpacking Southeast Asia to embarking on our epic road trip around Australia . <p> Breastfeeding makes traveling so much easier . If you cant or are n't  breastfeeding while traveling , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bottle Storage Bag <h> Car Baby Bottle Warmer <p> I never traveled with one of these baby bottle warmers for the car . I 'd just get my hands on a kettle and warm the bottle up in a cup of hot water . This looks much better and would be on my shopping list of best travel gear for kids . <h> Soft Cotton Muslin Swaddle Blankets <p> I always liked traveling these soft cotton muslin swaddles. - They are- great for covering when breastfeeding in public , for shading my girls form the sun , keeping away pesky bugs , or wrapping them up . <h> Baby Travel Diaper Bag <p> Again , I 'm sure you have one already . Get one that includes a baby change mat . It will definitely get used a lot ! <h> Portable Soft Silicone Travel bottle Set <h> Best Travel Gear for Toddlers <h> Life Jacket <p> If you are visiting a place where you will be swimming a lot or going out on boats , it 's a good idea to carry a child 's life jacket for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we used it often . Its one of the safest travel accessories for kids . <p> I really really wish we had one when we visited Thailand . Savannah was way too young and taking a boat trip with her and having no life jacket was stressful . <h> Best Travel Car Seats <p> If we are visiting Asia , we do n't  worry about taking a car or booster seat . Most of the time the vehicles there do n't  even have seat belts ! ! ! <p> It really did make traveling in Thailand difficult when Savannah was 17 months , she 's just wanted to roam around the car and was hard to keep her restrained . <h> Inflatable Booster Seat <p> The- bubble gum booster seat comes recommended as the best baby seat for travel . I think well travel with one of these from now on easy to chuck in your bag ! I wish I knew about them before writing this post . Its a fantastic car travel accessories for kids . <h> Travel Stroller or Pram <p> We found it worthwhile traveling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's so much easier , but it does depend on where you go and how you travel around . <p> A baby carrier may be adequate for you , although , be warned they can exhaust you ! <p> Strollers are great for pushing kids around but also for giving them a place to sit and for feeding . You can also carry bags in them if your child is running around . Be careful of the weight if you add bags on to the handle when they are in them . <h> Infant 3Dlite Convenience Stroller <p> We do n't  own a stroller any longer , but this infant 3Dlite convenience stroller is lightweight , sturdy , compact and comes with good reviews on Amazon- as one of the- best travel gear for kids . <h> Best Family Travel Product Kelty hiking carrier <p> We explored a lot further with this carrier , with a lot less whining . Savannah loved watching the world from above our shoulders . There 's no better way to help your little-legged children connect to nature and yourselves . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It fit comfortably and felt like Savannah was always secure with a 5-point harness system and was easy to get her in and out of . <p> The Kelty Hiking Carrier comes with a- nice amount of storage for packing wipes , diapers , and change of clothes. - And it comes with a sun hood ! <h> Micro Scooter <p> One of the best travel products we purchased for our kids on our road trip around Australia was one of these micro scooters . <p> Yes , they are a little expensive , but we never regretted our decision . <p> Savannah loves how it has three wheels and a flexible handle for maneuvering . Instead of demanding to be carried everywhere she happily rides her scooter . Its brilliant for helping you see more without damaging your back ! <h> Best Kids Travel Items for Technology <h> Wireless Bluetooth Headphones <p> Yep. - Travel gadgets make our life easier . Here 's what we travel with . <p> Our kids love watching movies , listening to music or playing games on their devices so finding comfortable headphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold the ear plug style headphones in which was never practical , and often they like to watch together so I like how these headphones have a share port , no need for splitters ! <h> Samsung Tablet <p> Kalyra and Savannah both have a- Samsung Tablet , which they love and have proven to be one of the- best travel gadgets for kids . <p> They use these them to record their own photos and videos and for games and movies and research " either school based learning or fun . <p> I have no problem with the girls watching movies or playing games on the tablet , especially on long road trips or flights . They have more than enough time pursuing other interests outside of the devices . We keep the balance in check . <h> Procase Cover <p> Whatever you do , do n't  forget the cover for your tablet ! Its worth the extra expense . They 're kids , they have butter fingers a lot ! <h> Quik by GoPro app <h> Best Family Travel Luggage &amp; Storage <h> Carry-On Luggage <p> I 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as we relocate to the USA we are buying both our kids one of these Delsey carry-on suitcases . <p> Unfortunately , Amazon does n't  ship- these to our current home base in Australia but they come highly recommended from other family travelers we know as being light weight and easy to maneuver , practical , stylish and durable . <p> I like how they have a large easy to access front padded compartment for electronics and two zippered mesh pockets for travel accessories 20 inch is a good size for- kids luggage . <p> Our kids have already chosen their color , brick red ! Check out the reviews on Amazon . <h> Trunki Ride on Suitcases <p> If I was to have my time again , I 'd get a Trunki suitcase for the girls . They are quite the rage for young children to travel with and on through airports ! ! <p> They seem perfect for keeping them entertained , engaged in the travel experience and responsible for it ! They consistently rank as a one of the top travel items for kids . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pack a suitcase efficiently . Throw everything in the bag , sit on it , and then zip it up . <p> It was n't too bad when we had backpacks because the different compartments helped us stay a little organized . But now that we have two kids we mostly travel with suitcases . <p> In each packing cube we roll up each item and arrange clothes based on type and season . It helps me find the clothes I need for the girls , as I separate dresses , undies , skirts , tops etc into different packing cells . Packing cells help the kids learn how to be organized and pack efficiently . <h> Travel Day Packs for Kids <h> Sprocket Pack <p> We have a travel day pack each for the girls . They 're responsible for packing their entertainment and desired comforts for plane and road trips . It comes in handy also for hiking and day explorations . <p> They are comfortable and strong and have lasted us a couple of years now . <h> Lily Bloom Crossbody Bag <p> My Aunty gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite kids travel accessory at the moment . She carries her tablet , sunnies , pencils , and purse in it . Its made from recycled plastic and is very groovy ! <h> Medical First Aid Kit <p> I ca n't tell you the regret I 've felt at times for traveling without a thermometer and kid 's Panadol and band aids . A good medical kit is essential , especially when traveling with kids . For peace of mind they are one of the best travel gear for kids items . <h> Lunchbox <p> If you are road tripping , a lunch box with compartments is brilliant . It saves on plastic and wrapping and helps your children take responsibility for their own food . <p> I pack their lunch boxes on our road trip and let them know if they choose to eat it all in the first five minutes they 'll have nothing left . They got really good at spacing out the food and they loved opening it to see what surprises lay in there . <h> Ziplocs <p> Ziplocs are a lifesaver for food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They really can make the family travel life easier . <h> Water Purifier Bottle <p> Traveling somewhere you know the water is n't safe to drink ? Then this can be one of the best travel gear for kids items . <p> This- Camelbak Purifier Bottle- has a- purification system built right into- the water bottle . We used a similar bottle for our 5 month trip in Africa , and your health is not something you want anyone to compromise . <h> Wovii- Towels <p> You can even use them as blankets if need be .

My toddler is 3.5 and I think we might try letting him have his own pack for his toys/snacks this time . <p> Another thing that we have found really useful for traveling with our toddler is a collapsible toddler cot . He loved sleeping on it during our cruise last winter and it was small enough that it fit into our large suitcase , so no extra baggage = <p> Helpful tips Caz ! I often realize that baby stuffs always take huge amount of our own bags so having their own bags is better .

Thanks ! <p> Hi , looooove your stories , so much amazing useful info , particularly the school on the road info . Just wondering if you have any tips for school aged kids to definitely take travelling . Thanks very much , Kristy <p> WOW ! That is one super detailed list . Having traveled with family there are some really nifty and useful items there . I really like inflatable booster seat because different countries have different driving rules and this is handy . As for Trunki , I think every child wants one for them . Really cool list o actually usable items . Thanks for this .

Keep reading as we 've got some local tips for you ! <p> New York City is widely known as one of the world 's most expensive cities , and for good reason . <p> It 's not cheap , especially if you live here , but one of the greatest things about NYC is that while there are countless wonderful ways to splurge , there are also plenty of awesome activities that are 100% free . <p> Some of them require a bit of planning or require you to be here on certain days of the month , but others are always available and all give you the iconic New York City vibes that you 're looking for . <h> 9 free things to do in NYC <h> 1 . See Manhattan from the Staten Island Ferry <p> I absolutely love the view of Manhattan from the water , no matter what time of day or what river . There 's something about the beauty and scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're standing right below them . <p> Although I love the Circle Line cruises that take you all around the island with interesting commentary , the Staten Island Ferry is a wonderful way to get the same views with none of the price . Bonus : you go right by the Statue of Liberty ! <p> Similarly , Ikea runs a ferry service from lower Manhattan to Red Hook , Brooklyn for free on the weekends you can easily hop on or off without having to buy any cheap Scandinavian furniture . And in the summers , there is a free ferry from downtown Brooklyn to Governor 's Island . <h> 2. - Walk along the High Line <p> Introduced in 2009 , the High Line has transformed western Manhattan . Built on a disused portion of the elevated New York Central Railway , it 's been converted into a pedestrian-only park and public art space . <p> Although it 's understandably more pleasant in warmer temperatures , it 's open year-round and only closed during intense rain and blizzards . <h> 3. - Explore Central Park <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Park is an oasis of nature in the heart of a chaotic city , and a beloved escape for locals and tourists alike . On the short list of things worth doing in the park that are completely free : <p> pay your tribute to John Lennon at Strawberry Fields <p> watch the kids of all ages racing sailboats at the Conservatory Water or scrambling over the Alice in Wonderland statue <h> 4. - Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge <p> The Brooklyn Bridge is one of New York City 's most recognizable structures . Although it 's especially romantic to walk across at sunset , I love the beautiful light and serenity to be found on the bridge at sunrise . <p> Bonus : if you walk from Manhattan to Brooklyn , you 'll end up in DUMBO . You can wander through the expertly-planned Brooklyn Bridge Park promenade , see Jane 's Carousel and get the iconic shot of the Manhattan Bridge from the cobblestone intersection on Water Street . <p> And if you want another amazing photo of the Brooklyn Bridge : walk through DUMBO and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's especially good when all the cars are driving home at sunset . <h> 5 . See the collection Metropolitan Museum of Art <p> Ok , the Met- is n't a completely free thing to do in NYC . You do have to make a donation . Although the signs will lead you ( and all other unsuspecting tourists ) to believe that the cost of entry is $20 , it 's technically a suggested donation and thus , you can donate whatever you please . <p> You do have to donate something , but for just $1 , you get access to one of the greatest museums in the world which is a pretty epic deal . <p> The museum itself is giant and overwhelming , so unless you want to spend your whole day here , pick a few things that you 're especially interested in seeing . And although it does require some planning and serendipitous timing , most of New York 's museums do offer free entry on certain days and times . <p> If you 're a Bank of America cardholder , many museums are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . <h> 6. - Watch the crowds in Grand Central Station <p> I used to commute daily in and out of Grand Central Station , and I never tired of the beautiful structure and all its bustle . <p> From the zodiac constellations on the ceiling to the four-sided clock , the Main Concourse is the hub of all of the back-and-forth activity . And you ca n't miss the Whispering Gallery ! The perfectly arched ceiling and architectural anomaly allows you to face into the wall and have a whispered conversation with someone in the opposite corner . <h> 7 . Look into the windows on Fifth Avenue <p> Although Fifth Avenue is surely at its greatest during the Christmas season incredible window displays , the tree at Rockefeller Center , merriment and goodwill to all it 's the most iconic street in New York City for good reason . <p> Start at 59th Street ( just below Central Park ) and head south : you 'll see the giant glass Apple Store cube , the old-world glamour of stores like Bergdorf Goodman , Saks and Lord &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BTW ) , the fa+ade of Tiffany &amp; Co. made famous by the lovely Holly Golightly , the soaring spires of St. Patrick 's Cathedral and the shadow of Rockefeller Center . <h> 8. - Read in New York Public Library and Bryant Park <p> When I first moved to New York City , I used to eat my lunch while reading a book on the sun-soaked steps of the New York Public Library or on the Bryant Park lawn and it felt just like the movies . <p> I especially loved walking up on 41st Street aka Library Way where famous literary quotes are cast in bronze on the sidewalk . The building is a National Historic Landmark with a grand and imposing marble exterior . <p> New York has always been a place I wanted to live in .. perhaps , I 'll settle with a short visit ..

I just got back from spending a day in New York City and even though it was a bit rainy , we walked the High Line and really enjoyed it . I love the Met and walking across the Brooklyn Bridge as well . <p> I love that you suggested reading a book on the steps of the Public Library while eating lunch .

@@21820560 @1820560/ <h> How I Purchased 3 Flights to the Gold Coast for $375 and Saved $130 on Car Rental <p> I want to start writing more posts to show you how we find travel deals . <p> So many people put off travelling because they feel it 's too expensive . It is in some regards , but make a few priority changes and find a few deals and it can become more of a reality . <p> This week I am heading back to the Gold Coast with the girls . Yep . Only been gone from Burleigh Heads for two months and I 'm already longing to return . <p> We were n't expecting to still be in Australia at this time we are waiting for our US business visa approval . <p> Miss my Burleigh bliss <p> Although- it 's been fantastic to be back in our home town on the Central Coast of NSW catching up with friends and spending a lot of time with family , I have n't been comfortable knowing that we 're just hanging around and Kalyra has missed a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had her cousin to play with , who is a similar age , and Kalyra has played with them too , but there 's still a four-year age gap . <p> Cousins <p> So I decided to take her back to the Gold Coast for a week to play with her best friend . She 's beyond excited . Well also try and tee up some play dates with Savannahs old friends . And I get to play with my besties too ! ! <p> When I first checked flight prices- and combined it with car rental prices for the week , it was looking like it would be cheaper for me to rent a car from our home town near Sydney and drive the nine hours to the Gold Coast . <p> I decided to give it one last look a week later to see if that was still the case . <p> I 'm happy with the $370 flight prices I ended up getting for three return flights from Sydney to the Gold Coast AND I saved $130 on car rental for the week WITH no excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Note : - Whilst I mention Skyscanner and American Express in this post , I want to be clear it is not sponsored by either company . We do partner with them quite regularly , and always disclose to you when we do . <p> They 're in this post because we are legitimate fans of both of them and use them as a travel resource frequently . As we say in all of our content on making money with blogging , work with brands you already know , like , and trust and use often ! <p> I followed the same strategy to check for my flights to the Gold Coast . <p> I use Skyscanner first as it quickly shows me what airlines will give me the best price without going to each individual airline website to check . <p> It told me the best prices would be with Jetstar and Tiger Air . It also helped me to easily see what flight times would work best for me at the best price . <p> I could have booked a cheaper early 8am flight with Jetstar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend 's place on the farm in Byron Bay at 5am . Not good for the girls . <p> A much better flight time with Tiger Air was available later in the day with a decent price . <h> Check your frequent flyer points <p> We recently used most of our points on our flights to South Australia , so I was n't expecting too much . I only had minimal points left with Virgin Australia and some membership points with American Express . <p> I could have transferred them over to Virgin Australia , but it would have only been enough to cover my flight . <p> When I factored in the cost of the girls ticket , it still would have been more cost effective to go with Jetstar or TigerAir . <p> Plus , it would take between 3- 5 days to transfer those Amex points over so I may have missed out anyway given my short notice for travel . <p> So that took out the frequent flyer points option . <h> Check baggage price and booking fees <p> Do n't forget to add in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booking one leg with Jetstar and the other with Tiger Air , I wanted to make sure I was n't going to get charged two separate booking fees . If so , it may have made it more cost effective to just use either Tiger Air or Jetstar . <p> Thankfully , there were no booking fees on either as I could pay by Poli ( a somewhat version of direct debit ) . I mostly use POLi as it is fee free . <p> Even though you can collect frequent flyer points when you use your credit card to pay for flights , I rarely choose to do that if there is a fee involved as I do n't think it 's worth it . <p> As we 're travelling in summer and it 's just the girls and I , there is no need to lug around school books and heavy camera equipment ( blog free holiday ) . Well I 'll share a bit on Instagram stories **30;208;TOOLONG ) , I only needed to purchase one check-in bag . <p> One checked in bag and three carry-on bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Decide and book <p> That researching and booking process took me about 30-minutes in total and I found the best flights at the cheapest price for what I needed . <p> 3 x flights on Jetstar for $239.50 <p> 3 x flights on Tiger Air for $245.68 <p> $485.18 for the three of us was more than I wanted to pay , but it was the best I was going to get . <p> I still had to factor in car rental when we got to the Gold Coast . It would have been cheaper to rent a car from here to drive up , but the savings was n't enough to justify the 10-hour drive ! <h> Two booking surprises save me money ! <p> I had two lovely surprises when booking the return leg of my flight from the Gold Coast with Tiger Air . <p> They had a 50% sale on their baggage price ! Yay . It may only be a savings of $7.50 , but anyone in my Money Cleanse community knows that I celebrate every win no matter how small , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came time to click the buy button , one of my options was to pay using Virgin Velocity Points . I had NO IDEA they were connected in this way ! I 've never flown Tiger Air before though . <p> I clicked on it to see what my points could get me " a whole 50% off the price of my Tiger Air flights . Happy Days . <p> So flights ended up costing $375 in total for three return flights . <p> And I could have saved a bit more . I totally forgot I had a $10 voucher for Jetstar I could have used . Bummer . Hey , $10 is $10 ! ! <p> My only other big expense now is getting to and from Sydney airport . It is my BIGGEST peeve . Sydney airport is a rip-off . The 12-minute train ride from Sydney Central Train Station costs $17 one way for adults and $14 for kids . <p> It might be a total pain to get off the train at Central from Woy Woy and catch an Uber , but it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously that getting the train to Mascot and then catching an Uber makes it even cheaper ( <p> I 've had a reader also recommend previously that getting the train to Mascot and then catching an Uber makes it even cheaper ( use this code ql3dc to get $10 off your first 2 Uber rides ) <p> Update : Good news " Craig drove us to the airport and is picking us up when we return ! <h> Car Rental on the Gold Coast <p> I am because not only are we visiting our friends in Burleigh , but I 'm also taking the girls to see some of our other friends and their similar aged children on their farms in the Byron Bay Hinterland . <p> Looking forward to the sunsets at Byron Bay <p> With car rental , remember- to factor in the cost of the car rental insurance . <p> Most car hire companies will give you the basic cover which will have an excess of $3,000 you are liable to pay if something happens . <p> So be careful . Always check what the total rental price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you book . <p> Since I had American Express points to use , I decided to check the American Express Travel site for car hire to see whether I could cover the cost of that with my points for a weeks rental . I almost could . But , that was just the base rate . <p> To reduce the excess , it put the total price of car hire to over $500 for the week . I could have reduced that with my points , but I wanted to check other options for a better use of my points and money . <h> Avis <p> I also checked Avis direct as there is a current offer with my Amex Card that if you spend $200 or more on Avis car hire you get $50 back . Even with this discount , having the right excess and insurance would still cost me $500 . <p> I also checked the credit card policy to see whether the excess could be covered by insurance if I paid for the car using my Amex card but that was a dead end as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to be the best online search tool for car hire . <p> We have used them since 2007 when we hired a car in the US and were astounded at how much we saved by booking on Travel Jigsaw , which is what it was known as way back then . <p> It always brings us the best rates . It 's why it is the only car rental site we recommend to you and choose to be affiliate partners with . We believe in them to be the best . <p> Whereas every other option ( except one which I 'll share with you in a moment ) gave me rates at least $500 for the 8 day rental , RentalCars.com returned me a vehicle for $371 with the excess reduction included . This is great savings . <p> But , I did n't book a car with them . Here 's why . <h> Jacks Car Rental <p> We love Jacks . They are a local car hire company on the Gold Coast owned by two sisters . <p> We stumbled across them when we first moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their rates always include excess reduction to zero . The best thing about <p> The best thing about Jacks Car Rentals is they drop off and pick up the car wherever you are . It was an amazing service for us when we lived on the Gold Coast and we rented cars from them all the time . <p> We phoned them to check their prices for the 8-day rental . It was $360 . <p> We could have booked with RentalCars.com via our own affiliate link , which would have taken the cost to be slightly cheaper than Jacks , but we really love this local company and would rather support them than save a couple of extra bucks . <p> Truly , if you 're looking for car hire on the Gold Coast , go to Jacks , they ca n't be beat- for service ! <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805

So where do you eat in Melbourne ? <p> Our visit was a combination of getting suggestions from friends , and just exploring on our own . Our focus was not on fine dining , but about value for money and family friendly locations . <p> Below are 17 places we enjoyed , plus further down below are some HOT TIPS from our readers . <h> Places to Eat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lygon Street is that famous Italian area of Melbourne , and home to many popular restaurants and cafes . With so many choices it can be hard to narrow down a selection . Luckily our local friend with an Italian background new the place for us Tiamo . <p> Synonymous with traditional Italian cuisine , Tiamo has a focus on pizza , but I enjoyed another Italian specialty , spaghetti marinara , and Caz said her risotto was to die for . Going there with a group , why not order a few pizzas , some pastas and risotto and share everything . <p> The bustling vibe is great , feels very homely and genuinely Italian . And for it being a touristy part of the city was impressed with their reasonable prices . <h> 2 . Brunetti Lygon Street , Carlton <p> A place to indulge in an Italian style coffee from the bar . Its said they serve 20,000 coffees per week , and has been serving cakes , pastries , biscuits and gelati since 1985 . You 'll also find excellent crepes , chocolates and savoury dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe how big and popular this place is . And the pastries are like art work <p> Brunetti <h> 3 . The Organic Food &amp; Wine Deli Degraves St <p> Wed visited Degraves St many times for coffee but never gave this place a thought until our local friend Steve suggested we meet for lunch . Turned out a great suggestion . <p> The Organic Food &amp; Wine Deli TOFWD is the place to go for tasty organic , vegan and dietary friendly food was perfect for Caz with her gluten intolerance . Grab a seat outside if its sunny and take your choice from pies , salads , sandwiches , burgers , wraps and more ! <p> Degraves st <h> 4 . Little Creatures Pub Fitzroy <p> I 'm a big fan of the Little Creatures beer , and was excited when we got yet another tip from a local Melbourne friend to hit up this pub for lunch . <p> Fitzroy is a great neighbourhood to explore on foot , and we timed our visit so that we could recharge with a bite to eat ( and a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interior is open plan and inviting , kid friendly , and the quality of their beer was matched with yummy food making for a great pub lunch experience . <p> Little Creatures <h> 5 . Vegie Bar , Fitzroy <p> If you find yourself in Fitzroy , and you should because its a cool neighbourhood to explore , grab a bite to eat at Vegie Bar . <p> Weve been there twice now and it satisfies our health conscious mind , and our taste buds . Be prepared to wait a little in line though , as they were lined up out the door on both our visits . <h> 6 . Queen Victoria Night Markets <p> The Queen Victoria Markets are not just a place to go shopping , the Wednesday Night Market serves up a global street food extravaganza with offerings from all over the world . <p> It was like any night food market you 'd find in Asia , buzzing with atmosphere and cheap ( for Melbourne ) street food . The kids tucked into a crepe , Caz had a goat curry and I demolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday from November March . <h> 7 . Chinatown Little Bourke St , CBD <p> If there 's a Chinatown in town , were there ! Rarely are we disappointed , and our bank balance is always happy . <p> One place in Melbourne we kept going back to was the popular Camy Shanghai Dumpling and Noodle Restaurant its not for the posh and fancy , its a genuine Chinese experience with below par service , but their dumplings were a highlight and cheap too ! <h> 8 . Loving Hut Victoria Street , Richmond <p> Just walk up and down Victoria street in Richmond and you 'll have oodles of cheap Vietnamese restaurants and cafes on offer , as well as Malaysian and Chinese . <p> Not knowing which one to try , a local tip we got was the vegetarian-friendly Loving Hut , which turned out to be a good recommendation with not only cheap and tasty food , but that family friendly service . <p> Trams travel along Victoria Street from the city , or jump on the train to the North Richmond station . <h> 9 . Dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dim Sims at the South Melbourne Market were famous , and judging by the lunchtime crowd they were worth a try . And they were not wrong , so good in fact I went back for seconds . <h> 10 . Riverland Bar &amp; Cafe Yarra River <p> On a sunny day in the city a great place for lunch , and a beer , is the Riverland Bar &amp; Cafe on the banks of the Yarra River . <p> With prime position overlooking the river , the Princess Bridge and the many rowers doing their thing , it felt like we were back in London in the summer . <p> They have a kids menu and room for kids to move with its open beer garden configuration . And located right above Riverland Bar is the happening Federation Square . <p> Riverland <h> 11 . Transport Hotel Federation Square <p> Speaking of Federation Square , another of our pub favourites is the Transport Hotel . <p> With a beer garden that overlooks Fed Square and the live music stage " this place quickly became a fave of ours with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cider , not to mention the $5 pints of James Boags and the yummy nachos ! <h> 12 . High Tea at the Langham Hotel <p> This was actually more of a treat for our kids , as the High Tea theme at the time of our visit to the Langham Hotel was based around the newly released Disney movie FROZEN . <p> But I must say , I 'm a fan of all things cakes and old English favourites as well as tea and coffee and thoroughly enjoyed this as a family treat . <p> The Langham Hotel is known for its signature high tea with three different offers . <h> 13 . Jimmi Janz , Elwood <p> For the lover of CHEAP pizzaIf you find yourself in Elwood , and you should because its one of Melbournes best beaches , either start your day with breakfast or end it with dinner at Jimmi Janz . <p> Out the back is a great little courtyard / beer garden complete with kids playground making this a hit with us as a family eatery . Not to mention the cheap and delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here twice , once for dinner and another time for breaky with friends its a locals favourite ! Ca n't make it to Elwood , they also have a location in East Brunswick . <h> 14 . St Kilda Beach and Acland Street Cake Shops <p> Who knew Melbourne could offer a spectacular sunset ? <p> St Kilda is its most famous beach and one of our favourite experiences was simply grabbing a takeaway pizza from Mr Natural Pizza Place , a bottle of wine , and sitting on the beach watching the sun go down . A cheap and family friendly dinning experience you ca n't beat ! <p> Acland Street is the place to go in St Kilda for cafes and restaurants , but also for the famous cake shops . I dare you to walk past without the temptation of indulging ! ! <p> St Kilda Beach , Melbourne <p> Acland Cake Shop <h> 15 . South Bank <p> Southbank is a pretty location along the Yarra River with great views back over the city , and what seems like endless dining and bar options . We walked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mantra Apartments , but never actually ate here . <p> But a local tip we got was to try the Blue Train cafe for a cheap eat with views of the city . <p> Southbank <h> 16 . Picnic in a Park <p> Looking for a cheap eat ? Why not grab some fresh produce from Queen Victoria Markets and head to either Fitzroy Gardens or Carlton Gardens for a picnic . <p> Or , how about take the family for a picnic in the Botanic Gardens or sit on the banks of the Yarra and watch the world go by . <p> Carlton GardensBotanical Gardens <h> 17 . North East China Family House CBD <p> Not all that appealing from the outside , and do n't  come here for the service they actually forgot to bring out one of our meals but in terms of flavour and quantity the food here is delicious and cheap . <p> The dumplings are their specialty , and the noodles were a hit with Kalyra . Casual and kid friendly , North East China Family House is located at 302 Flinders Lane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hot tips from our readers . You cant beat local advice : <p> Don Dons on Swanston Street near Melbourne Central offers very affordable and tasty Japanese fare and lightning fast service . <p> For stylish , I 'd recommend Eureka 89 and Vue De Monde mainly because I love a good view from high above the city . For stylish yet casual , I 'd recommend anywhere on Little Collins Street from Swanston Street , up to Spring Street . <p> Terra Rosa is a personal favourite of mine along this strip . <p> Kim Bibby says : <p> Sake which is located in Southbank under the arts centre &amp; alongside the Yarra River . Modern &amp; Classic Japanese cuisine . Lovely atmosphere and I find the food/service superior to the famous Nobu at a much more reasonable price . <p> Chiba in Moonee Ponds is fantastic excellent Japanese , atmosphere &amp; service . We often start with a drink at the Valley Cellar Door across the road . Actually , the Valley Cellar Door is awesome as well.great selection of wines to buy AND you can BYO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a nice modern atmosphere and excellent hawker style Asian Food . <p> Donovans at St Kilda .

Fab organic cafe with a great outdoor play area for the kids . <p> Anthony says : <p> There are a couple of great cafes in St Kilda with the kids . West Beach Cafe , right on the sand , where the kids can play while you enjoy a coffee . <p> Also Jerrys Milkbar , which is a converted milkbar with a little playground out the back and awesome banana bread . You should check out Carlisle St in St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bit grimey , but lots of character and great cafes . <p> Las Chicas , near Balaclava Station is as good as it gets in Melbourne with 50 tasty breakfast and lunch options . <p> Albert Park is great for a walk around , with a cafe nearby called Mart130 one of my favourites . <p> Chinatown , Victoria street Richmond for Vietnamese , Footscray for some great african . <h> Plan Your Trip to Melbourne 69808 @qwx269808 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Brunettis is so amazing ! I loved that day , meeting 4 people who inspire me . The girls are going to grow up just like you , kind , caring , helpful and free . Bless , I feel honoured to be a part of your journey . Joseph . x <p> When I traveled to Melbourne , this is one aspect that I failed to explore . Although I am a foodie , I could n't manage to taste anything beyond the confectioneries . I hope to try at least some of these places that you mentioned when I visit Melbourne next . <p> I second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mexican ( in the city and Richmond ) , and Chiangmai in Lygon St for Thai . There 's also a place in the city in The Causeway called Riva Cafe that does an amazing spicy chicken burger ! <p> Great read Craig , we were looking for a place to have brunch with friends when in Melbourne for a few day early next month . You have sold us on Brunettis but I 'm going to try my hardest this time not venture to Acland St and be tempted by all the cake shops <p> Lord of the Fries is n't vegetarian . I only know this because they have the best chicken nuggets I 've ever had . Another great restaurant is San Paolo Solarino . They have the BEST caesar salad . Their other salads are pretty good . Different from the normal stuff you get everywhere else . If any of you want help , just send me a reply . I can help with the CBD . <p> I think when I leave Melbourne for 15 months the thing I 'll miss the most about it is the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely anything . <p> There are a stack of local cafes out Hawthorn way- just a 10 mins train ride out of the city . My favourites are Axil Coffee Roasters , Crabapple and Liar Liar ( all reviewed on my blog ) . The best burgers in Melbourne are definitely at Beer and Burger Lounge in Richmond and the best dumplings are Hutong Dumpling Bar and New Shanghai ! <p> I absolutely love this blog , so many helpful tips and recommendations for exploring Melbourne without breaking the bank . I 'm planning to go there at the end of the year , so doing research and preparations whilst reading this blog will make my exploring in Melbourne more pleasant and fun . Thank you for doing it and making it so compact . <p> I find myself unable to leave your blog ! I ca n't stop reading it ! I must say you have a very unique voice in writing , which I personally appreciate . Which best place in Melbourne you love to visit ? Let me know what you think . Thanks again Craig .

When we first started , we had a lot of concerns around how it would work traveling around America but over the years we have figured it all out ! <p> Here are our top tips for traveling with dogs in an RV in the USA . ( I 'm sure many of these tips apply to any country you travel with your pets in ! ) <h> Dog-friendly RV parks <p> Most RV parks allow dogs but be aware that some do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to ask what the pet rules are when you are making reservations since you do n't want to show up and then not be allowed to stay ! <p> A lot of RV parks that do allow dogs will have a dog park , which is nice for letting your dogs off leash for a while . <p> All state parks and national parks we have been to have allowed pets , but again it is always worth it to double check . ( In Australia , pets are not allowed in National Parks ) . They do tend to ask for documentation showing that your pet has been vaccinated . <p> That leads us to the forms that you should bring with you when traveling with dogs . <h> Forms to have when traveling with dogs <p> Proof of vaccinations - especially rabies . You should be able to get a printed copy of this from your vet and I would recommend also having them email it to you so you have an electronic copy . <p> Vet records h.aving vet records on hand is less for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if you have to make an unexpected visit to a vet while you are traveling . It will be very helpful for the vet , who has never seen your pet before , to know its medical history . <p> Tags your pet should always wear a collar with their name , your mobile number and a rabies tag . We only take their collars off at night , but make sure to put them right back on in the morning . Even if you do n't think they will ever get out , it is still good to have their collar on as often as possible . You never know when they may see a stray squirrel and make a run for it out of your RV door ! <p> Chip information if your dog has a chip implanted in them , make sure to have the chip number , website , etc .

If you want to bring all of your dogs food with you on your trip , make sure to consider storage space when buying or renting an RV . Those pet food bags are large and heavy ! <h> Leaving your dog in the RV when you go out <p> There will be places you want to explore when you either do n't want to bring your dog or they are n't allowed . No worries ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are a few things to take into consideration . <p> If it is going to be hot , run the air conditioning and also keep some windows open just in case the power goes out at the park . An RV is like a car , so if the power goes out and there is no AC , it will get HOT in your RV . <p> If you are worried about rain or someone climbing in through a window , you can also buy rain covers for your roof vents and run the overhead fans . <p> If you plan on leaving your dog in your RV that you are staying at an RV park that has workers or security that are active during the day in case anything happens . <p> You can either buy or make a paper sign to hang by your door telling people there are dogs in the RV . Leave your phone number in case of fire or any other problem . Be sure to note what kind of dog you have and how many so it is clear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll need to do something about this . Having a neighbor with a barking dog is NOT fun . One of our dogs would bark any time she heard a noise outside the RV if we were not inside with her . We bought a collar that spritzes a citronella mist when she barks . It took one bark for her to realize she did n't like that smell and it has worked ever since . You can pick them up at pet stores or on Amazon . <p> If you take these precautions , your pet will be fine hanging out while you go out to explore . We do n't like to do it , but if we are visiting somewhere a few hours from our campground , we are able to leave our dogs alone for 12 hours we would never go longer than that ! <p> If you are staying at a dog-friendly rv park that has a lot of seasonal RV'ers ( people who come back every year and stay for 4 months or more ) , you may be able to find someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your pet or even take your dog for a walk . <p> Your comfort level on a stranger entering your RV would determine if this would work for you . <h> Vaccines/Preventative Medicine for your dogs- <p> Ensure your dog is up-to-date on their vet visits and vaccines before traveling as well as their flea , tick and heartworm medicine . <p> Tell your vet your travel plans to see if they recommend any additional vaccines . We took our dogs to Colorado and our vet recommended a Lyme Disease vaccine . <p> To take it a step further , you can always call a local vet to the area you 're visiting to see what they recommend for their patients . For example , in South Florida fleas are resistant to many flea medicines that people give their pets in the northern part of the US . <p> And remember , just like with people , certain medicines are available over the counter and some require a prescription . <p> Even further , there are also medicines that can only be prescribed after a vet has seen your pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , the length of time you 'll be away , and what they recommend you purchase ahead of time to have with you . <p> We like to keep a supply of : <p> Heartworm medicine <p> Flea/Tick medicine <p> Ear infection medicine <p> Upset stomach medicine <p> This helps us stay on top of preventive medicine and have a few things on hand in case of unforeseen situations without having to visit a vet on the road . <h> Places to visit when traveling with dogs <p> Traveling with dogs in St.Augustine <p> You can plan your trip around places that allow dogs to participate in activities and tours and even take them out to eat with you . <p> Here are our favorite dog-friendly locations . They 're part of your family , so it 's always cool to include them in your vacations ! <p> Or , you could plan it based around things you want to see and then find things for your dog to do when you get there . Most cities we have visited have a dog park or a local park we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park or a local park we can go to but do n't count on all locations being dog-friendly . <p> Some cities have a LOT more restrictions than others . So if you are someone who wants your dog to come with you more often than not , then do some up front research so you are n't disappointed . <h> How to find dog-friendly destinations in the USA <p> Bringfido.com has an attractions search box where you can put in the city you 'll be traveling to and it will show what pet-friendly things you can do there . It also lists the top dog-friendly places to visit . <p> The other option is to call the Visitor Bureau before you visit . We have had quite a few send us information specifically on things you can do with your pet in the area . <p> We did not know that St. Augustine was so pet friendly for traveling with dogs until we got there . And then the CVB told us they had a big focus on pets and gave us a list of all these pet friendly things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with pets in ( whatever city you are going to ) . And there are usually a lot of results . <p> To see if pets are allowed at a specific attraction googling or else calling ahead is your best bet . Its worth doing because there have been places we were surprised you could bring a dog . We have also seen people show up at some crazy places thinking their pets could come when they could n't . So we recommend calling first to verify . <h> Dog-friendly hotels <p> If you 're thinking you do n't want to travel in an RV , or you want to stay in a hotel with your dog you can . We have stayed at a few hotels with our dogs and a dog-friendly hotel chain- that normally allows dogs is La Quinta . <p> However , we were surprised by some of the more upper-end hotels that offer dog-friendly accommodation too ! <p> Be prepared there may be a large additional fee for you to bring your pet with you or a limit on the number of dogs or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dog if you are planning to be away from your RV overnight <p> There have been a few times we have had to board our dogs . Whenever possible , we have had family traveling with us , or new friends we 've met check on and help out with our dogs . <p> When that was n't an option , we learned that a person who watched dogs out of their home was our best bet . <p> Our #1 recommendation for finding a place to leave your dog is to stop in at the local pet food/bakery , not one of the chain stores , but more the boutique type of locally owned shops . Talk to the owner and see who they recommend . This has worked out really well for us . <p> If that is not an option , make sure you read a LOT of reviews on kennels , and if possible , bring your dog in to visit . This will help you see how they react and feel , as well as seeing how you feel about the place and the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this site to be really helpful when planning travel with our dogs . <p> Traveling with dogs in an RV is the best way to travel , especially for extended travel . <p> In the end , what it really comes down to is that you and your dog will love the fact that you get to hang out together at night , in the morning , and I am sure multiple times sitting under your awning by the picnic table enjoying the outdoors ! <h> About Bryanna Royal <p> Bryanna , her husband Craig , their 4 kids- and 2 dogs sold their house , everything in it , and bought an RV and are now traveling around the US .

@@21820565 @1820565/ <p> I 'm going to share with you eight examples , but there are even more than that . <p> Our style of travel has evolved over the years from solo travel , to traveling as a couple , to being a family of four . So our accommodation preferences have changed as well . Depending on the type of trip and destination , we like to mix up our accommodation choices . <p> Sometimes we stay in hotels but we mostly prefer apartments these days . Other times we stay in vacation homes , condos , or occasionally we stay in hostels if they offer family rooms . <p> What I love about Booking.com is that you can book a variety of accommodation types on the one website " as you 'll soon discover , Booking dot com is more than just hotels . <p> They are literally a one-stop-shop for all your accommodation needs . It has never been easier to book accommodation online . And- I love how simple their website is to use ! <p> And besides having all the major brands , you can find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find elsewhere . <p> Other features I love about using Booking.com : <p> Over one million properties world-wide means greater competition and usually the best deals on hotels <p> You can book now , - but pay later at check in <p> You can make changes to your booking , anytime <p> You get free cancelation on most rooms <p> 24/7 customer service <p> and a- best price guarantee <h> Verified reviews <p> The other nice feature that Booking.com has is the millions of verified reviews . Unlike other websites , only people who have booked through Booking.com and actually stayed at the property can write a review as they receive an email once they have checked out . <p> That means their reviews come from real guests , like you ! <p> To be clear , we are affiliates of Booking.com , which means we receive a small commission if you book through the links on our site . But , we are also paying customers just like you and use them to book our own accommodation , which is why we recommend them as our accommodation provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Hotels <p> The QT Hotel on the Gold Coast is one of the funkiest hotels we 've stayed in . <p> We do n't  stay in hotels as often as we used to , but if it 's a short city stay , or we 're just traveling as a couple , we 're happy to stay in a hotel . <p> If you 're on a short trip and desire a central location , a little comfort , and you do n't mind eating out , hotels are an obvious choice . <p> When we book a hotel in the city , we like to stay in a central area so we can walk to most of the attractions and be close to dining options . <h> 2 . Apartments <p> This is one of our favorite strategies for saving money when we book accommodation , particularly for families or small groups . <p> Apartments- are more practical than a hotel and often cheaper . If you 're traveling with other family members or another couple why not get an apartment big enough and share the cost ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia and we stayed in apartments with three bedrooms which reduced our per-night rates and was much cheaper than two separate hotel rooms . <p> And with apartments you get benefits such as : <p> Access to a full kitchen ( saves you money by not eating out every night ) <p> Separate bedrooms make it easier to put the kids to bed <p> You- have your own laundry <p> More space and privacy <p> Booking.com have a large inventory of apartments to help you find the best deal , wherever you travel . And you can filter your search results based on what 's important to you . <h> 3 . Resorts <p> Shangri-La 's Rasa Ria Resort &amp; Spa in Malaysia was incredible . <p> I must admit , I have become a bit of a fan of staying in a resort. - After all those years in my 20s roughing it as a backpacker , and with two kids , I appreciate the extra level of comfort and amenities most resorts have on offer . <p> However , I 'm not one to lay around a pool all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days on end . So I like staying in resorts that are not isolated but are located within easy access of the local world outside . <p> I 've stayed in some lovely resorts in Thailand , several in my current home state of Queensland , and I envision staying in a few nice resorts in the USA- as a treat on our upcoming road trip . <h> 4 . Hostels <p> Before we had kids , we stayed in hostels often to save money on accommodation . Not only are they a great budget sleeping option , but good for meeting like-minded travelers . <p> On occasion , we still stay in family-friendly hostels but only in private or family rooms . <p> Staying in hostels may not be a great option for the USA due to the lack of quantity and quality , but in places like Australia , Europe , and Asia the network is extensive and the quality is ever increasing . <p> And do n't think of hostels as just dorm rooms for backpackers . Many offer private and family rooms . <p> Benefits of hostels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport and tourist sites <p> A private or family room is typically cheaper than a hotel room <p> Most have cheap and free services such as wi-fi , a laundry , luggage storage , tours <p> Fully-equipped kitchen and laundries <p> Booking.com also have an extensive inventory of hostels around the world . <h> 5 . Motels <p> Like me , youve probably stayed in your fair share of motels over the years , some good and some a little shady . They can range greatly in service and cleanliness depending on the location , the management , and of course price . <p> The- Motel industry basically developed in the 1920s . When long-distance road journeys became more common , the need for easily accessible and inexpensive- overnight accommodation on main routes led to its growth . <p> On our previous road trip across the US in 2006 , we stayed in motels often . The money we saved allowed us to spend extra on experiences and activities . <p> You can find plenty of motels- , including over 9,000 just in the US alone , on Booking.com <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , Western Australia had 5 bedrooms <p> As a family , we appreciate the benefits of staying in a vacation rental ( holiday home ) . <p> If you 're not familiar with vacation rentals , what- you are essentially doing is privately renting a property on a short or long-term basis from the individual owner who has listed their property on a site like Booking.com . <p> These properties could be a home , a condo , a lodge , a cabin , you name it . You have all the comforts of home , except you 're on vacation . <p> Having a " home away from home " gives you the extra space to relax and unwind with living rooms and separate bedrooms , your own full kitchen and laundry facilities , and maybe even your own deck and backyard . <p> Holiday homes can be another great way to share accommodation with others and split the costs . That 's what we 've done on numerous occasions . <p> Go to their website , enter your destination and dates , and filter by ticking the box for " holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an opportunity to live like the locals do . You either rent a room or the whole property from the owner , similar to what Airbnb has to offer . <p> By living where the locals live , rather than say in a hotel or apartment , homestays can provide a more authentic cultural experience . Homestays can range from a few days so you can see the sights , or it could be a longer-term full blown cultural immersion where you stay and learn the language . <h> 8 . Farmstays <p> Weve experienced three farm stays as a family , one in Ireland and two here in Australia . And what a fun and educational experience they turned out to be . <p> Basically , a- farm stay is any type of accommodation on a working farm . Lodging options can be : <p> Cabins <p> Cottages <p> Converted barns/outbuildings <p> Farmhouse guest rooms <p> Platform tents <p> Tent camping <p> Yurts <p> Our kids loved the interactive experience of a farm stay , with opportunities to feed animals , collect eggs and learn how a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and instead offer a peaceful retreat for adults and do not actually have any animals . <p> They can offer a cost-effective and fun family getaway " and if you 're from the city you 'll appreciate the fresh air and wide open spaces for your kids to run around . <p> Hey guys , great blog . One bit to add , which will help you save money when booking a hotel room . When you find a property you would like to book at , via Booking.com and TripAdvisor , google the name of the property and get their phone number or direct email address . Contact them directly and ask what their best rate would be . 9 out of 10 times you will save 10 20% on the rate that you are seeing on Booking.com or the other OTAs .

Its big but very drivable and the roads are excellent . <p> There is such a huge amount of diversity in America . Each state feels very different from the next , both in landscape and in culture . <p> After road-tripping in the US for more than a year , weve still only covered about 60% of the States but we 've learnt a few things about travelling in the country along the way . <p> If you 're an Aussie or Kiwi planning a USA road trip , here are 10 things you should know . <p> Road Leading to Monument Valley <h> Planning a USA road trip <h> 1 . The USA is a BIG country <p> Weve been road-tripping in the US for over a year and we 've still only covered 30 states ! By the time we finish travelling we will probably be up to around 40 . <p> If you 're limited on time , pick a section of the country rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some really good US road trips that you can do in under a couple of weeks if you do n't  have time to drive across the whole country .

You Might Need A Visa for the US <p> If you 're coming to the US for just a few weeks and flying in and out , no problem ! You can enter under the Visa Waiver Program using- ESTA ( electronic pre-approval ) . <p> If you want to stay longer than 90 days or if you plan on also visiting neighbouring countries , the US visa situation is a little complicated . <p> Once you hit US soil , your 90 days starts ticking but it does NOT reset if you cross the border to Canada , Mexico or the Caribbean . <p> In fact , any time spent in these countries counts towards your 90 days in the US if you visit them after you entered America . You can apply for a 6-month tourist visa if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we did it . <h> 3 . Its Cheaper to Hire a Car in the USA from Outside the US <p> Itll definitely be cheaper to book your rental car- before you leave for the USA on an Australia , UK or New Zealand car hire website . <p> Quotes from US car hire companies might look attractive but they do NOT include taxes or insurance , which are paid when you collect the car , so you 'll have to double them to get the true value of the rental . <h> 4 . Buying a Car in the USA Isnt That Easy <p> In the US you have to register the car in a state , probably the one you purchase it in , and get insurance . Both of these things require a US address so if you 're lucky enough to have a friend or relative who can help you , it can be done . <p> We found only one insurer that would cover us as drivers with a foreign license and the insurance was $450 per month ! We managed to negotiate it down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents . <p> You MUST mention you have a foreign license when you buy your policy or you wont be covered if you have an accident . <p> Sunset , Key West , Florida <h> 5 . Do n't  Bring Much Stuff from Home <p> If you need gear for your USA road trip , stock up at a Target or Walmart before you hit the road for items like a car seat , a GPS and a cooler . ( Incidentally , its almost always cheaper to buy car seats and GPSs outright than it is to rent them with your car when travelling in the US . ) <p> If you 're planning on camping on your road trip in America , find a- REI store for all your gear or shop on Craigslist for second-hand supplies . <h> 6 .

Travel in the US is really good value ! <p> We have learnt a few simple tricks that save us a ton on accommodation in America . <p> One of the best tricks is to use Priceline Express Deals , which are like mystery hotels , to get massive discounts on hotels .

Tipping in the US is a Necessary Evil <p> To Australians , Kiwis and Brits tipping for practically everything in the US gets annoying and can feel uncomfortable . <p> Its actually a necessity for workers in the US as minimum wages are incredibly low .

Tip your bartender $1 per drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% of the metered fare .

Be Careful What You Eat <p> The quality of food in the US is generally pretty atrocious . <p> Lots of colourings , preservatives and the dreaded high fructose corn syrup in everything .

That said , you will learn so much by travelling around the US . There is history everywhere ! Especially on the East Coast . <p> You 'll come across lots of fascinating places you 've heard about like Salem , MA ( famous for its 17th-century witch trials ) and many you never knew existed like St Augustine , FL ( which was actually the first city in the US , settled by the Spanish ! ) . <p> We often find a historic trolley tour the best way to get to know these special places and their history . <p> You can also do a bit of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of US history . <p> There is an amazing documentary series on YouTube called Crash Course in US History that will take you from the Native Americans right through to the modern day . <h> Plan Your Trip to the USA <p> Here at yTravel we 've come to rely on a few trusted websites that save us money and time when booking accommodation , flights and car rental .

I will also agree , the things allowed in our food are atrocious . I 'm glad that things are starting to change for the better ! = I used to be a server ( and my husband was formally a restaurant manager ) . I would say that 15% is the minimum for a servers tip . Less than that ( unless the service is bad ) and theyll think you 're cheap mostly because most Americans have no idea that tipping is n't normal in other places around the world ! I love this blog because you guys always paint America in a good light . I know we have our downfalls , but we definitely are n't  all septic-tank-Yanks ! Ha ! <p> Thanks Leah ! ! ! I was a bit worried about how Americans might take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue for us when we are travelling in the US . When we go to a regular grocery store , I honestly do n't  recognise ANY of the stuff in there as actual food . There are so many chemicals and junk in it all ! <p> We also think 15% is what we should tip minimum , and we 've been doing that for over a year , but we met some Americans recently who told us that 15% seemed like a lot and that 10% was more the norm . Tipping is SO confusing ! Definitely something that you need to learn on the go and be conscious of as a foreigner in the US . <p> Another Yank here ( living in Australia , though ! ) . Loved this article , and were planning on " one day " doing the big road trip when our kids are old enough . Thank you for pointing out how amazing hour National Parks are the very best thing about America , in my opinion ! I have to agree with Leah that 15% is the minimum for tipping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think whoever told you 10% might be getting a lot of unhappy servers after he leaves ! = <p> Loved this article too but 10% is really low for tipping unless the service is extraordinarily bad . Maybe it depends on where you are from , but here in NY generally its 15% as a base but not uncommon to tip closer to 20% or more if the service is really good . <p> Tipping is something in wich non americans are indeed confused , but i also believe it is not right , ive stayed several times in the US and have american friends whom live in California , they do n't  tip unless they are very satisfait about the service , and they do n't  do 10 or 15% , they give what ever they see fit . the fact that serving workers do n't  get a proper wage is a problem of the people they work for . but it became so common over there that most strangers keep up with it . to give an example , when i was in a New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiter 10 dollar and said it was ok , he refused because it was not enough , so you see it is a system of wich they take advantage of <p> When entering a state , call into the Visitor Centre . Great information , quite often knowledgeable people working there and usually sheets or brochures with " coupons " for special offers for accommodation and other things ( very well worth it ) . When travelling , be guided by things you see often there will be signs to things which interest you , but which werent publicised . Chat to people you meet as frequently they will give you tips ! <p> Great tips Doug . Yeah we always make an effort to drop into the visitors centre to chat with the folks and get some brochures . And as you say talk with the locals , they often offer the best insider tips ! <p> As an American , I 'd say this is a fantastic list ! I just began discovering the beauty of our US National Parks myself , as I had only visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommending them as travel destinations to everyone I meet . <p> Also agree that our food is pretty gross . I did n't  realize how behind the U.S. is in healthy food options until I headed oversees for the first time . You can find healthier restaurant options in larger cities ( SF , LA , Boston &amp; NYC have thriving healthy restaurant options ) , but its VERY hard is smaller towns and in the Midwest/South . Chain restaurants are everywhere . While farmers markets can be very expensive for travelers , I recommend them as a place for healthier options and its also fun to shop around . <p> Cheers ! Tami <p> P.S. I love that you linked to the " Crash Course " YT channel that 's one of my favorites . <p> Also an American reading this- interesting to see this point of view , but I agree with them allthough I do n't  know about insurance for a traveler to the US . I would recommend leaving half the tip for the hotel after the first or second night and then the other half when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service- I do this in hotels wherever I am , if I 'm going to be tipping the cleaning staff . I also leave the money on a note that says " thank you housekeeping ! " or something like that so there ca n't be any confusion about the fact that the money there is a tip . <p> Totally with you on all of this Bethany . We loved road tripping from New York , up to Canada , then down to Key West . Funny thing was , I expected not to like it much . That trip was for my husband , but we all had a ball , so much diversity and loads of unexpected finds . Big thumbs up for American junk food though , everyone has to try a chili cheese dawg and biscuits and gravy in NOrleans . Great memories ! Ca n't believe you 've been there 12 monhs , time flies . <p> I forgot something else to add I met a British with a pet peeve toward American pricing system because the taxes are not included . He had to carry extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also I discovered that America appears to be famous for filling up a cup of ice for soda . Its like we are paying for ice but not soda . So , when I order drinks especially on the plane , I tell them no ice please . <p> These are great tips for any family road-tripping the U.S. , even for us Americans . We 've traveled more in other countries than our own so we are all looking forward to enjoying all the national parks as you did . <p> Before leaving NYC for our long-term travel , there was a movement happening among a few restaurants which started to include the tip into their prices , which is what 's normally done in the rest of the world . I hope by the time we come back home to do our road trip , this will be the norm . Its just better that people get a living wage from the start . Thank you for these great tips and enjoy the rest of your travels ! <p> Really good advice . I have done a couple of short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more . One other piece of advice is not to get stuck in the " I have to be there by x oclock " mentality . Take the scenic route , you miss so much if you stick to the Interstates and Highways . <p> When booking a rental car online it is quite confusing as it asks if you want all sorts of different things some straight forward but others like whether you want to pay a daily rate for road toll charges . I know these exist but my trip is only loosely planned in so much as I do n't  want to decide lots of the roads I am going to use yet just some key destinations . So should I just pay tolls as I get to them or pay a daily rate just in case so no queuing. ? <p> Totally agree with you . Road trip is definitely the best way to discover the US . Working in an events promotion company in London , I have attended several travel events or foreign culture events and lot of them were about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country is needed to discover it . <p> Hi Bethany ! Safe and Happy travels ! I 'm from the Southern USA and I hope you enjoy our beautiful country ! If you are traveling the U.S. I find the travel websites like booking.com , Hotwire , Priceline , Orbitz , skyscanner , cheapflights just to name a few a must , also priceline and orbits have bundle deals to book flights , hotels and car together and its cheap ! if you stay in a resort or casino watch for hidden cost the websites may not mention such as resort fees and incidental deposits ! the incidentals are usually refundable granted you leave your accommodations with no incidents but it usually takes 3-10 days to get that money back ! Research is key in the U.S. to get the most of your trip ! if u rent a car its cheaper to rent from a car rental rather than an airport ! airports tend to have a lot of hidden tax and deposits ! say we rented a car last month for a southwest tour and the online price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please research your car rental and hotels ! always read the reviews and believe what people say unless you come across a site with several high scores and only a couple of bad ones ! chances are that is a great place to stay ! ! Good luck and have fun ! ! <p> AWESOME stuff ! ! I 'm from Canada , but same stuff applies , as I do many road-trips and shoots through the US of A. One note that a lot of people do n't  realize is the compensation for work done thing . In other words , be careful of any deals . American friend says " I 'll let you stay for a night free if you fix a plumbing problem ? " NO . Although very innocent , border folk consider this compensation for work done without a work permit . Yes , they ( border ) can go through your phone , emails , etc . If they find anything suspect , well . turn around ! Keep in mind . Great stuff ! Thanks ! <p> I was wondering is there a app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down to Miami then to Los Angeles , I would like help with any suggestions on which application to use to create my Itinerary <p> Ken , people should be paid for the work they do as part of their wage . In the UK and many other countries around the world tipping is a bonus for excellent service . Being expected to tip for EVERYTHING feels ridiculous when all the person is doing is what they are expected to , as part of their job role . <p> About tipping : Always , always , ALWAYS check your receipt to be sure the gratuity has not already been added ! Minimum wage is NOT a nationally set rate . Wait staff may make minimum wage , but in some cities , minimum wage is more than I make as a child care provider ! Also , decent produce can be purchased at most any grocery store , and larger ones have a bakery and deli on site . Picnic anyone ? <p> Thankyou for your tips , it 's so nice and useful for me when i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that 's so cheap yeeah , and can safe money for accomodation . In your opinion , where is the best place that can visited in USA ? i really want to going to USA for someday . Are you know Bali , ever you visit in Bali ? many beautiful place that can you visit in here and also you must some traditional food in Bali . Do n't worry about the accomodation , here you can rent hotel , villa , homestay or apartment . When you going to Bali you can stay at http : **30;270;TOOLONG <p> Loved the post .

Place a note in your diary for at least 9-months prior to your passport expiring , this will allow sufficient time to organize your new passport . - <p> Visas not applied for which can result in a refusal to enter the country " check each countries visa requirements . If you apply for a visa online ensure that it is the official government department , there are many private companies offering visa services which look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you tell ? - The fees will be much higher . <p> Onward flight tickets " proof of onward travel , one way tickets are not accepted by airlines on check in and countries on arrival which can result in refusal to board the airline and you may need to purchase a very expensive ticket before you can check in . There are websites available that you can rent a ticket for a small fee for 24 hours e.g. Fly Onward and Best Onward Ticket . <p> Ensure that you have copies of your passports and visas either in an online account or actual photocopies . For Australians , note , if you have your passports stolen whilst traveling overseas the Australian authorities require original birth certificates , not copies , to process the new applications . Ensure that someone at home has access to the originals . <h> Risk #2 Health <p> Traveling without travel insurance " if you ca n't afford travel insurance you ca n't afford to travel ' . Ensure you take a printed copy of your policy with you and emergency contact numbers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a medical ensure that you have receipts , also take photocopies of the claim and receipts when lodging . <p> Vaccination records not up to date be sure to check with your doctor that you are covered for the countries you plan to visit . Ensure that your travel medical document is completed and date stamped when vaccinations are administered . - Take a copy of the document and leave it behind with your original birth and marriage certificates . <p> Incorrect vaccinations for the country you are visiting , for example , Yellow Fever is required when traveling into some countries from another i.e. Costa Rica from Panama . Rules are changing all the time , check regularly before traveling with the appropriate government departments . <p> Medication you require is illegal in the country that you are visiting . A visit to your G.P. will assist in this " there could be a generic brand available . <p> Not sufficient supplies of medication to cover your holiday duration .

Ensure you visit your G.P. and ask him/her to write you a letter explaining what the tablets are , what they are issued for and your actual dosage and keep this in your hand luggage . <p> Emotional support dogs without correct documentation " a visit to your Vet to obtain these documents well in advance of traveling is required . Ensure that you keep checking government departments of the country that you are travelling to , to keep up to date with their regulations . <p> If you are traveling with children ensure that you have medicine that is suitable for their age group . It can be difficult to obtain medicine suitable for children abroad , take sufficient supplies when you travel . <h> Risk #3 Personal Safety &amp; Security <p> The country you are visiting is classified as high risk ' and what it means to you as the traveler . Regular checks with your travel department of your government will keep you informed . Sign up for their travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket with an expired credit card and USD10 currency or equivalent of local currency , if you are pick pocketed at least the thief feels that they have got something . <p> Traveling overland at night especially on buses , ensure that you belongings are close to you and not on the floor or overhead lockers , with a secure lock that can not be opened . <p> Take care when walking around cities late at night/early morning , it is best to avoid this at all times . <p> Arriving into bus stations late at night/early morning in a new country " ask your accommodation to arrange a taxi to meet you at the bus station at your arrival time to take you direct to your accommodation . <p> Carrying or wearing expensive jewellery , carrying large amounts of cash or cameras/technology . Why not leave your expensive jewellery at home and wear costume jewellery when you travel . Instead of carrying large amounts of cash consider travel cards , credit cards and debit cards and just have enough small cash for incidentals . Cameras and technology should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will assist in keeping these items safe . <p> The use of unauthorized Taxi companies . Some countries have authorized Taxi stands when arriving at the airport , where you purchase a ticket for the region you are traveling to e.g. Mexico . Ask you accommodation in advance which taxi company to use , the estimated cost and if they have a taxi service available . <p> Ensure your hotel is located in a safe area of the city and safety and fire regulations are adhered to . <p> If your hotel has a personal safe and it requires a credit card to open and close , use an expired credit card not an active one as the safe can be a skimmers opportunity . <p> If your hotel calls stating there is an issue with your credit card , do not give details over the phone head down to reception to sort out the issue <p> If you are traveling with infants check whether you can purchase baby milk products and baby food where you are traveling , if not take your supply with you . Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communication <p> Ensure that you have left with family and friends your full itinerary , hotel addresses and contact details , cruise ship and tour details etc . <p> Check with your telephone provider that they have mobile roaming in the countries that you are visiting , particularly check the Pre and Post paid . We found they are different coverage . <p> Compile a list of the countries emergency numbers <p> Make sure you have a way to communicate with friends , family , banks and embassy when traveling . Skype and Skype credit , Viber , WhatsApp , and Facebook Messenger . <p> Make sure you have the international number for banks etc. rather than the 1-800 . Look for country code and direct number . <h> Risk #5 Money <p> Advise your banks and credit card providers that you will be traveling to certain countries prior to leaving the country <p> Take photocopies of your cards front and back and leave with family and friends , keep a digital copy on your smart devices <p> If you are traveling with currency or credit cards ensure that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe place whilst traveling e.g. money belt <p> Ensure you have contact details for credit card providers in times of theft or loss . <p> When using external ATMs , ensure that there is a video security camera is aimed at the ATM machine , also check the machine for any loose parts , particularly where you insert the credit card , simply pull hard on any part of the machine that is proud , this will determine if a skimming device has been self adhesive attached . <p> Do not use external ATMs at night unless you can see a camera . <p> Ensure that you can take currency out of country 's ATM using your credit or travel cash card e.g. Cuba <p> Ensure that you have a small amount of local currency available on arrival . <p> Do not take out large amounts of cash with you during the day , use a body money belt when traveling . <p> Check online ( even when overseas ) your balance on credit , debit and travel money cards to ensure that you have not been compromised with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of currency cards should one be compromised you can continue traveling using the other companies card . <h> Pin this to Pinterest : <h> Author Bio <p> Jane &amp; Duncan are Baby Boomers continuously traveling the world on the equivalent of the couple Australian Age Pension .

To my point of view its the best way to get a currency with no fee and have more for the trip . <p> Great tips ! From our long term travels we 've found it really helpful to have some British currency on us to exchange a small amount at the airport and get into a taxi or get some food . Although we told our banks were travelling , at times the bank have still stopped the card which can be so stressful especially when your travelling with kids .

Thanks ! <p> Thanks for these great tips ! So many of them have been lifesavers ( literally ! ) during our travels . We have also found that having 10-20 USD ( preferably in one dollar bills ) stored in a hidden pocket is a great emergency stash . Its never fun to be stuck without cash or a functioning ATM card/machine ! Thanks again and happy travels ! <p> Body money belt works very well but should be concealed under garments . Also , take care when paying for stuff that people do n't  see where you are getting the money from . A money belt also has the downside that thugs may think you are carrying too much money that requires a money bag .. You do n't  want them following you and going after the money belt .

Thanks for your help . <p> I would n't worry about visiting Brisbane , at least not for long . As far as a tourist city , there is n't much to see and do . ITs more of a liveable place . I 'd focus more on Sydney and Gold Coast . For 9 only having 9 days , I 'd fly between the cities . Its about a 10-12 hour drive and its best to do it if you have time to stop off at places along the way as there is so much to see and do .

Just watch the news often enough and you 'll learn all about it . <p> What 's so sad about these- sensationalized- stories which depict only a small truth to the reality of life is that they actually- prevent many people from stepping out into the big wide world to have life changing travel moments ; moments that teach you the world , for the most part , is actually a good place . <p> We have mostly only ever experienced- kindness , helpfulness , compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . <p> Always meeting kind and gentle souls <p> If we discovered the truth that the world is indeed beautiful and full of mostly good people , then each of us might be more willing to do our bit to preserve this kind nature of our world and be the best person we can be . <h> Do n't  Fear the World <p> We often get asked if we are ever afraid putting photos up of our children online and being so public with our life . <p> We do n't  think much about it , and maybe we should , but I come from the belief that the world is not a bad place . I do n't  fear the world , I do n't  fear- peoples- intentions and so because of that I feel quite liberated in the way I can live my life . <p> I- know- the world is not a bad place because in all my travels , even through places like- Africa , which is the " most- scariest and dangerous place on the planet " we have never had one bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , South Africa- safety measures in place <p> Oops sorry I forgot , There was that time I was kidnapped on a motorbike in Sumatraand was sung death songs to , but that is okay , because I survived and it taught me to be more careful in my choices and to be more present . Just a blip really . <p> But , you know , when I was- about- 12 , I was playing tennis with friends down at the local courts , when a car drove down the dirt road beside us , wound down the window and pointed a gun at each of us . <p> I- think it- was a prank on their behalf intended to see how much they could scare the crap out of small children , but an indication- that- the dangers do not just lurk in the alleyways of world travel , they are indeed just - part of this thing called life . <p> It is something that none of us can avoid . We should not be wasting our precious limited time on earth locked inside our homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Richness of Life <p> I love this quote from the book " Sophies World , " <p> " You ca n't experience being alive , without realizing that you have to die . But its just as impossible to realize that you have to die without thinking how incredibly amazing it is to be alive . How tragic that one has to get i 'll before they understand how rich life is and what a gift it is to be alive . " <p> Living in fear is what prevents you from understanding how rich life is and what a gift it is to be- alive . A gift that needs to be cherished and lived fully doing those things that make your heart sing , despite the apparent- dangers- that lurk in the shadows . <p> Kind and helpful Guides- Mt Fansipan , Sapa <p> Wandering Earl wrote a post the other week , " Why I do n't  panic when my backpack goes missing , " which really highlights , that he too , has discovered the world is not scary after 11 years of travel . And trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constant Negative News <p> What Gary Vee said is right . <p> Think about it , how often do you tell your friends on facebook , twitter , foursquare what you are doing at any one time . <p> ( Im- sure to some people it could possibly have happened to , but have the incidents risen from what was- happening- before- the growth of social media ? ) <p> Society has you believe that the world is a dangerous place- because- that is what SELLS <p> How morbid is that ? <p> What is wrong with society that we are addicted to bad news ? <p> Yes addicted . <p> Some people spend hours every day watching it on TV or reading about it in newspapers . <p> Most of the time I go about my life completely oblivious to what is going on in the world , because I do not pay attention to the Constant Negative News . <p> If there is something I really need to know , I usually find out because someone will tell me . <p> I do n't  want my head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never leave the house . <p> Murders , rapes , break ins , all happening within a five mile radius from my home . <p> Safe to travel ? <p> Forget that , its not safe to take the nails out the window , unlock the deadlock and climb over the six foot fence into the big bad neighbourhood . <p> Switch off the news , start living your life and you 'll soon discover that the world is really not dangerous and it is safe to travel . <p> Its- like- all things , even- when- you are- walking- down- the- main road of your town , you just have to make smart choices and keep your wits about you . <p> Here is the number one way to guard against your safety while travelling . <h> Be Present <p> Be aware of your surroundings , be aware of what is happening in the area you are travelling , because yes , some places are involved in machine gun wars , and okay , so that is not safe to travel to and probably a gigantic risk on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I bet if you are present , you will see things that are about to happen , your instincts will kick in and alert you to danger . You will have all your senses engaged so you will know intuitively how to act in order to get yourself out safely . <p> Of course , there is the possibility that something can go wrong , but as your news will tell you that possibility exists in your very own town , and that does not stop you from going to work , going to dinner , having fun and promoting it on facebook . <p> Why not do the same in another country ? <p> Its not frightening . Its not scary , it is down right enjoyable and liberating . <p> Hiking the Narrows Zion NP <p> So yes , it is safe to travel the world . <p> The dangers are there , I know that having lost a friend in Africa , but the dangers are every where . Do n't  let it stop you from living the life you dream . <p> Do n't  give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life is too short to let fear stop you from living . <h> What are you thoughts on whether it is safe to travel the world or not ? <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I was just thinking about this very issue yesterday , as I was thinking about out last trip to Madrid ( in October ) . At the time , the US Secretary of State had issued a worldwide travel warning because of some terrorist stuff going on somewhere in the world . <p> My mother called me and admonished me to be careful , and told us not to ride the subway in Madrid ( she has never been to Europe , so she was unaware of how nearly impossible it is for budget travelers to stay off of public transit in large European cities ) . <p> It made me thinkand I came to the conclusion that I do n't  feel any less safe in another country than I do at home . Bad things can happen anywhere . This " feeling at home in the world " is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt this way . When you get out into the world , you see that everybody is essentially the same , same fears and desires , and that people are generally just like you and me in a lot of ways . <p> Great comment Shanna and I love the example you have used . I so agree with you . It was n't till I started travelling that I also understood that the world is not scary and we are all the same . in fact , i feel more scared walking around my home town at night with Craig , then I ever did walking the streets of London on my own late at night . <p> To be honest travelling can put you in some unusual predicaments that you would not generally encounter . This alone can scare off some people who would not normally venture out of their comfort zone . I am a firm believer in getting a good understanding of the places that I am travelling to and making informed decisions . I have experienced my fair share of scary moments during my travels but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they have made me the person that I am today and a great story to tell . Travel is one of the most educating and rewarding things that you can do in your life . It is better than any text book and the memories you create and friendships you build are more valuable than any fancy mansion or sports car so do n't  let the fear of what might happen stop you from experiencing it . <p> Yes . Venturing out of the comfort zone can be terrifying . I loved the fact that these unusual predicaments actually showed me what I was capable and helped build up my confidence . So worth stretching the comfort zones for . And as you say it all makes it a great story to tell in the end ! That is half the fun . We have so many crazy stories . Ca n't wait to collect more . Its all about the memories ! ! <p> Before I left for my travels in Latin America and even now I get questions about safety . I always tell people that those scary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " parts of the world can still happen at home too . Of course , I am diligent to take the precautions to keep myself safe wherever I am . <p> Yes . people seem to think they do n't  exist in their home town and only occur once you travel . The dangers are everywhere . Best to just live your life and just make smart choices and be present . 15 years of travel and I am still healthy and whole with not a scratch to be found <p> I was thinking about this when I saw the " Best 45 Photos of 2011 " or something along those lines . The vast majority were of war , death , natural disastersincredibly moving but all very sad . How frustrating that our most moving images are all so negativeI was so much more moved by the ones that showed a human relationship , a smile , a bit of joy , a reminder that not ALL is bad in the world . We need to start thinking more like that , and having less of an attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were incredibly moving and incredibly sad . I think that the photos and " news " that move us the most are always at either end of the spectrum because great joy and utter despair are things that every single person on the planet can relate to . Its such a shame , though , that the news always , always focuses on the negative situations even if they do n't  exist ! There 's a scene at the start and end of the film Love Actually that uses real footage of the arrivals hall of Heathrow Airport . Now , that 's one of the most moving things I 've ever seen If you have n't seen it , give it a go even if you do n't  like the rest of the film . As for the dangers while travelling , I really hope you do n't  mind me sharing this link here about what happened to me last week : LONG ... <p> Thank you for sharing your post Abi , it is such a great post and I am always happy that others share with our community . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing okay then , that our lives are n't  nowhere near as bad . if we just learned to stop relying on comparison to make us feel good about ourselves then we might be more inclined to just want to hear good news . <p> World is too safe to travel the most areas . when i go for travel to India , I got lot of places that tells their own story that so beautiful and also to enjoy these places and other things to maintain and celebrate to have fun and enjoy of these . world is not so bad to travel the ancient and modern temples . In this story mentioned risks and acts are too excellent and wonderful to manage all these things . Thanks for this post . <p> I completely agree Caz ! Ive been to many places where friends had said : " that country is pretty lawless " meaning dangerous but when you get there you find normal , kind people living their everyday lives . The only bad thing that has ever happened to me was when after months of independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just proves to me that only when you make yourself a target is the world a dangerous place . <p> Exactly Natasha ! ! Great point . We always felt safer travelling with the locals in Africa .. We 'd see the big overland tourist trucks go by which were a very big target . Even then , though , , little even happens to them . <p> Great post . Recently wrote about this same topic on one of my sites . Threats of violent crime , terrorism , disease all of these are greatly exaggerated . I would say the warn area where you do have to take some extra caution is road safety , which is far and away the biggest threat to travelers . In most destinations , road accidents in the number one cause of injury/fatality for travelers . That said , even when it comes to road travel , there are steps you can take to lower the risk ( avoiding night travel , for example ) . <p> Totally agree with you on this one ! And that is how we lost our friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scares me a little overseas , but as you say you can take plenty of steps to lower the risk <p> Its an odd conundrum really . The best stories are the misadventures , disasters and other situations that really get your adrenaline up . Despite that though , travel is usually incredibly safe even in those more heart racing moments . So , which stories do people hear ? Which stories should we tell ? <p> Tell all the stories as it is part of the adventure . The misadventures are great stories to tell and as long as you came out the other end okay then its all good ! The misadventures are never as many as the safe ones though <p> I 'm a big believe in the idea that fear begets fear . As long as were smart and travel safely ( i.e. do n't  go wearing your American flag bikini into the middle of a Middle Eastern war zone ) , we should be fine . I feel sorry for people who let fear of the unknown prevent them from experiencing all the amazing adventures this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ! Once you do travel the world does become less scary every day . But if you just watch the news , well like you said , it does seem like quite a scary place . But that 's the problem , bad news sells , good news does n't  sell that well , so there are a disproportionate number of fear stories . Since I have been traveling this whole year , I have been following news a lot less , which means I see a lot less bad news , so world seems much better now . And skipping on news is n't that scary really , if something really important happens , it will be on twitter anyway . <p> The more I travelled the less scary the world became and the more friendly it was . I find that by not watching the news now , I am highly sensitized to any bad news or scary TV shows . I get really distressed if I watch them I used to enjoy watching Criminal minds but now can not watch it , it freaks me out so badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it always seems to get a bad rap . There is heaps of crime here in my home town- i find it way scarier than most places I have travelled to . You do have to think more carefully about where you go and what you do now with kids but I still think it is safe to travel with them <p> " Dangerous times , You should not go to dangerous places . " Simple and basic things . I think an important thing . What risk criteria ? I think it is judged by the people divided . With that in mind , the authors pointed out is important . " Know your risks and act accordingly . " I completely agree . <p> How refreshing to read this article ! I often get asked about safely and the good old " are n't  you scared to travel these days ? " Sure , bad things can happen sometimes . But they can happen anywhere . And like you say , Caz , should we lock ourselves away and hope for the best ? No way . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more positive approach : encouraging people to see that , for the most part , travel is not only safe but one of the best things you could ever , EVER do . Thanks for such a great post ! <p> Pleasure Cherina , its nice to be able to share the truth as I am sure there are many people not living their dream life of travel because they do fear for their safety . You may hear of one bad story amongst thousands of great ones . for the amount of people that travel there really is n't many bad things happening . <p> I understand everything you are saying but how can I trust myself going some places that has different rules than mine , how do I know I 'm not gon na svre the crap out of the people in other countries .. this is what scares me ! <p> Every country has different rules , you just have to go there with an open mind and a willingness to learn and accept . It is not as hard as you think it will be . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot to offer as do they <p> Thanks so much for posting this . I am constantly amazed at how fearful people are and how they use fear as an excuse not to experience the world . My aunt recently moved to Mexico and with all the bad news in the American press everyone always assumes that she is one step away from being kidnapped . In my experience , US cities are the most dangerous places . Two years ago , a wanted child rapist was arrested in front of my house in Atlanta . It is safer to travel = <p> I always love your positive messages ! I do get so tired of negative news . But I also look at it like , at least the bad things that happen are still rare enough to make the news when it becomes too common to get peoples attention , well , I do n't  want to live in that world ! In the meantime , the beauty of us all having blogs is that we can continue the positive stories ! <p> I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . No matter how much preperation that you put into it you really never know how it is going to be untill you really get there .

Do not miss Arches National Park- its our absolute favourite in Utah . Many beautiful hikes , Delicate Arch is amazing , but also the hike to the Landscape Arch and the part behind it we went up to Partition arch and it was really worth it . If you can , however , try not to travel there is summer the heat is unbearable and its difficult to get much hiking done in temperatures of 40-C and more . Another tip . Scenic Hwy 128 they say its Utahs best kept secret . Do n't  miss it its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canyonlands NP is also really worth it . Lots of beautiful hikes . Coyote Gulch looks really nice too ( a bit like Australias Red Centre ) , but we did n't  get the chance to get there yet .

And of course Bryce , Zion and Monument Valley , but you got those already . <p> Thanks for sharing your tips on things to do in Utah . Were excited to spend some quality time in this state . Definitely planning to hot all the NAtinal Parks , including Arches National Park . And thanks for the heads up on Scenic Hwy 128 , sounds amazing ! <p> Just a few thoughts from someone who grew up there .

The drive through Provo Canyon with a stop at Sundance , a milkshake at the " train " station in Heber , and a dip in the hot pots at the homestead makes for one of the most beautiful drives in Utah . Flaming Gorge and Dinosaur National Monument are worth a stop in Eastern Utah . <p> Hey Janet , sounds great about the whitewater rafting and mountain biking , two things we love to do .

If its more than one , the WiWander might make better sense . <h> How to book WiWander : <p> Book and pay online via wiwander.com at least five days before departure . <p> Your pocket Wi-Fi router is delivered to your address at least one day prior to your departure . <p> Enjoy unlimited Wi-Fi every day throughout your entire overseas trip . <p> A courier collects the router from your address one day after you get home . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons .. the price per day is the only thing that would hold me back you are right though , its great if you are going between countries on a quick trip . If there for longer then $20 per day and $15 for the states is a bit high compared to getting a SIM card ( which is what I usually do in the States there 's a crossover period where a SIM card is more economical depending on how many days I am there . Looking at this , it would be about 5 or 6 days but I totally agree , that its great having it from arrival . I always go and grab a sim card when I arrive which is a bit of a pain ! You can get by with free WiFi to check in at home when you arrive at the airport but you cant call anyone until you get a card . I have had the wonderful experience of trying to get an Uber while still trying to hook into airport wifi before its a fine line as to how far you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yep . I started that process of getting the uber on the free airport wi-fi before remembering I had WiWander and got connected up to do it . Made it so much easier . I think its a good choice for business travellers or digital nomads as well because of the unlimited wi-fi . Or , of course , any families who have a Netflix addiction ! ! ! <p> ha yes that 's true and if you upload a lot of photos with wifi its handy too I will definitely consider it next time especially if I go less than a week and as you say , in Europe it can be handy if you are using it for a few things . And big conferences inevitably have WiFi issues so you can be everyones best friend haha . <p> Absolutely agree with your observations , and each traveller would have to weigh up the get a local SIM data option ; biggest thing about this and mounting your own WiFi point with your phone is the security advantage . Free public and shared WiFi in overseas hotels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much exploitative stuff out there now . And the convenience with phones and cameras now syncing to the cloud as your take stuff devices like this make it seamless . It is always fun watching those coming back from a day out going onto shared free WiFi in their stay place and watching everything slow to a crawl as they all upload . Nope , self contained WiFi is the answer using this or any solution . And . Yep $20 per day would be OK for a week so measure your length of stay carefully . <p> You do n't  know of any service like this that is based in other countries ? I 'm from the US and I have n't found anything as awesome sounding as WiWander stateside Would have been incredibly useful in Israel when we were there for two weeks the wifi on our travel bus was so bad . <p> Did you get to try it on the plane ride as well ? If you did , did it work ? <p> This seems AWESOME . I think it would depend on the price per day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , and that could get pricey . But its definitely something to keep in mind , for shorter trips . RWhttp : **34;302;TOOLONG <p> I never knew there was a device like this , and when I read this , I had my breath taken away.Its just amazing how easy it is now to be on the internet any time given.But , to be honest , this device is a waste of money , because not only is it expensive , but also , when somebodys on vacation , they need to enjoy their holidays , not be on their phone all day long.For blog owners like you , it is pretty useful , but for other kinds of people , like me and others , it can be helpful , but not that much . <p> Thank you for this useful advice , I want to go traveling next year and I am buying all my gear over the next coming months .

Have you got any other places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ordered this to take away when my daughter and I go to the US next week . Between the two of us we go through 15gig of data a month , which is a lot . What with my blog , 3 social media accounts and her blog and social media accounts , it made sense to get a device like this as we will be blogging on the road . Yes its expensive but the journalist in me knows the risks of open/free wifi and I am just not willing to take the risk anymore . I 've also just gotten a new wifi sim card for my camera so need the connectivity . Will look forward to checking it out .

And by that , I do n't mean oh is n't this wonderful , darling ' . Havana really is full of wonder and one of the best things to do in Cuba . <p> From the crumbling buildings to its curious narrow streets brimming with life and ingenuity , Havana is Cuba 's capital for a reason .

Trinidad <p> Apart from Havana , Trinidad has to be the most historic city in Cuba . <p> Similar to Havana , the Old Town section here is UNESCO heritage listed ( as a World Monument ) , but unlike Havana , this part of town is only accessible on foot or horseback . Carts are also allowed and commonly seen . <p> The narrow cobbled streets and the low , leaning , brightly coloured houses are iconic to this city .

It 's about 2 hours east of Havana . <p> The American mafia wanted to build a stretch of casinos from this peninsula all the way to Havana " so naming it the Casino Coast . <p> However , when Castro took control from the corrupt Batista , he kicked the mafia out , who then started Las Vegas in Nevada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , and ordinarily we 'd be voting for this one to be a priority to visit . <p> The problem is the resorts lining the beach here utterly spoil it . All-inclusive package deals keep unwitting and unwelcome tourists in their complexes where the beaches are guarded and locals are not allowed . <p> There is even a boom gate at the start of the peninsular stopping Cubans from entering . <p> Interestingly , outside the confines of these huge resorts , Cuban life does carry on in Varadero with relative normality . <p> There are classic American cars , casa particular , little shops and bars . It 's just tainted by the legacy the Cosa Nostra left behind . <p> Further away east towns like Santiago de Cuba and Baracoa offer amazing beaches , beautiful towns , exciting adventures and a path far less trodden . We did n't make it there . <p> But it 's a matter of yet than never ! <p> We ca n't wait to get back to Cuba and explore more of this fascinating country . <h> Where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Cuba , check with our accommodation partner- Booking.com. - 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Cuba sounds amazing , I really want to check it out soon , before things change too much ! Interesting about Varadero , I hear so much about it but I never knew about the downsides of it . I get bored of resorts after one or two days , so do n't  think I 'd be stopping too long ( if at all ) anyways . <p> We definitely got bored in the first day or so , Claus and because wed never stayed anywhere else like that before , we just felt really out of place and a bit lost ! I hope Cuba does n't  change too much Cubans are pretty resilient as far as holding onto their culture goes . Let 's hope it stays that way ! J <p> I would agree that varadero can be skipped as I just returned from there and was n't a fan .

Varaderos a funny place , is n't it ? Well definitely add Cayo Coco and Guardalavaca to the list for our return visit . Holguin is already on the list though our guide was from that part of Cuba and could n't say enough good things about it . Ca n't wait to return . As far as the beaches go , perhaps it was just the for resort we were in that it applied other than the resort staff we could n't see any other Cubans .

Send me an email with further questions about my country and I will be happy to assist you . <p> Ohh man , I love how you can look at photos of Cuba from last week and from 40 years ago and basically have no idea it was n't taken the same week . When I tell people about Cuba , I say imagine that someone closed the doors in the 50s and not a single thing has changed since then ! Its changed a little , thou not much . If your a baby boomer this will likely make you feel like a kid again . Go fast thou , its gona change soon . Coming from Canada , i 'd recommend booking into Varadero , it was cheaper then todo 10days all inclusive then just flying to Havana . We got to the resort , unpacked and hit the road ! Go To Cuba , we also took a bunch of kids baseball gear and drove out into the country side giving it away .

I am so glad we got to go there before they opened it up again , and yes I remember the locals lamenting what had been done to their beloved Varadero . Love your article Jim it brought back many memories of playing bongos on the roof of a pub after too many mojitos , dancing salsa in an out of the way bar with only locals in sight , walking the back streets of Havana and finding all the little LONG ... hole in the wall eateries that the locals started through their kitchen window , and the best part sitting on a couch with an ageing gentleman telling me about his time in the Buena Vista Social Club while a Grammy Award sat humbly on the wall above my head . His name was Amadito Valdes and as a fan of the movie and the soundtrack , and a drummer myself ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely say that I never wished my fading Spanish would come back than that afternoon with a beer in hand wishing we did n't  need a local friend we had met to interpret for us . Surreal just the same . Would love to go back and take our kids . And the cars those cars ! <p> Very relevant post especially with Cuba opening up now . I have to agree about Varadero I spent two days there but felt it was a typical tourist place , of the kind where visitors do n't  really leave their hotel or resort . Other places see tourists as well of course , but they also show more of the real Cuba . Great guide ! <p> Cuba has always been a destination I 've wanted to go . Now that we Americans can visit safely , I 'm looking forward to ticking it off my travel bucket list . Once I finish my escapades in Southeast Asia , it will be one of my first stops since its a mere 90 miles from my home state ! <p> Cuba was definitely one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 years . Hired a car to drive around , so saw a good mix of quiet spots and the tourist hot spots . Cienfuegos was great , but I have to disagree with you on Varadero . Yes , while I was there I complained about the tourists that were flying in only for Varadero , not for Cuba , I complained about the prices , I complained about the lack of authentic cuban culture , I complained about the resorts . But when I got home , the photos showed a beach that must be one of the most beautiful in the world with crystal clear water . <p> We visited all the cities you recommended and went to Varadero , I did n't  think Varadero was that bad . We stayed in a Casa a block from the beach only $30 , we were on the beach end far away from the all-inclusives . I too am nervous what will happen to the beach as tourism increases . <p> Hi Sarah , I will traveling to Cuba in the near future . Did you visit Vinales ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company ? We would like to do a day trip . Any information is greatly appreciated . Thanks .. <p> Hi Jim , A group of us will be traveling in late June . My question , is it fairly easy to find an independent travel guide ? During our stay we would like to travel to Vinales for the day and will need a guide and transportation . Would like to have lunch and a tour of the tobacco farm . <p> Dear Velia , I just had the most amazing personal tour of Cuba thanks to Royal Cuba Trip and I am now helping out to advertise their tailored made tours . Have a chat ( E/Sp ) on whatsup with the Boss , Bladimir Bell ( +506 870 73810 ) , a pure cuban based in Costa Rica . <p> Hi Velia . I highly recommend Cuban Adventures they arrange personal and small-group tours around Cuba . This is how we explored Cuba and loved it . Our guide was amazing and everything was very well organised . https : //cubagrouptour.com/ <p> Remembering if you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot you will want to take an ice cream or an ice cream soda you will find on Sundays along with kilometricas queues because the Cuban government says the ice cream and capitalist invention and not to encourage capitalism can only be consumed on Sundays and soda I no longer guarantee you if you will find . anyway the beaches are beautiful <p> That article gives me the idea to visit Cuba soon . Is it good to visit Cuba in December ? How will be the weather there ? We ares baby boomers from Canada and want to plan the trip ourselves . Is it doable travelling inCuba ? We want to see diffrents places : LaHavane and others , and stay sometime near a beache . I readed below someone suggested to book a package 10 days into Varedero . From there , how we could go around and visit differents places that need more time ? What are your recommandations ? Thanks <p> Hi Thi . Yes , December is a great time of year to go its when we went actually ! Its not too humid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would avoid Varedero as much as you can .

Cuba will be country #30 for me . Some help from everyone would be appreciated or Kim , let 's keep each other informed on what we find . Thanks ! <p> My husband and I visited Cuba last Christmas .

Havana is particularly beautiful . The Malecon , Havanas promenade not only belongs to the tourists , but the hell is going on at Carnival time ( June ) . The Cayo Coco is known for its paradise beaches <p> Do n't  agree about Varedero I thought it was absolutely beautiful and our hotel &amp; area we were in seemed very welcome to locals ! There was Cuban locals on the beach and we did n't  see any gates on the beach .

If anywhere to avoid I 'd say Havana ? But I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would honestly avoid Cienfeugos over Varadero ( but that depends on what you 're looking for ) . There 's nothing exciting in Cienfeugos , the same can be said for Varadero but I had more fun in the all inclusive resorts and walking the city around Varadero than I did in Cienfeugoes . Another that can probably be avoided is Santa Clara . I want to go back and see different areas , just hard to guage how much time is really needed in each area . I got bored quick in Santa Clara and Cienfeugos . Also , Trinidad and Vinales are a must . <p> Casey , I 'll be leaving in 12 days to visit Havana , Trindad and Cienfieugo and we will try to fit in Vinales . Do you have anything else we need to know about our trip , there will be 6 people in my group . we will be staying in AIRBNBs and we will be there for 7 days .

It has some of the best beaches in the country , amazing nightlife and an awesome vibe . <h> Best Time of the Year to Visit Orlando <p> The best time to visit Orlando is in October and March . Each month is warm enough for you to take full advantage of beaches , water parks and all the other outdoor activities , but without the humidity that the summer is notorious for . <p> October tends to be less crowded at the theme parks than March ( popular with school spring break ) , but there is always the looming threat of a hurricane interrupting your trip though the likelihood for that is minimal . <h> Getting There &amp; Away <p> With Orlando being such a popular destination , direct routes from most major airports in the United States are almost always available and competition keeps prices reasonably affordable . <p> Direct flights from destinations in Europe and South America are also plentiful . <p> Orlando is served by both busses and rail , but the logistics of getting to the main tourist corridor are cumbersome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport . <h> Best insiders tip for Orlando <p> One of my favorite local spots is tubing down the Rainbow River .

Ha ! But Orlando is actually growing quite nicely . There are more and more downtown businesses opening and a new arts center will open in a few years . And not too far down the road is a new tech center . So in 30 years , itll be even better ! Ever ride a hammock in a hurricane ! <p> There is a pretty clear distinction between Theme Park Orlando and everything else . Most travelers to Orlando never experience the everything else part , so its surprising when they read that there is more to Orlando . And yes , that cake was delicious just ask my expanding waistline ! <p> What a great article ! I have been to Orlando many times ( my parents live there through the winter ) and you 've put me onto some new spots ! <p> Love it or hate it , Orlando really has a lot to offer even if you hate big theme parks . Weeki Wachee is certainly worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a lovely spot and the mermaid show is really something . You can read about our visit at LONG ... We have enjoyed many day trips to Mt Dora and Winter Park , both fun places for an excellent meal , just wandering around and visiting the playgrounds with our toddler . Tampa ( including Busch Gardens and scenic Ybor City ) and Clearwater are also within 90 minute drives to the west of Orlando , and make enjoyable day trips . <p> DINING IN ORLANDO WITH KIDS : Visiting Orlando , it 's easy to find yourself eating at fast food and large-scale chain restaurants where you often have to trade off a delicious meal in favor of a family-friendly place . But there are some great family-friendly options which will please both kids AND adults . Wolfgang Puck Express in Downtown Disney Marketplace offers delicious brick oven pizzas , pastas and fresh salads in a casual family-friendly setting . Boma at Disneys Animal Kingdom Resort has an excellent African-themed buffet with something for everyone and the service is fantastic . <p> Chef Mickey 's at Disney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are lots of options on the buffet to please even the pickiest of eaters and kids love table visits from their favorite Disney characters . Our most recent visit to Chef Mickey 's was with my niece who is allergic to nuts , and we were blown away with how accommodating the staff were to make sure she had many safe options . The Contemporary Resort is handy because it is on the Disneys Monorail system , and it is a great vantage point from which to watch the evening fireworks shows . The best spot is actually the smoking area on the hotel 's terrace " sounds horrible , but there is lots of space up there , and it is very easy to get away from anyone smoking ( though in our experience , there are few smokers out there anyway ) . <p> You need to call in advance to make reservations for Boma and Chef Mickey 's at 1-407-WDW-DINE . Be aware at Disney , a reservation does n't actually secure you a table at the allotted time " it just means you will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later time " and inevitably , you will need to wait for your table . So expect a wait , bring some activities to keep the kids busy , and enjoy your meal ! <p> If you find yourself in Haines City , Lake Wales or Winter Haven ( in any case , this place is worth the drive ) and have a big appetite , check out Manny 's Chophouse . Mannys has excellent seafood , sandwiches and ribs in huge portions . There 's always a line-up and they do n't take reservations , so be sure to go early and call ahead to get on their seating list . If you do n't  feel like waiting , call ahead for take-out . Manny 's is very busy , and though not uncomfortably loud , it is unlikely fellow diners will be disturbed ( or even hear ) a fussy baby or toddler . <p> The town of Celebration is home to several tasty options . There 's a branch of Tampa 's famous Columbia Restaurant with a kid 's menu in addition to adult favorites like their renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes . The Celebration Town Tavern serves up an extensive menu of New England-style favorites and has an extensive kid 's menu . I ca n't leave Orlando without having their Maine lobster roll sandwich . From the end of November to the end of December , Celebration also hosts nightly snow falls ( check out LONG ... which kids get a kick out of . <p> What awesome tips from Ben ! I had no idea Orlando had that many non-Disney related things to do ( although I do love me some Disney ) . Cocoa Beach looks beautiful , and The Dessert Lady and Pine Twenty2 will definitely be on my list if I roll into Orlando when I 'm in Florida next year . <p> May have to give the skydiving a miss though , getting light-headed just looking at that photo ! <p> I imagined there 's stuff to do in Orlando besides the parks if one really looked , yet I had no idea Orlando had festivals and skydiving opportunities ! If I ever make it there , I hope to come for one of the festivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing ! Ill be in Orlando for a conference ( at a Disney resort ) in September and been trying to plan my visit and figure out what else we can do while there . This will come in so handy . Thanks ! : ) We 've never been to Florida and I 'm missing the beach so bad , so were hoping for a few days before or after to rent a car and drive to the coast . I know you suggest many Miami beach , but what would be your suggestion for something a little more quiet , yet beautiful beach ? Atlantic or Gulf ? <p> Sabrina , from Orlando , there are two beach options : Cocoa or Clearwater . Cocoa Beach is about 45 minutes from Orlando , so its a bit closer , but the beach is average ( not great ) Ron Jon Surf Shop offers free parking . Clearwater Beach on the Gulf Coast is much nicer , but the drive is further . Either are great choices . I love the convenience of Cocoa . <p> Thanks for the tips ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to the crazy distances here anything within maybe 3 hours would be totally fine for a 3 day trip = I checked out Clearwater beach . Looks very nice ! are all the beaches close to the city though ? Is there anything a little more natural maybe ? And on the off-chance that this is a possibility . do you know if there is any scuba diving within a 3-hour radius of Orlando by any chance ? Its not a prerequisite , but would sort of be the cherry on top since we have n't been in a while . <p> The beaches are n't  close to the city per se , they are about 45-75 minutes , but its an easy drive . If you want natural , fresh water , check out Wekiwa Springs or the Rainbow River . Both are equaly great fresh water escapes . For SCUBA , your best best is to drive 3 hours south to Ft . Lauderdale/Miami/Boyton Beach . There are plenty of outfitters out there ! <p> We just found out our 2 year old grandchild will be visiting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? She likes everything from climbing to art projects . The Disney character breakfast scared her 6 months ago , so well wait a bit before going to a theme park . Thanks ! <p> Downtown has lots of places to explore . The Relax Grill is an amazing place to grab a meal and enjoy a view of Lake Eola . Walk around Thornton Park , stop by the Farmers Market on Sundays , and take a swan shaped paddle boat out in the lake <p> Its been a few years since I visited Orlando , but hands down the most fun we had was at Discovery Cove . Its a great place for kids of all ages and us adults had a lot of fun too . We swam with dolphins , stingrays and countless others salt water fish . We relaxed in our own private cabana ( I highly recommend splurging ) and enjoyed breakfast and lunch while we were there its included in the price ! <p> I love Orlando . I must go there 6-8 times a year . The theme parks are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like shopping at Old Town , Downtown Disney , and all the little souvenir shops in Kissimmee on 192 . They always have discounted merchandise , a lot cheaper than what you will get in Disney . But Orlando does have a lot to do . You have done a good summary of all the major attractions . And I like your reference to the tubing at Rainbow Springs . Yes , Orlando does offer a lot of state parks to go canoeing , camping , horseback riding , etc <p> The Yum Yum Cupcake Truck is one of our favorites ! I 'm so happy to see them get some love . My family and I visit Orlando once a year as our big family vacation . We always stay within walking distance of Disney . Disney has some of the best food !

@@21820592 @1820592/ <h> Have You Thought About Repositioning Cruises ? <p> We certainly had not heard about them until last year when a fellow house sitter traveled from Panama to Portugal and taking a reposition cruise could be a new way of traveling for you ! <p> After downsizing and selling up everything we owned we now travel the world house sitting and writing about our adventures on our baby boomer travel blog . Travel costs are our #1 expense item and we are always looking for travel hacks- to maximize our travel dollar and finding discount cruises is one way we do it . <h> What are repositioning cruises ? <p> Cruise companies reposition their cruise ships from continent to continent to commence the next season e.g. Europe to the Caribbean . <p> Repositining cruises are one way the traveler can win too " fares are between 30% to 70% off the full price meaning cruise travel is more affordable for you . <p> Instead of arriving at a new destination jet lagged and exhausted from a 9-hour flight , we arrive refreshed , relaxed and raring to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the time you reach your destination you are in sync with the country you are visiting . <p> We had expected a lower level of service and less entertainment and activities on our repositioning cruise , but that was certainly not the case . <p> At times one of the bars may have closed for renovation and repair but that did not hinder the experience on board at all for us or other guests . <h> Which cruise ship did we travel with ? <p> We had a three-month house sitting assignment in Panama and needed to arrive early October . Our reposition cruise started in Bilbao , Spain on the 17th September with port visits to Lisbon- in Portugal , St Maarten and Aruba in the Caribbean and arriving into Colon in Panama 16 days later . <p> It is a Spanish speaking ship , but we never needed to worry as English was the second language for all those on board . - A great way to hone up on your Spanish skills ! <h> What did the repositioning cruise cost ? <p> As we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inside cabin over 9 nights : <p> US$237.50 per person <p> Government taxes US$210.00 <p> Total per person US$447.50 <p> Cost per day per person US$30.00 <p> The fare included all meals , all drinks , and entertainment . <p> The drinks package could be upgraded to premium brand spirits but we felt that was not necessary . We enjoyed our many different types of cocktails , red and white wine as well as sparkling wine . <p> Cocktail hour on board our repositioning cruise <p> As on all cruise ships , gratuities are not included . We paid 330 Euros for the two weeks for the two of us . <p> Hot tip for singles cruise <p> This is a great way for solo travelers to travel too . - There was no singles cruise supplement charged . Some couples even booked two rooms , one for their luggage and one for themselves . <h> How did we choose our cabin on the repositioning cruise ? <p> We were given a tip from a fellow blogger to choose a cabin on Level 3 and at the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centre on board ships is located on the lowest level ? There is less movement in rough weather the lower down you are . <p> And if you choose a cabin at the front of the ship there is less passenger movement late at night . <p> You can ask for an upgrade and may just get one ! Wait till you set sail from the last port , in this case it was Lisbon , Portugal . <p> Monarch- could carry up to 2,744 passengers , 800 boarded in Bilbao and a further 800 boarded in Lisbon . After dinner , we approached Reception and asked for an upgrade on the same floor , same location , but an outside cabin and the next morning our wish was granted ! <p> The outside cabins are larger and it was nice to have the window but as you really do n't spend that much time in your cabin we could have happily enjoyed our inside cabin . <p> Reception area on board Monarch <h> How was the food on the repositioning cruise ? <p> Breakfast was a buffet that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit , cold meats and cheeses , to hot breakfast dishes as well as suitable vegetarian options . <p> Lunch was also a buffet , where the menu changed daily for the hot dishes . <p> We were very impressed with the range of vegetarian options at lunch . There was a selection of red , white , rose and sparkling wine for lunch . <p> Sea Bass for dinner on board Monarch <p> Over the summer season , Monarch had approached a top Michelin Chef in Europe to devise a new dinner menu . We were the guinea pigs ' for the first menu . The menu had many options to choose from and had catered well for vegetarians . <p> We enjoyed the selection of wines that were on offer for dinner . <h> What type of cruise traveler was on board ? <p> To be honest , we thought repositioning cruises would be full of passengers of mature age . In fact , there were many types of cruise travelers ; solo travelers , young families , teenage families , millennials , baby boomers and older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is not all bingo , believe it or not ! Bingo was set up every day at lunchtime but ended up being canceled due to lack of interest . <p> After dinner , Bingo was held in the Broadway room prior to the evening show performances and it was great to see the millennia 's really getting into it ! <p> Fun times on board Monarch <p> Monarch had a small gym with exercise classes available for a small fee . <p> The Spa catered for all types of beauty treatments as well as hairdressing services . <p> A morning exercise walking class was held on the pool level as well as Zumba , Salsa , and Latin dancing . <p> In the evening the bars had live music playing at certain times , an evening show every night and the disco started at 11 pm . <p> There was plenty to keep everyone entertained throughout the cruise . <h> 9 nights on the Atlantic Ocean without land in sight <p> We had imagined we would be stuck inside the ship with bad weather and had planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could not have been more different . With perfect weather every day we set into a daily rhythm ; breakfast , gym , sun bathing , cocktails , lunch , sunbathing , cocktails , dinner , and a show ! <p> Hurricane Matthew preceded us as we arrived into the Caribbean and we had to forgo our visit to Aruba as the Port was closed due to the strong winds . <h> Is there a downside to repositioning cruises ? <p> As far as we were concerned there was no downside . <p> Our only problem was choosing our daily cocktails and our evening meal . We would definitely use a reposition cruise to transport us from one continent to another again .

Re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are passionate about a port a day , but I enjoy those relaxing sea days to enjoy what the ship offers .

A tip ensure you have all your documents printed for the country that you arrive in with flights and hotel documents this helps in the disembarkation process as Immigration wanted paper documents . Passengers had to purchase extra internet to be able to print them out . <p> Hi Gundi We have heard of a relocation cruise from Dubai to Vancouver from a friend who was thinking of taking one .

You want to be able to enjoy the local beer and wine , call into the local bakery , visit the ice cream shop and test out the grub at the local pub " guilt free ! <p> We recently spent a few months in the Margaret River region where there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve yummy gourmet pizzas or burgers . <p> While we were there , one of the kids favourite things to do was ride our bikes down the main street to the ice cream shop to choose which flavour they wanted to try next ! <p> I had no problem with sampling the wine in the region , treating ourselves to a pizza or enjoying an ice cream because on the whole we have a good foundation of healthy habits and include plenty of the good stuff " real , whole foods - in our diet every day . <p> Real foods or whole foods are foods that are close to their natural state with minimal processing . They are foods that are ready to eat , straight from a plant or animal . <p> Vegetables , fruits , eggs , nuts , fish , yoghurt , meats and whole grains like spelt , brown rice and quinoa are real foods . These are the kinds of foods we should base our diets on . They are nutrient rich and fuel our bodies beautifully . <p> When we eat more real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is easier to maintain a healthy weight and we glow from the inside out . Who does n't  want that when they are travelling ? <h> 2 . Stock up on local produce <p> Avoid heading straight to Woolies or Coles when you arrive in a new town . Instead , seek out a local farmers market or fresh produce shop and stock up on produce local to the area you are visiting . <p> Becoming a locavore in the area you are travelling in helps you to fully immerse yourself in the local food culture and there are loads of health benefits from eating local produce too . <h> 3 . Eat a good breakfast <p> You tend to have more time in the morning when you are travelling than when you are at home so make the most of it and fuel yourself for the day ahead . <p> Eating a good breakfast , rich in protein and healthy fats helps to sustain you until lunchtime and reduces cravings for rubbish later on in the day . <p> Some of our favourite breakfasts on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Serves 7 <p> Ingredients <p> 1 cup organic shredded coconut ( no preservatives ) <p> 1 cup almond meal <p> -+ cup chia seeds <p> 1 cup pumpkin seeds <p> -+ cup each of pecans and walnuts , chopped or bashed into smaller pieces <p> 1-2 tablespoons cinnamon <p> Method <p> Mix all ingredients together and put into an airtight container in the fridge . Put -+ cup of the mixture into a bowl with enough water or organic milk to cover . Soak in the fridge overnight and add some fresh sliced strawberries , peaches or apple and a couple of spoonfuls of natural yoghurt . <h> Banana pancakes recipe : <p> Serves 1 <p> Ingredients <p> 1 banana <p> 1 egg <p> 1 tablespoon nut butter <p> Coconut oil for cooking <p> Method <p> Mash the banana . Scramble in the egg and nut butter . <p> Heat a fry pan and melt a little coconut oil in it . Pour in a heaped tablespoon of the banana mixture . Wait for bubbles to form and then flip over . Repeat with the rest of the mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural yoghurt and berries . <h> Green Scrambled eggs on sour dough recipe : <p> Serves 1 <p> Ingredients <p> 2 free range eggs <p> 1 slice rye or spelt sour dough bread <p> Handful of baby spinach <p> Big pinch of fresh parsley , chopped <p> Pinch of sea salt <p> Butter to serve <p> Method <p> Scramble eggs in a cup and cook in a pan over medium heat . Add Spinach and salt . Toast the sour dough and spread with butter . Serve scrambled eggs on toast and sprinkle over the parsley . <h> 4 . Pack your lunch and snacks <p> Packing food for day outings and on travel days saves you heaps of money and prevents those last minute fast food or bakery stops . <p> I always pack fresh fruit too depending on what is in season , but it will often be strawberries , bananas , apples , stone fruit and grapes . A container of mixed raw nuts is usually included or I might be organised and have some Bliss Balls ready to go . <p> We always have plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to buy bottled water ( not only a waste of money but also terrible for the environment ) . <h> 5 . Include plenty of slow time <p> There is always plenty to see and do when you are travelling but make sure you are getting plenty of down time too . <p> Travel offers us a break from our busy schedules . It is the perfect time to rest and recover from our often hectic lives . Sit in the sun and read a book , lie around and tell jokes with the kids , lay down under a tree and watch the clouds , float in the ocean , do whatever fills you up and calms you down . <p> Get in the habit of getting to bed early . Without the temptation of Netflix , I have been getting lots of early nights on our trip and my sleep has been more restful because I am reading before bed rather than watching a screen . <h> 6 . Get moving <p> There are plenty of opportunities to be active when you are travelling so make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids boogie boards , hike to a waterfall , hire a SUP or take an evening stroll with the family . Some of our best memories on our Australian road trip so far have been our active days together ! <p> We travel with our bikes and try and walk or bike ride where ever possible . We also have surfboards , skateboards , balls , skipping ropes , yoga mats and suspension training straps so we are geared up for an active adventure . <p> Even on those days when one of the kids is n't in an active mood ( whining that they ca n't be bothered ! ) we have plenty of equipment to do our own fitness , which for me is often a few yoga stretches and some deep breathing . <p> Keeping your family healthy while you are on the road does n't  have to be hard work . With a little thought and organisation your whole family will be healthy and vibrant throughout your travels . <h> Want to know more about keeping your kids healthy ? <p> Jessica is hosting a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've attended Jesss webinars before and have found them full of useful tips I can implement straight away to improve the girls ( and my own ) eating habits . Its especially useful for my extremely fussy Savannah .

We always shop for groceries locally , making sure we have enough veggies , fruit , yogurts , whole wheat bagels etc . The thing is you do n't  usually have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edible and healthy basic produce helps . Getting pre-cut veggies like carrot sticks or something you can munch on like snow peas is great too . And we absolutely eat at fast food joints too , when traveling in the US . Its an affordable and quick way to grab a bite on a long road trip . The trick is to know which dishes to pick there . You can actually have a healthy meal at McDonalds . They have great salads ( skip the dressing ! ) , fresh fruit yogurt parfaits and even oatmeal , so its doable . <p> All this time , my children were constantly hungry and they did n't  want any fruits , they wanted desserts and snacks . I never realised that it was the breakfast that made them , but after reading this guide , in the next trip , I 'm sure I 'll make less mistakes about healthy eating . <p> Its unbelievable how easy it is to give to your children healthy food . Every time me and my children go for a trip , I am always nervous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't  pack enough ( or the right ones ) fruits and healty snacks and as a result , we usually end up eating fast food , which is sad for me . But , after reading this guide , I will be more prepared now . Thank you for your advices ! <p> I am always afraid of getting sick while travelling because it would be awful . Nobody likes to have fever , chills , pain , headaches in daily routine , so while travelling it may be a disaster lol . My husband always take lots of pills to try to at least relieve these symptoms if they appear . Water is something that I pay attention before drinking , specially when I go to other countries .

I 'd also recommend Kripalu for a couple of days if you 're interested in yoga or anything like that ( they have a very broad range of offerings ) . They might have some programs for kids .

It is a beautiful base camp for a hike up Mt Greylock , the tallest mountain in MA . The trail to hike to the top is part of the Appalachian Trail that spans from Maine to Georgia . From the top of the mountain ( which you can also drive up , but wheres the fun in that ! ? ) you can see a few states !

And lastly as a huge sports fan I have to suggest a visit to Fenway and Gillette . <p> Weve lived in Massachusetts our whole life and there 's a lot to see here despite being such a small state . A lot depends on the time of year you visit . In the Fall , you need to get out to the Berkshires to see the foliage .

So this post is a list of things to do for free ( or cheap ) that we have previously done or are planning to do . <p> So if you 're planning a trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save a few bucks , and if you 've already been or happen to live here as well , we 'd love to hear your tips in the comments down below ! <h> Free Things to Do on the Gold Coast <h> 1 . Cycle the Gold Coast Oceanway <p> Weve done parts of The Gold Coast Oceanway , which is a network of pathways along the beaches of the coast which range up to 4km long and are popular with cyclists and walkers . <p> But wed love to cycle the full length , 36 kilometres in total from Point Danger Lighthouse ( Coolangatta ) in the south to the Gold Coast Seaway ( The Spit ) in the north . <p> This would make for a fantastic day out to get some exercise , fresh air , and take in the magnificent coastal views . <p> When you do it , be sure to pack your own lunch , bring plenty of water , your swimmers and a camera . Stop off along the way at any of the beach towns for a dip and a cold drink . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo : Tourism Queensland <p> If you do n't  want to pay the $49 admission price to see all the Aussie animals and the adventure side of the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary , twice per day at 8am and 4pm you can feed the wild lorikeets for FREE ! <p> Hundreds of rainbow lorikeets descend upon you from the surrounding trees to get a lick at the sweet honey nectar that you hold out in a bowl in your hands . They will climb up your arms , on your head and just sit on your hands drinking . <p> We did this a few years ago and it is worth an hour visit to see these beautiful birds of Australia up close and personal . <h> 3 . Go walking on the coast OR in a National Park <p> Burleigh Heads National Park <p> Walking is free , good for you , and one of our favourite ways to explore a destination . <p> Get up at 6am on the Gold Coast and it feels like midday with everyone out and about walking or running . You ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you do n't  have to drag the kids out of bed at 6am , and its not just the coastal area that offers great walking opportunities , the hinterland and National Parks offering lovely walks too ! <p> What 's on our list : <p> Burleigh Heads National Park grab a coffee from Nook Espresso then head to the point and catch the magnificent sunrise before doing the 2.5-kilometre coastal walk around the headland to Tallebudgera Creek . About half-way back you 'll come to Tumgun Lookout which offers awesome views over Palm Beach . <p> Federation Walk a 3.5-kilometre pedestrian walkway located at the northern end of the Gold Coast Oceanway on the Southport Spit . <p> Lamington National Park many fantastic walking trails from short walks to all day hikes . OReillys Tree Top Walk is 180 metres in length and made up of 9 suspension bridges . Also do the Booyang Boardwalk and Tooloona Creek circuit . <p> Coolangatta to Point Dangar a great little coastal walk via Greenmount and Rainbow Bay . I suggest saving it for late afternoon as the sunset views from Rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamborine Mountain is in the third oldest National Park in the world with 12 walking tracks , each one is no longer than 3 kilometres . <p> The Oceanway instead of cycling walk one of the sections each day . <h> 4 . Hit the beaches <p> Coolangatta <p> Obvious I know , but is there a better free day out on the Gold Coast than hitting up one of the beaches along the 57 kilometres of pristine coastline ? ! <p> They do n't  call it the Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise for nothing ! Not only famous for fun , the Goldy is renowned for their beaches which also happen to be home to some of the world 's most famous surf breaks . <p> But you do n't  have to be a surfer or even a water baby to enjoy them , just soak up some sunshine , play on the sand and most of them have grassland , playgrounds , and BBQ areas . <p> Coolangatta / Greenmount Beach an 800 m long north facing beach protected by the headland . Generally safe with usually low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Currumbin / Currumbin Creek is a popular spot with families where you can enjoy a range of watersports including surfing , kayaking , and stand-up paddle boarding . <p> Tallebudgera Creek on the southern side of Burleigh Heads National Park . No waves of course and a nice spot for a swim , stand up paddle board or kayak . <p> Burleigh Heads voted #1 by travelers on Trip Advisor and is one of the best swimming , body boarding and surfing spots on the coast . The headland of Burleigh , known as " The Point " , is a favourite for weekend BBQs and sunset drinks . On a Sunday afternoon local musicians and fire-twirlers come out to the park beside the surf club for a jam session . <p> Broadbeach towards the northern end of the coast . Long , clean stretch of beach and bordered by large grasslands and a playground perfect for a picnic . Also home to weekend markets . <h> 5 . Hit the markets <p> Where ever we go we always try and hit up the local markets , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast , <p> From fashion to farmers markets , to art &amp; craft , to music to everything in between . Now that we are living here , it will take us some time to explore them all quality problem ! <p> They are all free to attend and quite often there are lots of free samples on offer , or bargains . <p> We especially love farmers markets for stocking up on supplies for self-catering when having picnics and BBQs , or when staying in apartments with kitchens . As much as we love eating out , you can save a pretty penny preparing your own meals , and can be more relaxing with young kids . <p> Miami Marketta Just discovered this locals favourite ourselves ! Feels like we were back in Thailand . Every Friday and Saturday it comes alive with street food , live music , boutique wine and craft beer . <p> Miami Farmers Market every Sunday at the Miami State school . The area 's first truly Organic Growers Market straight from the farm . <p> The Village Markets every 1st &amp; 3rd Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifestyle market plus live local music and food from around the world thanks to the lineup of food trucks . <h> 6 . Hit the playgrounds and parks <p> Justins Park , Burleigh Heads <p> Having only lived on the Gold Coast for two months now we are constantly amazed at the quantity and quality of playgrounds and parks on offer . <p> At almost every beach , or green space , there is a playground with picnic benches and BBQs . The council does such a great job of providing and maintaining these facilities for everyone to enjoy , and usually right on the beach . <p> You can let the kids play on the equipment , kick a ball around , or just relax with a picnic or BBQ . And besides the cost of your BYO food and drink they 're all free ! <h> 7 . Experience the Festivals and Events <p> There are several free events and festivals held throughout the year celebrating music , art , sports and our multicultural society . <p> We recently experienced Blues on Broadbeach , which was cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blues on Broadbeach is held every year in May and is regarded as one of the world 's largest free festivals with multiple stages and shows spread over the four day period .

Cooly Rocks is a free event and open to all ages and in 2016 will be held from June 3-16 . <p> Swell Sculpture Festival at Currumbin Beach becomes home to dozens of sculptures by local , national and international artists . Over a 10 day period in September visitors can experience the sculptures for free on twilight walks and even talks from some of the artists . <p> The Quiksilver Pro Surfing Event is your chance to watch the worlds best male and female surfers battle it out at one of the worlds best surfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March each year .

Its a celebration of art , culture , music and food and includes street parades and parties , concerts and a la carte in the park . <h> 8 . Go whale watching from the headlands <p> View from Tumgun Lookout , Burleigh Heads NP <p> Whale watching season typically runs from May to October when thousands of humpback whales migrate north from Antarctica , passing up and back down the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks to get a glimpse , you can try your luck for free from one of the elevated headlands along the coast , or even from your skyrise apartment , as whales have a tendency to come in quite close to shore . <p> Some of the best naturally elevated viewpoints include Point Danger , Greenmount , Kirra Hill , Currumbin Rocks , Tumgun Lookout within Burleigh Heads National Park , North Burleigh/Miami headland . <p> Look out for the big spouts of mist that shoot up into the air . Bring a zoom lens and maybe some binoculars ! <h> 9 . Watch sunrise &amp; sunset <p> Sunrise at Burleigh Point <p> How about starting off your day the best way possible , by watching the sunrise over the ocean . Throw in the surfers doing their thing on the morning swell and you can sit and be mesmerized . <p> Grab a smoothie or a coffee at one of the cafes and you 're ready for the day ahead . <p> My favourite place to watch the sunrise and sunset is from Burleigh Point , just follow the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rainbow Bay Surf Club is a great spot for sunset drinks as you watch the sky light up in the distance behind the Surfers Paradise skyline . <h> 10 . Currumbin Rock Pools <p> This is on our must do list when the weather warms up again . <p> Apparently , the Rock Pools are just a 15-minute drive from Currumbin Beach , and are a favourite spot with the locals , and sound like the perfect area for a family day out with picnic tables , BBQs , grassy river banks , and toilets at close hand . <p> There 's varying pool depths for everyone and rope swings , rock slides and ledges to jump off , and just another five minutes along Currumbin Creek Road is the Mount Cougal section of Springbrook National Park looking forward to doing that800 metre walking trail to cascading waterfalls , more rock pools and an historic bush sawmill . <p> Sounds like nature at its best ! <h> 11 . Lookouts <p> Its not all just beaches and theme parks on the Gold Coast you know , the city is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panorama shots on many postcards . <p> Were planning to head to all the best lookouts and incorporate a picnic or BBQ into the experience . <p> The Best of All ' ' lookout at Mudgeeraba appears to be aptly named , and among the best lookouts . From Canyon Lookout in Springbrook National Park , they say you can see waterfalls and the main strip of the Gold Coast skyline off in the distance . <h> 12 . Exercise <p> The Oceanway , Surfers Paradise <p> We love the outdoors lifestyle on the Gold Coast , and how everyone is so active , its addictive . <p> Ok , you 're probably on holidays and not wanting to workout , but if you like keeping up your level of fitness up and down the coast there are exercise machines and equipment that are free for everyone , plus the before mentioned walking and cycle routes . <p> The City of Gold Coast created an Active &amp; Healthy program to get residents and visitors up and working out , with several cheap classes on offer along the coast including circuits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Caz has participated in the bootcamp in Burleigh class held twice per week , for $3 a class , what great value . There are classes suitable for all ages and fitness levels and you can check out the class options and times here . <h> Almost free <h> 13 . Entertainment Book <p> We signed up for a membership of The Entertainment Book when we first arrived and have saved a few bucks on various activities . <p> Its a way to get up to 50% off and 2-for-1 offers for many of the best restaurants , attractions , hotels , travel , sporting events , shopping and much more . <h> Plan Your Trip to the Gold Coast 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation on the Gold Coast 69803 @qwx269803 <p> Flights to the Gold Coast 69807 @qwx269807 <p> Car Rental on the gold Caost 69806 @qwx269806 <p> For transport to and from the airport and various locations try Con-x-ion shuttles .

Do n't  forget to pay a visit to Morticia the oldest funnel web spider in Lamington National Park . <p> Back at the lodge we headed upstairs of the main residence to the library for afternoon wine and cheese time . The kids occupied themselves reading whilst we enjoyed 20 minutes of downtime and views over the valley . <p> For dinner on the first night we grabbed a BBQ pack- and cooked it under one of the covered cooking shelters in the campground if you do this , you just need to bring your own- cutlery and plates . <h> Morning sunrise <p> Caz and the kids were happy to sleep in a while , is n't that what getaways are for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most of the morning light . <p> There 's nothing like being greeted with a burst of sunshine to wake you up at 5 am and have pretty views out over the valley . <p> Getting up early is also the best time to spot one of the locals hopping about at Binna Burra , the cute Pademelons . <p> We did see them on our Bellbird walk hopping amongst the bushes , but early morning they are out in the sunshine in the open grassland and easier to spot . <h> Yoga anyone ? <p> Caz loves her yoga , - its how she starts every day , and was excited that they had a pre-breakfast morning yoga session up in the library room . <p> What was cool though was that the kids were also welcome and joined her for the session .

Grab a seat by the window if you can as the views over the- Numinbah Valley go on forever . <h> Archery anyone ? <p> After lunch , it was time to bring out our inner Robin Hood and try our hand at archery . Surprisingly this was my first time ever shooting an arrow and I was keen to have some fun learning about this medieval sport . <p> Ranger Dean put us through our paces , instructing us on the technique of holding the bow and arrow , and Savannah picked it up like a natural. - She did n't  get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And big sister Kalyra hit it all by herself ! <p> Caz proved to be a sharp shooter getting at least one bullseye .

Definitely , give this a go on your visit for a fun family activity ! <h> Flying through the treetops <p> Our kids , and us big kids love flying through tree tops- on 165-metre long flying fox cables , or zip lines as some call them . It was time to up the pace a little and play Tarzan and Jane ! <p> I still have visions of two-year-old Savannah zooming solo through the canopy 30 metres off the ground at nearby OReillys Rainforest retreat- on their flying fox with a mixture of shock and excitement on her face . <p> This time , we could go tandem so I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mummy .

Theres room for the kids to play and the adults can kick back on one of the chairs with a cold drink and spectacular sunset views . <p> Picture yourself here ? <p> We stepped back inside for our buffet dinner before retreating back to our cabin and just chilled on the bed and caught up on some overdue reading time . <p> Again , it was so good not to be tempted with logging on to Facebook and being distracted with the online world , instead being totally present with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty sunrise <p> I do n't  mind waking up at 4.30am to catch sunrise , yes the sun pokes its head up early in this neck of the woods , but when you get treated to a sight like this its worth the effort. - <p> I took this photo of the pretty pinks and clouds over the valley and the Gold Coast Hinterland from the elevated position back up near the main restaurant . <p> Apparently Bellbird Lookout is a top spot for sunrise , but that would mean getting up extra early ! <p> If you 're looking for a quick getaway to the Gold Coast Hinterland and getting off the coast or out of Brisbane , consider Binna Burra your ticket to serenity and bonding time as a family or as a couple . <p> We can all do with escaping to nature and unplugging once in a while . <p> As always our stay was over before we were ready to head back to reality , but being local well definitely be back ! <h> The Details <p> Getting there - If travelling on the Pacific Motorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exit 73 Northbound ) and follow the signs Nerang West/Binna Burra .

@@21820604 @1820604/ <h> 22 Things to Do in Port Macquarie <p> I grew up holidaying in Port Macquarie and have fond childhood memories of camping at the Breakwall Caravan Park , visiting Fantasy Glades and riding the water slides at Peppermint Park . <p> We loved those trips to Port Macquarie . It was a great getaway from our home near Sydney and I remember it well as a place all members of my family enjoyed visiting time and time again . <p> But we only ever stuck to activities close to town so it was exciting to revisit Port Macquarie recently with my own kids and explore more of the Greater Port Macquarie region . <p> Ive since discovered there 's so many new things to do in Port Macquarie , up in the hinterland , and around the Camden Haven region and our three day visit was n't nearly long enough , which can be a good thing as we must now return for more ! <p> The best way to appreciate the beauty of this region is by getting out and enjoying the diverse range of activities , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we got up to . Plus a few extra suggestions from helpful readers of our blog . <h> Things to do in Port Macquarie <h> 1 . Sunrise at Town Beach <p> Its worth getting out of bed early for sunrise in Port Macquarie . Several people suggested the Tacking Point Lighthouse is awesome at sunrise , and I 'm sure it is . <p> But I opted for Town Beach and the breakwall as I could walk there from our apartment , and it meant getting up just a wee bit later . <p> The first sunrise shot I took was from the beach using a lifeguards tower for some foreground interest , then from the end of the iconic breakwall as a local fisherman went about catching his lunch . <p> As I was shooting away many people were pulling into the car park and heading off by foot . My guess is they were starting the popular Coastal Walk . <h> 2 . Billabong Koala Wildlife Park <p> We arrived at the Billabong Koala Wildlife Park just in time to see " Shrek " the monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s an intimidating fella when hungry and this is as close as I ever want to get to a croc . <p> After spending months travelling around North Queensland and the Top End of Australia I 'm all for tourists learning about the behaviour of these dinosaurs and the respect we need to show them in order to keep ourselves safe , and them from becoming extinct . <p> There 's also the cuter version of Shrek that Kalyra and Savannah were happy to touch . <p> This park is a world-renowned breeding centre for koalas and offers the chance to get up close and personal with some of Australia 's favourite wildlife . <p> You can never pet too many koalas , just ask my kids who just want to cuddle them and bring them home . Especially a baby koala who was snuggling with mum up the gum tree . <p> Feeding the kangaroos and wallabies is always a highlight for the girls , their wet mouths nibbling away at the food in the palm of your hand . And a few if them had little joeys in their pouches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Not only is there Aussie wildlife on display here , but we enjoyed checking out the Snow Leopards and Red Pandas , who by the way were extremely active playing peek-a-boo with me as I tried to snap a pic . I finally got him in the tree . <p> Whilst there , grab a bite to eat at the Billabong Cafe which comes with every parents dream a play area for the kids to keep them entertained whilst you enjoy some down time . <h> 3 . Wander along the Breakwall <p> I used to ride my bike and fish off the iconic breakwall as a kid , and its the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Port . <p> This time , it was nice to see my own kids enjoying a stroll from Town Green to Town Beach checking out all the brightly painted rocks . There 's some cool artwork from locals and visitors alike and if you 're lucky you might see dolphins playing in the Hastings River during your walk . <p> At the Town Beach end , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia , plus a skate park and playground . <h> 4 . Watch the Sunset <p> We took in sunset during our walk along the breakwall before heading to dinner in town . Other great viewing spots are Town Green near Lady Nelson Wharf , or how about enjoying sunset with a cold drink at The Beach House pub which has uninterrupted views of the Hastings River . <p> Sunsets here can set the sky alight as they dip below the mountain on the banks of the river . <h> 5 . Town Green &amp; Lady Nelson Wharf <p> Lady Nelson Wharf is named after one of the three ships that arrived at this point in 1821 to establish the penal settlement of Port Macquarie . This wharf is a popular fishing spot by day , as is the Town Green area , but we enjoyed the twilight scene just after sunset as the lights came on . <p> There 's a playground at Town Green and plenty of grass area to run around or have a picnic . <h> 6 . The Beach House <p> The before mentioned Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront , an outdoor beer garden style area with a stage for live music , good selection of beer on tap , kid friendly and a new menu consisting of American style grub . <p> After chatting with manager Brent and Canadian chef George , I opted for the Philly Cheese Steak that classic sandwich from Philadelphia in the US . And what a feast it was . Tasty and BIG , and I washed it down with a Blonde Ale made locally by the folks at Black Duck Brewery . <p> Caz enjoyed her Blackened Silver Dory Salad and the kids were kept happy with their cheeseburger and nuggets . <p> No wonder this is a popular spot for the locals to hang out . It would be my local too . <h> 7 . Hello Koalas Sculpture Trail <p> This is cool . Dotted around the Port Macquarie landscape are 50 one-metre tall hand-painted koala sculptures made of fibreglass . From the mountains to the sea , they create the- Hello Koalas Public Sculpture Trail . <p> I snapped this cool looking dude in Town Green . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to do the 9km Coastal Walk on this trip , but we 've done a section of it previously and if you 're in town with enough time , I highly recommend it as a thing to do in Port Macquarie . <p> Start from Town Beach and head south to Tacking Point Lighthouse . You 'll come across family friendly Flynns Beach and small inlets bordered by rocky headlands that lead you to the flatter and wider expanse of Shelley Beach , then through the protected Sea Nature reserve and down to the wild and rough pounding waves of Lighthouse Beach . <p> The walk is spectacular and peaceful and compared to say , the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk , almost empty . <h> 9 . Livvis Place <p> Looking for a playground your younger kids can burn off some energy for half an hour ? Livvis Place is a new water playground at Westport Park with a carousel , water play , tree house , nature play and swings , right on the Hastings River . <h> 10 . Wauchope Farmers Market <p> Every fourth Saturday of each month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or places we visit we always try and grab our fresh produce from the farmers market and support the local growers . <p> We stopped in here on our way out to our Farm Stay to stock up on supplies for dinner and breakfast by grabbing some eggs , fruit and veg , and wherever there 's a punnet of strawberries on offer you 'll be sure to find Savannah ! <h> 11 . Watermans Cafe <p> Whilst in Wauchope we hit up the popular Watermans Cafe which overlooks the park and kids playground and has a nice seating area outside in the sun . <p> The kids entertained themselves at the park whilst I downed a chai latte , one of the best Ive ever had ! Win win . <h> 12 . Wauchope Riverwalk <p> There 's a lovely boardwalk along the riverfront in Wauchope , just a five-minute drive out of town . We took advantage of this peaceful setting to stretch our legs and walk off our lunch and coffees from Watermans. <h> 13 . Visit Old Bottlebutt in Burrawan State Forest <p> Were always up for a nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600-metre track in the Burrawan State Forest near Wauchope was on our to do list . <p> There we laid eyes on the largest Red Bloodwood tree in the southern hemisphere , a staggering 52-metres high and 16-metres wide at its base . Its an impressive looking tree at 200 years old . Try wrapping your arms around this old fella ! <p> The Old Bottle butt ' is one of Port Macquarie 's best kept secrets and if you 're in the area come say hi . <h> 14 . Bago Maze <p> The Bago Maze in Port Macquarie is awesome ! The owner of Bogo Vineyards , Jim is a genius for combining a maze with a winery . <p> Splitting up into pairs , we had a lot of fun getting lost among the lilly-pilly hedge and taking on the challenge of finding our way to the two towers cleverly placed in the maze so that you could see them , but reaching them was another matter . <p> We crossed over bridges , discovered hidden gnomes , and played musical instruments . Team Caz and Savannah came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hunt as my navigation skills had us walking around in circles haha . <p> Bago Maze is the largest hedge maze in NSW with 2,000 metres of pathways covering 10,000 square metres . Once you 've solved it , kick back with a cheese plate and a glass of wine under the pergola overlooking the jacaranda trees and valley below . <h> 15 . Ewetopia Farm Stay <p> As much as we love living on the coast , escaping to the country and spending some time on a working farm is something we all enjoy as a family . <p> We met Ian and Jill , the owners of Ewetopia Farm in Ellenborough earlier in the day at the Wauchope Farmers market , they 're the regions newest cheese makers and sell milk , yoghurt , labne and are renowned for their halloumi . <p> We checked in just in time for sunset and sat on our expansive deck perched on the hill overlooking the farm entrance and valley below with our new neighbours close by , sheep and jersey cows . <p> Just prior to our visit seven little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs are born every year during spring ) and they came up for pats and followed them around the farm like long lost friends is there anything cuter than this ? ! <p> We cooked a nice meal in our self-contained 3 bedroom cottage and enjoyed waking up to the crisp fresh air of country living , the sounds of farm animals and the mist lifting to start a new day . <p> The saltwater pool with gazebo and BBQ area attached looks inviting for the warmer months , and the summer is when they also milk their flock of dairy sheep that produce feta and halloumi . <p> The 130-acre farmstay is less than an hours drive west of Port Macquarie and you can do as much , or as little , as you please . <p> And do n't  ya just love the name , Ewetopia ? <h> 16 . Drive to Camden Haven ( via Lorne and Kendall ) <p> Leaving Ellenborough we drove across the spectacular hinterland ranges via the towns of Lorne and Kendall before ending up back on the coast in Camden Haven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenic drive offers the opportunity to go bushwalking , birding , and hiking to waterfalls , with Ellenborough Falls and Rawson Falls being the stars of the show when flowing . <p> We were pushed for time but enjoyed the drive to the top of the hinterland ranges of Comboyne before descending to the village of Kendall , and here we suggest stopping in for morning tea at Miss Nellies Cafe . <h> Drive to the top of North Brother Mountain <p> It was n't the best weather and time of day for photos when we stopped here , but the drive up to Laurieton Lookout on North Brother Mountain provided stunning views over Queens Lake and the seaside towns of Laurieton , North Haven and Dunbogan . <p> Easily one of the most scenic views we 've seen in NSW . Would be spectacular on a clear day ! <h> 17 . Eat at Oasis by the River <p> When you visit the Camden Haven region you must stop in and eat at Oasis by the River for a delicious meal with a view . <p> Friendly and passionate , Brendon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe and restaurant and I now know why this has become a popular spot for Camden Haven locals and day-trippers from Port Macquarie . <p> Off the menu , we chose locally produced Armstrong oysters , soft-shell crab , smoked chicken fettuccini with chorizo , and a strawberry cheesecake which tasted just as good as it looks ! <p> And I love the space Brendon has created out the back for seasonal and special events , a relaxed outdoor area that feels more like your sitting in someones backyard . Drop in and say gday to Brendon , I 'm sure your taste buds will leave satisfied . <h> 18 . Camden Haven River Cruise <p> For a much slower pace we hopped on the Camden Haven River Cruise for a leisurely Sunday afternoon cruise down the river . <p> Some local pelicans were on hand to send us off on our two-hour cruise with the Three Brother Mountains providing a nice backdrop . <p> The scenery was a mixture of mangroves , sandbanks and oyster leases , and the kids were excited about playing skipper and took control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why she calls it home . <p> But the highlight of the trip was witnessing a swooping Sea Eagle zoom down and catch its dinner for the night , they 're not easy to photograph but I did manage to produce this shot as proof . <h> 19 . Pilots Beach <p> Again we werent visiting at the best time of year for a day at the beach , but Pilots Beach is one to remember for when we return again in the warmer months . <p> It sits at the mouth of the Camden Haven River and is known as the most protected and safest beach in the region , especially good for families with the gentle waves . <p> It had just stopped raining when we arrived and the colours that came out were striking . <h> 20 . Dunbogan Boatshed <p> On the cruise , the locals suggested we stop in at the Dunbogan Boatshed for a good cup of coffee . Its a peaceful setting on the river and here your kids can feed the friendly fish who hang out down below . <p> Ours girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raining visibility in the water was quite low . <h> 21 . Laurieton United Services Club <p> We were impressed with the size of this club and the friendliness of the people , and if you 're there in the daytime the views of Camden River would be an added bonus . <p> Oh , and theyve thought of the children too , with two kiddie play areas in the bistro and main entertainment area . Winning again ! <h> 22 . Ocean &amp; Pacific Drive <p> Heading back to Port Macquarie from Camden Haven , take the Ocean Drive and Pacific Drive route along the coast and check out the regions best beaches via Bonnie Hills and Lake Cathie . <p> For our weekend getaway in Port Mazquarie , we had fun cruising around in a new Jeep supplied by the guys at Miedecke Motors . I 've never driven a Jeep before and would have loved to have taken the doors and roof off .

I could n't recommend it highly enough for any type of traveller . <p> Be warned , though . People have been known to visit for a weekend , and stayed for a while ! <p> Thanks to Port Macquarie Tourism for hosting our stay . For a complete list of everything on offer in the Greater Port Macquarie region , check out their website . <p> Hey some great pictures ! I 'm one for sunrise timesSo this sounds just perfect !

I live here in Anchorage , Alaska so I have s couple Alaska travel tips . <p> Cities and towns ? Anchorage being the largest , also recommend driving to Seward and Homer . <p> Hiking ? So much to do up here , lots of talks and mountains even close to Anchorage . The most popular in Anchorage is Flat Top mountain . Also go to Hatchers Pass , Exit Glacier in Seward , Byron Glacier in Portage . <p> Road trips ? To Girdwood , Portage , Hope , Seward , Kenai and Homer . North is Talkeetna and Denali . <p> Lakes ? Eklutna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes north of Anchorage and you can rent a little boat by the hour to go fishing . <p> Eat &amp; drink ? Everyone will tell you to eat at Mooses Tooth in Anchorage and yes its delish . I 'd also recommend Spenard Roadhouse and The Pantry ( in the Captain Cook ) . <p> Hi Rachel , I plan a trip to Alaska next summer with my 18 years old daughter . Were looking to travel around the best place of the resident people who actually lived there . We sure want to see some tourist places , but we prefer to see best places to everyone . So if you have good contacts that you can share .. we would be very happy to inviting you to join us for a part of our trip and maybe you could come to visit us to our places . Thanks to U Julie <p> I love the town of Talkeetna that functions as a gateway to Denali National Park . The Talkeetna Roadhouse has a fantastic breakfast and atmosphere . The whole town is like a movie set of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over town . A local dogsledder will take you out on his training cart or go fishing in the nearby rivers . It also has good internet available and Ive seen several RVs camped there but I 've never used an RV there . It is a fantastic stop as you head inland into the Alaskan wilderness , especially Denali National Park , and I highly recommend it . <p> I forgot to add my restaurant recommendation in Anchorage . The Glacier Brewhouse has fantastic King Crab and salmon . It also has several of its own micro-brews ( its a brewhouse , duh ) and for the kids and non-drinkers they also have house made cream soda and root beer . We go there every time we are in town ! <p> My five cents : If you book cars , do that WELL in advance . Good cars are gone quickly . 4WD is actually not necessary most of the roads are either passable with a regular car or good only for ATV . <p> Alaska can be roughly divided into six very different travel zones . I 'd plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairbanks and South of Fairbanks , Kenai peninsula , Katmai and Kodiak , Central Alaska and South-Western Alaska . <p> If you can afford hiring a float plane , it is always fun to do , especially if you opt to visit very remote locations like Yukon delta ( would n't recommend ) , Kobuk Valley NP ( best option for seeing caribou and wolves ) , Katmai or Kodiak ( both are must for grizzly bear viewing at salmon runs ) . We usually use float planes for our canoe trips drop-ins/take-outs . Speaking of canoe I would recommend Birch Creek canoe trip ( starts from Circle Highway , 2 hours drive from Fairbanks ) , it does n't  require floatplane drop-off , but float plane pick-up is desirable unless you want to float Yukon , which I would n't recommend at this location ( due to silty waters and bleak environment on riversides ) but would highly recommend to do at Whitehorse area of Canadas Yukon territories . Back to travel zones : <p> North of Fairbanks : Drive as long portion of Dalton Highway as you can afford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Circle is rather boring , some highlights are fishing wheels on Yukon , Yukon Bridge layered by wooden planks and Alaskan pipeline that zig-zags parallel to the road . If you 'll travel in summer , some forest fires should certainly be flaming somewhere by the road , it is part of nature environment and usually interesting to watch at almost barren lands ( close to Fairbanks they are not that funny , smoke problems are real ) . To my taste the road is getting nicer and much more scenic the further north you go , the best part of the road is roughly from north of Arctic Circle to at least Wiseman , but I would certainly recommend to drive through most mountain passes all the way to Galbright Lake ( nice campground there ) . Driving further north to Prudhoe Bay is much more boring , but may be done to get " sense of accomplishment " . Take your time at Gates of Arctic NP . It is the park for " non-tourist minded " people , for those seeking solitude and serenity . It resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . drive to Circle via Steese Highway . Highlights are few interesting Alaskan gold-digger villages ( with many old mining equipment on display ) , fields of fireweed , viewing the results of total dredging of most of Alaskan creeks and rivers , fishing for grayling . drive to Chena Hot Springs . It is 1 hour easy drive , hot spring are pretty nice ( and hot ) , although crowded . Chena river has good population of grayling , salmon runs on June and then later toward fall . <p> Fairbanks and south of Fairbanks : City itself is not much to write home about . University is OK to visit . City center , except " plaque tree " , is not very well developed tourist-wise . Interesting is to stay at local houses ( pick B&amp;B by Chena River , once we have stayed here https : //www.vrbo.com/118558 , it was good ) ) and see everyday Alaskans life , that still include fishing , hunting , vegetable and fruit growing , berry picking etc One other piece of advice : due to proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old planes ended up as " sheds " or even " houses " , so drive side streets for a funny pictures of such planes . Drive to North Pole . Santa Claus is always present there ( at Santa Claus House it is a shop , obviously ) and is a most authentic one from all I had ever seen . Also on the same road from Fairbanks toward Eleison AFB keep an eye to the right for an interesting wood shop ; you 'll never miss it cause it marked with pretty interesting wooden sculptures outside . Denali NP . Prepare to some disappointment , as it is not allowed to drive your own car there . <p> Kenai Peninsula . This area share first place among my loveliest parts of Alaska ( based on my taste , of course ) . choose two pretty different " base camps " here : Seward and Homer . You can easily spend whole week in each of this places , and that is why : Seward : it is nice ( pretty crowded in season ) campground in Lowell point few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saltwater lodge , it is easy to book most boat trips through the lodge here . Fishing trips are a must . It is tons of fun , both for childrens and adults . Easy trips are for salmon ( a lot of sight seeing during the trip , too ) , halibut fishing is for serious fishermen , but also very rewarding . Glacier seeing trips . Very relaxing and extremely picturesque , if weather is cooperative . Kayak trips to glaciers . Guarantee to see bears , too . Bear glacier is closest , Holgate , Alalik , Northwest and many others are not far away . Scenery is incomparable . Hike from Lowell to Gaines Head recreational area . Very nice hike , be prepare to wet your shoes . Climb Mount Marathon . It is not very difficult climb . Just stroll along the shore or walk the harbor . It is impressive . Watch wildlife , from a shore or via boat trip . The place is ideal for wildlife viewing . Homer : Do canoeing at Swan Lake canoe area LONG ... Watch bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortodox villages in Soldotna area ( keep in mind that Ortodox religion is not opened toward outside world ) . Take a halibut fishing tour , the best in the world halibut fishing is right here . Take a ferry to one of the islands in Katchemak bay or to Seldovia for a relaxing wildlife viewing ( sea otters are plentiful , whaling is not bad ) . Take a Grace Ridge trail . It is a bit challenging , but views are magnificent . Relax and enjoy views . It is on pair with the best parts of New Zealand + plenty of wildlife . <p> Katmai and Kodiak Island : This parts should be visited for two reasons : unspoiled natural beauty and wildlife . Not much of social life here . take one of a float plane excursion to sea a wildlife ( http : //www.seahawkair.com/ and http : **38;338;TOOLONG are both very good ) on Kodiak Island . Mostly focus on seeing bears , of course , Kodiak bears are rightfully claimed to be largest bears on planet . To see them from a close distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure . Go right in season ( August is a no brainer , usually ) . Kodiak is remote and for the reason is much less touristy than Katmai NP , where wildlife viewing regulations sometimes may drive you even more craisier , than in Denali ( is it possible ? ) . Kodiak has sizeable presence of old Russian ortodox churches . Get to Brooks Falls at Katmai NP , of course . Brooks lodge is a good place to stay nearby , they are renovated a lot of dilapidated houses recently . Katmai NP is mostly for those who like to hike a lot , if this is your passion , you 'll find it fascinating . <p> Central Alaska : Anchorage is a big city , and I had never came to Alaska with a purpose to stay in a big city , so I can not be helpful in recommending something about it . Independence mine in Wasilla is cool to visit with children , theyll love to ride a miniature train there . visit one of Mat-su valley ( Wasilla , Palmer or elsewhere ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed with the sizes of vegetables they grow here , you need to see it to believe it ( " regular " carrots of 3+ kilos weight each blew my mind and they are surprisingly very tasty ) . Matanuska Glacier easy to reach by foot ( 15 minutes walk from a parking lot ) , easy to walk on the glacier without any guides , very picturesque . Whole road between Palmer and Glenallen is pretty nice . Cantwell to Paxson drive ( so called Denali Highway ) . You can do it in a regular car , if driving slow ( speed limit is 30 mph anyway ) , but spare tire and tire repair kits may be very essential here . This is a road for those who want to experience " real " Alaska how it portrayed i.e. hunting grounds for a real Alascans . Alaskan Rt . 4 from Delta Junction to Valdez ( Richardson Highway ) is one of the most picturesque in Alaska . Northern part is most beautiful between Delta Junction and Paxson . Lots of moose and bison here , sightings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glacier are very picturesque , Black Rapids Lodge and two campings ( one at Fielding Lake is good ) are the only places to stay here . South part of the Highway from Willow Creek to Valdez runs through fantastic mountain scenery , photo opts are countless on each road turn , Worthington Glacier is mostly photographed , but glacier hike is much less pleasant here that the one to Matanuska Glacier . By any means , do not miss a side trip to McCarthy . It is one of the very interesting places in Alaska . Road to McCarthy starts from Tonzina on Richardson Highway and takes at least 2 hours one way without stops . However , you will likely stop a lot on the way , for watching fishing wheels near Chitina River Bridge , then near old wooden railroad bridge , then to picture your car at narrow bridge , crossing one of the creeks , or to watch occasional moose or bear . You should plan to stay at least few days in McCarthy , up to a week . Place to stay is Kennicott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in advance . Things to do here : Hike Root Glacier . The lodge has excellent guides : all levels of expertise are welcomed , all are carefully sorted to groups based on interests and taken full care of without unnecessary tight supervision ( in a good way ) ; do a river rafting . It is really interesting and not very challenging , children can even float their own vessel ; walk along the Root Glacier . Icefall wall at the beginning of the glacier is one of the most majestic and picturesque ( weather permitted ) in the world in my opinion . Explore the old Kennicott Mine . It is pretty unique experience . hire a small plane at Mccarthy and fly to one of the mountain valleys for an unforgetable picnic in one of the most untouched wilderness areas in the world ( many peaks and valleys still has no names here ) ; Walk through and around tiny and pretty town of McCarthy , where many artists now live permanently . <p> Southwestern Alaska . It is likely my most favorite part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be able to describe everything I want , so let it be just brief guidelines for places to visit . The best ( and in most situations the only ) way to get from one town to another in this part of Alaska is by ferry or by plane . Car ferries are good , not overly expensive and run on schedule , booking in advance is not vitally necessary if you travel without car , but absolutely essential if you want to have your own car with you ( which I certainly recommend to do ) <p> Stay at Haines for several day . Here : Visit Chilkat river for bald eagle viewing ; Mosquito lake is picturesque ; Salmon fishing on Chilkat and Chilkoot rivers ( they are different ) are fun to watch and easy to participate ; Chilkat SP trail ( on Chilkat peninsula ) is very interesting , especially if you like mushrooms or berries , moose or porcupine sightings are common ; Hike Battery Point Trail ; Ferry to Scagway ( without your car , passenger ferry between Haines and Scagway is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scagway . It is plainly touristy city . Its population is 600 ( in summer , threefold smaller in winter ) , cruise ships bring 9,500 passengers a day . It is insane . Tuesday and Thursdays are the busiest days , with at least four cruise ships docked there . When in Scagway , you may take one of the excursions ( all are too touristy in my taste ) or walk through the town . Do n't  expect to find -good restaurants , they are all touristy , except , maybe , few Filipino restaurants ( most crews on Alaska cruise lines are from Philippines ) . <p> Juneau : drive ( or take bus ) to Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center . No access to glacier itself here , just a view point and several trails runs from here . However , at least one tour company http : //beyondak.com/ do a guided tours to glacier , and they even do a kayaking tour to the glacier . I did n't  use it , but my friends did and were pretty happy ; do a trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be combined with Mendenhall Glacier visit ; Take a Tramway from the city and than do hike from up there to Mt . Roberts . The Tram is very popular with cruise ship hordes , so better plan this trip for the day , when the city is less crowded with cruises ( my guess Monday and Wednesday are the busiest days , but better check ii out ) ; take one of the city nature trails . Some other trails ideas can be found here LONG ... drive to Eagle Beach , that may be bears here ( beside eagles ) at low tide even from July till October ; also in the city : zip lines , breweries , gardens , some good japanese restaurants . <p> Gustavus : It is mainly a hub for Glacier Bay NP . Book a tour and have fun ; <p> Petersburg : Very authentic fishing village in a nice low-lying fiord settings . Best part of ferry passage starts here . Worth staying for a few days or just ferry through . Relatively easy kayak trips from here to LeConte glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is closer to very nice bear viewing river ( Anan River Near Observatory ) ; <p> Ketchikan : It is a hub for floatplane excursions . City itself is mostly touristy in its central and most interesting part , place to visit is Ketchikan Creek area with its salmon runs and picturesque old houses on stilts . <p> Prince of Wales island This pretty big island ( accessible from Ketchikan via float plane or easy 3 hours car ferry ) has largest paved road network from all Alaskan islands . It is one of the best islands in the world for salmon fishing or for salmons run watching . Plenty of bears , also . Nice and very well maintained trails , funny fishing villages . I love this island . <p> Hyder . This tiny village is accessible from Stewart , BC . The place is must to visit ( best way to drive from Cassiar highway , BC ) . Stay at Stewart at Ripley Creek Inn , best rooms are 301 and 306 . The reason to visit this place is Salmon Glacier . It is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your car . And the glacier is majestic ! Added bonus is wonderful Bear glacier on the way to Stewart from Cassiar Highway and plenty of black bears along the road ( sightings are guaranteed ) . <p> I do n't  know where to start . Greatly appreciate the time it took for you to share all your tips on Alaska . Some awesome insights here and these tips will be super useful when we visit . Love these type of tips from others who have traveled their previously . It seems like you know Alaska well = <p> I was in Alaska for just over three weeks last summer and loved it ! My favourite places were Seward make sure to do a day cruise in Kenai Fjords National Park , Sitka my favourite little town in Alaska with tons of hiking trails , salmon run , close knit community and kayaking around the small offshore islands , and Talkeetna a gorgeous historic town where you can take flightseeing tours around Denali from and make sure you eat breakfast at The Roadhouse . Breakfast at the Snow City Cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best breakfasts I have EVER had . I have tons of Alaska posts on my blog if you want to take a look LONG ... = <p> Were heading to Alaska for a month in August and are so excited ! Were renting a jeep with a pop up roof tent so are hoping to be able to explore off the beaten track . Really excited for Chena Hot Springs and Circle , you 're supposed to be able to see the Northern lights from there sometimes ! Also the McCarthy Road sounds awesome . Will be looking back to see what other suggestions people come up with so we can add some of them to our itinerary ! Will post back after our trip with any cool places we find = <p> Love what you guys are doing . We almost did a road trip through America November / December last year but we felt the weather in certain states would prevent us from visiting some of the places we wanted to . We ended up choosing to visit Japan &amp; Bali instead so America is still on our bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past summer . The absolute highlight of the trip was taking a plane trip from Talkeetna up to Denali and landing on Ruth Glacier . Be sure to allow 3+ days as Denali is often not visible . <p> Alaska was breath taking ! We did not have plans when we got there just went on an adventure . The drive from Anchorage to Seward is amazing ! A must do ! Plus the town of Seward is quaint and adorable with great seafood . Loved Punch bowl Glacier too . We went around June 1st when tourist season just opens and we were the first ones to do everything that we attended . Awesome adventure ! <p> I lived in alaska for three years . Some of the places we went to was homer , its a sweet little town and I would recommend you take a fishing charter . To catch some salmon and halibut . Also another great place to go is Seward , the drive there is just beautiful . There is hiking , fishing , just to name a few things . One more place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice caves , walk on glaciers . Lost of places to hike and there 's two beautiful waterfalls right by the road . I miss alaska . <p> I lived in " The Interior " for several years and absolutely loved it . When you arrive in Anchorage make sure you visit the Kenai Peninsula . Some of the most beautiful scenery and coolest towns in the world I was especially fond of Soldotna and Homer . If you love sports the halibut fishing is the absolute best in the world off of Homer there are amazing national parks everywhere , and I recommend the train from Anchorage to Fairbanks . Its a slow moving 10-12 hour trip but the food is great , you can walk around and relax , and the views on the tour are spectacular . If you 're there in the summer and want to spend some time exploring in and around Fairbanks , check out the university ( UAF ) they used to rent out apartments like hotel rooms over the summer . There are miles of hiking trails right on campus . Alaskas incredible give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's just so much to see and experience . Have fun ! <p> Not sure if you 're still looking for recommendations , but we just got back from Alaska and it was amazing . Denali is a given , but Wrangell St. Elias is an equally beautiful park . We took a bush plane over the Wrangell Mountains and it was definitely on of the highlights of the trip . We stayed in Chitina right outside of the park at the Chitina House B&amp;B and we 'd highly recommend it . There is n't much going on in the town but it felt like an authentic small Alaskan town and the surroundings were gorgeous . Also , you should drive the Denali Highway . The views are incredible . <p> Hi ! Lots of great tips here ! A few other thingsplease remember the public libraries for free wifi access and FREE community performances or events . The Milepost is such a useful travel reference book , consider purchasing your own copy . If you prefer to blend in when visiting , let your jeans get dirty ! Nobody cares about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to stand out . Buy a growler from any brew house , brewery , grocery store , wherever . There are lots of great microbrews available throughout the state . <p> Love that you have an Alaska Bucket List ! I live in a village here in Alaska and I definitely recommend to everyone travelling here to visit a village if you get the chance . The Alaska Railroad is also an amazing trip ! <p> We called Anchorage home for 3 years , and I still miss it every single day . I definitely recommend visiting Kincaid Park ( and the stone beach there ) , saying hi to the animals at the Alaska Zoo , taking a wildlife/glacier cruise out of Whittier or Seward and definitely going halibut or salmon fishing ! Denali is also a must , but it looks like you already know that ! Enjoy your journey = <p> We just spent 4 weeks exploring Alaska and it was Amazing ! So many adventures to list a few off the top of my head that we loved Our new favorite city is Juneau Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climbing , Ice Caving , Gold Panning , Heli-hiking , to Cruising . One huge one was wild bear viewing and camping in Lake Clark NP . It is a worlds top 100 travel adventure and an experience of a lifetime .

Jenna shares with us her insider tips on the best things to do in the Napa Valley including where to drink wine , eat , sleep , shop and explore . <h> Why Visit Napa Valley California ? <p> Napa Valley is a world famous wine growing region , but it is also much more . <p> The biggest reason to visit the Napa Valley is that its incredibly beautiful . The hills covered with grape vines , - which change colors all year , are gorgeous . The wineries , including the architecture and gardens , are another reason to visit . <p> Also , there is are many things to do in the Napa Valley . There are five towns that make up Napa Valley , and each one offers something different , from hot springs to hiking and shopping to fine dining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Things to Do in Napa Valley <p> Drive the Silverado Trail and stop in wineries along the way . Rent a bike and explore all the small roads . Check out all that Downtown Napa has to offer , including the Oxbow Public Market . <p> Clos Pegase is a great choice if you want something different the owner has a huge collection of art scattered around the winery . <p> Everyone should also know about the wine tasting in Downtown Napa . You can get a wine tasting card for $25 and taste wine at 12 tasting rooms , and you can park your car for free and walk from one to the next . Definitely , an easy , inexpensive , and safe way to try lots of different Napa wines . <h> Places to Eat in Napa Valley <p> Oenotri is a fantastic Italian restaurant in Downtown Napa . And of course there is one of the best restaurants in the U.S. , French Laundry , which requires reservations well in advance . <p> Morimoto <p> If you are looking for budget food options , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a quick mealthere are many different purveyors , from authentic Italian pizza to French crepes and Venezuelan food , and everything is fresh and local . <p> Bistro Sabor in Downtown Napa has excellent food from Latin America . <h> Where to Drink in Napa Valley <p> Certainly , wineries and wine tasting rooms/wine bars are the preferred places to drink in this area , but if you 're looking for something different , there are a few good bars/breweries to choose from . <h> Places to Stay in Napa Valley <p> There is no shortage of wonderful places to stay in the Napa Valley . <p> Andaz Napa and the Napa River Inn are two excellent choices in Downtown Napa . Staying there means you are within walking distance of everything you need , and both hotels offer unique high-end accommodations . <p> The Napa Valley area is expensive , so there are n't  really budget options , but there are Best Western and Travelodge in Napa , and you can get good deals at the hotels in Calistoga by looking online ahead of time . <p> For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com . You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Best Markets and Shopping in the Napa Valley <p> The Oxbow Public Market is definitely worth a visit . Not only can you eat there , but you can also buy products to take home for yourself or others , like locally made olive oil and chocolates . It hosts a farmers market on Saturdays , May-October . <p> There are boutique shops in Downtown Napa and St. Helena , definitely worth a visit if you want to buy something special from the area . <h> Events &amp; Festivals in the Napa Valley <p> There are tons of events and festivals going on year-round in the Napa Valley . <h> Getting Around the Napa Valley <p> However , you can hire a driver or use a tour to get around .

Winter can actually be a great time to visit . It can rain for a few days at a time , but that is followed by sunny , even warm days , and the mustard plants paint the valley yellow . <p> Winter is also the time to enjoy lower prices and better service since there are many fewer visitors then . <p> Fall <h> Getting There &amp; Away <p> The Oakland International Airport is the closest airport , just 50 miles away . Santa Rosa airport is even closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In addition , Napa Valley is easily accessed from either San Francisco and Sacramento , both about one hours drive . Both Oakland and San Francisco airports have shuttle service to Napa Valley . <h> Best insiders tip for the Napa Valley <p> A really fun experience is " Build Your Own Blend " at District4 Wine in Downtown Napa . Visitors try a few different varietals of wine , mix them together over and over until creating the perfect blend , design their own label , and take home 3 bottles of their special blend . Plus , District4 is worth a stop because its very cool and serves excellent boutique wines . <h> I love Napa Valley because <p> It is an incredible mix of beauty , luxury , and fine food and wine , yet it still feels friendly and accessible . <h> Plan Your Trip to the Napa Valley 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation in the Napa Valley <p> Booking.com- has over 100 properties in the Napa Valley including hotels , apartments , and hostels .

One of our favourite wineries to visit and Thank God we were on a bike was del Dotto . We did the barrel tasting pricey yes at around $40 pp but you could literally drink about 18 ounces of wine and who wants to spit the good stuff ? I wrote a post on the experience Blotto at del Dotto . Memorable , delicious . Napa is also amazing for bike riding and in fact there are maps made showing all the bike friendly routes . We spent 10 days exploring the area self supported with the only downside that we could n't carry much wine . Also loved the Cakebread tasting . I love this post Jenna . <p> What an epic guide ! I 'm heading out to Napa this month . Ive been a bit lost planning , because the area is so massive . There are so many wineries I want to visit and its been hard to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely handy . The tips I think I 'll definitely use are about District4Wine , the Truffle Festival in January , visiting Oxbow Public Market , purchasing a wine tasting card and of course making use of the places that offer free wifi . I know Ive not planned nearly enough time for Napa , but that just means I 'll have to visit again . Thanks for writing this . <p> I agree that choosing wineries can be overwhelming . If I were you , I would stop by the Napa Valley tourist office ( there are 2 in Downtown Napa ) and ask them for recommendations besides the ones I mention here . Tell them what you like to do and what your price range is for tasting . Some wineries charge $50 for tasting now , but there are plenty of great ones that are still $15-20 . And the tasting rooms in Napa with the tasting card are a great way to go ! <p> I 've spent significant time over the last 6 years visiting , tasting with and writing online reviews of Napa wineries with the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Napa County . My personal mission is to promote Napaand is a self funded project . <p> To date , I 've visited , tasted and written about more than 700 unique Napa wineries with unbelievably several hundred still to go .

I 'm happy to make some good recommendations . <p> Hey Dave , My wife and I are visiting Napa this week And will be in town for 5 days .. <p> What would be the top five wineries we should visit ?

I could drive my 1 ton dually but would rather just enjoy the trip . <p> great blog . We just booked our first trip to Napa late December through new year ! Are cabs accessible ? Rental car not the best move for drinking wine all day lol . Wanted to do our own route for wineries. not feeling the tours I looked at so farThoughts ? <p> I am planning to visit California and still looking for the best place to go there , I 'm glad Ive seen your blog through google and I 've decided to go there in Napa valley .

For that , I recommend visiting The Napa Wine Project or yTravel Blog . I 'm merely going to explain why I chose the stops I did , and why I think you should consider

@@21820627 @1820627/ <h> 9 Ways to Experience the Magic of Uluru <p> Uluru , previously known as Ayers Rock in The Red Centre of Australia had escaped us for 40 years . <p> Its not that we 've never wanted to visit , it 's always been at the top of our Aussie bucket list , but with all our overseas adventures and the age old attitude of Australia will always be there , we put it on the back burner . <p> Youve probably seen hundreds of photos , postcards and TV commercials of Uluru , but its a place you have to see , and feel , for yourself . <p> Uluru has been a very spiritual place to the the Anangu people , the traditional owners , for thousands of years . Ask most people who visit and spiritual experience is the word they often use to describe it . <p> Made of arkosic sandstone , Uluru stands 348 metres high and is taller than The Eiffel Tower and 2.5 times the height of Sydney Harbour Bridge . <p> After spending a week here and getting to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the heart of Australia . <h> 1 . Lasseter Highway Sand Dune <p> The anticipation was building as we turned off the main Stuart Highway and headed along Lasseter Highway in the direction of Uluru . <p> There 's this unofficial lookout at the top of a small sand dune . You 'll come across a free roadside campground approximately 20 kilometres before you enter the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park boundary , you cant miss it . <p> Even though you are still quite a distance from THE ROCK , that first sighting is something special and you can feel its presence and of what 's yet to come . <h> 2 . Sunset at Uluru <p> The are several lookout spots for sunset at Uluru around the town of Yulara and within the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park . Every lookout and sunset offers a different perspective of the vibrant and ever changing colours . <p> The most popular sunset spot is the official SUluru Sunset Lookout about 10 kilometres down the road through the entrance gates of the park ( entry fee $25 for three days ) . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with Uluru , I 'm sure you 'll recognize this profile shot , and like us , you 'll be overwhelmed by its incredible size , presence and spirituality . <p> We visited in late February ( out of peak season ) and sunset was around 7.10pm , and it was still quite busy . <p> If you come in peak season get here early . Set up your camp chair and tripod , bring some nibbles and cold drinks and enjoy the magical transformation as the sun sinks below the desert horizon . <p> The other option within the National Park is the Talinguru Nyakunytjaku sunset and sunrise lookout . <p> There 's a tiered viewing platform here which offers uninterrupted views of Uluru and you 'll see the sun setting in the distance , with views of Kata Tjuta 50 kilometres away . <p> Not as popular here at sunset as the first spot , but a totally different story at sunrise as you 'll read down below . <h> 3 . Uluru Sunrise <p> We dragged the kids out of bed at 5. am each day and jumped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park ( sunrise was around 6.20am ) . <p> Its the best time of day at Uluru , especially if you come in summer like us and need to beat the heat . Regardless of what time of year you come , seeing the desert and the rock come alive is an unmissable moment . <p> For our first Uluru sunrise , we headed back to the- Talinguru Nyakunytjaku lookout . Be warned , this is where hordes of people and tour buses converge and was very busy even in the off-season . Again , get here early unless you like people in the foreground of your photos . <p> To escape the bulk of the crowd and for a closer sunrise view of Uluru , walk down to the track a little in front of the viewing platform , set up your tripod and self-timer , and snap a priceless family portrait . <p> HOT TIP : <p> For a great Uluru sunrise silhouette , on another morning head back to the sunset lookout spot and you 'll get the rock blocking the sun as she rises . <p> Whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had this sunset spot all to ourselves , and this magnificent silhouette ! <p> Caz even took a moment for a morning yoga session . <p> Outside of the park and in the town of Yulara , another good Uluru sunrise option is the Ewing Lookout near the camel farm . <p> You 're much further away from Uluru , but if you do n't  feel like getting up as early to drive into the park it makes for a nice option , also with distant views of Kata Tjuta . <p> I used my 300mm canon lens to zoom in and get this amazing view of Kata Tjuta from the Ewing Lookout : <h> 4 . Kata Tjuta dune viewing area <p> here 's an extra hot tip . For another brilliant sunrise silhouette of Uluru head to the Kata Tjuta dune viewing area . <p> We 'll be writing about Kata Tjuta in an upcoming post , but we were pleasantly surprised when we drove the 50 kilometres out from Yulara to watch the sunrise over Kata Tjutua , and then looked back and saw this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to the naked eye this perspective turned out being one of my favourite spots in the whole park ! <h> 5 . Uluru base walk <p> One of the best things we did as a family was walking around the base of Uluru . We 've done some great walks on this trip around Australia but nothing quite like the one at Uluru . <p> The loop walk is 10.6 kilometres around the whole base of the rock and it took us 3.45 hours , and that 's with a three and seven-year-old and taking lots of photos . <p> The walk is completely flat with one short sandy section but otherwise solid footing underneath . <p> Remember though you 're in the Outback so it 's best to start this walk early at first light to beat the heat . The park opens daily at 5am and as soon as we watched sunrise we were off . <p> We suggest starting at the Kuniyawalking point and heading anti-clockwise . The back face of Uluru does n't get any shade so it 's best to walk this section early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 degrees celsius they close this walk from 11am . <p> Take lots of water , snacks and short breaks . There are a few drinking stations around the loop and do n't  forget a wide-brimmed hat , comfortable walking shoes or sandals , and sunscreen . <p> There were quite a lot of flies at the time of our visit , but a head net soon took care of that . <p> Our kids , aged seven and three , did great . We had to carry little Savannah part of the way sharing the load but its all part of the family adventure . <p> We did it . A priceless family pic at the end of the walk is compulsory <p> If you 're wondering about climbing Uluru , yes its still legal to do it and about 20% of all visitors do , but we chose not to out of respect for the traditional owners who request people do n't  as its such an important sacred site . <p> Regardless , the 800-metre steep climb is actually quite dangerous , people have died , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anangu people have to say : <h> 6 . Cycle the base <p> If you 're not up to walking the 10.6 kilometres around the base , a great alternative is to hire bikes from Outback Cycling ( $30 for three hours ) or bring your own and bike it . <p> We had a tag-along for Kalyra who enjoyed the relaxation of letting daddy do most of the peddling , and little Savannah took in the sights in a baby seat on the back of Cazs bike . <p> The 15-kilometre track took us about two hours , again stopping for more photos and drink breaks , and it was a thoroughly enjoyable family experience , not to mention another much-needed workout. <h> 7 . Free Ranger Guided Mala Walk . <p> Your third option if you do n't want to walk or bike the whole 10.6 kilometres of Uluru is to participate in the two-kilometre return walk ( 1.5 hours ) free ranger guided Mala walk . <p> A ranger will take you along the base of the rock , stopping to tell the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anangu culture , rock art and how the park is managed . 8.00 am October to April . 10.00 am May to September . <p> You can even participate in this walk and then head off and complete the entire base walk by yourself . <h> 8 . Uluru sunset camel ride <p> Looking for someone else to carry your load whilst you sit back and marvel at the landscape , then one of the unique ways to take in Uluru is on the back of a trusty camel . <p> Our kids , and us big kids , absolutely loved this experience . Weve ridden camels at sunset before on Cable Beach in Broome , but I think this was better ! <p> Little Savannah rode up front like a boss and I shared a camel with Kalyra . Our camel was a bit of a cranky bum to start with but soon fell into line , as they do . <p> As you can see everyones happy to be at Uluru . They 're a funny animal the old camel , always up for a pose and why wouldnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of our one hour ride again we had amazing views all the way over to Kata Tjuta , and a nice touch was the beer , wine and nibbles back at the camel farm . <h> 9 . Sunset drinks with AAT Kings <p> A fitting farewell to our time at Uluru was sipping on a few glasses of champagne with the folks from AAT Kings . <p> By now we 'd spent seven days by ourselves in and around Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park , and it was nice to mingle with others from around the world and share stories and feelings of what its like to take in the wonder of Uluru . <p> Its a sight you never get tired of seeing , an experience you never get tired of feeling , and funnily enough looks and feels even better ofter a few glasses of the old bubbly ! <p> Cheers . <p> We had the most amazing time exploring Uluru . It was everything we imagined and then some . <p> No , we did n't  do every experience on offer at Uluru , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the National Park and Yulara . <p> You can be sure it wont be another 40 years until we return . <p> On our bucket list is the Sounds of Silence dining experience under the stars ( when the kids are a bit older ) and a helicopter flight sounds amazing too ! <p> Do n't  just come for a day , stay a while and really get to know what I now know to be truly the " heart of Australia " . <p> I did this three years ago and stayed for three days . You can do sunset , sunrise and the basewalk in two days and one night . Some extra days will give you the chance to see kings canyon and kata tjutua aswell . <p> I think 3 nights would be a good amount of time as this gives you 2 full days 1 to explore Uluru and the other for Kata-Tjuta . It would also give you enough time for a photographic session during at least one sunset and one sunrise , as well as a chance to look round the cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> If only you had more than 2 weeks for all of Oz right ? ! = I agree with the others , if you can make it 3 nights / 2 days and see at least one sunset , one sunrise and either walk or cycle around the base of Uluru . Hope this helps ? ? <p> Great photos , Craig ! I know what you mean about leaving Uluru for later in life because you know its waiting there , right in the middle of Australia and not too difficult to get to . I went there as a young child with my family but even still I really want to go back as I was too young to remember much . My mum took the most amazing series of photos at sunset where the rock changed from pale orange through to bright glowing red , to purple and blue . <p> Awesome photos of Uluru , you did a great job of capturing the spirit of this site . Truly a magical place <p> I visited 2 days in October on my visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top highlights ! I saw Uluru at sunset from the viewing area , and was doing walks in the morning , so missed that . I took the camel ride as wellgreat fun ! I had to laugh when you said your camel was cranky , was its name Ned Kelly by any chance ? <p> I spent 16 days in Australia , spent a few days each in Melbourne , Sydney , Hobart , Uluru and Cairns , and I can not wait to visit again , the country , people , sites and wildlife are just amazing . <p> What a nice variety of ways to experience Uluru ! Its interesting to notice how big it isit does n't  seem so large in photos from far away , but seeing you guys up close next to it really shows the scale . <p> BIG it is Jenna . When you come visit us from California , and you must come visit us , put some quality time aside for Uluru and the Red Centre , your family will love it , this is Australia right here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Facebook !

How wonderful it will be to have them one day to look back on when Savannah and Kalyra are all grown up . Loved your descriptions of the area too , and your insider tips , which not everyone would know about . Gosh , I visited over 30 years ago , and from what I remember there was only a campsite and a pub very little else . <p> You have taken some of the best photos of Uluru I have seen .

Uluru is so captivating and in a way , has such a mysterious air about it . Its one of the places I was really hoping to visit when I lived in Australia for a short time but unfortunately I did n't  make it there . I 'm keeping it on my " someday " list though , as I would love to see it with my own eyes ! Jessicahttp : //www.thebellevoyage.com <p> my husband and I visited this area for a week 15 years ago .

Your site has been amazing for us . We got lots of ideas from your blogs. thank you very much . My question : Visiting in December ( possibly during Christmas/New Years time , will this be crowded ? Is it a big time to visit Uluru ? Not sure if I should reserve camp site as we will rent a campervan . We will be flying in from Cairns before this . ANy suggestions are welcomed . Thanks . <p> We are off to Uluru at the end of June because of THIS post . Considering we have only been home from our big lap for 3 months too ! ! you guys are inspiring . We will hire bikes from the same crowd . So much easier than dragging all of ours . Cheers <p> This brings back memories ! One of my first all out backpacking trips was around Australia . We camped out under the stars after watching the sun set on Uluru . The night skies out there are magical . Great post , and I 'm glad you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respect for the original people of the land . <p> Agree with everything here , but its a sign of the PC age we live in that climbing the rock does n't  get a mention . I lived there for 2 years and climbed it several times , it was amazing every time . Youll be told the aboriginals get upset by people climbing the rock but I talked to so many of them while there and they do n't  really care , they are more offended by people photographing them than climbing the rock , its just a bit of spin for the tourists . So climb it , its incredible ! <p> Reading your blog is very inspiring . We are heading to Uluru from Rockhampton QLD via the dinosaur trail , in September this year . We have four children , aged 11 , 9 , 7 and 5 . I have a silly sounding question for you.how does everyone hold onto their bladders for the 10km base walk around Uluru ? <p> You mentioned taking the Red Centre Way , sadly there is not map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centre Way . Google maps has it as Larapinta Dr , is this correct Many Thanks , you have a great blog <p> Hi Lorraine , I have 2 links for you . Here is a link to more information on the Red Centre Way from the Northern Territory Tourism website . You can download a PDF which has a map and a suggested 6-day itinerary from Alice to Uluru ( or in reverse ) . Link : LONG ... <p> Great post ! A friend and I are trying to plan a trip here in early June . What would you recommend for someone flying in on how to get there ? I do n't  think well be renting a car , but would this be necessary , or are there other ways to get from the airport to the hostels/activities at the rock ? Thanks so much ! <p> Hi Heidi , you actually have to fly into Alice Springs which is the nearest airport to the rock , and Uluru is then approximately a 4-hour drive from Alice . So you can either rent a car from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or take a tour from Alice . <p> Fantastic read , fantastic photos , our Daughter and son in law live in NT we are about to go back for another visit , love love love the place , and we are about to revisit everywhere where you took us in your story , its a very emotional and spiritual place so Thankyou <p> is the most beautiful moment you are glad you have experienced together ? Spending time together at Uluru was pretty magical . We did sunset camel rides , biked and walked around the rock , and enjoyed

Its a murky visualization- as there is far too much concrete now covering the view . <p> Except when you get to the Town of 1770 and you explore the nearby beaches and creeks and headlands that Cook and his crew- sailed past . Its natural state has been unchanged for thousands of years . <p> I could imagine the wonder they felt meeting- furry animals hopping along the beach guided by their tails , sting rays gliding along the sandy floor of the river , and- dolphins guiding the nose of the Endeavour into a safe anchorage . <p> I could imagine Joseph Banks confusion and awe as he came across hundreds of species of plants hed never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hibiscus flowers , and small forested valleys filled with beautiful blue butterflies . <p> This is the Town of 1770 and Agnes Water . <p> The longer I stayed the longer I wanted to stay .

He 's a member of the Adelaide Oval he reckons it 's the best in Australia . ( He plays for the over 70 's Australian team so he 's bit of an expert ! ) <p> Well you know what my thoughts were on it If Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daggy . <p> I arrived in Adelaide last year , for a brief one night stay , curious to see if- this small city was boring and slow more suited to oldies , or did it have something a bit more modern and hip that could cater to my interests ? <p> My Dad must be a bit of a hipster in his old age because he was right ! <p> Adelaide has charm , sophistication , history , elegant beauty and a fresh , gentle , fun way of living that does n't zap your energy like the big buzzing cities of Sydney and Melbourne do . <p> It 's a destination that will surprise and inspire . <p> I left with Adelaide sitting at the top of our list for a much longer stay when we arrive on our road trip at the end of this year . I 'm penciling in a couple of weeks to explore more deeply . <p> Here are eight- reasons you should forget Sydney and Melbourne for your next getaway and head to Adelaide . <h> 1 . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stunning wow factor of Sydney , but Adelaide has a softer gentle beauty with the surrounding hills to the east , beautiful beaches to the west , luxuriously wide boulevards , many parks and gardens , enormous skies and wide-open spaces . <p> Unlike Sydney and Melbourne , Adelaide offers you space to breathe . <p> Everything you need is only 20 minutes away and with a population of only 1 million , you can swing and spin with arms wide open while appreciating all it has to offer . <h> 2 . The food capital of Australia <p> It has over 80 stalls , cafes and restaurants all showcasing local produce . You can watch cheese being made , feast on chocolate , enjoy coffee from an Italian family with a 55 year history in the markets , or buy from green grocers who 've been operating for more than 35 years . There is even a food tour you can do of the markets . <p> In the city , highly awarded fine dining restaurants exist alongside pop up bars and food trucks . There 's over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watering holes in arcades and hidden laneways . <p> I am currently in Adelaide , speaking at the Tasting Australia festival , and gorging myself on more great food . I highly recommend Pure Boutique Coffee- in Glenelg , Cafe Zuma for breakfast at the Central Markets , and Ky Chow in Chinatown. <h> 3 . The wine capital of Australia <p> There 's nothing I like more during the winter than to sit around a cosy fire on a vineyard with a superb glass of Australian Shiraz . <p> There are wineries all around Australia and near to the capital cities , but in Adelaide , there are several within an hour 's drive . <p> You 'll find some of Australia 's most recognized brands such as Penfolds , Yalumba , Wolf Blass and Jacob 's Creek . It 's the place where some of the best wine in the country is made . With a nation full of superb wine growers , this is a statement that must be tested . <p> You 're spoilt for choice : Barossa Valley , Mclaren Vale , Clare Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no other capital city in Australia that offers you such easy access to many different wine regions . <p> How can you not love a city where Australia 's best food and wine meet ? <p> Read more about things to do in the Barossa Valley and Adelaide Hills- here , here , and here . <h> 4 . There 's a greater Adelaide <p> If you move just a short distance in any direction from the CBD , you 'll discover a diversity of regions to satisfy any person 's interests : Wine regions , beautiful beaches , historical towns , unusual villages in the hills , abundant wildlife and stunning landscapes . <p> Most of Adelaide 's beaches are within a 30-minute drive and with the warm climate can be appreciated almost all year round . Glenelg , the main tourist beach is only 12km from town . I visited last week and the resident seal waved to me while swimming 5 metres from shore ! <h> 5 . You can explore the- city by bike <p> Adelaide is an easy city to explore by bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parklands , and well-marked and safe bicycle lanes on the city streets . <p> I enjoyed a lovely bike ride along the Torrens River and through the parklands of East Adelaide . There are plenty of sightseeing places along the way , I preferred losing myself in the stunning Botanical Gardens . The bike path does a loop around the city or you can even cycle out to the beaches . <h> 6 . Festivals and Events <p> Another reason Adelaide is high on our bucket list is the wide variety of festivals and events on offer . You get the party and fun without the maddening crowds . <p> Now 's the season for the sports mad to experience the thrill of a live AFL game . Mad March is when you throw your party boots on as it 's the hot festival time . The most known festivals in Adelaide are the Fringe Festival , WOMADelaide , Tour Down Under , and Tasting Australia . <p> But Adelaide also has many smaller , just as fun , festivals and events such as Splash Adelaide , which focuses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop-up street parties and restaurants , performances , night markets , and mobile food vendors . <h> 7 . Eclectic lifestyle <p> Photo credit : South Australian tourism <p> It might have a lot of history , being Australia 's first free settlement , but Adelaide is overbrimming with multiculturalism which is reflected in their suburbs , food experiences and festivals . <p> German influence is strong in the Barossa Valley and the Adelaide Hills a must visit suburb is Hahndorf . The Irish founded the Clare Valley and Italians , Greeks and Asians have a strong influence in the region 's food . <h> 8 . It has Kangaroo Island <p> Kangaroo Island Photo credit : South Australian tourism <p> My heart bursts every time I think of Kangaroo Island . I 've not been yet , but I already love it . ( I 'm trusting Mum and Dad 's recommendation for this one . ) <p> Kangaroo Island is Australia 's answer to the Galapagos Island and is only two hours from Adelaide . It 's a remote and undiscovered destination that has stunning beauty , unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no crowds . I 'm booking myself in for a month . <p> Adelaide is pretty Rad ! <p> Now your toughest decision is what do you explore first ? ( I 'm getting back out into the Adelaide streets for more food and wine tasting ! ) <p> As Lonely Planet said when it named it in their Top 10 must visit cities for 2014 , <p> A gateway to some of Australia 's most accessible wine country , Adelaide is effortlessly chic " and like a perfectly cellared red , it 's ready to be uncorked and sampled , " <p> Time to uncork it ! <h> Plan Your Trip in Adelaide 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 69803 @qwx269803 <p> Flights 69807 @qwx269807 <p> Car Rental 69806 @qwx269806 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Hey guys !

I Love Sydney but i 'm glad i live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , as I have traveled a lot of Australia but not Adelaide . It sounds real similar to Perth , a place where I 've lived for a few years .

We fell in love with Melbourne , were wowed by Sydney yet I loved the compactness of Adelaide . Such a walkable city . Loved the markets , the food , and the people . The ride to the beach through parkland , the free bikes , and we are pretty unfit and we survived . Shush do n't  tell anyone but if I could move to Australia , I may choose Adelaide . <p> After growing up in the Australian outback , I moved to Adelaide for a decade from 16 years of age . I had a love-hate relationship with it and left for London not sure I 'd ever enjoying going back , other to visit friends and family . I can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind . I now go back every chance I can , for all the great reasons you state in your post . I recently asked my friends who still live there what they love most about it and by far , the most common answer was that it had the benefits of city-living and the accessibility to countryside , hills , wineries and beach . Great post ! <p> What a great reflective promotion of Adelaide . Ive been a couple of times and admit that I enjoyed my time in the city of churches . It has a nice vibe to the place and the wide roads are definitely true . The local fashion sense did leave me a little bemused though , a lot of people wearing bright greens and oranges for clothing ( and it was n't safety/work clothing either ) . <p> Amazing post with wonderful pictures.I 'm sure your personal experience in Adelaide has been as as delightfully diverse as these pictures as well.After reading your post I am looking forward to visit Adelaide very soon <p> Cats out of the bag now !

There are many holiday destinations within South Australia that are easily accessible when road tripping also Flinders Ranges ( absolutely must ) , Robe ( this is further along the coast ) , the Yorke Peninsula and Eyre Peninsula ( e.g. Port Lincoln , Port Vincent ) , Victor Harbor/Port Elliot , West Beach , Normanville , Burra , and more ! McLaren Vale is the wine region I am most familiar with having gone to school there . It boasts many lovely cafes and restaurants , amongst the vineyards and wineries where you can get wine tastings and cheese platters ! Hahndorf is also close to my heart , it boasts such history and culture . Do n't  forget Stirling , which is nearby , and has the most breathtaking scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart wrenching hike is worth it to look out over the beautiful city ( you can drive there too ! ) . Adelaide is a must-visit place for sure ! <p> I am not sure how I missed this Australian treasure but now that I know more about Adelaide and what this beautiful city offers , I might have to visit soon . It looks like it has a lot to do for almost everyone and I am sure even the most die-hard travelers will find a reason to love Adelaide .

Ningaloo Marine Park <p> Ningaloo Marine Park protects Ningaloo Reef Australia 's largest and most accessible fringing reef that stretches 300 kilometres and is just a stone 's throw from Exmouth . <p> Experiencing Ningaloo is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people come to town . And when they say accessible , they mean accessible ! <p> " The awesome thing about Ningaloo is the easy access , you can just walk in off the beach and be snorkeling 10 metres from shore . No 60-minute high-speed boat rides like the Great Barrier Reef " . <p> Because we were spending a week in Exmouth we finally decided to purchase our own snorkeling equipment from Tackleworld . The guys were super friendly and helpful and had us kitted out in no time . <p> Instead of camping in Cape Range National Park , we had decided to base ourselves in town in a holiday home and drive in and out each day to the amazing snorkeling spots on offer , just over an hour away . <h> Turquoise Bay , Ningaloo <p> When you dive into the waters of Turquoise Bay you 're swimming within metres of Ningaloo Reef . The " Bay " is brilliant for swimming , snorkeling or just relaxing . <p> Besides the Bay , try your hand at the popular drift snorkel , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ningaloo . <p> Either park at the " Drift " car park for direct access , or park at the " Bay " car park and walk about 300 metres south on the beach . Swim out a few metres and let the current carry you north , just make sure you exit before the sand bar which is prone to strong currents ! <h> Sandy Bay , Cape Range National Park <p> Endless white sand , crystal clear water , dark blue skies . The shallow waters of Sandy Bay made it an excellent beach for our kids , and when the wind is right apparently its a popular place for kite surfers . <p> We did n't  snorkel as much here as at Turquoise Bay , but grab your towel , your snorkeling gear and be prepared to be wowed . <p> There 's a picnic table with shade with prime positioning overlooking the beach for a lunch break or brekkie , or just as good is grabbing a spot on the sand ( there 's plenty of space ) for a few hours . Bring your own shade ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't  get to these spots but they came recommended from other travelers within our community and members of the tourism board : <p> Oyster Stacks great for fish life and best accessed on a high or incoming tide . Enter the water at the end of the walking track and snorkel either north or south . <p> Lakeside great snorkeling spot for swimmers of average fitness . From the carpark walk 400 metres south along the beach to the marked entry point . Snorkel out in a northerly direction for 150 metres before returning to your original entry point . <h> Diving in Ningaloo , Exmouth <p> We do n't  dive , but our friend Janina from 1770 Liquid Adventures worked at Exmouth Dive Centre a few years ago and says if you get a chance to go diving , do the Navy Pier dive . One of the BEST dives you 'll ever do . <h> Sunset at Vlaming Head Lighthouse <p> For a spectacular view of Ningaloo Reef and to witness another famous Western Australian sunset , grab some nibbles , a bottle of wine and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head Lighthouse . <p> And if you visit at the right time of year you could even be lucky enough to spot humpback whales migrating south . <h> Jurabi Turtle Centre <p> Sea turtles can be encountered on the Coral Coast all year round and hatchlings may be sighted during turtle nesting season between November and April . <p> Located 13 kilometres from Exmouth the Jurabi Turtle Centre is an interpretive educational facility to help manage turtle-visitor interaction and minimise disturbance on nesting marine turtles along the Ningaloo coast . <p> If you would like to view nesting turtles I recommend you visit the turtle centre and participate in a guided experience . <h> 2 . Cape Range National Park <p> You enter Cape Range National Park when driving from Exmouth to the above-mentioned snorkeling spots , its northern boundary is just 40 kilometres from town . <p> Besides the beaches and the snorkeling , this is what else we recommend in Cape Range : <h> Visit the Milyering Visitor Centre <p> Make your first stop the Milyering Visitors Centre located in the heart of Cape Range National Park and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The centre features interpretive information with videos , models and graphic displays to help make your visit informative . Its also a handy bathroom break once you 've driven the 52 kms from Exmouth . <h> Yardie Creek Gorge <p> Drive to the end of the sealed road in Cape Range and you get to Yardie Creek where you can explore the spectacular gorge either on foot via walking trails or on a Yardie Creek boat tour . <p> We decided to hike the 1-hour return Yardie Gorge Trail along the cliffs which offered brilliant views . We did n't  spot any of the local rock wallabies but the views were spectacular . <p> The only downer was the pesky flies , and I mean they were pesky , and a lot of them . Besides dealing with the flies , it can get very HOT here so best to walk early in the morning and bring adequate fluids . <h> Charles Knife Canyon <p> This drive was totally unexpected and we felt like we were back in the south-west USA . <p> An un-sealed road follows the ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky providing breathtaking views down into the multi-coloured gorges and all the way to the coast . <p> We stopped at several of the lookout points along the way for photo opps and then drove until you can drive no more and then turned around and came back down the hill .

Swim with Whale Sharks <p> Exmouth is famous for being a place where you can swim with the incredible whale sharks , the world's- biggest fish . <p> These massive but harmless to humans filter feeders can grow up to 18m long . <p> The chance to snorkel with the whale sharks was one of our bucket list items for our road trip around Australia , but because this is a seasonal experience and we are on an 18 month road trip around our MASSIVE country , its so hard to be in the right place at the right time for every experience . <p> Every year from April to July they congregate- along the Ningaloo Reef and unfortunately we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have to save for later . <h> Exmouth Accommodation <p> We stayed in a holiday home found on Airbnb which has fast become our new favourite site for booking homes and apartments throughout Australia . <p> If you 've been following our road trip around Australia , more often than not we call home our 5+3 camper trailer . <p> Not only is it our sleeping quarters , but home office and classroom for Kalyra . Things get a little cramped in there . <p> When we can we like to upgrade to a little more comfort and space with a full-kitchen , our own bathroom , separate bedrooms for the kids , and a dining room to use as an office . <p> Our rustic cottage in Exmouth slept up to 6 people and was an easy walk to the main shopping centre in town and proved to be a great base for us . <p> Kalyra was especially excited as she got to have her friend Maddie sleep over for the night who is also traveling around Australia , and we all had a fun Halloween party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our partnership with airbnb who are helping to keep us sane on the road . <p> BONUS Weve got a $32 credit for you when you sign up to Airbnb via this link ! <h> Plan Your Trip in Exmouth 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 69803 @qwx269803 <p> Flights 69807 @qwx269807 <p> Car Rental 69806 @qwx269806 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Hi Craig , this is a great round-up of Exmouths highlights ! The colours in your photos are beautiful . I cant wait to go back to Ningaloo and Karijini later this year . <p> If you ever go back , try to make it during the whale shark season and go swimming with them , its an amazing unforgettable experience but then again with all the travel you do maybe youll end up swimming with them somewhere else in the world one day . <p> We have n't been up as far as Exmouth yet , but your post has me itching to go though in whale shark season . The colours on your photos are absolutely stunning , and what some beautiful memories you 're all creating together one day when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip with enormous pride and great nostalgia . Btw . Your posts recently have totally swayed me towards using Airbnb . <p> I have n't visited Exmouth . I had planned to when I was in Western Australia but my plans changed and I did n't  go . Which I regret badly . But I guess that 's a good reason for me to come back to Australia = <p> Very impressed by your blog . Looks like paradise . Planning a trip in October/November for 6 weeks or so . Have family in Sydney but Would love to visit WA first . Wondering if we Will have enough time . Good luck .

@@21820636 @1820636/ <h> What Its Like to Fly Qantas Business Class <p> I have a new goal in life : to fly Qantas Business Class all the time , well at least for any long haul flight from Australia to another destination . <p> Hang on , that 's almost all international flights . <p> My other goal is to avoid LAX ( Los Angeles Airport ) at all costs . Does anyone else detest that airport ? <p> We recently had the pleasure of flying to and from the USA in business for our visit to The White House travel summit . From Australia to the US is one hell of a flight when you 're in economy , with your knees up to your chin and three inches of space for your torso to sit within , sleep does not come easy . <p> But being upgraded to business class on both our flights from Sydney to Dallas , and then from LA to Sydney made a HUGE difference in the on board experience AND feeling refreshed once we arrived its going to be hard to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kangaroo has always been our preferred airline since we were teenagers , and as we shared in this post- we had a lot of Qantas frequent flyer points saved up which helped to reduce the cost of our economy class tickets for this trip to the States . <p> So when they heard about our White House trip they kindly popped us on the standby list for business class upgrade and we crossed our fingers and toes hoping a seat would open up . <p> Simply being on the list was no guarantee of an upgrade , and on both flights , it was n't until the last minute when we handed over our economy boarding passes to the gate attendant that seats became available . JOY ! <p> Its like winning the golden ticket to Willy Wonkas ! <p> Many people wonder and ask what it is like to fly business class , so here is a little rundown of it for you . <h> Access to the business lounge <p> We had access to the business lounge before both our flights , which made the flying experience even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with complimentary food and drink . And showers ! <p> I needed the shower before our long flight to the US as we had flown the red eye before it from Perth with our kids , not much shut eye on that trip . <p> The Qantas lounge in Sydney was amazing " spacious , light , comfortable , modern and with nice views . I did n't like the Los Angeles lounge as much . It was a little darker , smaller and a lot busier . The food also was n't as good or did n't have as many options . <p> Thumbs up Sydney ! <p> Sydney Business Lounge <p> But , LAX is my most detested airport in the world anyway , so I could have had jaded glasses on . <h> You 'll probably see some famous people <p> Champagne anyone ? Why yes , we could get used to this ! Once we got settled in our seats we were enjoying a glass of the bubbly and then we had another nice surprise . <p> Steve Waugh , former Australian cricket captain ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the States . His family was seated behind us in business and he photo bombed our We made it to business class and are so happy photo ! <p> Once he settled his family in , he took off to First Class , lucky bugger ! <p> Steve Waugh photo bomb <p> And then in the LAX lounge , there was some famous rapper . He looked familiar and walked with a swagger and then when I saw him escorted to the plane with his entourage and eye-goggling attendants , I knew he must have been someone important . <p> No idea who he was though . He had silver teeth caps ! <h> Outstanding service <p> To be honest , I 've always been happy with the service on Qantas flights even in economy , but being in business you get outstanding attention . And so you should for the price ! Who does n't love their every whim catered for ? <p> You do n't even have to ask for another glass of wine , they just keep topping it up , and if you 're not careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons than one ! <p> Be aware of this because you might go to move and suddenly realise you 're a lot tipsier than you thought . Weee ! ! <p> OF course , I 'll have a Baileys ! Make it a double . <h> Excellent food <p> Business class food is like a fine dining experience . <p> I think I 'm one of those weird people that actually likes plane food . It 's the experience of just devoting my time to eating and watching a movie and joyfully opening each container to see what surprise it holds and of course we did n't  have the kids with us on this trip where dinner is hardly ever a relaxing experience ! <h> The seats on business class move <p> Not only can you lie completely flat with your seat to sleep , but you can recline it back to get comfy for a movie , or sit it back up to eat or type on your computer , or for reading a book . <p> And the seats are wide and comfortable . Just hit a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having to worry about encroaching on the space of the people behind you , you know , like when they have their tray table out and you want to sleep . <h> You can lie down <p> Okay so this is the prime reason for taking business class on long haul flights you have a bed ! <p> Jet lag is killer , and flying business wo n't necessarily get rid of it ( you can see my secret tips for dealing with it here ) , BUT it helps as you can actually get a good nights sleep especially for Craig who CAN NOT sleep in economy no matter what ! <p> Now , the beds are n't Westin Hotel plush comfortable . It 's still on a plane , so it 's a little harder than normal . But you actually get to lie flat and stretch your body out and have your own SPACE with no stranger resting their head on your shoulder . <p> Oh , and the little toiletry kit with socks helps you get all comfy and homey . <p> I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time I 've arrived in the US without feeling like a zombie . <p> If you can , try to time your sleep so that it starts to merge with the time zone of where you are arriving . It will help with your jet lag adjustment . <p> Apparently I missed the end of the movie ! <h> Massage chairs <p> This sealed the I must fly business class all the time goal for me . The seat has a massage function ! ! ! <p> I have flown business before on Delta and they did not have this . I almost squealed out loud and I had the massage function going for almost the entire 15-hour flight . <p> If I 'm going to be picky , I 'd say it could have been a bit harder , perhaps a deep tissue hardness would be good ! <p> It was very soothing . When I was woken during the night with a little turbulence I whacked that straight on to calm me down . <h> You have more private space <p> This can be a good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own space to just chill out and do what you want without having someone talk non-stop to you for 12 hours , or be stuck next to someone with a small bladder or bad body odour . <p> We even had a barrier that we could put up between Craig and I " it 's always great to be able to shut out your spouse when they annoy you ! It 's much more chilled . <h> How can you fly business class ? <p> Well , you can simply pay for your tickets . Of course , it is a lot more expensive , but if you have the money why not ? It 's my goal to get to that why not place ! <p> You can use points to upgrade . We use ourAmerican Express Business credit card through the Commonwealth Bank- to pay for everything , which gives us Qantas frequent flyer points . Gather enough of those and you might be able to upgrade or do points + pay . <p> Pray that lady luck shines upon you and you get a surprise upgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen anymore ? ! <p> Or , you could be fortunate enough to work for a company that will fly you business class . As happened when Craig worked for Delta and I scored a lucky standby seat . I can assure you , Qantas kicked their butt for quality and service . I was treated so rudely by the staff there . That is a story for another time ! <h> TIP for Aussies flying to the US <p> If you are flying Qantas to the east coast of the States , or LA is not your final destination , we highly recommend you consider flying direct to Dallas instead . It walks all over LAX . <p> We were through customs in no time , you can just jump on a train shuttle to your connecting terminal and it just has a more pleasant atmosphere . <p> We regretted flying back home through LAX . It 's utter chaos . It has been years since I 've seen lines so long , they were that long that we did n't even have to take our laptops out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to get through the security . <p> Insane . <p> And there are no interconnecting shuttles between terminals from behind security . We had to come out into the madness of the street scene that is LAX , walk to the Tom Bradley terminal , and then back through check-in and security again . Shuttle buses run every twenty minutes but it was quicker to walk , and if we did n't we would n't have made our connection . <p> The laugh of the day came from the LAX sign that said LAX is happening.com with a trademark symbol ! <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> I hate to say it , but I miss flying , if only for the upgrades to business class . = I havent flown business on QF in the past or on my RTW , but I had enough we-love-you status to use any and all of the Oneworld lounges , including the beautiful one in SYD . I 'm glad you both enjoyed QF business class ! <p> I used to fly business class on various airlines for work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly my family business class . But I got sick in 2010 and stopped working . I have n't flown business class since mid 2010 and miss it . My now 11 year old daughter misses it too . I dropped from Qantas platinum to bronze , and not once did they ask why we werent flying with them any more . I used to do 2 overseas trips a year , plus lots of domestic travel . Basically all Qantas . They never asked why . We still fly overseas on an annual basis , mostly economy unless there 's a super deal such as Air New Zealand having an auction to upgrade your seats . We are flying Qantas overseas for the first time in 5 years in June , but sadly in economy having lost my platinum status . <p> I have only flown long haul business class once and it was on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Brisbane on Etihad . It was brilliant ! You actually get treated like a real person , you have heaps of space and I was on the window so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they configure their planes . <p> The way I got it , and I have seen this on and Air NZ flights too , is that I actually put in a bid to get upgraded . Basically they emailed me to see if I wanted to pay extra to upgrade and on which leg I wanted to do it . I put in the minimum bid of $900 and luckily got upgraded . I figured that if my overall ticket from Brisbane to London return was $2800 which included business class on the longest leg then I was happy . <p> Unfortunately it was my last long haul flight and I came back saying I would never be able to travel economy again . I have another one coming up in August but I am hoping that I will have forgotten all about my business class experience by then = <p> I used miles to fly business class from New York to Melbourne . I was 18F flying from LAX to Melbourne ! While it was n't my first time sitting out of steerage , it was my first time flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have staircases inside . Ca n't say I was particularly thrilled with my dinner choice though . Benji and Joel Madden from Good Charlotte were on my flight . That would be Cameron Diaz and Nicole Ritchies husbands , respectively . <p> I would love to fly business class one day and looking at flights to Asia with Qantas miles recently I found a deal where it would only cost $187 in taxes + 45,000 points one way ! I think I will be booking that = <p> Business class is AWESOME ! We managed to get enough miles to fly business class from Honolulu to Bangkok for less than the cost of an economy class ticket and it was fabulous ! Like you , all I want is to be able to continue to do that for long-haul flights from now on business class makes flying actually enjoyable again bliss ! ! ! = <p> Loved seeing the pics you guys look like you really enjoyed the perks ! <p> Qantas is a much loved airline and its business class flying is wonderful . The business lounge is refreshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You get complimentary drinks too . However , the USP of Qantas is their service and when you get upgrade to business class it is even better . Adjusting the seats for sleeping or catching a movie is within finger tips and their food is lip smacking good . Now the massaging feature of these seats is like icing on cake . It will take many first time fliers by surprise . I think using Qantas frequent flyer points to win upgrade to business class is the best option for most economy class users . 
@@21820640 @1820640/ <h> 9 Ways to Prepare and Protect Yourself Before Working Abroad <p> Not only does it make the travel experience cheaper , but it turns the everyday mundane , like visiting the bank , into an exotic adventure . <p> Craig and I have followed the working holiday strategy for over 10 years . We 've worked in London , Dublin , Bangkok , and Raleigh , North Carolina . We loved every minute of it and we highly recommend everyone experiences working abroad at least once ( trust me , you 'll get addicted ) . <p> But , to ensure you have the best experience possible , we recommend you take some necessary steps to protect , prepare and keep you happy . <h> 1 . Have reserve money <p> Working abroad means you often do n't have to save as much money in the first place to travel long-term . It 's one of the major reasons we recommend doing it . <p> It 's ( mostly ) cheaper to travel on local currency and you 're always replenishing the purse with each new weekly pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do arrive with reserve money in the bank . <p> It 's highly likely something will go wrong . <p> Perhaps you wo n't get your first pay check for at least a month , you might need to pay a security bond for your apartment , or have to furnish a new place . <p> And of course you want to travel a little bit too . <h> 2 . Be prepared for culture shock <p> I know plenty of people who have been outwitted by culture shock and returned home only weeks into their working abroad adventure . <p> Change brings chaos , which is only elevated by being in a strange environment . <p> You 'll love being an expat at first as everything is so new and exciting , but pretty soon that high will come crashing down and you 'll notice how different everything is in a sucky way ! <p> That 's okay , this is part of the change process . If you understand it 's just that old pest culture shock , you 'll move through it . There 'll be tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flow out . <p> The best way to move through culture shock is to continue to explore and experience what is so great about the area you 've moved to . <p> Keep the travel experiences and the fun alive and do n't get bogged down by the everyday life of another country . <p> We 'd frequently go on weekend trips , attend concerts and festivals , and party with new friends . This made the transition so much smoother . <h> 3 . Cover yourself with international health insurance for expats <p> Medical bills can be extraordinary in other countries " I 'm looking at you America ! <p> There 's nothing worse than being sick or injured in another country away from the security of your home medical system and the love of your family . <p> Do n't freak out about this , just cover yourself so you have peace of mind . <h> 4 . Prepare your paperwork <p> I never realised how important this was until I was in Africa and having to chase down paperwork from London , Australia , Bangkok and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get all references and statement of services from your current job in your home country , and from any other job you now do in your working abroad experience . You just never know when you might need them . <p> Before you leave for your working abroad experience ensure you have all the paperwork you need for your new job : degree certificates , references , statement of services , resume , resources , police checks . <p> And everything you need for your visa : the actual visa , bank statements , anything that proves ties to your home country . <p> De-clutter , organise and pack all your work resources <h> 5 . Pack with intention <p> There is a tendency to want to pack your fluffy teddy from when you were six , and every picture frame in your house . It 's nice to bring the comfort of home with you , but you 're travelling to break out of the comfort . <p> Do your research . <p> What will the seasons be like ? <p> Do you need any special clothes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and material costs in your new destination ? <p> Pack considerately and as minimally as you can . <p> You can save a lot of hassle and shipping costs by purchasing what you need in your new destination . If it works out cheaper to bring your own things , then consider freight shipping and organise it to leave at least six weeks before you arrive so it arrives when you do . <h> 6 . Research costs <p> You do n't want to go into bill shock in a new country . <p> Make a list of all you need to live comfortably now . Cross out the ones that truly are n't that necessary , like cable TV . <p> Now research what the costs of those things will be in your new country . I 'm sure there will be some you now discover are n't worth paying for and will eliminate from your list . <p> You can prepare for your working abroad experience by researching the best price and value the different companies offer for those things you really need . <p> Do n't  forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay and if you are entitled to receive any back. - A lot of people overpay tax without realising it . You could be due taxback if you worked abroad or were taxed incorrectly or perhaps did n't work for the full year . TaxBack.com can check out your details and tell you for free what you 're owed . They provide tax refunds for 16 countries worldwide including Ireland , the US , Australia , Canada and New Zealand . <h> 7 . Research your new area <p> One way to overcome culture shock is to try to have a little sameness from your life in your own country . Research your new home so you can find where those things are and incorporate them into your new life . <p> For example , you might love visiting farmers markets , or running through national parks . Find where those places are in your new area . <p> It 's also great to have a good idea of the layout of your new region and where the best places to live are . This will save a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The less planning and running around you have to do when you arrive , the better you 'll feel and the less impact culture shock will have . <p> Also note the transportation options . It might be a good idea to hire a car for the first couple of weeks to help you in organizing a new place to live and any way you need to furnish it . It will also help you get a good idea of the layout of the city or town . <p> Make sure you also know the transportation routes available for you . <h> 8 . Pre-arrange meet ups and start building relationships before you leave <p> The world is so much easier for this now with social media and online sites like Meetup.com . You can easily connect with people with the same interests as you in your new country . <p> If you are moving to a new country with a job already organised you can start connecting with colleagues . <p> I moved to the US with a job already in place through a company that employed teachers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in place and we connected straight away at our Orientation meeting . It made a huge difference to our ability to settle in and enjoy the experience . <p> When I moved to London , I was on my own without a job , but I knew of some people from home living there . We were n't really friends , but I contacted them to meet up and help me have a little of that home security . It was awesome and one of them is still one of my best friends . <p> Quickly making friendships in your new home is the best way to ensure you wo n't be outplayed by culture shock . <h> 9 . Create your bucket list <p> Working in the USA allowed us to do a big road trip and visit places like Bryce Canyon in Utah <p> So you 're not really moving abroad just for work . Your main purpose is to travel and check off those bucket list items . <p> Whenever I know I 'm moving to a new country , I buy my Lonely Planet books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My excitement is often enough fuel to fly me overseas myself ! <p> Your bucket list is essential . It will remind you why you are doing this during the tough times and will keep you focused on saving and taking the time out on weekends and during holidays to get out and see the local area . <p> Okay ! Now you 're feeling a little more secure in your working abroad experience , it 's time to get going ! Look out . Amazing adventures ahead . <p> Can you add any other ways to prepare for a working abroad experience ? 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Bethany Dickey <p> 3 years ago <p> Loved this article !

Having worked in a few places around the world , I 've experienced the emotions of longing back for home ( which we will all have one day or another I think ) .

I think joining a sports club , a gym , or a sports team would also be a good idea to meet new people and make new friends . When I lived in England , I took courses in tap-dancing and flamenco dancing . Lots of fun , and made some new friends along the way as well . <p> And if you move somewhere where English is not the main language , you could also take a language course : makes it easier to chat with locals or make friends among locals , and it 's also a great way to meet other expats who struggle with the new language and who are going through the same culture shock as you are . <p> Fantastic tips ! Doing a language course is a great idea . One of our Aussie mates joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WE could n't believe they had a team . He loved it and we loved being the vocal supporters at the games and the parties in the bar after it . <p> Great tips . I think you are very brave working abroad with two kids . For me seems almost impossible even though I work online . Changing my kids environment stresses me out because I do n't  know if this is the right thing to do now that they are in school age . <p> Great tips Caz . I have been working abroad in various places for nearly 10 years now and I can say I have successfully made almost all of those mistakes especially in regards to health insurance , money and paperwork ie : all the really annoying things ! <p> Hi !

Thanks for this amazing post ! I will definately use it as a guide when we finally go to Sydney . For now , I will dream about it Damn , its beautiful = THANK YOU ! <p> I remember my first ever visit to Sydney , it was for 5 days and totally full . It is true that there is a lot of great things to do around Sydney . I also enjoyed a day trip to the Blue Mountains with a stop off at the Olympic Stadium . <p> When I visited Bondi I must admit to being quite disappointed , I found it quite tacky . I would rather go and visit the Northern Beaches . <p> Do you guys write about Melbourne ? Ive been there many times too and totally fallen in love with the place . <p> Where was this thorough guide when I went to Sydney last year ? I definitely enjoyed the beaches and the amazing weather in Sydney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate inside the restaurant or took the food to go ; I did n't  pick up on that up until my last few days in Sydney when my friend pointed it out to me . The other thing I enjoyed was the weekend Glebe Flea Market . I thought Sydney was overall expensive but was surprised at how much cheaper the prices were in there , compared to the same kind of flea markets here in NYC . <p> Means you will have to re-visit . Yeah , its no secret Sydney is expensive . But things like the markets , the beaches , ferry to Manly , walking around and visiting parks , eating in Chinatown and having picnics do n't  costs that much . <p> Love this round-up of Sydney it makes me miss it so much . Glad to see Sydney Harbour Tallships on the list . looking at your previous post on the mast climb , it was a surprise to see myself working at the bar dressed as a pirate . Remember this sail well ! <p> We re just planned our trip to Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best tips for our trip . We have the same style as travelers and we are very pleased to have found your website to share experiences . Thanks , Alvaro and Vanessa ( Brasil ) <p> Wowthats a great list ! Anyone planning to visit Sydney must check out this list . Well , I have been Sydney once and it was a fabulous experience ! I did n't  do each and everything that you mentioned , but it was still a great trip ! <p> This is THE BEST Sydney Travel Guide on the internet . I was wondering what i can recommend to my mates from overseas and I found this gem . You have covered every aspects and I am gon na send it to my mates and ready to have a great time . Thanks Craig ! <p> Wow , I 'm coming to Sydney in a few weeks and this has made me even more excited ! Ca n't wait to try out so many things you have listed . A map with all the places you have mentioned would be a great addition to this blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in comparison to each other ! Thanks for the fantastic guide <p> Thank you for the tip . We do tend to add maps into our posts now but something like this would probably be too time-consuming and cost a lot to do in resources . Although , I agree it would be a great idea and I also love maps to help me see how it all works . <p> Ah , Sydney . Love the city ! Ive been there couple of times . Still , cant say that I 've seen all of it . Each time I discover new things . The last time I had the opportunity to travel a bit around the city , and found that there 's places outside of the city worth visiting . Found a pretty nice list of suggestion I plan to follow next time when I 'm there http : **34;412;TOOLONG <p> You know its nice to look into tourist pages like this once in a while even if you 're born and still staying in Sydney . Seems like there 's always an activity that you 've forgotten was around and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't been too since you were a kid . <p> When you are in bondi you should check out the bondi beach markets . We are not the biggest in Sydney , but we are a local not for profit market that has donated thousands to local charities over the years . Great range of Sunglasses , hats and Jewellery . Near Hurricanes restaurant . <p> What time of the year were you in Sydney ? I see you wearing shorts and shirts , but another picture shows a coat and scarf with knee boots . The children wearing fleece , so is it elevation or cold in the morning and warming during the day ? 
@@21820647 @1820647/ <h> 14 Things to Do in Bathurst For Families <p> I took Kalyra for a daddy and daughter weekend getaway to the NSW town of Bathurst , and what a pleasant surprise that trip was . <p> No longer do I think of Bathurst as just a town for motor racing or going to University , but possibly the perfect country getaway from the hustle and bustle of Sydney for a family , or even just for couples ! <p> Once you escape the madness of Sydneys traffic , its an easy three hour drive and your reward is a vibrant and charming city centre ( we caught the last of the autumn colours ) and a surrounding region of gorgeous natural landscapes . <p> To be honest two days was n't enough but we certainly got a real taste of the highlights , and when we revisit regional NSW again I 'd like to explore this town and surrounding area at a slower pace . <p> When you first arrive in Bathurst , I recommend you drop into the Visitors Centre . We always do this when we visit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some great insider tips on things to see and do , and you can buy something locally made . <p> In case you did n't  know , in 2015 Bathurst is celebrating its Bicentenary as Australia 's oldest inland settlement with a huge line up of ongoing events and attractions . <p> There 's a lot going on currently , with future events throughout the upcoming winter school holidays planned . Below is a list of activities to tick off your list on your trip to Bathurst. <h> 1 . Abercrombie House Night Tour <p> Kalyra and I had a ball exploring this 52 room heritage mansion by torchlight whilst Chris Morgan , the owner , told us fascinating stories of his childhood growing up at Abercrombie . <p> Chris was just six years old when his parents took ownership of the property , and to start the tour he sat us down in the very living room his own parents gathered his brother and sister and sat them down some 40 years ago on their first night in Abercrombie by the fire and baked fresh bread . <p> We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candlelight as Chris told us ghost stories and how he grew up playing games of hide and seek and explored the downstairs on his bicycle . Yes , this house is that big . <p> Since the Morgan family moved in they have been renovating and restoring the house , and are now sharing their stories and the fascinating history of this Scottish styled mansion . <p> Built in the 1870s by Bathurst pioneers the Stewart family , Abercrombie has 52 rooms , 29 fireplaces , 7 staircases , and a grand ballroom . Easily the biggest home we have toured in Australia . <p> We climbed staircases , visited the grand ballroom , the chapel and walked amongst skinned foxes . A nice touch at the end was hot chocolate and cookies out on the terrace prepared by Chriss lovely wife , I went back for thirds ! <p> Loved the history and atmosphere of this place , and I 'd like to return to Abercrombie in the daytime and take a self-guided walk through the house , gardens andexplore the five outer buildings . <h> 2 . Australian Fossil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically museum people and it has to be something special to grab my attention and keep me interested , but the display at the Australian Fossil &amp; Mineral Museum impressed me , a lot . <p> This collection of 2000 rare fossils and minerals from around the world is the result of one mans passion , Warren Somerville , and includes crystals from over 100 Australian mine sites , plus diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and emeralds . <p> Kalyra was in awe of the full-size T-rex dinosaur skeleton , and check out the size of the egg . <p> Also impressive is the location , the collection is housed in the original 1876 Public School building which underwent a restoration . <p> Admission : $12 Adult , $8 Concession , $6 Child , $28 Family <h> 3 . Drive the Mount Panorama Motor Racing Circuit <p> Start . Your . Engine <p> Ok , you cant come to Bathurst without doing a lap of the famous 6.2 kilometre Mount Panorama racing circuit , and no you do n't  need a V8 Ford or Holden to take on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan , I 'm a sports fan and have watched enough Bathurst 1000s over the years to understand this is one of the true iconic Aussie sporting events and I always appreciate the skills and courage needed to reach the top of any sport . <p> So it was fun to get behind the wheel and pretend for a moment to be like the late great Peter Brock , the King of the Mountain , who won this race a record nine times . <p> I was amazed at how steep and windy the circuit actually is as you climb up the mountain , which offers nice views of the Bathurst plains . <p> Whilst you 'll feel the urge to put the foot down along Conrod Straight ( the V8 Supercars touch 300km/h on this stretch ) its a public road and regular road rules apply , including 2 way traffic and a 60km/hr speed limit . <p> Kalyra and I took a few sneaky pics on pit straight , make sure there is no oncoming traffic , and felt what it would be like to start on pole position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely interested in sitting trackside one October and getting amongst the festivities of the Great Race ! <h> 4 . Visit the National Motor Racing Museum <p> We started our visit with a short 20 minute movie reliving the history of Mount Panorama and the Bathurst 1000 , then wandered about the museum admiring some of the famous cars that have been victorious here , including Brockys 1984 Holden Commodore VK , and learned about the history , personalities and achievements of Australian Motor Sports . <p> Brocky fans will appreciate the Peter Brock tribute section , and out the front there 's a gift shop to grab some memorabilia to take home with you . <p> Cost : Adult $12.50 , Child $5.50 ( under 5 is free ) , Family Pass $30.50 <h> 5 . Annies Ice-Cream Parlour <p> Judging by the lineup out the door , and by how many people on our Facebook page recommended this place , Annies Ice cream Parlour is an institution in Bathurst . <p> I felt like I was back in a diner in America when I stepped inside with the funky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . <p> As far as the ice cream goes , many folks suggested we try the locally named Sofala Gold variety , or bridle track . Kalyra was having none of it , she went for a scoop of blueberry + cookies &amp; cream . Dad , well he needed some warming up so went for a hot chocolate which came with a bonus freckle . <p> What flavour you having ? <h> 6 . Barcoos Barn Farm Stay <p> Just a 10 minute drive from Bathurst gets you too the Barcoos Barn Farm Stay where you have the option of staying overnight in self-contained or bed &amp; breakfast accommodation , or you can simply do what we did and participate in an hour long farm visit . <p> Elaine , the friendly owner , took us around and Kalyra enjoyed spoon feeding the chickens , ducks and pigs , collecting the eggs and bottle feeding the cute baby lamb you can also milk a jersey cow . <p> But she cant decide what was her highlight , the pony sulky ride or jumping up behind the wheel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she steered the whole way . <p> This was a fun way to experience a real working farm . I 'm sure kids of all ages , especially city kids , would appreciate reconnecting with nature and a behind the scenes look at farm life . <p> And the afternoon drive out from Bathurst was scenic , you cant beat an open country road and autumn leaves . <h> 7 . Adventure Playground <p> What seven year old does n't  enjoy an hour of playground time ? And what parent does n't  like to let their kids run loose and burn off some excess energy ? ! <p> Kalyra tells me the Adventure Playground was a hit , and wanted to stay here all afternoon . Shes always up for the challenge of a maze and wherever there 's a flying fox she 's on it . <p> Located within Victoria Park , on the corner of Durham and Hope Street , the playground is based around a dinosaur theme and there 's plenty of swings , a sand pit , climbing frame , rock wall , slides and picnic tables and BBQs <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves a good pizza and the Church Bar + Woodfired Pizza certainly delivered and was a top spot for a little daddy &amp; daughter dinner date . <p> Located in Ribbon Gang Lane , Church Bar is housed in the old Anglican Church School House . Its an impressive location , charming yet casual and family friendly . We sat inside but the leafy courtyard would be a winner on a sunny day or nice evening , even if just for drinks . <p> But come here and try one of their pizzas . <p> The Italian wood-fired pizza oven turns out some of the best pizzas I 've had in a long time . I went for the Panorama : slow cooked lamb shanks with baby spinach , sweet potato , feta and rosemary . And the lamb was cooked to perfection . <p> Whilst Kayra got through most of her Mitre : Ham , salami and peperoni with a smokey BBQ sauce . <p> We did n't  have time for dessert as we had to rush off for the Abercrombie night tour but it also sounded and looked delish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday night . <h> 9 . The Hub Cafe <p> The Hub Cafe seems appropriately named as its a place the locals love to congregate , apparently brunch at the Hub on Sundays is the thing to do in Bathurst . <p> We had lunch here just after arriving in town and not being used to the cooler temperatures coming from the Gold Coast it was a nice and cozy atmosphere inside around the open fire . <p> On a sunny day I could imagine the lovely courtyard being popular and probably the best option with younger kids . <p> The coffee was good and with 5 menu items on the kids menu at around $7 I thought was decent value . I went for the healthy haloumi salad option . Theres jazz nights and takeaway available . <h> 10 . Bathurst Regional Art Gallery <p> The Bathurst Regional Art Gallery was the first purpose built regional gallery in NSW and if mum or dad , or one of your teens is into their art , it has eight exhibiting spaces showcasing work by Lloyd Reece and Brett Whiteley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten weeks and for a list of upcoming exhibits click here . <p> Of more interest to Kalyra though was the kiddies section in the library next door which provided for some much needed down time , for both of us. <h> 11 . Webb &amp; Co <p> This modern restaurant and bar is probably more suited to teens than younger children , but the Webb &amp; Co was definitely a nice dining experience with some live acoustic tunes being played from the elevated stage . <p> This is another historic building , built in 1863 , and the owners have done a great job transforming a former department store into a classy bar . <p> We had tapas style food and a mixture of prawns , wings , meatballs , and mushrooms , washed down with a craft beer . <p> And I got a great tip from a local , grab yourself a bottle of the Winburndale Shiraz which has won numerous awards , and they werent wrong . <h> 12 . The Crago Mill Emporium and Heritage Centre <p> This is an interesting building , and keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old and was previously a flour mill . <p> You can come here for breakfast , brunch , lunch and award winning organic coffee ( roasted in Young ) , and Kalyra was kept happy with a hot chocolate and scones and cream . <p> Glenn and his wife make homemade gourmet sausage rolls , quiches , muffins and popular french vanilla slices , plus numerous other cakes and slices . <p> Once you 've had a bite to eat you can wonder the numerous independent shops housed within , or do a bit of wine tasting at the cellar door . I took home a bottle of Cabernet Malbec Merlot. <h> 13 . Bathurst Winter Festival <p> Why not grab the kids and jump in your car these upcoming June / July school holidays and hit up the Illuminate Bathurst Winter Festival ? ! Do n't  forget your beanie and your skates for the outdoor ice-skating rink in Kings Parade in the historic town precinct ( from 4-12 July ) . <p> You can also munch on a few Perthville pantry sausages and watch the heritage buildings magically lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm you up and highlight how Bathurst is becoming a hotspot for families . <h> 14 . Sleep track-side at Rydges <p> It was very cool driving onto the track to access the hotel , and standing on our balcony I could envision the V8s roaring past and no doubt would be a prime viewing spot during the race in October . <p> Regardless of when you visit , its an easy drive into town , just up the road form the Uni and a handy central base for the whole Bathurst region . <p> Whilst Kalyra enjoyed a hot chocolate in bed AND a movie ( do n't  tell sister Savannah ) I thought what better way to get amongst the Bicentennial celebrations in Bathurst than with a bottle of " Bathurst Bicentenary Cabernet Sauvignon " overlooking the track from our balcony . <p> The C Bathurst Pass includes a number of Bathurst regional and council museums including ; the Australian Fossil &amp; Mineral Museum , Chifley Home , National Motor Racing Museum and the Bathurst District Historical Society Museum . <p> Hi ! Your blogs are amazing reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very much informative as well . Also , I would like to invite you to read mine on http : **28;448;TOOLONG . It would be a pleasure to know your opinion on the same . Thanks ! <p> Last year I and my younger brother went to National Motor Racing Museum that was full of fun . It is quite economy for kids activities . Moreover , videos shown of past races continuously was most enjoyable to us . <p> Bathurst in NSW is simply amazing with some of the best attractions . I am more amazed with night tour in Abercrombie House . Australian Fossil and Mineral Museum is scintillating with scenic views all around . I prefer to be there during my next visit . Thanks a lot ! <p> I love your very detailed information . I would love to go and visit Bathurst , because it looks incredible . Many bigger cities can learn from their way how to combine interesting yet completely different activities . And the wine , and pizza , almost like in real italian restaurants .

This usually includes soup , salad , a casserole of meat , chicken or vegetables , and rice pilav or pasta . <p> Fortraditional Turkish food that 's a cut above , try Guneyliler . Theyll start you off with mezes ( appetizers ) and fresh baked bread before you even order anything . My favorite meal is to split a kilmali pide ( Turkish pizza with chopped meat ) and then order Ali Nazik , a dish made with marinated lamb on a bed of mashed eggplant and topped with a yoghurt sauce . <p> For grilled meats the place to go is 7 Mehmet .

St Kilda Beach <p> Caz on St Kilda Beach <p> If you 're only in Melbourne for a short stay but you crave some beach action , then St Kilda is your best option . Its the closest and easiest beach to get to from the city centre , just 6km away , and its Melbournes most famous beach . <p> On a sunny day , St Kilda is the place to be seen and has an interesting mix of people . Its generally a safe beach to swim at , but besides the swimming its the most happening of Melbourne Beaches . <p> Thereare plenty of people sunbathing on St Kilda Beach and grassy area adjacent to it plus windsurfing , sailing , kite surfing , rollerblading , beach volleyball , jet skiing and water skiing . <p> Kalyra enjoying the action <p> Our favourite thing to do there as a family was the walking track along the beach and then cycling all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty impressive , and we suggest grabbing a takeaway pizza from Mr Natural Pizza place and a bottle of wine and sitting on the beach whilst the sun goes down . Our other food hangout was Beachcomber Cafe at the sea baths where we could watch the kids play on the sand just metres away . <p> St Kilda is also the place to experience the rides at Luna Park , and for the famous cake shops on lively Acland Street . To get to St Kilda jump on a tram near Flinders Street Station in the city . <h> 2 . Elwood Beach <p> Elwood Beach <p> Elwood is another popular Melbourne- bayside beach during sunny days and a great family beach . Its not as accessible from the city as St Kilda as its not exactly on the tram or train line , but still only 8kms away if you have a car , or jump in a cab . <p> The water was clean and calm for swimming and our kids had a great time playing on the sand and the rocks . Its another fairly active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket and walking . <p> Me and Savannah <p> Once your day at Elwood Beach is over , we suggest hitting up Jimmi Jamz Bar on Ormond Road in the town centre which has great AND cheap pizza . Plus there is a little playground in the back courtyard area bonus for us parents in getting 5 minutes down time after eating dinner . <p> Elwood Beach <p> jimmi Jamz pizza <h> 3 . Parkdale Beach <p> Parkdale Beach was a great find for us , thanks to our friend who lives in a nearby suburb . It 's a bit of a drive from the city centre , 23- km south-east , but if you 're looking to get away from the crowds of St Kilda it 's a great place to relax and swim with the kids . <p> The water was again clean and calm and with the shallow bars you could walk quite a ways out . It 's best to stay on the shallower bars and clear of the rocks and reefs area . <p> Whilst there do n't miss having breakfast or brunch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach . With its outdoor deck you can watch the kids play on the grass , and the food and coffee was really good . <p> Parkdale BeachParkdale BeachParkdale BeachBreakfast at Parkdale cafe <h> 4 . Brighton Beach <p> Brighton Beach is famous for the 82 colourful bathing boxes that call the beach home and are one of the tourist icons of Melbourne . <p> Brighton also houses some of the wealthiest citizens in Melbourne with grand homes , and the coastline cycling and walking tracks are a popular route for exercise and leisure . <p> Brighton is easily accessed via the Sandringham train line . <h> 5 . Sandringham Beach <p> Sandringham is another local tip from our friend who lives in the area and is one of Melbournes bayside suburbs popular for living and for beachgoers , walkers , and cyclists . <p> Its quiet , its calm and it 's accessible by train . Just jump on the Sandringham line , or it 's a relatively easy drive from the city . <h> 6 . Half Moon Bay <p> Half Moon Bay is a bay located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated with a nice atmosphere for relaxing and gentle waves for swimming .

I discovered it the other weekend . There 's one part that a lot of people go to , but I found a little beach right at the end near the old Princes Pier . Hardly any people , and great place for a swim . <p> Sounds great . Ill be adding these to me Melbourne to do list for next time I am down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times and a bite to eat at Beachcombers once and eat one of those delicious choc mint cakes in the window of you 're pic at Acland one day too ! <p> Brighton Beach ! So that was the name of the place . I got a friend who is currently in Melbourne right now , and they have this cute photos of colorful cottages behind them , which I found out thru this blog , to be bathing boxes . From all the 6 beaches you mention , I think Brighton is my favorite . = <p> This post was EXACTLY what I was looking for ! I traveled to Melbourne last winter ( during my summer ) and missed out on all the beach weather . I am coming back in a few weeks and plan on hitting every beach possible ! This post was great because you included which train lines to take to get there AND awesome restaurants to eat while there as well . My two girlfriends and I are all moving there form America and South America so we will not have our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , while good , has not mentioned a couple of others and they are worth mentioning and should n't be left out . <p> Seaford beach , towards the Mornington peninsular along the Nepean hwy and which is also accesable via the Seaford train station is a great clean beach and is highly regarded . <p> In warmer times around the pier is quite busy , a couple minute walk in either direction finds you a nice quite spot in which to enjoy your day . <p> Also definitely worth mentioning , is Canadian bay , which is accesable also via Nepean hwy by car only a few minutes past the my Eliza hill . <p> Heading up along the Nepean hwy , pass the mt Eliza hill heading away from Frankston staying in the middle lane and turning left at Canadian bay road following that until the end . <p> Parking your car in the car park there , and wandering down the path the quite oftern secluded alcove , is a great little mostly unknown spot to catch some rays and some sunshine whilst enjoying a swim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so out of Melbourne . <p> Both of these beaches are nicer than st kinda and also Elwood beaches . <p> Also certainly worth a mention are the Blairgowrie beach , which is just a great place to spend a nice sunny day contemplating life and the great view , also the Blairgowrie back beach for an amazing view along the cliff . <p> Whilst were at it , the Sorrento beach is also another winner in my book . <p> Shame none of these beaches really make me think I 'd like to go to the beach . All the pictures are of dirty/debris filled sand that stabs you in the feet when you walk . I was hoping this article would be a comprehensive list of beaches that are n't  all 20 minutes away from st kilda beach and be special after having a convo with a friend who moved to melbourne 2 years ago and was desperate to go to the beach when she was in sydney for an engagement party because she , rightly , thinks all the beaches listed here are gross . If you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to search for at least 10 that are n't  st kilda or brighton . If you encourage people to use up time to travel to beaches without public transport at least list one with white/clean sand and no sharp pebbles/shells at the water line . <p> On your next visit to Melbourne , I highly recommend visiting the beaches that are a little further out as they 're generally much cleaner with white sand and clear waters = My suggestions include Bonbeach , Carrum , Seaford , Frankston and Edithvale all in the south-east suburbs . They all share the same stretch of sand and are close together . They wo n't necessarily give Sydney or Perth a run for their money in terms of surf , but they certainly will for the sand , water and general cleanliness ! In the west , I 'd suggest Altona beach . It has a lovely town centre but the beach is the main attraction and perfect for families = Happy travels !

My perspective is that you should do what you want and not give a damn . = <p> We tend to vacillate between quick whirlwind travel and taking it really easy . We " live " on the road so its important for us to find something that 's sustainable the only problem is that we have n't quite found the most long-term sustainable option that works for us .

Everyone has that *one thing* that they must have that everyone else rolls their eyes at . <p> While I roll my eyes at people whose heads are stuck in laptops , iphones , etc , I know everyone rolls their when I ( 99% of the time ) insist on my own room , even though I travel solo .

If I have to backpack , travel at a slow pace , travel for a short period of time , go on a tour , go independent , go on an adventure trip , stay in a hostel , motel or hotel , I will do it . As long as I am on the road , learning , knowing people and having fun , I am up to it . <p> Like Ruth , I was also thinking of this topic last weekmust be something going around the blogosphere = I was answering a question about what our website name ( Uncornered Market ) meant and how it relates to travel .

No one way is the " right " way , each person needs to figure out what works best for him/her whether that 's backpacking for $5,000/year or spending $5,000 on one week of luxury . No one way is inherently better than the other ; what 's more important is that people are choosing their way of travel deliberately and within their values/goals and not just following what others are doing . <p> Thanks for stopping by and commenting Audrey .

Now I understand the beauty of what that means to those people and why it can even be nice for my SOMETIMES . <p> I 've only ever traveled as an expat and because I have lack of resources to have a long-term job ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in any country . <p> One day I would like to save up a sum of money and do a semi-big backpacking trip too though . <p> I think the longer you 've spent backpacking the more you come to love the idea of luxury travel . When my brother got married in Cape Town , we hired this mansion for a week . There were twelve of us staying in the house , we had our own maid , private pool , and views of Table Mountain . It was so great ! ! ! ! ! I could definitely do more of it . We still got out and about and mixed with the locals . We just had luxury to come home to . <p> We travel as expats for the same reasons , although we have done big backpacking trips with the foreign currency we have been able to save <p> I agree that there 's no best way to travel it depends not only on the persons personality , but also on how much money they have and the length of stay . If you only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then again , a whirlwind tour of all tourist attractions day after day for a year is something I 'm happy to let the more professional travelers a try . I think I 'd die <p> Varieties for us is important . Some days itll be hectic , then well take a weekend to rest and enjoy . Some days we decide to bum it out and go all cheapskate and the next day well clean ourselves up in a nice hotel . <p> hey thanks for sharing , I agree with what you and most of the other comments are saying that there is no right way to travel , just different ways . <p> The way we choose to travel is entirely personal and dependent on our individual circumstances . Travelling around the World in one long extended trip is obviously a dream for many but will seem impossible to others with families and 9-5 jobs . <p> My own personal travel experiences have been a mix of military expeditions for several weeks or even months at a time , general vacationing with friends and more recently solo travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curently planning a RTW for a year as my circumstances now suit this , although that is because I have made the decision to make it so , believing this will give me the best opportunity to visit as many destinations as possible , on a limited budget . I also think the journey itself will be almost as interesting as the places I will visit . <p> We can not all choose to travel this way otherwise the World would pretty much grind to a halt around us while we travel , so I am thankful to those that remain in fulltime service orientated employment travelling for two or three weeks each year . Life would be a little more difficult without them . <p> Anybody that has made the choice to travel and expand their individual horizons whichever way they choose to do so has made an important decision and as long as we all make the most of our opportunities and respect the choices of others we can all enjoy our travelling experience whether it lasts one week a year or several years . <p> Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Obviously I would love if everyone traveled , just because I know how much joy it brings . However , I often think what would happen to the world if we did , as there would be no one running anything . So I am really grateful for those who do not travel and decide to stay home and run the world for us . Makes me realize that when I am not travelling , I am just taking my turn in contributing to world order = <p> I think you 've hit the nail on the head . There is no one best way to travel , it will vary from person to person . For me right now , the best way to travel is in short burst with short periods of working in between . My job allows for this and it makes the most since to me . Not to mention I still get to be home for part of the year and experience everything that family and friends at home have to offer . The best of both worlds for me = <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . I am so sick and tired of people claiming their way is the best way ! ! ! As long as you 're traveling who cares for how many days and where you 're staying ! <p> Exactly Andi . I wish everyone would stop worrying about have a better life than everyone else and just make it the best for themselves . Let others do what they like . I get excited for anyone who is travelling , no matter what their chosen style may be . <p> I thought this was a really great post . I cant disagee with you here ! It is great to finally come across a post that puts the idea of " what 's best for a individuals travel experience " in its proper perspective . Also I never thought about adopting a slow expat style of travel to make my trip more affordable . That makes sense . And I can see how that would allow me to get more out of my travels . Thanks <p> It really is a great way to do it cheaply Eugene . Especially if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays for your flight and maybe accommodation . I had my flights covered to the US twice and my accommodation covered in Bangkok . <p> Weve set up a base in Bali for a month , so its interesting to read this post , as I 've never lived an expat life . I 'm a great believer in travelling slowly , but I can understand , also , why people want to travel fast , especially if they have n't travelled much before . <p> I know quite a few luxury travellers , whose experiences are different from the budget traveller , but work for them . I guess , really , the question comes down to what people really want to get out of travel . You can get a lot of magic out of a weekend in a city you do n't  know . And some people are whirlwind minded <p> Its refreshing to see a post that 's not arguing that anyone who 's not travelling longterm is somehow missing out on living the dream . Not everyone wants to travel longterm , not by a long shot . <p> Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very tough and sometimes not very enjoyable . A lot of people do n't  want to travel in this way . I love the sound of your Bali base for a month . <p> I could n't have said it better myself . There 's a " right " way to travel for every individual , but not for everyone as a whole . And I 'm certainly not about to judge someone else for their travel style just because it may differ from mine . <p> As far as Im concerned , as long as you 're traveling , that 's great . The how , where and why are really just extra details . <p> Love this post . I was thinking about the subject , too recently . The only thing I would add is that however you decide to travel ( and it might be different ways on different occasions ) always travel with an open mind , and a willingness to learn and experience . Even if you are closeted in a five star hotel just to wind down on a stressful life , you can still learn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life is better with a bottle of wine . Visas can be a bit tricky , especially when you get too old for a lot of the working holiday programs . We got the working holiday visa for Ireland okay and for England for me . For the US and Thailand we were sponsored . Now that we are moving into more digital nomad work we will only have to worry about doing tourist visa runs in countries . <p> I 'm so glad you tweeted this older article ! I am new to blogging about my own travels and the world of travel blogs ( while of course I 've always loved traveling ) . I have loved so many of the blogs and articles that I 've found , but they kind of started to make me question if I was a " real traveler " because it is n't my full-time lifestyle or because I have n't been to so many places . Its just nice to be reminded that its ok to have a different style or even be at a different point in your life .

@@21820654 @1820654/ <h> What to Do in Victoria , BC , Canada <p> As part of our city guides- series , we interviewed Gillian who lived in Victoria , BC for 15 years . <p> Gillian shares with us her insider travel tips and knowledge on what to do in Victoria for those looking for the best places to see , eat , stay , drink , and explore . <h> Why visit Victoria BC ? <p> A Little Piece of England ? For the newly-wed and nearly-dead ? No ! I hate those monikers . <p> Victoria is a city with lots of nooks and crannies to explore beyond the obvious tourist traps . Its a great little piece of the Pacific Northwest ; more laid back than Vancouver and Seattle ( I know , its that possible ? ! ) but with less rain . <p> Big enough to have some great pubs and restaurants and yet small enough to easily walk around the downtown core . It is truly beautiful and , surrounded by water on three sides , is the perfect place to dip your toe into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Take a Pub Tour : <p> Start with lunch at Spinnakers . As Canadas oldest brewpub , it deserves the pole position . A wide selection of great , house-made beer and great food coupled with one of the best views in the city seals the deal . ( Insider Tip : take the passenger harbour ferry from the main dock in the harbour ; a fun little ride on boats often captained by ex-Marine officers . Buy a return ticketyoull be coming back . ) <p> Take the ferry back and make your way to Darcys at the foot of Bastion Square . A pretty nondescript Irish pub , its the patio that you 're here for . Sit back and tipple a pint while watching the seaplanes land in the harbour . Best done on a windy day as they appear out of nowhere over the rooftops to drop into the water at your feet . <p> A quick jaunt up Bastion Square lands you at the Irish Times , a favorite hang out of tourists and locals alike . Pull up a stool at the bar ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those around you ; they may be from near or far but its always a great time . <p> Make your way back down to the water and follow Wharf Street along to the bottom of Pandora Street ; here you 'll find Swans BrewPub . Housed in an old warehouse and home to one of the best art collections in Victoria , its worth a visit for one of their hand drawn pints ; I like the Buckerfields Bitter . Ones enough thoughlets keep going . <p> Take a right out of Swans and head down Store street and take a left down Swift Street . Yes , I know it gets a little seedy in there but its safe I promise and really worth it . Tucked at the bottom of Swift Street , in a 100 year old electric power plant is Canoe ; my favorite watering hole in the whole city . If its warm enough there is plenty of patio ; I prefer the smaller , more intimate , close patio to the larger one down below . Settle in here for the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great food . Do n't  worry , theyll call you a cab at the end of the night to get you safely back to your hotel . <h> Sightseeing : <p> The waterfront drive in Victoria is stunning and the best way to do it is on a scooter . <p> You can rent one down in the Inner Harbour and then scoot , scoot , scoot your way along the waterfront . Simply keep the water on your right and its pretty hard to get lost . You 'll meander through a number of neighbourhoods ; stop whenever you feel like it . <p> A few favorites : take a stroll along the Ogden Point Breakwater , admire the gardens ( and views ) from Beacon Hill Park , wander among the history in Ross Bay Cemetery , watch for ghosts through the Royal Victoria Golf Course , stop for coffee/lunch at Olive Olios in Cadboro Bay . <p> Turn around here and make your way back along Cadboro Bay Rd and Fort Street . Just try and wipe the smile off your face . <p> ybox For- an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recommendations , and tidbits of history on things that are n't  just touristy , get the guide , Victoria : The Unknown City . /ybox <h> Ginnery/Cider House/Winery Tour : <p> TIP : Youll need a car ( and a designated driver ) for this one . We did this tour a couple of years ago and it remains as one of my favorite days ever . <p> Victoria Spirits is housed in an old farm house on Old West Saanich Road . I call it a ginnery because that 's what they make ; flavourful , herb infused gin ( and because I do n't  know what the real name for a ginnery is ) . <p> They offer tastings of all their products upstairs but its downstairs where the magic happens . Ask if you can have a tour of the still down below they are proud of their work and are more than happy to show off the German constructed beauty that produces the magic elixer . <p> Also housed in an old farmhouse with fabulous views over farmland and sea , the Sea Cider Farm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their ciders are made from apples all pressed and fermented on site from various types of apples . In fact , its impossible to choose from among the many options ; I suggest a tasting flight to sample them all ! <p> Last stop is Church and State Winery . A beautiful location in Brentwood Bay and a great place to end the afternoon . Sample a few of their in-house wines , take some pictures and then head back into town for dinner . <h> A Few More Favorites fr Victoria , BC <p> See the salmon spawning . Salmon return to their home rivers in the fall in order to spawn the next generation . One of the best places to see this is in Goldstream Park just north of town . There are nature trails and an interpretive center here too . Head to the estuary to see the Bald Eagles feeding too . <p> Hike Mount Finlayson . Accessed through Goldstream Park , this hike takes you up through the forest and onto rocky outcroppings where you 'll scramble to the top for some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its not for the faint of heart of those with a fear of heights . You should be able to do the whole hike in two hours remember to take water with you and maybe a snack for the top . <p> Visit Thetis Lake . A local swimming hole , Thetis Lake offers a small sandy beach and plenty of other hidden spots further around the lake . The trail around the lake is great for a good , quick run ( about 4 km ) or a brisk walk . There are a few hills but nothing too strenuous . <p> Surf at Jordan River . Head west out through Sooke and you 'll hit the true Pacific Ocean where the water reaches out toward Japan . The surf here is some of the best there is and local surfers congregate at any hint of an off shore storm . There are burger shacks and coffee houses to warm up in as you watch the talent out on the waves . <h> Best Neighbourhoods to Explore in Victoria , BC <p> I love the look and feel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for 15 years ! ) . Its one of the older parts of town but has plenty of redevelopment and character . <p> Cook Street Village is a favorite hangout with a couple of coffee shops , a bakery , pizza place and local pub . <p> Ross Bay Cemetery houses some of Victorias historical figures ; the moss covered gravestones and often foggy weather make it a photographers dream . <p> The Moss Street Market happens every Saturday on the corner of Moss and Fairfield streets ; great organic food , crafts , knick-knacks , music and a hippie vibe predominates . <h> Where to Eat in Victoria , BC <p> Pig BBQ Joint started as a little hole in the wall but now calls one of the newest buildings in Victoria home . It still serves up the best pulled pork sandwich around and you can get a local Phillips beer on tap too . Perfection . <p> Red Fish Blue Fish is , hands down , my absolute favorite budget eatery in Victoria . Housed in old cargo container right on the wharf in the Inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seafood . There is often a line up but get-in-line-already its worth the wait ! The funky , hipster staff will help you choose but , for me , there is no choice ; it is the tuna tacones every-single-time . <p> Hernandez Cocina is probably the best kept secret in Victoria . Housed in the walkway of a downtown office building it is more than worth seeking out ( their website gives directions its easier than me trying to describe it to you ) . This traditional Mexican cocina offers up quick , cheap food of a quality that is outstanding . Handmade corn tortillas are used in their tacos ( 5 for $5 ! ! ) and the burritos are huge . Get here early as the office workers in the area are in on the secret . <p> Prima Strada Pizzeria is another mid priced favorite . This small , local eatery has a wood fired oven that produces a chewy , thin crust pizza that needs minimal toppings to finish it off . The staff are friendly , the wine is cheap and we always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line up is too long just leave your name and tell the wait staff you 're just heading across the street for a pint at The Beagle Pub . Your table will be ready when you get back . ) <p> For something more upscale I offer up two of my favorites <p> Ferris Upstairs is a great , intimate spot for cocktails , small plates and sharing . <p> Brasserie LEcole is one of the best date spots in the city . Cozy and warm it hints of its French bistro brethren both in food and wine , offering up the best steak and frites around accompanied by fabulous French wines . <h> Where to Stay in Victoria , BC <p> Turtle Hostel is a small hostel housed in a Victorian house on the edge of downtown . This makes it convenient to everything and the prices ca n't be beat ! As low as $50/night for two people in a small private room in summer . That 's about as good as it gets around here as I would n't recommend sleeping on the beach ( its too cold and rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funky hostel just off downtown . An old apartment building ; it has many amenities and features not usually seen . Its one of my favorite buildings downtown and knowing it houses travellers makes me smile . It has a lounge/cafe and is nicely decorated . This would be my pick if I did n't  live here . <p> HI-Victorias location ca n't be beat ; right in the middle of the city , everything is happening right on the doorstep . And as part of the Hosteling International group you know that it has to meet certain standards . <p> Swans and Spinnakers ( see the Pub Crawl above ) are both also guesthouses which would negate the need for a taxi at the end of an eveningjust crawl upstairs to bed . Both are rather up-scale rather than budget though , but if you have the dough I would recommend it as they are both very nice places . <h> Markets and Shopping in Victoria , BC <p> Lower Johnston street , or LoJo as they 've rebranded themselves , has become quite the shopping mecca for fashionistas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with independent shops ( with a few larger names ) its a great place to window shop or find a little something for yourself . <p> The Downtown Market is held on Government street ( between Pandora and Fisgard ) every Sunday from 11-5 . Its a funky , hippy-ish market with stalls filled with crafts , psychics , clothing , food carts and music . A little something for everyone ; its a fun stroll and a great way to spend an afternoon . <p> The Moss Street Market is held every Saturday on the corner of Moss and Fairfield streets . It is primarily an organic food market but there are also some crafts , home-made jams , clothing , food carts and music . Its a lovely walk from downtown to here . <p> Insider Tip : Stay away from lower Government Street ; it truly is a tourist trap down there , the closer to the harbour the worse . By all means take a stroll but do n't  do any shopping here . <h> Events and Festivals in Victoria , BC <p> The Moss Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . The street is closed from the top of the hill down to the ocean and is lined with artists creating their masterpieces and selling their wares along the way . <p> You can spend hours perusing all the art , chatting with the artists and enjoying the great weather . ( Insider Tip : Go later in the afternoon and stop at the Art Gallery at the top of the hill for a hot dog and beer at the Beer Garden . There is a band after dark and its always a good time . ) <p> Symphony Splash is held on the first weekend of August in the Inner Harbour . A barge is floated in , the crowds gather all around on shore , and the Victoria Symphony puts on a show to remember . <p> Swiftsure is the premier yacht race in the Pacific Northwest and attracts sailors from around the entire region . Its worth being down near Clover Point on Dallas Rd on the morning of the start ; its something else to see hundreds of boats in full sail as they jostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for sailors thoughthere is always a major party at Ships Point in the harbour . Aye Matey ! <h> Getting Around <p> The best way to get around is on foot . The downtown area of Victoria is quite small and even the nearby neighbourhoods are a nice walk away . <p> The bus system is pretty good though ; you can call the Transit Info line and a real person will help you get from Point A to Point B. <h> Finding WiFi <p> Yes . All the hostels listed have free wifi as do many of the coffee shops and pubs in town . ( Insider Tip : Plenty of folk here do n't  password protect their wifi routers ; sometimes all you need to do is search for nearby networks to get free wifi . ) <h> Best time to visit Victoria BC <p> Spring and Fall are out of the height of tourist season but Summer offers the best weather . Winter can be dreary and wet . <h> Getting There &amp; Away <p> There is an international airport serviced primarily by Air Canada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't  fly , you have to take a ferry . BC Ferries operates from Tsawwassen just outside of Vancouver . Its a little pricey but the scenery is absolutely stunning as it makes its way through the Gulf Islands . <p> The Coho Ferry runs between Port Angeles in the USA to the harbour right downtown in Victoria . <h> Best insiders tip for Victoria BC <p> Try the local beer ; stay away from the big brands . One of the best things about Victoria is the great beer revolution its been part of . <p> Ask what 's local and try a sampler tray . Phillips . Driftwood . Vancouver Island Brewery . Lighthouse . Work your way through them and you wont be disappointed . <h> Plan Your Trip to Victoria 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation in Victoria <p> Booking.com has over 80 properties in Victoria including hotels , apartments and hostels .

I remember the first time Ive been there it was from Vancouver by helicopter and it was Awesome . People are so kind and the atmosphere is so great Miss Canada s much = <p> Ive been to Victoria twice ( once as a kid and once last year ) and there 's definitely a lot more I need to see and do there . I can vouch for the Red Fish Blue Fish recommendation . I went there for lunch three days in a row . <p> I had no idea there was so much to do in Victoria , just that it was a beautiful place to visit . I hope to make it to the Rockies one day , and then Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Thanks for all the great tips ! <p> I visited Victoria for a day 2 summers ago it was the last port of call on an Alaskan cruise that my family took . I LOVED the city , and was really sad that we only had an afternoon to explore . I definitely plan to return ! <p> As someone who mostly lives in Victoria , this was a pretty comprehensive story about what to do . I would add Craigdarroch Castle , the Provincial Museum and the Legislature Building as possible additions and of course Buchart Gardens . And for accommodations I have to give a nod to Accent Inn Victoria for their pet friendly and bicycle friendly accommodations . More touring possibilities are Hatley Castle at Royal Roads and for dinner maybe the Deep Cove Chalet . <p> I live in Victoria and I never tire of the city and all the things you can do . My favorite places are the harbour front in the summertime . And nothing beats walking down around the cliffs and rocky outcrops around mile zero . We once had a picnic and saw orcas from the shore ! 
@@21820658 @1820658/ <h> Best Things to Do in Coffs Harbour <p> To be honest , I 'm actually not a big fan of Coffs Harbour . The town just does n't  do that much for me . <p> So why did we visit Coffs recently and why am I writing a blog post about the best things to do in Coffs Harbour ? <p> Well , what I do really like is the region surrounding Coffs Harbour . There are some great nearby beaches , towns , and National Parks . Even the drive into Coffs is pretty whether you 're coming from Sydney or from Armidale down the Waterfall Way . <p> So when I think of Coffs I think of it as a base for exploring the surrounding area , and this is what gets us as a family going back for more . <p> On our recent visit during our road trip through NSW we did n't  even stay in Coffs , but down the road in nearby Sawtell which we much prefer ( more on that later ) . <p> But for now , I want to share some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Banana and Park Beach attractions . <p> Ideally situated half-way between Sydney and Brisbane , Coffs is a popular stop off point for people doing the Sydney to Brisbane road trip , but for those looking to spend a week or two the region is big enough and has something for everyone . <h> Things to Do in Coffs Harbour <h> Muttonbird Island <p> One of my favourite things to do in Coffs Harbour is take the short walk up Muttonbird Island . <p> We did n't  even know about this place until a few years ago when we went for a walk along the breakwall at the Coffs Harbour Marina and there it was . <p> On approach , I actually envisioned myself being back in Ireland as it was so green and had the rugged cliff face look about it . <p> The walk to the top gives you incredible views up and down the coast and over the mountains . Its the perfect spot to sit and watch the sunset over the Marina . <p> Muttonbird Island Nature Reserve is also great for bird lovers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the migratory wedge-tailed shearwater nests . <p> Walk up Muttonbird IslandEnd of the walk on Muttonbird IslandSunset from Muttonbird Island <h> Coffs Harbour Marina and Jetty <p> If you like boats and towns with a marina and jetty , Coffs has a really nice one . At the entrance to the jetty precinct on Harbour Drive there 's a collection of cafes and restaurants and on Sundays is the jetty markets . <p> The Marina Village also has cafes , restaurants a fish co-op and an ice creamery . Latitude 30 and the Sailing Club are good spots to have a wine and beer and watch the surfers and the sun go down . <p> The Marina is also where the whale watching boats depart from in season ( June to November ) . <p> Savannah at the Marina <h> Diggers Beach <p> One of our friends who lives in Coffs Harbour recommended we check out Diggers Beach ( located across from the Big Banana ) and were glad they did . <p> Its a great family-friendly beach being sheltered and wide making it a nice place for our kids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular surfing spot for the locals or for a wind-free beach walk . <h> Diggers Beach to Park Beach Headland Walk <p> View of Park Beach from Macauleys Headland <p> Whilst in the Diggers Beach area , we did the Macauleys Headland walk which runs between Diggers and Park Beach . <p> You can start at either end and the views of the ocean and of both beaches are spectacular . The spot overlooking Park Beach in the photo above is a great place to sit and watch the surfers . <h> Sawtell <p> Sawtell Beach <p> Sawtell is a lovely little town 15 minutes drive south of Coffs Harbour and where we chose to base ourselves . <p> The main street is picturesque and divided by big fig trees with plenty of cafes and shops lining both sides of the street . <p> Seasalt is popular for takeaway fish &amp; chips , and the cafe at the Surf Club on the beach is great for a meal , a coffee and classic beach views . <p> Sawtell Beach is family friendly , especially toward the southern end which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area sheltered by a small island which can be reached at low tide . We stayed at the Sawtell Beach Caravan Park . <p> Sawtell Surf Club &amp; CafeView of Sawtell Beach from the Cafe <h> Bellingen <p> Bellingen is a super laid-back town in the valley just a 30-minute drive from Coffs Harbour on the Waterfall Way . It has a lovely tree lined street and river running through town , and has an artistic feel and lively cafe scene ( we recommend Black Bear Cafe ) . <p> But on our recent visit- to Bellingen the thing we liked most was visiting the Bellingen Markets which are one of the biggest and best regional markets in Australia . <p> The markets are only on every third Saturday of the month so you have to time your visit , but if you can they 're definitely worth it . <h> Dorrigo National Park <p> For a great day trip from Coffs Harbour , Dorrigo is only 65km ( 1 hour by car ) . <p> Continue on past Bellingen and up the Waterfall Way and you 'll get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then visit nearby Dangar Falls . <p> This town is also the gateway to Dorrigo National Park where you can enjoy waterfalls and rainforest walks including an elevated Tree Top walk starting at the Dorrigo Rainforest Centre . <p> We also recommend the walk to Crystal Shower Falls ( you can walk behind the falls ) and the Glade Picnic area is a nice spot for lunch . <h> Butterfly House <p> Our kids really enjoyed The Butterfly House in Bonville . Kalyra is mad on butterflies , and so is Caz . <p> Get amongst 400 butterflies in an indoor subtropical rainforest setting as they fly around and even land on you making it one of the easiest places I 've ever photographed a butterfly . <p> There 's also a- maze to explore in the side garden . We were given a piece of paper with a paragraph about butterflies that had missing words in it . We had to search for the missing words on the wooden walls of the maze <h> Red Rock Beach <p> Another great tip from our friend living in Coffs was to visit Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful- village an easy half an hour drive ( 40km ) north of Coffs Harbour , and the beach is absolutely stunning . Climb up the cliff on the northern end for a top view looking down the beach . <p> Kalyra and Savannah loved playing in the gentle water and collecting shells on the beach . <p> There 's a Caravan Park at Red Rock if you 'd like to stay over a few days and explore the many beaches , lagoons , and swamps in the area . <h> The Big Banana <p> I cant decide whether the Big Banana is a must visit or a totally over-hyped tourist trap . I 'm leaning towards the latter . Its one of those famous Big Things we have going on here in Australia and you cant miss it from the road as you head north out of town . <p> I 'd visited many times as a youngster and it now looks incredibly small compared to when I was ten . We did n't  stop in on this occasion , but our kids enjoyed it a few years back which is all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the best thing about the Big Banana is the banana split sundae from the cafe . <h> Getting to Coffs Harbour <p> Coffs Harbour is a 6-hour drive north from Sydney or 4.5 hours drive south of Brisbane .

We were out of season for the dinner and show , but it 's a noted experience at the museum . <p> The Stockmans Hall of Fame is a little on the expensive side and I 'd say overpriced for what you get . But , if you 're mad on this sort of thing , it might just be worth it to you . <h> 3 . Camden Park Station sunset tour <p> This was our favourite thing to do in Longreach . I loved this experience of visiting a cattle station , which seems bizarre as there were no cattle or sheep . It was awesome to meet James Walker and his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The spirit that shaped so many incredible things about our country and culture . <p> Camden Park Station is 15km out of Longreach and is one of the older cattle stations in the area .

Queen Elizabeth also visited and enjoyed tea and scones with James ' grandfather in 1970 . <p> James is only in his early thirties and has taken over management of the 80,000 acres of their sheep and cattle station . Understanding the issue farmers face out here , he works in creative ways to ensure has farm stays afloat during drought and destocking . <p> James has attended farming seminars in London to learn innovative ways to irrigate and farm so he can return and implement and teach to the farmer 's in this region . <p> He 's also diving into the online world to create programs to sell , and now runs the cattle station sunset tours . <p> Even though the livestock was missing , we still got a tour of the property and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to be cows and he mustered us so we could see how they did it ! Our girls had a ball because his girls came out to play with them . Which meant we could enjoy our selves a little more . <p> At the end of the tour we went to sit up near the Artesian bore for sunset . It was so still and quiet . James told me of his plans to build a luxury farm stay overlooking the water to make use of the stunning sunset views and serenity . I confirmed that his plans were a winner ! <p> It was so tranquil . I felt like I was back in Africa , with the endless plains in front of me and a fiery red setting sun . We enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine and some nibbles as part of the tour , whilst the kids enjoyed time with their new friends . <p> Sitting in my home now in Burleigh writing this I have a longing to see that sunset again with a glass of wine and the sweet taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three weeks and the itch starts to return ! <p> Jump on the Camden Park sunset station tour with Outback Aussie Tours and visit James and his family .

He also gets many rave reviews on Trip Advisor . <p> We also heard the Cobb &amp; Co tours and River Cruise with Kinnon and Co were good value . <p> We visited Longreach in partnership with Tourism Queensland as part of our Outback Queensland drive .

@@21820668 @1820668/ <h> Tips for Women Dressing Modestly in Conservative Countries <p> As a female traveller exploring conservative countries , its highly recommended that you make an effort to dress more modestly than you would at home . <p> It can be especially challenging if you 're in a very hot or humid climate , but its still necessary . <p> What you do n't  want is to draw attention to yourself , especially from the males . Dressing modestly will help avoid these situations where you start to feel uneasy as the centre of attention , or even unsafe . <p> Showing off too much skin or wearing tight-fitting clothing is a pretty big no-no and can be seen as rude and disrespectful in some cultures . Its certainly not the first impression you want to give when you 're trying to connect with the locals ! <p> Whether you agree with these customs or not is irrelevant . As travellers , we have an obligation to be respectful to the culture and to do our research before we arrive . <p> You 'll feel more confident by not being the only lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're offending anyone and you 'll have less googely-eyed men staring at you . Win-win . <h> What to- wear when dressing modestly <p> As a general rule of thumb , cover your shoulders , cleavage and knees at all times . In more conservative countries , you may have to cover down to your elbows and chins/ankles and sometimes even feet . <p> Many countries requiring modest dress also have a number of religious sites which you probably want to visit . Its important to cover up in these places of worship otherwise you could be denied entry . <p> The Blue Mosque in Istanbul is the only place Ive been to which gave out cloaks and headscarves at the door to anyone who did n't  fit the dress-code . The staff at many other sites are n't  so kind and are free to just turn you away ! <p> Based on what Ive seen , many travellers going to Southeast Asia forget ( or just do n't  know ) that its really disrespectful visiting a temple without having their knees and shoulders covered . <p> In many countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown boobies for when you 're at home . <p> Western dress is generally more accepted around popular , non-holy sites and near beaches , but its still easy enough as a traveller to throw a pashmina around your shoulders while you 're there then you 're certain you 're being courteous to their customs . <p> That small step may be enough to avoid causing offense and the locals will appreciate your effort . <h> Conservative countries where women dress modestly <p> Generally speaking , predominantly Muslim , Hindu and Buddhist countries are ones youd need to cover up the most in . <p> Western countries , or countries with a major Western influence , are usually fine to wear whatever you please . Its still important to bring at least something to drape around your shoulders and to cover your legs in case you 'd like to visit a religious site . <p> Its always good to do a quick Google search before you go so you know what to expect when you pack . <h> What should you- bring with you to be prepared for dressing modestly ? <p> The best solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and put away if you do n't  require them then pull them out easily as you need them . <p> Leggings and yoga pants are OK for coverage , but you 'll probably still want a long tunic or something similar to sit over your buttocks and crotch . Tight-fitting clothing can be frowned upon and will likely attract unwanted attention . <p> Always go with the light , natural fabrics which are still breathable and will let the heat escape from your body . Youll be covered up , considerably cool and as a bonus you 'll have sun protection . <p> Read to embrace solo travel ? <h> Packing suggestions <p> Scarves and pashminas are my #1 suggestion and barely take up space or weight in my luggage . <p> A long skirt or long loose-fitting pants . <p> Lightweight shirts or blouses which can be layered over a tank top . <p> A maxi dress to be worn with a pashmina or blouse then can double as a summer beach dress in non-conservative countries . <p> T-shirts which do n't  show too much chest and definitely no cleavage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of items then purchase the rest when you arrive . I 've found that locals love helping when tourists are making an effort to adapt to the customs and culture . <p> It can seem like a daunting task at first with all these rules and it can feel so overwhelming as a female visitor trying not to cause any offense to the locals , not to mention trying not to stand out . <p> But there are SO many amazing places which are far more conservative than what we may be used to and its not worth missing out on them because you 're worried about a dress code . <p> At the very least , make a little bit of effort then you 'll figure the rest out quickly once you arrive . <h> About Mirna Segal <p> Mirna is the founder and head hostess of - Breathe Travel - a community-run resource hub for women .

No one I was with needed one so I did n't  feel them but they looked kind of like thick &amp; stiff crepe paper sheets that could be stapled around you into a shawl or skirt . <p> I have always tried to dress conservatively in countries that require it , but it always makes me question why I am doing it and if it is actually paying respect to the local culture or if its paying respect to the local sexism . Conservative clothing for women tends to be worn in cultures where women are also " lesser " citizens than men and so , I sometimes wonder , if by not wearing shorts in a certain place , I am just bowing to the dominant patriarchy . And , if that 's the case , would I be better setting an example that women can wear a tank top and not be a sex object at the same time ? <p> I honestly do n't  know the answer , but it is an eternal internal struggle for me when I travel . <p> Great point Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when you are in another country you respect their culture and their ways regardless of what you believe is right or not . Think of it this way . Imagine if someone from another country visited your culture and went against your customs because they believed you were doing it wrong . Its the same principle , just your belief against theirs . <p> Ultimately , its not up to us to enforce our way of life on others or to tell them our way is better , it is up to them to decide what they want to believe and how they dress . WE cant make them change , they have to do it themselves . And in my experience if you did wear WEstern clothing in those countries the women would n't look to you with respect or an example to follow , theyd be actually really offended and annoyed , which does n't  help your good intentions at all . <p> Hey Caz , Thanks for the thoughtful reply . While I do agree in practice and always dress modestly when its appropriate , I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right move , especially when it comes to human rights . For example , if we apply the same principle to travelling itself , then that would mean that women should n't travel solo through any country that frowns upon women being alone with men who are n't  part of their immediate family . Just by travelling in the first place , we completely ignore so many customs I want to be clear that I 'm not trying to start an argument here its just something I thought a lot about while I was travelling , especially in the Middle East , Malaysia and Indonesia . <p> Great point . I did n't  think about that . Although I think they are more open to us travelling there because its beneficial to them from an economic perspective so they are tolerant of us living out our Western ideals from that perspective . I 've never encountered any issue or antagonism from the locals in doing so . I have however many times in regards to dress . I still think the travel side of things is powerful for helping to subtly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dressing part as a direct insult to them . I 'm not sure if I 'm clearly explaining the difference as I see it . Great food for thought Jane . Thank you ! <p> Hi Jane ! Ahhh , I admit that runs through my mind a lot . Especially in VERY conservative places where women are expected to cover up most of their bodies . I agree that I also do n't  want to give in to their belief that women are lesser citizens than the males , and by covering my body its like Im giving the men more power over how I can live and dress . <p> HOWEVER , I also agree with Caz and think its not up to us to try and change their customs . Especially because its not always just for ladies . I had a long conversation with some local women in India and they said they were equally offended by men wearing sleeveless shirts as women wearing short shorts . Some cultures find our Western ways really out there so its insulting to them when we ignore how were making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our responsibility to adapt to their culture regardless of our personal beliefs . If we do n't  want to adapt then there are plenty more places to visit instead . <p> Thank you for bringing this up , its a great point and something I have thought about a lot before ! Mirna <p> It is extremely important to dress in a non- revealing way when touring a conservative country because not doing so might attract unnecessary attraction from the natives . Sometimes the natives might get the wrong message and it can also offend their belief and culture . It is important to respect the culture of the place we are visiting . <p> A good topic . As two nomadic women travelling the world for some years we are always dressed well before landing in a country that requires different etiquette than we are used to . We want both to show the respect to the local culture and do n't  want to look like women with strange manners . We are currently on a local island in the Maldives . We have chosen staying on a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the locals . The Maldives is a strict Muslim country and unless you spent your stay in a resort its necessary to wear clothes that cover your shoulders and knees at least . We are surprised to see tourists , both women and men , strolling around island in short dress , string tops and very short pants , men even without a T- shirt . We just would like to add to the post that not only women but also men should dress properly when travelling in conservative countries . <p> Its good advice to shop when you arrive . I find it hard to actually buy conservative clothes in Australia . For example , maxi dresses are often sleeveless and show a fair amount of cleavage , plus are often in polyesters or other fabrics that are n't  good for the heat . <p> Kathryn , I totally agree ! The maxi dresses I had brought to Asia from Australia seemed thin and light but were purely synthetic so they felt horrible in the heat . And it seemed impossible finding something that covered shoulders and chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trackbacks <p> attract undesirable attention but also will show respect to the local traditions and culture .

Mudgee Wineries <p> The highlight of our visit to Mudgee , was of course , the wineries . <p> We soon found out why the Mudgee Wineries are award winning . Whilst most people are familiar with the previously mentioned Hunter Valley , Mudgee is growing in popularity and we now know why . <p> Biking the Wineries <p> One great experience you must do in Mudgee is bike the wineries . Because they 're close in proximity to each other , and the terrain is generally flat , it makes for a great day out . Cycling between them put a fun twist on the experience with our kids . <p> We always love exploring destinations on our bikes , and getting some fresh air whilst taking in the beautiful scenery at a slower pace was great between all the taste testing . Kalyra got so excited she turned into a speed demon . <p> The wines here are certified organic , taste great , and I think the setting itself is worth the visit . Check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We dropped into the local tourist office on arrival in Mudgee , which we always recommend you do in any new town , and finding out there was a brewery put a smile on my face . <p> The timing was perfect , Caz and I were celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary , and what better way to celebrate than a few drinks at the family friendly Mudgee brewery . <p> We sat outside in the little courtyard whilst inside some live acoustic music entertained . We do love our craft beers and werent disappointed , sorry Australia but your mainstream domestic stuff does n't  do it for us anymore . <p> I highly recommend you try the wheat and pale ale . <h> 3 . Dinner at Lawson Park Hotel <p> We could have stayed at the Brewery for a meal but we got another local tip to eat at the Lawson Park Pub . <p> Turned out to be a great suggestion for a country pub meal . Kids eat free at the Lawson , you can choose to cook your own steaks on the communal BBQs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu was large and reasonably priced with typical meals like your salt &amp; pepper calamari and salmon . <h> 4 . Albey &amp; Esthers Cafe &amp; Wine Bar <p> If you 're looking for a cafe in Mudgee , we suggest you drop into the Albey &amp; Esthers Cafe &amp; Wine Bar . <p> Located up a little alley way off Market street , you can either sit in the garden courtyard , or get cozy inside and enjoy one of the homemade cakes , toasties , or pastries and a good cup of coffee . <p> We could easily walk or bike to Mudgees historic town centre , it was shady and of course on the river . They have self-contained cedar cabins or villas , and if you 're traveling like us plenty of powered-sites for camping and caravans . <h> Tips from our Facebook Fans <p> Below are some insider tips left by fans on our Facebook page : <p> Nicky Way Says : <p> Di Lusso Winery have great wood fired pizza , bocce and wine .

Once on top , take a one-kilometer interpretive walk along the Banff Skywalk while keeping an eye out for wildlife . <p> Head to the Whyte Museum . They feature extensive archives and library , visual art with a Canadian Rockies theme and a collection of historical relics used for skiing , mountaineering , guiding , packing and more .

You can rent a bike in town from Bactrax . <p> In winter there are two ski hills almost within spitting distance of Banff Sunshine Village ( fantastic when sunny ) and Mount Norquay ( steep ) and both have shuttle buses running to them . Lake Louise is another thirty minutes up the highway . <p> close-up of the mountain overlooking Banffs main street <h> Best areas to explore in Banff <p> I highly recommend a trip to Johnstone Canyon , about 25 minutes away any time of the year . <p> Its an easy 1.1 or 2.7 kilometer hike one way , depending on if you want to see the lower or upper falls . In winter I 'd recommend wearing crampons or Yactrax for grip on the ice . <h> Where to eat in Banff <p> Loads of dinner choices . Probably the most upmarket choice would be Saltlik Restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of other choices . <p> Other places to try are the Eddie Burger Bar for burgers but also poutine and deep fried pickles . You cant go wrong with Earls for reasonably priced food and a great atmosphere . <p> Saltlik Restaurant <h> You ca n't visit Banff without eating ? <p> Alberta beef and buffalo . <h> Where to drink in Banff <p> Try the Banff Paddock Pub for a casual pub setting in the Mount Royal Hotel . Banff Avenue Brewing is a happening spot for meals and for great beer . <p> For something a little quieter head to the Banff Springs Hotel and nab a table with a view . Its a place that takes you back in time but the drinks are good and so is the bar food . <h> Where to stay in Banff <p> If you come into Banff along Banff Avenue you 'll pass 13 hotels in just six blocks .

Its about a 15 minute walk from downtown Banff . <p> At the other end of the spectrum is Banff Y Mountain Lodge . Dormitory rates start as low as $33 in high season with bedding provided . They do have private rooms too including a family room .

You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Markets and shopping in Banff <p> Most of the shopping in Banff takes place on Banff Avenue . Unfortunately , I see it primarily as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions . <p> Patagonia has a store and there are a few galleries worth poking about in Canada House and Willock and Sax Gallery . There are lots of opportunities to pick up a T-shirt and perhaps a chocolate moose . <h> Events and festivals in Banff <p> The Banff Film Festival is one of the major events in Banff that takes place yearly in late October and early November . <p> They do have ongoing events throughout the year but its best to check their website for what 's coming .

Buses start running at 6:15 am and the last pickup is at 11:30pm . <h> Best time to visit Banff <p> Banff is actually a year round destination though my personal opinion is that its at its prettiest in July , August and September . Ski season lasts from late November until May . <h> Favorite side trip from Banff <p> You only actually need a few days for Banff . The beauty of Banff lies in its location . Its extremely easy to explore the surrounding mountains and lakes by day and return to Banff by night . <p> Picking a favourite side trip is near impossible but if you 've never been to the area then I think you should drive the thirty minutes to Moraine Lake near Lake Louise and walk to the far end of the lake phenomenal scenery and fantastic lake colour . <h> Getting there &amp; away <p> The drive from the airport to Banff takes about 1-+ hours . Banff really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be close to a 5 hour drive from Edmonton or a 9-hour drive from Vancouver . <h> Best insiders- tip for Banff <p> Wander down to the Bow River ; I like the trail heading off from behind the Banff Springs Hotel . Go park yourself down on a rock by the river and enjoy the peace and serenity of the place .

@@21820673 @1820673/ <h> Is Esperance Worth a Visit ? My answer might surprise you ! <p> I hate to say this , and I never thought I would be saying this , and I 'll probably cop some flack for this post , but I would n't hurry back to Esperance . <p> And that comes just as much of a surprise to me as it might to you . <p> But hear me out . <p> Esperance had been high on our Aussie bucket list for so long . Everyone kept saying , " You just have to go there . Wait until you see the beaches around Esperance , you 'll be blown away ! " . <p> Maybe that was part of the problem . Our expectations were so high , as wed already been BLOWN AWAY so many times since wed started our trip . It was getting harder and harder to be blown away by places , especially by beaches . <p> In defense of Esperance , it was up against me from the minute I arrived in town . Mentally I just was n't in the right frame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road around Australia . Our trip had started to get to me and I was n't that excited about seeing yet ANOTHER beach . <p> After traveling for so long travel had become the norm , and once things become the norm , they become less exciting ! <p> For those that do n't  know , Esperance is the gateway to Cape Le Grand National Park , home to Lucky Bay . Youve probably seen photos of Lucky Bay , that famous beach with kangaroos hopping about . Its been used extensively in promo material forever . And when I say gateway , its still a one hour drive east of Esperance to Lucky Bay . <p> We are spoilt for choice when it comes to beaches in Oz , a quality problem , and at that stage of our trip I would have been content to call it a day on beaches . <p> As for the town of Esperance , it just did n't  do anything for me . I found it a bit rundown , drab and lacking any real vibe . <p> I remember saying to Caz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a feel for the place , " McDonalds is the most modern building in town , what 's that saying ? " . Turns out , first impressions count . <p> And arriving from Margaret River , Dunsborough and Fremantle , I was always going to judge the cafe scene , of which there was little . Although I will give a shout out to Coffee Cat , a cute mobile coffee truck on the Esplanade . Delicious coffee at cheap prices ! <p> I hate to be so critical , but besides the surrounding beaches it just lacked as a family travel destination . <p> I mean , somebody had decided to build a full-size replica of Stonehenge . Number 5 on the list of things to on TripAdvisor . It just seemed a bit weird . What is the connection ? And when I hear of people saying the real thing is a bit of a letdown , why would I want to see a replica ? <p> At an eight hour drive from Perth , Esperance is isolated . And in case you did n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . That 's extreme isolation . <p> Now that might appeal to you , but for me it was a lot of effort when I just was n't up for it . <p> If you 're passing near to the area like we were on the way across the Nullabor , then its worth a stop . If you have n't seen many beautiful beaches in Australia yet , then its definitely worth checking out . But , since wed been so hyped up about them being out of this world , we were disappointed to not get that expectation . <p> Feeling like this about Lucky Bay and Cape Le Grand reminds me of the time we spent five months traveling through Africa , going on many safaris . Towards the end , we would find ourselves casually saying , " there goes another elephant " without the awe and wonder . <p> It could be just a timing thing . <p> Caz and I said to each other several times , if wed been travelling Australia clockwise , were near the beginning of our trip and we had just spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , seeing Lucky Bay for the first time probably would have been a WOW moment . <h> So what does Lucky Bay &amp; Cape Le Grand look like ? <p> I know you 're just going to be thinking . " How could you not be blown away by this . You 're friggin crazy ? ! " Even now as I 've just finished editing my photos , I 'm asking myself if I still feel this way . I mean they are stunning . <p> We did have a fun day . My kids enjoyed playing on the beach , and it was cool to be able to drive our car on the sand ( which was compacted like concrete ) . I could imagine it being as busy as the M1 in peak season . <p> Maybe I was a little disappointed I did n't  get the classic kangaroo shot with the beach background . Or maybe it was the fact that wed already seen kangaroos on a beach before , and hundreds of kangaroos in the wild . <p> I did get this one shot of a roo up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ha ha . <p> I do n't  know . I probably sound like I 'm fussy , but I can only compare it to what else Ive seen . <p> When I think of the " best in Australia " I think about the pure white powdery soft sand you get on Whitehaven and Hyams Beach . I think about the sunsets at Cable Beach , and the surf at Byron Bay . <p> My idea of the perfect beach might differ to yours . For me its one that offers more than just sand and water . I cant sit on a beach all day and just lie in the sun and read a book . I like to have other things nearby . <p> That 's why I love Cable Beach so much . You can spend a few hours on an incredible beach , and at your fingertips are lovely cafes , sunset bars , kids playgrounds and so much more . <p> Again , in Cape Le Grands defense , we did n't  see and do everything in the park . Many people had said how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlight of their visit . <p> To me , at this stage of our journey , rough camping was the last thing I felt like doing . I was struggling enough as it was in our camper trailer in a caravan park . I was even over that . <p> And some of the walks look pretty amazing . We did n't  do any because Savannah is at the stage where she wont walk and only wants Caz to carry her . Cazs back and exhaustion refused to entertain it anymore . <h> West of Esperance <p> A short drive west of town are some other stunning beaches , and I 'd argue just as good if not better than Lucky Bay , they 're definitely more accessible . And the coastal views from the road are outstanding . <p> My fave was Twilight Beach . If you do end up in Esperance , this drive is well worth it . <p> Knowing what I know now , if I did my 18 months around Australia again , I would skip visiting Esperance for a second time . Now that I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If I was in Perth , I 'd prefer the 20 minute ferry ride back to Rottnest , the three hour drive to Margs , or heading back to Coral Bay . <p> Nothing personal Esperance . And I 'm not saying do n't  go there , not at all . But some places do it for you and some do n't  . We cant all love everywhere ! <p> If you like to totally get away from it all , Esperance might be your kind of town . In hindsight I personally did n't  think it was worth the effort , when you have so many other great places in Australia . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> It definitely depends on the frame of mind you are in as well as what you are comparing it to and if you feel any kind of connection to a place . I personally though Margaret River was overrated , it was nice but not incredible . I also felt the same way about the Great Ocean Road . <p> Yeah , mindset definitely plays a big part and what you are open to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River I mean the whole region , not just the town , talking places like Hamelin Bay , Yallingup , Prevelly and River Mouth , Meelup Bay , Eagle Bay , Bunker Bay , Dunsborough , Smiths Beach , Boranup Forest and the caves etc . Not to mention the hundreds of wineries ha ha . <p> As for the Great Ocean Road , you definitely need to get lucky with the weather , which we did fortunately = <p> I cant remember the name of the beach we went to near Margaret River but it was pretty rocky . I 'm sure there are nicer beaches around there that we just did n't  see . We had a mix of sun and rain during the three days we were driving the Great Ocean Road I found it pleasant but nothing special . My favourite beaches in Australia are on Kangaroo Island , South Australia <p> Yeah the Great Ocean Road does n't  have a good reputation for weather , much like Melbourne really = <p> Have yet to visit Kangaroo Island , but looks amazing ! <p> tracey 69801 @qwx269801 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Felt to touristy and not relaxing . Everywhere we went was just busy and it was n't even tourist season . We still enjoyed it but would n't go back . <p> Lisa B ( @lmbva ) 69801 @qwx269801 <p> Oh what a shame ! I was one of those people who urged you to go see Cape Le Grand National Park . My favourite beach there is Hellfire Bay it looks from your pics that there was a bit of seaweed in Lucky Bay . Anyway , it definitely depends on your state of mind how you enjoy a place . And yep you can get beach fatigue because they 're all so bloody amazing over in the west ! Hope you 're settling in okay at Burleigh . <p> I should have mentioned Hellfire Bay in the post , we did make a short visit there and it was stunning , and I agree with you , probably nicer than Lucky Bay . But I chose to focus more on Lucky Bay for this example . <p> Interesting ! I really think it had to be the timing I love iconic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overrated . Crazy huh = As a surfer , Margaret River beaches definitely take first place in my mind though , and I go down there from Perth justttt about every free weekend that I can . <p> Sometimes places just do n't  give you the right vibe and that 's enough to settle it . Definitely has happened to me before . But now that I think about it , I do n't  even really remember what the town of Esperance really looks like so that surely has to say something . <p> As a surfer I can see how Margs is the drawcard that it is . Would love to watch the pro event one year ! <p> Yeah timing , weather , other factors all play a part . I still think there are better beaches in WA though as mentioned . Either way , you 've got a great backyard over there ! ! <p> Donna Bennett 69801 @qwx269801 <p> Great to get your opinion on Esperance . WA is a destination I 'm looking forward to exploring in the near future . While I 'm there " time " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places that I can possibly skip . Thanks for sharing your thoughts . <p> Depending on how long you have , its a good idea to narrow your choices . Remember WA is HUGE , we spent 6 months there on this trip and still have lots yet to see = <p> MARLENE 69801 @qwx269801 <p> Oh Donna please do n't  be turned away by one persons opinion . We may not have it all here in Esperance but we do have plenty to offer . <p> tracey 69801 @qwx269801 <p> This is the first blog i have read where the author has really not been favorable to esperance . So all the hundreds of others that rate esperance very highly must have really been able to see the beauty , sadly this authour did n't  and that 's ok . But do n't  just take their word for it . <p> Wonderful ! Because we do n't  really like being like everyone else . Tracey , I think we clearly stated the reasons we did not like it AND we very clearly said the area is beautiful . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also included to showcase its beauty even though we werent taken with Esperance . So please , do n't  take it personal and just read it properly . <p> It sounds like you visited Esperance at the wrong stage of your trip . I bet had you visited it before some of the other beaches , you would have loved it ! <p> It is a magic place , but as you say , your frame of mind makes all the difference . Youve seen more beaches than most people ever will , which gives you a very different perception . Also , unless your expectations are met in one way or another its easy to feel let down . <p> We also thought Lucky bay was overrated , for the same reasons . That said , the beaches further east ( Duke of Orleans and Thomas River ) were magic and blew us away . I guess it depends what you are looking for in a place <p> I can totally relate to this ! After you 've been to so many beaches you can start to get a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for that perfect one . <p> When I was backpacking Europe years ( and years ! ) ago , I met an Aussie on the ferry to Greece from Italy . He summed it up with a great quote after I asked him how his trip to Europe had been . ( Mind you , he was at the end of a six month journey ) " It became ABC mate Another Bloody Church , Another Bloody Castle " ! <p> Love the articles and pics . Do n't  worry , there 's always something awesome just around the bend ! <p> Ha ha , that 's a good one ! I could say the same thing about our time in Thailand in regards to Temples = <p> johnberk 69801 @qwx269801 <p> Yeah , I totally agree with the author of this article . On the other hand , it always depends on your current mood , and on the weather . This beach looks generic to me . Nothing that would blow me away with its natural beauty or anything . You somehow expect more when you travel to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are simply not enough . <p> Your opinion of Esperance does not surprise me at all , given how long you 'd been on the road at the time and the fact you were feeling burnt out , and were also maybe a bit rushed only spending a few days there . However I feel like many of the things you do n't  like about Esperance are part of what makes it great for some people , such as the isolation and the town being the opposite of somewhere glitzy and touristic . I wonder if you were to return one day in the distant future , with a 4WD and a week or two to explore off the beat track , if your perception would be completely different . <p> I think its good that you share your honest opinions and feelings including some occasional negativity . It means that when you are enthusiastic about something , your readers can trust that its genuine , which I think is hugely important once you start earning money off a blog and being endorsed by brands and tourism boards . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of your Australia trip as a whole and your mindset at the time , and are n't  too discouraged from visiting the stunningly beautiful Esperance beaches ! <p> Bonny : " I wonder if you were to return one day in the distant future , with a 4WD and a week or two to explore off the beat track , if your perception would be completely different " . <p> Me : Kid free ? Absolutely . I 'm sure it would ha ha . And thanks for GETTING where I was coming from . I thought I was pretty clear on my reasons why I would n't hurry back though . And of course the isolation and the town being the opposite of somewhere glitzy and touristic would appeal to others . Definitely . Each to their own . But I can only write about my experience and expectations and desire . Everyone has to see it for themselves before making judgement on whether its a fit for them . <p> And yeah , I think as a whole we have highlighted and promoted Australia HUGELY . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails , and the FB comments , and the private messages , and the feedback from any tourism partners . But you know , I think most people get . And like I said at the end of the post , just calling it as " I " see it . I have seen hundreds of AMAZING places around Oz and unfortunately this place did n't  hit the spot for me on this visit . And let 's face it , most people visiting Esperance have n't just spent 15 months on the road with a 3 and 7 year old , homeschooling , running a full-time business , and everything else that comes with all that . That 's why I thought I explained that it was just as much about my mental health , as it was Esperance = <p> I think you 're doing the right thing . You might risk annoying a small minority of people ( you can never win there because other people would find it annoying if your lives were too perfect ) , but its one of the things that makes your blog stand out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure the majority of readers do especially over the longer-term and in the context of the 18-month road trip . Anyone looking for travel inspiration and advice from non-corporate blogs should realise they 're all subjective , and that that 's where their value lies . <p> Totally agree with you Craig and a great way to articulate it , we felt exactly the same and agree we loved the same beaches around OZ that you pointed out too . The town of Esperance was a huge disappointment , there are many nicer places to visit . Spot on , well done ! <p> Its really unfortunate you did n't  enjoy yourself much these photos make it seem very beautiful ! Sometimes people prefer quieter , less to do areas , so I think your review is helpful for people either way . Thanks for sharing ! <p> We went to Esperance straight from the Nullabor and enjoyed climbing over the rocks at Blue Haven beach and Twilight beach . After being told lucky bay was a 25 min drive from the yha we headed over at 4.30 pm , spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark ! It was pretty but time was n't on our side . We are travelling West and I 'm now looking forward to the amazing beaches we will pass on our way to Perth after reading this ! <p> Oh you 're going to love them Laura ! Do n't  forget Elephant Rocks at Denmark it will blow you away . And then all the beaches around Margaret River and Rottnest . We just love them ! <p> Bruno 69801 @qwx269801 <p> Yeah I think definitely captured the flaws in your opinions really well . You 're at the end of a long trip visiting a state full of amazing sites , you have two young kids who are n't  suited two of the biggest attractions of Esperance hiking and 4WDing you did n't  visit any beaches for surf , you did n't  go fishing , and you limited your coffee experiences to a van selling coffee ( albeit fantastic coffee ) . What on earth did you want from Esperance ? What research did you do for the experiences on offer there and the best ways to spend your time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy your trip , probably better if you 'd just not bothered reviewing the place at all . 0/5 for that purile rubbish mate . <p> There 's a difference Bruno between Esperance the town and Lucky Bay and the National Park , like a 100km difference ! I think I was pretty clear on my reasons why I did n't  like Esperance . As a town it just did n't  do anything for me , and that 's coming after experiencing hundreds of towns around Australia . And from personal experience there are many beaches better than Lucky Bay . That 's not being obnoxious , its just my comparison from my travels . Do you like every place you visit ? ? <p> And just becasue I do n't  surf , fish or 4wd does n't  mean I cant rate a place , and those activities have nothing to do with the town of Esperance , which is the title of this post . By the way our kids do hike and I explained why we did n't  there and I 'm sure it would have been a different experience in the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear about that . And I did try coffee at other cafes , they just werent worth mentioning . IMO , Esperance the town has nothing on Broome , Coral Bay , Margaret River , Dunsborough , Yallingup , and several other towns in WA . Sorry , I call it as I see it . <p> I can understand the locals getting ticked off ; it hurts when an outsider does n't  love your town as much as you do , but its also helpful to get an outsiders ( a paying visitor , same as any other visitor who might actually have the same opinion ) honest appraisal because there might be areas that can be worked on which will encourage future travellers . To say there are flaws in someones opinion is just silly though . Its just an opinion , its neither right nor wrong . Craig and Caz , its too bad you did n't  enjoy the wilds around Esperance as I think its a stunning part of my old home state and I think much of its beauty lies in its remoteness and simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you could be right suggesting travellers go anticlockwise . I did some of the coastal bushwalks and climbed Frenchmans Peak and camped in Lucky Bay and loved all of it . I think the beginning of this post was a little harsh ; the title and intro implies you do n't  actually consider it worth visiting when the post is more about how you probably would n't visit AGAIN . I 'm glad you were up front about how over it you were , its just *unlucky* that Lucky Bay copped it because you werent in the mood . <p> Again , all I can say is Esperance and Lucky Bay are two separate destinations . And like I said , I 'm judging Esperance against hundreds of other towns Ive visited around Australia , and to me its an average town . Would I return to Esperance again if Lucky Bay and Cape Le Grand werent in the area ? Not any time soon . Would I enjoy Cape Le Grand National Park if given more time and a better state of mind ? I 'm sure I would . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the town . If locals get upset by my thoughts , so be it . I call it as I see it , and I stand by my experience . <p> Stacey 69801 @qwx269801 <p> i cant help but take offense when I read this . I actually bristled in defense Esperance is my town and I love it . If you cant appreciate it for what it is we really do n't  want you to come back . An assumption I know , but I 'm guessing you must be from either Victoria . <p> Hi Stacey , why would you take offense ? Why would you take it personally ? And why do I have to like every place I visit , do you ? ? The world would be a boring place if we all liked , did and agreed on the same things ! I could n't care less about what people thought of my home town , it does n't  define me as a person ! And no , I 'm not from Victoria , but NSW . <p> Stacey , we did n't  insult any people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I find fascinating about your comment is your outrage at how we 've offended you personally ( and we never said anything about people from Esperance ) , yet you yourself have written quite an offensive comment about Victorians that 's millions of people . Really ? <p> Nicky 69801 @qwx269801 <p> An honest opinion . I think this experience is more indicative about the difference where we as travelers are looking for when traveling . These travelers do not seem to appreciate the beauty isolation can bring . Who needs a cafe scene when you get that every day in the big smoke ? Who needs crowded touristy beaches , I like having lots of personal ? Would it worry me that the town is not too exciting ? Not a bit I am there to explore the natural beauty not the shops , cafes and restaurant . But you have to respect that not everyone is looking for the same thing . Born in Europe and having traveled extensively , Esperance beaches are still on top of my list for natural beauty . But I admit to being biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69801 @qwx269801 <p> So pleased to read some good reports about Esperance . I run holiday units . That have 90% occupancy rates . Over the twelve months . In Esperance . And find all our guests only have positives about Esperance . But I do understand we are all different and are looking for different things . Also was great to comment about Hellfire bay . Also my favourite . Secluded , sheltered , great swimming , wonderful facilities . Cheers from ESPERANCE. must I have done quite a bit of travelling in my life time and feel ESPERANCE DOES COMPARE AND IN MANY CASES OUTSHINES SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES . <p> tracey 69801 @qwx269801 <p> I like many others that call esperance home found it after travelling , it just had that homely feeling and i couldnt keep away .. I am constantly meeting tourists and backpackers that have just been in awe of the beauty that esperance has . Many that stay for months to really experience it . Our lifestyle here is second to none . So many places for weekend outings , fishing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what we do have is pretty amazing and i feel very lucky to choose to live here . Maybe posting on a town when you are in the wrong frame of mind is not a fair interpretation . <p> louisa klimentos 69801 @qwx269801 <p> i felt the same after visitng the ancient ruins of Cyprus.Towards the end i was over it.I must say your photos are really stunning.The water is very blue and the sand is very white.I have been told that Helfire bay is stunning.I ve been told that the water is so blue . Bluer than say beaches at Byron Bay . <p> Hi ! We 're Caz &amp; Craig <p> Travel addicts living life unplugged and proving travel does n't stop after kids .

@@21820679 @1820679/ <h> What to do in Freiburg , Germany <p> As part of our city guides- series , we interviewed Andrew Couch who has lived in Freiburg since 2007 . <p> Andrew shares with us his insider tips on things to do in Freiburg for those looking for the best places to see , eat , stay , drink , and explore . <p> Take it away Andrew . <h> Why visit Freiburg ? <p> Freiburg is a German university city out of the main English speaking tourist flow that runs Munich to Berlin and yet central in Europe . <p> It is a beautiful , walkable city on the edge of the Black Forest known for being in the sunniest corner of the country . <p> The university and its students keep it vibrant and cultural . It is a good base to explore this region with day trips to the nearby spa towns and the numerous hiking opportunities of the forest nearby . <h> What to do in Freiburg <p> Start with walking around the old town with its historic buildings and relaxing squares . <p> Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market and eat a sausage from the stands there . <p> Explore the side streets and step over the B+chle , the tiny water rills along many streets which are unique to Freiburg . <p> See the iconic Martins Tor ( one of the former city gates ) with the McDonalds in it . <p> Then head up the Schlossberg ( Castle hill ) . There are stairs and an elevator at Schwabentor ( another former city gate ) that head up . The mountain is an extension of the black forest and is terraced . <p> At one level there is a beer garden with views of the whole city . The next level up is Cannonenplatz with seats and views as well . Further up is a lookout tower to climb . <p> The city itself is pretty relaxing , so to " do stuff " you need to leave town for a bit . <p> If you like a good walk , head down to the river and start walking . My favorite direction is east toward the forest . You can walk for miles along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangout . <h> Best neighborhoods in Freiburg <p> Certainly , the Altstadt ( old town ) is the best place to walk around . The Cathedral and Town Hall have their own squares and the pedestrian shopping streets are there too . <p> On a Saturday this is where the action is . If you want to get out of the center there are a few neighboring districts to look at . <p> Weihre is south of the center and over the river . It is one of the older neighborhoods with older buildings . While mainly residential , there are some nice places to shop and eat . <p> St++hlinger is the other side of the train tracks and mainly a student area . More little neighborhood cafes here . <p> Gunterstal is the end stop on the green line going south . It is almost a self-enclosed village of its own with expected charm . <h> Where to Eat in Freiburg <p> The best food for a quick lunch is at the Markthalle , a food court of many ethnic food stands right near the center . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An old hunting lodge on a hill with great views , although a bit of a walk from the center . <h> You Ca n't Visit Freiburg Without Eating <p> Flammkuchen . It is a thin crispy dough with cream sauce and toppings . So a bit like a pizza , but not . The classic toppings of onion and bacon are from just over the river in Alsace France . A lot of places in town serve it and most will put just about anything you want on it . <h> Where to Drink in Freiburg <p> Feierling . This is a tiny brewery in Freiburg with both a pub and a beer garden . The beer is unfiltered and a little sweet , but very fresh . <h> Best Place for a Night on the Town in Freiburg <p> Hit up Niemannstrasse near the University . There are a number of bars and cafes that are open late . In summer sitting out side is an easy and enjoyable prospect . <h> Where to Stay in Freiburg <p> Freiburg has two hostels with the Black Forest Hostel being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Schwartzw+lder hof a few times and they like it . It is a small hotel right in the old town . <p> I have always come to Freiburg to live so always had apartments to move into . <p> Although when I move here from the US permanently I did stay for several weeks in the City Hotel . It is n't pretty from the outside , but it is right in the old town and the staff was friendly . <h> Markets and Shopping in- Freiburg <p> The old town and the pedestrian streets there are the main shopping district . It is mostly big name stores , not too much unique . The best market is the one around the Cathedral . <h> Events and Festivals in Freiburg <p> Christmas Markets for the four weeks of Advent in November and December . Summer brings wine fests both in Freiburg and surrounding towns . Summer also brings music and local fests in specific sections of town and on the castle hill . <p> Fasching is the German version of Mardi Gras celebrated 6 weeks ahead of Easter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings New Wine Season . Check out the sweet new wine in the market . <h> Getting Around- Freiburg <p> The center of the city is very walkable . Even from the center to one edge of the city is about an hour walk . There is also a tram system that keeps all parts of the city well connected . <h> Finding WiFi in- Freiburg <p> Unfortunately no . Starbucks is your best bet for wifi even if you might have to pay for it . <h> Best time to visit- Freiburg <p> Late spring to early fall . The town lives up to its reputation as the sunniest part of Germany . This is also the time for many festivals both in Freiburg itself and surrounding towns . <p> Sit in the sun and enjoy a cold beer or wine in a square . <h> Favorite side trip from- Freiburg <p> Freiburg is a great town , but it can feel small . However it is at the center of a good regional transport network so day tripping is a really excellent idea . <p> Titisee or Feldberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baden , the Kaiserstuhl wine growing area or even Switzerland are all within a few hours on the train and make easy daytrips . <p> Afterward come back to town and enjoy a beer . <h> Getting there and away <p> Frankfurt International airport has a train station in it that has links to Freiburg . The ICE train connections take 2 hours and either run straight or have a very easy connection ( same platform ) in Mannheim . <p> Basel Euroairport has an Easyjet hub and it connected by bus to Freiburg . <p> The train is probably your best bet if you are already in Europe with Milan and Paris about 5 hours away . <h> Best insiders- Tip for travel to- Freiburg <p> My quirky favorite is the marking on the ground just north of the old town where the 48 latitude line goes through . It is an inlay in the sidewalk . <h> I Love Freiburg because <p> It feels like home . Not just that I have lived here , but it has a lot of elements that make it feel like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as Blacksburg , VA where I went to college . <h> Plan Your Trip to Freiburg , Germany 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation to- Freiburg <p> Booking.com has 100+ properties in Freiburg including hotels , apartments , and guesthouses .

I am quite happy being " Freiburg guy . " Definitely come during Football season and we will figure out how to get tickets . <p> Germany There are alot of beautiful towns and cities to visit . I live as an expat in North West Germany and it looks quiet similar to Freiburg . Of course all the old part of the towns are just so quaint and full of character . The bad point ( or good points for some ) are the bakeries ! Gained way to much poundage from those cakes ! <p> Enjoyed your psst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you regarding the Feierling brewery . As students we drank their beer when our funds were low , and , even then , we referred tipoff the beer as " Reierling " . <p> What a lovely blog post ! I was born in Freiburg and love this city .

@@21820680 @1820680/ <h> Things to Do in Peru itinerary 10 days <p> Who says travel to amazing places , such as Peru , is only for the people that are willing to quit their jobs ? <p> My husband and I have been working the 9 to 5 and traveling to amazing places for the past 12 years . We have used our vacation days to see some of the world 's most sought after places , including a Peru trip . <p> We understand the challenge of only having a few vacation days , but when that is all you have to work with you find a way to make it work . <p> I have heard from many people that planning to visit Peru for only 10 days would be " too rushed " and we would be " unable to enjoy it " . <p> I usually counter this with , " Have you traveled to Peru for 10 days ? " and this is usually followed by a shameful " well no " . It IS possible to take 10 days , travel to Peru , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your life . <p> All Smiles At Machu Picchu <p> In this post on things to do in Peru on a 10 day itinerary , well cover : <h> Things to Do in Peru <p> The best way to plan Peru travel is to create Peru- trip pillars . <p> Your pillars represent the things you are not willing to miss on your Peru trip . Peru travel has many pillars and it is not possible to see them all in 10 days in Peru . So identifying your Peru must-sees is very important in the planning process . <p> Common Peru pillars include : <p> Lima <p> Nazca Lines <p> Lake Titicaca <p> Machu Picchu <p> Sacred Valley <p> Cusco <p> Amazon Rainforest <p> Colca Canyon <p> Ballestas Islands <p> and Huacachina Sand Dunes . <p> You could spend months exploring all the nooks and crannies of Peru but with 10 days , pick your pillars and then plan things to do in Peru around them . <p> This will make the best use of your time and budget . My biggest piece of advice is to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL lead to a rushed , unpleasant travel to Peru . <p> Stunning Lima Architecture <h> Peru itinerary 10 days make a plan <p> When making flight arrangements to Peru you will likely fly into the capital city of Lima arriving late at night . <p> This city is a vibrant , busy and crowded Third World capital and I would n't plan on too many days here . <p> If you plan your very first day in Lima you will have plenty of time to catch up on some sleep from your late arrival the night before and hit the highlights of the city . <p> From Lima , you can reach the Nazca Lines , Ballestas Islands and Huacachina Sand Dunes by bus . To visit these areas you need to plan a minimum of 2 days with an overnight . <p> A day trip to the Nazca lines can be done if you are really short on time and ca n't live without them . It will be a long day and it is n't feasible to combine Ballestas Islands and Huacachina with the Nazca Lines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Titicaca , Cusco or Colca Canyon at this point depending on what you have chosen for your Peru itinerary . <p> There is no set way to put your Peru trip together , so be creative and plan in the things you are excited to see . <p> Some things to keep in mind while planning : <p> What time of year are you going ? <p> What will the weather be like ? <p> Should you plan for altitude adjustment ? <p> Little things you should be aware of that have a significant effect on your plans . <p> Witnessing the Macaws Descend On A Clay Lick in the Amazon Rainforest <h> Getting Around Peru <p> Due to your limited number of days , flying becomes your most logical option . The only exception is taking the bus to visit to the Nazca lines , Ballestas Islands and Huacachina Sand Dunes . <p> Bus rides are available throughout Peru that will get you to and from Cuzco , Lake Titicaca and Colca Canyon but they take many hours , think 30+ , due to the terrain . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and slow . <p> With only 10 days in Peru , that leaves flying as your best option . <p> Luckily , Peru operates a few different airlines within the country that you can pick up for cheap prices if you plan ahead . The three airlines to search are : <p> Star Peru <p> TACA <p> LAN <p> We used Star Peru for all of our inter-country flights which included : Lima-Puerto Maldonado , Puerto Maldonado-Cuzco and Cuzco-Lima . The tickets ranged from $55-$150 per person for each leg . <p> ybox <p> HOT TIP for Peru travel : <p> Do not try to book tickets that are designated for Peruvians only it will be tempting as they are significantly cheaper but they will not honor your ticket at the airport during check in. /ybox <p> When we arrived in each new place we utilized the local transportation . Taxis in Lima and Cuzco , Tuk Tuk 's in Puerto Maldonado and put many miles on our feet . <p> Local prices are pretty reasonable and easy to find while you are out and about . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city center , we hailed a taxi but if we wanted to see another site nearby , we walked . <p> Amazon Transportation <h> Where to Stay in Peru <p> With only 10 days in Peru , choosing your accommodation location in Peru is really important . <p> You want to make sure you are in the thick of things and close to the main attractions to maximize your days . <p> This alone will help you to not feel rushed and despite what you may hear from people , it is possible to find reasonably priced accommodation in the main areas of each city in Peru . <p> Speaking from our experience , I would recommend the following places to stay in Peru ( all private rooms with bath ) : <p> Lima <p> Miraflores is a clean area with many attractions . You can get a room at a guesthouse or hostel for around $20 per night . <p> Puerto Maldonado <p> We stayed at a property near the Madre de Dios as part of the adventure package we booked for the Amazon . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near the river for around $10-$25 per night . <p> Cusco <p> We stayed at the Hostal Inti Wasi and the location was amazing . We were right next to the Plaza de Armas . You will be in the heart of Cusco if you stay here , within easy walking distance to many shops , food and sights . They also stored our excess stuff when we went to Machu Picchu . Cost was $35 per night . <p> Aguas Calientes <p> This little town is loaded with places to stay on any budget . You are at the foot of Machu Picchu and that comes with a price . <p> We ended up at a small hotel near the train station for $50 per night . Your other option is hiking the Inca Trail . On a 10 day Peru itinerary you have time to do the 2 day / 1 night hike and lodging is included when you book . <p> Relaxing in Our Bungalow in Puerto Maldonado <p> For more places to stay in Peru choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> What Does it Cost to Travel in Peru ? <p> This topic is subjective . Everyone 's tastes and opinions of the perfect vacation are different . <p> The single most important thing is to plan the Peru trip you want around the money you want to spend . We planned a busy 10 day Peru itinerary for ourselves with many activities . <p> Our budget was $4,000 total for 2 people over 10 days . <p> We spent : <p> $1,020 getting to Peru <p> $700 on inter-country flights <p> $115 on 4 nights of accommodation <p> $1,279 on tours that included 4 nights of accommodation <p> We spent our last night in the airport and when it was all said and done , we came home with $500 <p> Our total spent was $3500 , $1750 per person . <p> Hiking in the Sacred Valley <h> Our Peru itinerary 10 Days <p> Day 2 Slept in then explored Lima , including open top bus tour of the city sights . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog arrived late afternoon .

Its far better than the Inca Trail landscape in my opinion . If you have limited time , I 'd recommend seeing Machu Picchu in a day but trying to incorporate the Santa Cruz trek from Huaraz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titicaca ( floating islands and overnight on Amantani ) . I did n't  like Nazca except for the lines themselves and the plane was pretty scary ! Huacachina was great fun . I had 7 months in South America and I still did n't  bother with Lima <p> Hi Arianwen ! Thanks for the additional suggestions ! Peru is such an amazing country with so much to do and see . I know we did n't  even scratch the surface and we are really looking forward to our return visit to hit up some of the places we missed on our first 10 day trip there . Ill definitely look into Huaraz ! We love to hike , so it sounds perfect . <p> That sounds great ! ! You certainly used your time well . I think I just spent a week and a half in Peru too plenty of time to see Lima , acclimatise and check out Cusco and then do the Inca Trail . It is certainly possible to have an amazing time in a short time period ! ! <p> Hi Sharon ! Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 10 days . We were happy we did n't  plan in too many days in Lima tough . Our time was better spent in the Amazon . We did n't  plan early enough , so we werent able to get passes to hike the inca trail , but it is certainly on our list for our next visit ! <p> Thanks for the information especially the detailed itinerary . I will look into it again when I plan a trip . Machu picchu is my dream destination . I have one question . Can I reach there by bus ? Or only by foot . <p> Hi Wannee ! Machu Pichu is breathtaking ! Getting to Machu Pichu , you start by taking a train or taxi from Cusco to Ollantaytambo . From there , you have to take a train or hike to the town of Aguas Calientes . Once there , you have the option of hiking or taking a bus to the entrance of Machu Pichu . <p> we are 70 and 73 . planning on going to machu pitcchu and other destinations while we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) one of our worrys is the altitude and how that will affect us Any suggestions please thank you for this . it has truly been fantastic Liz Arthur <p> Hi Liz ! Your plans sound awesome ! Yes , you definitely should be fit and stable on your feet to make a visit here . You have to walk and climb to access much of the area and the paths are narrow with no hand rails . The altitude at Machu Picchu is n't bad at all . It is quite a bit lower than , say , Cuzco . The ideal plan of action is to fly into Cuzco and then immediately descend into the Sacred Valley , visit Machu Picchu , THEN visit Cuzco . You will be making a gradual climb into the higher altitudes . We did n't  do it that way and my husband was affected by the high altitude in Cuzco . Bringing altitude meds from your travel doc is a good idea if you do n't  have the days to acclimate slowly . <p> Hi there ! I live in Peru for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuscomy suggestion is to start drinking coca tea as soon as you land and keep drinking itI never got altitude sickness thanks to that ! <p> You can certainly spend 1/2 of what you spent &amp; see the same sights , less the tours &amp; with cheaper hotels . As for the flights , we booked the " Peruvian only " flights on TACA to Cusco from Lima &amp; back . 5 of us had no issues &amp; were not turned away of charged more . We asked around in Lima ( we were there for a week before transiting to Cusco ) beforehand &amp; no one had heard of that happening . <p> You 're right you could spend less in that amount of time if you wanted to . Something to note though , is that total price also included our air to and from Peru . That was 1/3 of the total we spent . Budget really is subjective . It depends on the wants/needs of each traveler . We prefer to have a private room and if possible , a private bath . So we spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we felt our time was pretty limited , so we opted for some tours to get a deeper experience , since we did n't  have more time to explore on our own . We had to take the tour for the Amazon , you are n't  allowed into the Amazon ( at least in that part of it ) on your own . The price included lodging , transport , all activities and food so it was well worth the price we paid . Again , it comes down to each travelers preference . It certainly can be done more than one way ! Regarding the Peruvian prices , we watched several people get turned away that were not able to provide a Peruvian I 'd when they checked in with those tickets both in Lima and Cuzco . They were denied boarding and had to repurchase tickets . All the sites specifically state ( if you read the fine print ) that they are under no obligation to honor those tickets if you buy one and are unable to provide a Peruvian I 'd . They also do not refund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you get lucky , you score an awesome deal but for us , the chance of being denied boarding , having to buy another ticket and possibly missing our flight was n't worth the difference in price . = <p> Hi Mellisa ! Thank you ! That is great to hear that you have added t back to your bucket list ! We hesitated initially too , because the logistics in the country can be intimidating when you start planning . But do n't  let that deter you . Using the budget airlines gets you around efficiently , easy and makes it possible to see some of the best places in Peru with a short period of time . <p> Yes , you can FOR SURE make a visit to Peru with 10-14 days ! And that is enough days to see a couple different areas without racing around too much . Best of luck in your planning and I hope you make it to Peru in 2014 ! <p> Hi ! It is so tempting ! I think I wan na go to Peru = And I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country ! I recently visited Colombia ( in 9 days ) and it was just amazing ! Great country , lovely people , amazing views ! <p> Peru is amazing and you should definitely add it to your travel list ! Having more time will always give you a more in depth experience , but when you have limited days to work with , it is possible to put together an itinerary that fits in the highlights and is n't too rushed . I celebrated my golden , 28th , birthday in Colombia ! Loved that country as well . = <p> Hello ! This was forwarded to me from a friend . I have been saying for years that i want to go to Per+ . It was my dream , now is my goal . This help that you just wrote is excellent . Thank you so much . I did n't  even knew where to start . I 'm still planning tough , because I have been told that there are some months of the year that is not good to go because of the rain season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do you have any recommendations of what months to go . I usually only have also 10- 12 days of vacation at work . Thanx for the help ! Christie <p> Hi Christie ! We visited at the end of March . That time is not considered ideal time to visit by many but we had an absolute lovely trip . We did get rain the day we went to Machu Picchu , but it rained in the morning and then cleared off in the afternoon . As a result , we got the most amazing photos of the clouds covering the ruins . So I can say I do n't  regret the rain at all ! Most sites will tell you that June- August is the ideal time to visit , as there will be little to no rain during the those winter months . Some other travelers we know just visited in October and they had some rain also , but nothing that lasted . It all comes down to what the ideal trip is for your travel style . = Good luck in your travels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money by taking an overnight bus instead of flying . I took a bus from Arequipa to cusco and back . I paid around $20 each way to get a VIP seat . I slept perfectly and when I woke up I was at my destination ! Machu Picchu monta+a was fabulous ( but a rough hike ) . I went without a tour guide and it was great , and even better that I was able to save that money . Hiking through the colca valley was also increadible ( but if you have any asthmatic tendencies you should not do it ) . One more thing : I found a company where I could actually climb up one of the mountains in the sacred valley via staples ( like on a telephone pole ) , it was beautiful ! And then I zip lined back down . At the time I was only 18 ( and female ) and traveling by myself felt so safe the entire time . Those Peruvians take good care of you = <p> Hi Rachel ! We did n't  visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people that want to do that ! That overnight bus route does n't  sound so bad . We looked into buses between Lima and Cusco and they were at a minimum of 30 hours . We just did n't  have the extra days for that kind of travel . We plan to use the bus though on our return visit ! <p> Hi Lina ! I was wondering which companies you went with for your excursions ? I 'm trying to plan a trip for next year , but am having a hard time finding recommended excursion companies , hotels , ect . It looks like you did a lot and had an amazing time , I 'm hoping to do a few of the same things on my trip . Thank you ! <p> Hi Denica ! We used Wasai Lodge and Expeditions to visit the Amazon from Puerto Maldonado . They have a number of different packages based on what you want to do . Highly recommend this company for a trip into the Rainforest . In Cusco , we used a company called South Adventure Peru Tours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu with them . Have fun in Peru , it is an amazing country ! <p> Hi Lina , actually I have a travel agency in Peru , right now we trying to expand at USA , currently we have 20 years in the tourism industry and I saw your trip in just 10 days , which was amazing and good experience as well , however its no enough time to visit other places like Puno , Arequipa , Trujillo and Piura which basically u can find really nice beaches and the weather is warm the whole year . I 'm so glad that you and other travelers gave a feedback , opinions and suggestions because for us like travel agency is extremely important all the feedback , so on . So according to that we travel agencies can improve the services , budgets , and how treat our costumer . Thank you for this blog . I hope you can come back to Peru when you have a chance and try to do the route Of adventure or mystics . Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see all of Peru in just 10 days . But I wanted to convey to people that it is still possible to have only 10 vacation days and make a nice trip to Peru . This is just what we decided to do , others may choose to mix and match the cities to their tastes with their allotted number of days . Thanks for stopping in and you input ! <p> Hi this post is wonderful and really helpful as I plan a trip with my boyfriend for the middle of March = Thank you ! I have a few questions I was wondering if you could she 'd some light onDid you have difficulty with the language barrier during your stay in Peru ? I plan to mainly use the bus to travel and I am wondering if the language barrier will become an issue as I try to navigate my way from one destination to the other . Also , the INCA trail is my number one pillar and am hoping to travel with a local guide for a 4-5 day trek to cover the entire trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides once I arrive in Peru ? I have done research online for guide companies , many of them are very expensive and I am uncomfortable with booking and payment through the internet . Also water ! I am assuming that you bought bottled water during your stay . Did you ever think of bringing water sanitizing tablets ( these are often used when camping ) . My thoughts for this come from my plan to trek the INCA trail . I will prepare and pack myself with bottled water but I can only carry so much weight in my pack . Do you know how guide companies provide thier travellers with water ? Do you think/trust that the water tablets be useful ? <p> Hi Alicia ! I did n't  have too many troubles with the language barrier- but I speak an intermediate level of Spanish . You will be able to get by using the buses even if you do n't  speak Spanish . Just know where you are going ahead of time in case you cant find anyone that speaks English . I will tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . Yes , you can find people that speak English , but not as easy to find as say , Mexico . We did n't  get a chance to hike the Inca trail because we waiting too long and we werent able to get passes ! They literally sell out months in advance . So if you do n't  have them yet you might be out of luck . Sometimes you can find an outfitter that has some set aside , but this is rare . As far as I know , you ca n't hike the trail alone , you have to go with an outfitter/guide of some sort . Unfortunately they are all expensive , but I have heard really good things about Llama Path . <p> Regarding water , we bought bottled water everywhere . You could probably use the chlorine tabs on tap water if you wanted to . Best of luck in your planning ! <p> Hi Shay , You will save a ton of money if you make all the arrangements yourself . I would suggest buying a basic translation book , learning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fine . English speakers may not be as prevalent , but if you have some basic phrases , someone can point you in the direction of someone that does speak English . As long as you know where you are going , you can read signs and find your way . Part of the fun is the exploration . = <p> Hi Hannah , Thanks for stopping by to read the post ! No nothing specific . Mostly internet research via Google and TripAdvisor . I did have an eyewitness book that I was reading- that is how I found out about the macaw clay links in the Amazon , but the rest was internet research . <p> Hi there ! Thank you for your kind words . The common misconception is that you need more time to visit places like Peru . Yes , there were things that we missed , but when you only have a minimum amount of days , you make what you have work the best you can . Glad you found it useful ! = <p> Hi , i am planning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family this Christmas and I really like the itinerary you chose . Your 4 day trip in the amazon looks awesome but i cant find a similar package which would include kayaking , zip lining , tree climbing hiking etc . With which company/website did you book your tour ? Thanks you <p> Hi ! We booked our stuff with Wasai Adventures . Click on the Wasai link in the article and it will take you to the website. = It is a really awesome tour and a great way to see the Amazon . Enjoy Peru , it is beautiful . <p> I 'm traveling to Peru at the end of May with 2 friends and we 've booked our trip through a great travel agency . We are also planning to do the trip carry-on only , do you have any suggestions on what to bring/wear ? Thanks and happy travels . <p> Hi Suzanne ! You should check the weather forecast for your travel dates . We were there in late March , early April and we experienced both cold and hot climates . It will depend on where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuzco was colder and wet . We wore rain jackets and sweaters while we were there . Make sure you bring a good pair of walking shoes . Have fun , its a great place to visit ! <p> Hi Lina ! Thank you so much for the amazing detailed post . Six of us will be traveling to Peru this upcoming August . We will be in Cuzco for 5 days and one of the days we are visiting Macchu Picchu . We booked a package that includes hotel , breakfast , transportation from and to the airport , private tour of Macchu Picchu , tour of Cuzco and a dinner and show I know , it sounds like a lot ! We are extremely excited for our trip . Nonetheless , I have a concern the altitude ! I am from California and I 'm a bit worried about acclimating in order to truly enjoy Cuzco . What recommendations do you have ? Also , many have stated to be cautious while in Peru due to the high volume of thieves did you have any negative experiences while there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cuzco and Lima ? Thank you for taking the time to read and reply to my post . <p> Hi Vanessa , Just saw your comment and I am guessing you are already in Peru ! Sorry for the delay . Regarding the altitude , the biggest thing is to take it easy and drink loads of water . Altitude effects everyone differently , when we flew into Cuzco I was fine but my husband got sick . We had altitude medication from our travel doctor that he was able to take and then he slept it off and was fine by dinner . So it all depends . Cuzco will be the highest place you visit on your itinerary , MP is quite lower so you should have no issues there other than shortness of breath if you do any type of hiking or lots of walking . We did n't  have any issues with theft in Cuzco or Lima , but we were vigilant . That 's the best you can do , do n't  dress flashy , do n't  have a fancy purse , make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straps , etc ) and that will deter thieves . Make sure you walk the markets in Cuzco , they are so charming and the locals are lovely with smiles . Enjoy Peru and let me know how it went when you got back- you can contact me directly via our website. = Cheers ! <p> I totally agree with you that Peru is worth visiting also in only 10 days ! My boyfriend and I were there in April for 3 weeks but already in the 1st week we 've seen so many beautiful places . We could go home after the first week and we would be satisfied ! Actually I came to a conclusion if you like a destination which is a bit more far away and you do n't  have that much time , do n't  think , just go there . You 'll see it is worth it ! You experience 1000-times more as you would probably in 1 month back home working . I wrote about our unforgettable journey to Peru and Bolivia here : http : //bit.ly/1pXHZyG <p> You are so right ! ! Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally worth while . We just visited Tibet while in China and we were only able to stay a week because of the travel restrictions and permits but it was SO worth it ! One of the best places we have been to date . Great comment , travel on ! <p> I have reviewed Peru for its cultural , historical value wise how to get there and how to live their for months . Necessary information I got from your blog and helpfull a lot in the terms of where to stay and eat . Thank You Lina . <p> Hi Kaira , While I certainly felt the altitude , I did n't  have any issues with it . However , my husband had a slow time adjusting and needed to take Diamox on the first day we arrived in Cusco . He seems to have troubles with altitude as we just went to Everest Base Camp and I again had very limited issues and he needed Diamox . Its good to have your travel doc prescribe that if you are worried about it and do n't  forget sunscreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hi Brittany , We booked everything in advance as they sell out , especially during high season . As it was , we still did n't  get all the best flight deals because we waited too long and most of the promo fares were sold out . <p> Thank you for your blog post , its inspired us to pursue a travel to Peru and has been quite valuable in our planning ! I do have one question : Is there a place where you stored your belongings while you hiked around the Sacred Valley and Ollantaytambo ? We are thinking of going the same route but did n't  know how to hike while safely storring our luggage for the hike . Thank you ! <p> We stored our bags at the hostel we stayed at in Cuzco . We had a booking for after we returned from the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu , so they held our bags at no cost and we packed into smaller bags for our time away . Worked out well . <p> I love your suggestions , and will probably follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I have is about the " $1,279 on tours that included 4 nights of accommodation . " Was this at the Wasai Tambopata Lodge ? If so , which package did you do ? I cant find anything even close to $1279 , especially including lodging ! <p> Not sure if the numbers are right : <p> $1,020 getting to Peru ( this is each , correct ? ) $700 on inter-country flights $115 on 4 nights of accommodation $1,279 on tours that included 4 nights of accommodation ( each ? ) <p> That would be like $3200 each , not for both . I 'm just trying to figure out what I 'm missing , because I 'd love to mimic this trip ! Thanks , any advice you have would be awesome . <p> Hi Erin , Yes , those numbers are total , for both of us . We did a 4 day adventure package that included lodging with the Wasai Tambopata lodge . We booked directly with them through their website . I do n't  think you can book on the website , but you have to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We actually did n't  spend the whole $1279 on the amazon portion either , we spent around $100 on a private Sacred Valley hike too . It is possible that the prices have changed as they have become more popular , that often happens . It is worth it though as you will have an amazing experience . Hope this helps , feel free to email me directly if you have further questions . email protected <p> Hi Lina , Your review is so user-friendly and gave an overall picture of Peru . I am an avid traveler and like to explore new places . I live in the US . I am planning a trip to Peru in the last week of March for 8-9 days . I have 2 kids ( 8 and 4 ) . What 's your thoughts of Peru travel with kids . I definitely want to go see Macchu Pichu and will land first in Lima . What do you recommend ? Amazon Rain forest of Lake Titicaca . <p> Hi Andy , Well , we did n't  do Lake Titicaca simply because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had our hearts set on the Amazon , which is an amazing experience . So it will depend on your desires , but something to take into consideration during your planning is the altitude at Lake Titicaca and how you and your children might adjust . It is much higher than Cuzco and many people find they need several days of acclimation to visit there . Just something to consider . The Amazon experience we had with Wasai would be suited to your children if you went that route . <p> Hi Alanna , We used Wasai and it was an amazing experience . 100% recommend them and we are planning a return visit when we are back in Peru in 2016 . They have a variety of packages and just redid their website , so it is really user friendly now . http : //www.wasai.com . Have a look and ENJOY PERU !

In Peru , there are many sites to visit and know I can help with that , I 'm a Tour Guide on Cusco Peru and I have a lot of experiences with people that visit us . I design packages around Peru , in Cusco , i organized trekking to Machupicchu , adventure to Machupicchu . You can find all sorts of information at http : //www.inkaltitude.com and contact me . I can also design packages according to their requests . I hope I can help people who want to know Peru and Machu Picchu ! ! <p> Do you think that it would be better to go Lima-Ballestos Islands-Nazca -Arequipa/Colca Canyon-Puno-Cuzco-Puerto Maldonado-Lima or to fly to Puerto Maldonado from Lima and then Cuzco and try and do this route in reverse ? <p> I love this blog there are some places I could not see because I had no time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titicaca and the Nazca Lines . At first I felt a little frustrated because I had no clear idea how to make this trip , finally looking a bit able to find an agency with very good recommendations online , so I encourage to seek their assistance . They were great and arranged everything , the team very professional and totally commendable http : //www.perutravel.pe Trippers Peru was incredible . The guides are passionals , they love their work . There are a few dostic flight airlines Like http : //www.lan.com or avianca.com and the train I used was http : //www.perurail.com I do n't  remmenber ver well the name of the Buses to Nazca but it was also good enough Next time I will go to Galapagos Islands and I Hope to Uyuni in Bolivia <p> A few years ago my daughter and I were lucky enough to spend 4 weeks in Ecuador and Peru . We had a broad plan but most of the time were making it up as we went along , sometimes using overnight buses to save on time and hotel bills . That way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked or disliked . For instance we got off one bus and straight on to the next in Lima as it was cold , damp and not inviting whilst we spent an extra two days in Arequipa , relaxing and re-charging our batteries . A beautiful place with views of El Misti volcano . We ran out of time to do the jungle trek but saw so many other wonders it did not really matter . When each day you have laughed , cried and gasped in amazement you know you 've had a good trip . <p> Hii Lina , Great post and gorgeous shots captured by you ! I also had the same misconception regarding exploring Peru . I am alba I have beautiful vacation home rent property If anyone is plan to trip than book our rental house http : //goo.gl/unUufK <p> If you come back someday , you must visit the lake Titikaka and the Colca canyon , both are amazing places and you will have really good homestay experience .

I am trying to get extra money for my wedding sojust drop me an email if you think this could work for you . My english is good enough since I studied in the US . <p> I wanted to mention that to reach Machu Picchu on a journey of adventure is not only the Classic Inca Trail that their spaces sell out in advance , but there are other alternative Inca trails to reach like Inca Jungle trail biking and hiking , Salkantay trek , lares trek . <p> Wow ! You guys had such a great time without spending a lot of money . I love to do budget travel . It helps one to completely enjoy the trip without being stressed out about all the money being spent . So , do you think 6 days would be enough for traveling Peru ? <p> Wow , what a nice trip . But personnally I believe that 10 days for Peru is just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do you know that in the northern regions there is so much more to see ? <p> On the coasts you have the archaeological sites of pre-inca civilisations , like the adobe city of Chan Chan , UNESCO world heritage site , or the Museum of Tumbas Reales , one of the best museums in South America . In the Andes in North Peru , you have the civilisation of the Chachapoya with the fortress of Kuelap ( also called the Machu Picchu of the North = ) of the Sarcophagi of Karajia , absolutely stunning . <p> That is a very nice itinerary . I was working as s tour guide around Peru for over 25 years . There is the option to see a little more from Peru in 10 days . Perus infrastructure continue improving , there are better roads , more flight companies with connection to almost every part of the Andes and the Amazon Jungle . You can find unnumbered trails hiking , mountain biking and other adventure activities . With the suggestion below , you will be able to explore part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machu Picchu and the rain forest . Day 1 : Flight to Lima at any time during the day . Day 2 : Flight to Arequipa Day 3 : Colca Cayon Day 4 : Colca Canyon Puno Day 5 : Lake Titicaca Day 6 : Bus to Cusco with guided tours . Day 7 : Cusco day off Day 8 : Sacred Valley Agua Calientes Day 9 : Machu Picchu Day 10 : Flight to Lima and home <p> You can add 4 more days and visit the Amazon jungle Nazca Lines and Huacachina . One very important tip is food in Lima , there are plenty of restaurants that are ranked between the best restaurants in the world with exquisite dishes and the best cheap prices . <p> Something You should considerate to visit now a days is the new 1 day trek to RAINBOW MOUNTAIN , It is 3hr. far from cusco . there are different travel companies you can travel with and a exellent one is INKA ALTITUDE , I hight recommend have a day trip to this area , YOU WILL LOVE IT . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip for a couple with 10 days as well and this has answered so many questions .

I know this is a long time since your post was published but it just came up as I was searching for example itineraries . Have one question where did you leave your luggage as you traveled by train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes to stay there for the night ? The weight limit on the train is 15 lbs . How do people end up taking any of their luggage ? <p> Hi Alison , We left our luggage in Cuzco when we traveled into the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu . Just packed into small bags . It was much easier and the hostal we stayed at stored our bags for free and saved us a room for the night when we returned . Worked great .

Weve picked 10 reasons why you should already be planning your trip to Portland . <p> Once considered the less exciting sibling of San Francisco and Seattle , Portland , Ore. , has evolved into much more than just a city . Today , it is a utopian symbol of the possibilities of urban living in the 21st century " affordable , friendly , environmentally conscious and full of epicurean delights <p> Named one of Amtraks 10 best places to visit in 2014 , Portland , Ore. , is dotted with tons of sights ( big and small ) that are within walking distance of the train station !

That place is Portland , Oregon . <p> One of the reasons Portland has been talked about in travel circles in recent years has to do with the food cart culture . It 's impossible to keep track of how many carts are in operation in Portland at any given time , but there are at least 500 food carts throughout the city serving up dishes from all over the world .

In its place was a dedication to the things that really matter : hearty food and drink , cultural pursuits both high and low , days in the outdoors and evenings out with friends .

Kids here love the outdoors in its leafy summertime brilliance and its wintry , puddle-soaked glory .

So far , our favorite place has been Multnomah Falls and visiting a different brewery every weekend . 
@@21820683 @1820683/ <h> What to Do in Bodrum Turkey <p> As part of our- city guides- series , we interviewed Roving Jay- who has- been traveling to the Bodrum Peninsula for the past 4 years <p> Jay shares with us her insider tips on the best things to do in Bodrum , Turkey + best places to eat , stay , drink , and explore . <p> Bodrum Castle at Sunset <h> Why Visit Bodrum Turkey ? <p> The Bodrum Peninsula is located on the western coast of Turkey , and has a distinctly European feel . <p> Its fringed with a crystal clear stretch of the Aegean , and is only 20 minutes to the nearest Greek Island of Kos . To me , the Bodum Peninsula is a multi-dimensional gem ; you just have to venture below the surface to discover it . <p> Sure Gumbet caters to the 18-30 party crowd ; Turkbuku has been touted in the NY Times as Turkeys San Tropez and attracts the glitterati from Istanbul and various European cities ; and Turgutreis caters to the British expat community by serving variations of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bodrum has a long history ; in-fact the Father of history , Herodotus , was born here . Bodrum is also the location of one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world , and is now home to one of the most prestigious Museums of Underwater Archeology , which is housed in the renovated Bodrum Castle . <p> In the tourist hubs , there are also plenty of eating , shopping and entertainment options . But , during my trips , I like to step off the well-trodden path ; explore the back streets ; and immerse myself in daily interactions and activities with the locals . <h> Things to See and Do in Bodrum <p> Kick start your stay by adjusting your mindset , and easing yourself into Bodrums pace of life . <p> Paradise Cove " Cennet Koy " Golkoy <h> Day Boat Trip on the Bodrum Peninsula <p> Every coastal destination on the Bodrum Peninsula offers a selection of day boat trips . There 's an experience to match your needs ; you just have to make a little bit of effort to select the right one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agents where you could be squashed on a party boat for 70 , and served a mediocre lunch. - Instead , head down to your local boat harbour ( before 10am or after 6pm ) and find one of the smaller , independently run boats . <p> Find a boat that takes a maximum of 10-12 passengers , and offer a relaxing excursion via wind and sails to propel you through the Aegean . Guaranteed you 'll decompress from your travels , and pick up some good local recommendations from the Captain and fellow passengers . <p> Siesta Boat in Bitez Harbour <p> One of my favourite recommendations is a trip aboard the Siesta , which is moored in Bitez . Lunch was a fresh selection of traditional Turkish meze , followed by Kofe kebabs , cooked fresh on the BBQ . Captain Zariff makes sure that each of his passengers enjoys their day he s a fabulous host . <h> Turkish Bath ( Hamam ) <p> Most of the bigger hotels have Turkish Bath facilities , offered as part of their spa services . There 's also a couple of independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my favourite hamam is one used by the locals . <p> You 'll find the Bardak+- Hamam situated down one of the back streets of Bodrum . It dates back to the mid-1700s , and is the oldest Hamam in the area . Just look past the unassuming exterior and step inside for a memorable Turkish Bath experience . <p> Exterior of the oldest Turkish Bath in Bodrum <p> This is no Spa experience ! The interior is basic and small , and men and women share the Hot Room area . There 's no standing on ceremony , and the service can see a bit rough and abrupt you may even feel like you 've had a turn in a spin-cycle at the end of it . <p> But the massage is rigorous , adept and appropriate . Out of all the Turkish Baths I 've had in the local area and Istanbul , the Bardak+- Hamam is the best . <h> Tour Bodrum Castle <p> 40 years ago this castle was in ruins , but today its fully renovated and stands proudly in the centre of Bodrum Bay . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated vantage point allows for great views of the surrounding area . <p> Bodrum Castle view of the town <h> Best Neighborhoods to Explore in Bodrum <p> Some visitors are drawn to the activity and vibrancy of Bodrum town , where you 're spoilt for choice with its ancient sights , its shopping , as well as its restaurants , bars and clubs . <p> But just walk down any of its cobbled back-streets , and you 'll find small restaurants that cater to the local Turkish crowd . Here , you 'll get more for your money as well as a relaxing and authentic dining experience . <p> At the inland villages of Derekoy and Dagbelen you may stand out as one of the few English speaking visitors , and it may be a challenge to order a tea the way you like it , but they both offer a local slice of Turkey , where life is unhurried , and the immediacy of todays modern existence dip slowly out of view like a waning sunset . <p> Gundogan Beach <h> Best places to Eat in Bodrum <h> Kebabs <p> Mention Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , post-pub encounters with a doner kebab as it oozes meat juices down your wrist . <p> The local Turkish version is a lot more appetizing and delicious . A popular kebab is the Tuvak ( Chicken ) Doner , and you 'll see the kebab stands at all of the local towns . <p> In Bodrum , there 's a good selection on offer along Ataturk Cad. ( which runs parallel to the bay ) , a firm favourite is Akyol Bufe . <p> In Turgutries there 's also lots of options , especially around the area close to the location of the Saturday farmers market . This photo below shows the front of Zeyno , which serves a succulent and flavourful chicken wrap for 3.50TL . <p> Chicken Doner Kebab shop Turgutreis <h> Turkish Breakfast <p> Try a local restaurant for a traditional Turkish breakfast of salty cheese and olives , served with flavourful tomatoes , and other seasonal local product , all served with fresh bread and homemade local jams and preserves . <p> A tranquil setting for breakfast in Yalikavak is Gulten Abla . The restaurant is a converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , and is a relaxing place to kick start your day . <p> Turkish Breakfast at Gulten Abla in Yalikavak <h> Lokantas for Lunch <p> If you 're looking for a quick and cheap lunch , head to a local lokanta for a peasant lunch of a bowl of white beans and salad . There 's usually no menu , and quite often not a lot of English spoken , but the homemade food is cheap and tasty . <p> For a great location , that 's open long hours , and always seems to attract the locals , visit Dalgi+in G++m+++l++k . <h> Meze for Dinner <p> A traditional dinner in this area of Turkey , starts with a selection of cold meze , followed by hot meze , a salad and then your choice of fish . <p> To be honest , when the weathers hot , I much prefer ordering a selection of different meze for dinner. - Some of my favourites are Fava ( mashed white beans with , oil , garlic and lemon ) and bit like hummus ; hydari , made with thick Turkish yogurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a popular base for meze dishes ; mashed aubergine and yogurt and garlic ; or chopped with fresh , sweet tomatoes , and red chili pepper . You 'll find that yogurt , garlic and olive oil are popular meze ingredients . <p> Waiting for the sunset at the Limon Cafe Gumusluk <p> One of the restaurants offering the largest servings of flavour-packed meze is the Limon Cafe , G++m+++l++k which offers a fairytale hillside setting for watching the sun set . <p> Another favourite is Myhane in Kadikalesi , where the garden setting amid citrus trees is a perfect location to enjoy their traditional Turkish music on a Saturday night . <h> You Ca n't Visit Bodrum Without Eating <h> G+zleme <p> Many of the local lokantas serve G+zleme , but I think it tastes more delicious when bought at a local farmers market , and you snack on it as you wander around . <p> G+zleme are made from large , paper thin circles of dough ; filled with any mixture of cheese , vegetables and meat ; then folded and cooked on a dome shaped griddle . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onion and white cheese . <p> G+zleme are very filling , and will keep your hunger at bay . They 're the ultimate Turkish street food . <p> Gozleme for sale at Yalikavak market <h> Best places to Drink in Bodrum <p> You should try a Turkish Coffee , even if its just once . But do n't  head to a tourist cafe and pay 6TL for the experience . Instead , opt for one of the local Belediyesi ( municipal ) cafes , and sample a Turkish coffee where the locals drink , and itll only set you back about 1.50-2TL . <p> Many of the towns like Bodrum , Gumbet and Turgurtreis have a " Bar Street " , offering a noisy array of bars and clubs to party the night away . You can even visit the local Marina Bars for high price cocktails . <p> But I much prefer a beach-front table , to watch the sun go down whilst enjoying an ice cold local Efes Pilsen beer . <p> Watching the sunset over Yalikavaks Marina <h> Places for a Night on the Town in Bodrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unforgettable night of partying . But if you 'd prefer to go offshore ; both Bodrum and Turgutreis offer glass-bottomed catamaran night clubs , where you can party til dawn with a view of the Aegean at your feet . <h> Best Markets and Shopping in Bodrum <p> Each town and village has a weekly farmers market , and the larger locations also have a pazaar section that includes fake designer clothes , textiles , house wares and tourist trinkets . <p> The craft markets stalls of G++m+++l++k and Yalikavak , offer unique hand made crafts that are better quality and more unique than the mass produced items available in a lot of the shops . Especially those in the tourist trap areas . <h> Major Events and Festivals in Bodrum <p> Turgutreis and Yalikavak have their own small amphitheatres , and Bodrum holds events in Bodrum Castle and also in the renovated ancient amphitheatre situated in the hills above Bodrum , which has sweeping views of the Bay and its Castle . <p> View of Bodrum Bay from the Amphitheatre <p> Another popular Classical International Music Event is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the dolmus station . <p> The grounds are opened up for overflow seating , and its a relaxed setting for a months worth of classical performances . <h> Getting Around Bodrum <p> The cheapest way to travel between the different towns and villages on the Peninsula is by Dolmu+ . These small passenger vans zip between locations with convenient frequency . <p> As this is also the standard mode of transport for the village locals , the dolmu+ can get packed , but that 's all part of the adventure . <p> Dolmus local transport heading to Bitez <p> During peak season , the dolmu+ start early in the morning and run to early the next morning . Each town has a central dolmu+ station and you can flag one down anywhere along its route . <p> Fares and routes are posted on the windscreen , and you pass your money to the driver via the other passengers change comes back the same way . <h> Is Bodrum WiFi friendly <p> Most of the restaurants and bars in the tourist hubs have WiFi , as do the hotels . Plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to use the free WiFi . <p> Most of the larger towns have Internet Cafes , and its only 1 or 2 TL for an hour . <h> Best Time of Year to Visit Bodrum <p> Although the peak season in July and August , and the weather can top 100f/38c degrees , the larger towns like Bodrum can become an unpleasant crush of tourists , especially in its pedestrian shopping areas . <p> Instead , I 'd recommend visiting during one of the season-shoulder months of June or September , when its still hot , but the crowds have thinned and the public transport is still regular , but not as packed . <p> Pedestrian shopping area of Bodrum during the season <h> Favorite Bodrum Side trip <p> Day trips are touted in all of the tourist hubs . One of the most popular is a day trip to Ephesus . Its a 3 hour journey in each direction , and there 's an excursions that will get you there and back in a day , giving you 1/2 day to tour this ancient Greek site . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rented a car , and stayed overnight in the nearby town of Selcuk , and then spent a leisurely morning touring Ephesus , and stopped off at a local Kusadasi beach on the way back to Bodrum . <p> Ruins of the Library of Celsus at Epheses <p> If you 'd prefer to tour ancient ruins a little bit closer to the Bodrum Peninsula , on the other side of the Milas-Bodrum airport is the ancient city of Iassos , and in the hills above Bodrum , is the ancient city of Pedesa . <p> While neither of these are in the same league as Ephesus , theyll get you your ancient-site fix . You can hike up to Pedesa from Bodrum , but you 'll need a car for Iassos and that trip will take you about 90 minutes from Bodrum . <p> But that being said my favourite full day away from the Peninsula , has to be a boat trip . <h> Getting There and Away <h> By Air <p> The Milas-Bodrum airport has been newly renovated , and during the season , there 's a number of cheap package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most established Turkish Airlines is Pegasus , and of course there 's Turkish Airlinesoffering scheduled flights from an expansive list of locations . <p> If you 're flying in from other Turkish cities , like Istanbul or Izmir , there 's a couple of good options for domestic carriers ; Onurair and Atlasjet . <h> By Road <p> One of the national companies is Metro Turizm and they have lots of routes spanning the entire country . Another popular company that services the Aegean region is- Pamukkale . <p> Small local Ferry <h> By Sea <p> Turkish and Greek ferry companies service Bodrum and Turgutureis . You can arrive via one of the Greek Islands of Kos , Rhodes and Kalymnos . Depending on the season , frequency of routes will vary , and different services are offered via ; Bodrum Express Lines , Ye+il Marmaris Line and Bodrum Ferry Boat . <p> Bodrum is also a Cruise-line destination welcoming waves of day trippers , and is also a busy port of call for those enjoying a Blue Cruise on a traditional locally charted gullet or on their own personal yacht . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insiders tip for Bodrum , Turkey ? <p> On the surface , the Bodrum Peninsula may seem like a high-priced tourist trap pandering to the cruise line crowd ; the all-inclusive holiday-makers ; and the city-dwellers , looking for some beach-action . <p> But at any of the coastal locations , you do n't  have to venture very far from the main thoroughfares to find good local businesses , with non-tourist prices . <p> Many of the excursions offered by the Travel Agents so prevalent in the tourist areas , can actually be arranged independently by using the local dolmu+ service , and a sense of adventure . This approach not only saves you money , but adds flexibility to your schedule . <h> I love Bodrum because <p> It is heaving crowds , squashed into narrow cobbled streets haggling for bargains ; but its also sparse farmers markets milling with locals . <p> It is sipping expensive cocktails in open-air night clubs , pumping dance music til dawn ; and its enjoying a harbour-side cup of Turkish Coffee , as the fisherman survey the landscape at dawns early light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you visit the Bodrum Peninsula , you have two choices : Either it comes at you full force and you just let it just wash over you ; or you go in search of its other , quieter side , and eek-out the memories you 're in search of . <p> I 'm a frequent visitor to the Bodrum Peninsula , and each time I visit , I always manage to unearth some new little gem lying in wait for me . <h> More Resources for Bodrum , Turkey <p> Roving Jay writes and publishes the on-line Bodrum Peninsula Travel Guide , and her first ebook " Bodrum Peninsula Travel Guide : Discover Turkeys Aegean Gem " will be released on Amazon in Spring 2013 . Jays had a 4 year love affair with this corner of Turkey , and keeps the memories alive by writing about her adventures and sharing her local knowledge with other visitors to the area . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Always thought that Bodrum was like one of those Spanish towns on the Costas . You knowan over-developed tourist trap with high rise hotelsneed to take another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great list ! Thank you for sharing this article . I think Bodrum is a great place to visit ! I found kebabs so delicious , Very tempting foods = I will be back in Turkey this summer and I cant wait to see its ancient beauty again . Also , I suggest you must try visiting ancient sites in Kas and Side Two cities are very different one is more touristy and both have great Roman ruins sites . Read this blog I found helpful too http : //www.gonomad.com/5658 <p> I think this area of Turkey has learnt from the mistakes of other resort towns , by putting laws in place to stop development of tall buildings , and to make sure some areas remain un-developed . <p> Let 's hope they keep it this way . The 100 year anniversay of Ataturks New Turkey is in 2023 and in 2003 Turkey began working on their 20 year tourist development plan in anticipatation of this event . Over the 4 years I 've been visiting this area , Ive seen so many changes ; roads being developed ; sign-posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just hope they know where to stop ! <p> You only have to visit the Costa Del Sol in Spain to see why Turkey should stop at some point before they ruin it ! The charm of this area of Turkey is that it still HAS charm , and that its not just row upon row of high-rise apartments and hotels squeeze between McDonalds and other chains . <p> Luckily the Turkish government is cracking down on huge big resorts gobbling up the local beaches , and some are even being knocked down because they did n't  get proper planning permission . <p> Hi Jan if you 're looking for more information about some of the other towns and villages in the area , I publish free Quick Reference Travel Guides which are in pdf format and are great from printing out , or just saving to your mobile device . <p> Bodrum is a convenient central location for navigating the peninsula . Head to the dolmus station in the centre of town , and you 'll be able to hop on a local bus for cheap . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many nights ) I should look to spend in Bodrum ? I am visiting Turkey in May with my girlfriend . Great to know that I could do the Ephesus excursion from Bodrum . I was going to do it from Selcuk but this sounds great too . <p> That 's a little bit harsh ! Bodrum is a bit of a crush during peak summer months , but its a year round destination and in the shoulder months , it reverts back to its former , mellow self . You can use Bodrum as a base for exploring the rest of the peninsula , and there 's lots of options for getting away from the tourist traps and exploring a more authentic side of Turkey . <p> What a fantastic post . Loved how I can find all the answers in one place . Thanks for sharing , Jay . Booked my holidays to Bodrum in September and now can not wait to go . Will read more of your published material and will be very grateful for all your efforts . <p> Thanks for the lovely comments Marina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of year to visit .

Always good to share other peoples perspective on my site . thanks , Jay <p> Dear Roving Jay , thank u very very much for such amazing infos . My husband and I spent a month in Turkey during our honeymoon back in 2003. now we r going back for our 10th anniversary with our 3 year old and 6 month old babies = I need your help to pick a right place to stay.last time the hotel was at the top of a hill in the city center.this time we r looking for a nice location which has both access to a nice beach and still close to a city.should we stay at the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi , great insight ! I will be flying into bodrum in October 2015 for our honeymoon ! Looking for somewhere to stay that is n't ridiculously expensive but suitable for the first few nights as a married couple . Would like something with a bit of character but still able to get room service , serve alcohol and have a good view . <p> Were ex par Brits living in Durban SA and visiting Bodrum/Souh Turkey in Sep 2015 for +/-3weeks . Allowing 1 night in Istanbul then 2 nights in Bodrum we plan to grab this part of the planet with both hands . Choices are numerous but what appeals most if dumping the hire car and cruising the coast for +/- 2weeks . Can someone please recommend a reasonable charter company ? <p> Anyone who wants to visit Bodrum should also visit Marmaris and Fethiye ( from fethiye take a tour to Saklikent. this place looks like a heaven , it is between Mu-la and Antalya but very easy to go from Fethiye ) .

There are also museums , art galleries and churches to visit .

These are no ordinary potatoes but special varieties of small , - floury tubers , grown in the Canary Islands . <p> They are served with mojos , - Canarian sauces made with cilantro or red peppers . <h> Where to Drink in Santa Cruz de Tenerife , <p> No one bar- stands out . In Santa Cruz head for Avendia Anaga after dark to cruise the- clubs and bars . During the day , shuttered up , they look abandoned , but- change character completely when the lights come on . <p> La Laguna is a- university town , so there are plenty of reasonably-priced bars all around . <h> Where to Stay in Santa Cruz de Tenerife <p> Of course when you live in a place , you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only hotel I 've stayed in is the very chic- Iberostar- Grand Mencey , which somehow blends modern , luxury minimalism with a- colonial feel , and which I loved ! I would n't hesitate to recommend it . <p> A- friend stayed in city-center hotel Silken- Atlantidaearlier this year and pronounced it excellent too . <h> Markets and Shopping- in Santa Cruz de Tenerife <p> The Market- of Nuestra Se+ora de Africa for sure , to buy the best of the islands- produce bananas , tomatoes , papaya and other fruit , not to mention those wee potatoes and yummy goats cheeses . <p> Market of Nuestra Se+ora de Africa <p> For gifts ? The Canary Islands has- been famous for wine- since the 17th century Shakespeare was a huge fan , no kidding . He- mentions " a- cup of Canary " in several of his plays ! <p> You can also buy artisan olive- oils , those mojo sauces , local honey and jams , and lotions and other- beauty products made from aloe vera , which grows all over the island . <p> The- Canary Islands have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be duty- free , and that 's not strictly true now , but you can certainly buy- perfumes , booze and tobacco cheaper than on mainland Europe , though- obviously you need to check how much you can take into wherever youre- going back to . <h> Major Events and Festivals- in Santa Cruz de Tenerife <p> No doubting what springs to my mind first Carnival . Its claimed that Santa- Cruzs Carnaval in the couple of weeks leading up to Lent is second- only to Rio de Janeiro in size . Its one long , crazy , chaotic , fun-filled- party. - It would take me an entire post to do it justice . <p> The best I can- say briefly is that it is the colourful , noisy , costumed event you imagine- it to be ! <p> Other than that there is the Heineken Jazz Festival in July , - which includes some free concerts . <p> August is a bit like one- long fiesta too , when terrazas de verano ( summer terraces ) open. - These are temporary bars which set up just for hottest weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to while away those sleepless nights . <p> In La Laguna there is a famous romeria , - a traditional fiesta which is something like a cross between a harvest- festival and May Day celebrations . <p> family trad dress Romeria <p> Folk groups , singers , dancers , farmers with their huge-eyed oxen , herds of- goats , the odd goose or puppy take part , and everyone in traditional- dress , including many of the onlookers . <h> Getting Around Santa Cruz de Tenerife <p> Both cities are very walkable . Although this is a mountainous island , - slopes are fairly gentle , even in La Laguna , which is- around 2,000 ft above sea level . <p> There are excellent bus services to other- parts of the island , and a zillion taxis . <p> The two cities are connected by- a modern tramway which blends surprisingly well with the historical- surroundings when it passes through those areas . <h> Is Santa Cruz WIFI friendly ? <p> A huge swathe of Santa Cruz city centre is- actually a wifi zone set up by the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping away . La Laguna , as I said , is a- university town , so facilities there are excellent too . <h> Best Time of Year to Visit Santa Cruz , Tenerife <p> In one sense any time . Winters are very mild , shirt-sleeves by day , a- jacket by night . Although La Laguna is- cooler because its much higher , even so , the worst it gets is like an- Autumn day in England , say . <p> If you do n't  want all the noise of Carnaval- avoid Shrove Tuesday week at all costs . <p> Low season here is May/June and- November/early December- and there are cheap flights around , but the- trouble with low season is that sometimes you find restaurants have taken- the month off . <p> Hottest time- is late July/August/early September when temperatures can get up to 40-C- so if you do n't  like it hot avoid summer . Its also the busiest time , of- course , during the school holidays . <h> Favourite Side Trip Away From the City <p> The Teide National- Park absolutely ! Another UNESCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds third largest volcano- measured from the ocean bed , at 3,713 m Mount Teide is- the highest mountain in Spain and in winter you will- often find it covered in snow , despite this being a sub-tropical climate . <p> The parks volcanic landscapes are sensational , and although its pretty- barren-looking , there is flora which grows nowhere else on earth in the- wild . I love to see the expressions on peoples face when I take them up- there . The most-used adjectives are lunar or surreal . <p> Its also an- interesting drive , through pine forests . Often you emerge above cloud- level , to look down on clouds as you would from a plane , and see- Mt Teide rising above it all impressive . <h> Getting Here and Away <p> From Europe is pretty easy .

@@21820691 @1820691/ <h> What to Do in Cologne , Germany <p> As part of our city guides- series , we interviewed Melvin Boecher who has lived in Cologne for a period of 8 years . <p> Melvin shares with us his tips on things to do in Cologne for those looking for the best places to see , eat , stay , drink , and explore . <h> Why visit Cologne ? <p> Cologne is an open-minded city . Its maybe not as beautiful at first look like other cities , but when you walk around , you 'll see that its one of the nicest cities in Germany . <p> The Altstadt ( old town ) has some very nice buildings , which lie right at the river Rhine . Just next to it is the Cologne cathedral , a UNESCO world heritage site . Its worth the climb up into one of the two towers . <p> Cologne is about the atmosphere and its people . People in Cologne love their city . They have their own dialect and quite a few music bands who sing about the city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be able to understand a word . Its quite a unique music scene . <h> What to do in Cologne <p> There is no way around it , you have to visit a brewery . You 'll sit down and get a K+lsch ( Cologne beer ) right away without asking for it . At the very moment its empty , you 'll get a new one without asking for it , until you put your beer mat on top of your glass . <p> Another highlight is of course the cathedral . You should climb the 386 steps to the top . After that , walk across the railroad bridge and there you 'll find the perfect picture of Cologne . <p> The bridge and the cathedral . Maybe wait for sunset or even a bit more until the cathedral and bridge are lighted . That would make a great photo . <p> You should also walk through Z++lpicher Strasse towards outter city from Z++lpicher Platz . There are many bars . My tip is Stiefel . Its a real rock bar . Graffiti on the walls , pool billiard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Getting around Cologne <p> I love walking and Cologne is easy to walk . But there is also a very good public transport system with many trams and busses . <p> People in Cologne also love to ride bicycles and I would recommend to do so as well . There are pretty much cycle paths everywhere , so its safe to ride . <p> The city life is pretty much on the Eastern side of the river Rhine . Youll have the old town in the centre at the river and then you 'll see 2-3 rings around the city . That way its very easy to find your way around . <p> Relax by the river <h> Any wine Regions to visit in Cologne ? <p> For a day trip , if you have a car , I would recommend you drive to the river Mosel , which is about a 40 minutes drive . <p> Its a little river , set in a very beautiful valley . There you 'll find one of the top wine regions of the world ! <p> German wine might not be as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first class . Even if you do n't  like drinking wine , you should consider heading there . There are many walking paths and the scenery alone is worth it ! <h> Where to Stay in Cologne <p> I personally have n't stayed in these properties myself , but they come recommended : <p> For more places to stay in Cologne choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com . You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Markets and shopping in Cologne <p> You 'll find some nice shops in Ehrenstrasse , but in recent years more and more chains have opened their , which has destroyed the atmosphere a bit . But its still worth going there ! <p> Friesenstrasse and Hohe Strasse are the main shopping streets . You 'll find pretty much everything there . <p> Small boutiques are pretty much everywhere around the inner city , surrounded by the ring with the rail tracks . Just wander through the side streets and you 'll find some good shops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experience one of the best carnivals of the world , Cologne is your spot . It might be cooler than in Rio , but the difference is that the whole city takes part . Everyoneabsolutely everyone is dressed up ! <p> We 've told that many friends from abroad and nobody has really believed us , until they experienced it . <p> There are many street carnival parades of different sizes . The biggest one is on Carnival Monday &amp; there will be huge trucks and thousands of people attending ! <p> They throw candy as big as chocolate bars . Youll have plenty of beer and you wont have it alone . Travel solo and after 5 minutes you 'll get invited by the person next to you ! <p> People sing carnival songs in the Cologne dialect and its just an amazing atmosphere ! Forget carnival in Rio , Venice or anywhere else Cologne should n't be missed , if you like carnival . <h> Favourite side trip from Cologne <p> I 've already mentioned the river Mosel above . That 's worth a trip . But you could also head East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape with many hills and old town centres . <p> Get a nav-sat , but first get lost on the small streets , before using it . <h> Best time to visit Cologne <p> Carnival is around February/March , which is really fab to experience . Otherwise I would suggest May September to visit Cologne . <p> The Christmas markets are also very special , so December might be of interest to visit Cologne as well . <p> Christmas Markets photo by Rightee <h> Getting there and away <p> It- really depends where you live . I know that an international bus service stops in Cologne , which should be a very cheap option . <p> The Cologne airport is also a base for GermanWings , a good low cost carrier . You should check rates with them . <p> Not that far away is Dusseldorf , which also has an international airport with a few low cost airlines . <h> Best insiders Tip for travel to Cologne <p> Check out couchsurfing and stay with the locals .

I recently visited Berlin , loved it and was thinking that I should explore a little more Germany . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two tiny jazz bars I know , which are really cool &amp; have that very special jazz atmosphere . One is in the Altstadt &amp; one at Barbarossaplatz . The lived just opposite of the chocolate museum for a few years . Nice spot ! The museum is fine , too . They even have a huge chocolate fountain where you can eat from . = <p> Cologne got the biggest gay scene with Berlin of Germany . It pretty much describes the kind of folks you meet . They are easy going and open minded . I have n't been to the Gay Games , but am sure that the Cologne carnival is even better ! Its truly one of the best in the world ! Many international friends who visited us will back me up on this ! = <p> I lived a few kilometres from Cologne for a few months = ( No idea how I did n't  know Melvin was there ! ) . Loved the live music scene , the beer , and the view from the top of the Dom . Also , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at = Finally , and totally randomly , if you 're into computer games at all , then Europes largest computer gaming festival is held in Cologne every year = <p> I was at that gaming festival 2 years ago . Wow ! That was fun and loud ! It was an amazing sunny day &amp; we were inside in that noisy halls , which was n't that nice . They should have that event on rainy November days ! = <p> I loved visiting Cologne last June . Melvin has some great tips here . Climbing the tower of the cathedral is definitely a must . I enjoyed the K+lsch , too ! To add to places to stay I stayed at the Hotel Cristall on Ursulaplatz not far from the railway station &amp; the cathedral . Nice room , free wi-fi , great breakfast . <p> Melvin , I 've not been to K+ln during Karneval ; its one of the things Ive missed out . But I 've visited the place at all other times of the year . = <p> If I may , my own recommendations for K+ln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after all that drinking in the area , my go-to place is Oru+ Kebap , Kyffh+userstrasse at Heinsbergstrasse ( between U Barbarossaplatz and U Dasselstrasse/Bf S++d ) . * more t++rkisches Essen ( turkish food ) is to be found in Neustadt-Nord , just northwest of the Hauptbahnhof . Had an excellent meal at Mangal Restaurant on Weidengasse. * summer lounging and drinking at the Aachener Weiher ( U Universit+tsstrasse ) . * a walk/stroll through the park in the Ring ( that is , Innerer Gr++ng++rtel , or the inner green ring ) * R+misches-Germanisches Museum , next to the Dom . After all , there are good reasons why the place is called Colonia. * a short river cruise with K-D ( K+ln-D++sseldorfer Rheinschiffahrt ) on the Rhein is a great way to spend a sunny afternoon , too . <p> Loved Cologne , it was my hub during the 2006 World Cup and your post brought back some good memories . The Chocolate Museum is a must if you 're there for longer than 2 days , especially in the summer when you can enjoy your chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great summary of Cologne ! I love that you mentioned the Bergisches Land its where I am from = I never noticed how pretty and idyllic it is before I moved away . Another good day drip from Cologne would be to one of the many Talsperre ( lake/dam ) in the region . One of my favorites in the Aggertalsperre which is superclose to where I am from . <p> I really liked Cologne when I visited last year , and ended up extending my stay to learn some German = Some insider tips from a long-term visitor is to definitely check Kompakt Records ( if you 're into that ) and take a food tour of the S++dstadt LONG ... <p> One word for this city amazing . My boyfriend treated me to going to this wonderful city for my birthday 29 Dec 2013 and did n't  want to come home the only shame was we was n't out there for new year . People were so friendly and would talk to you in any bar . Loved the cathedral and it is a must also the chocolate factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . But the most amazing bit was the love bridge which my boyfriend surprised me with a lock to put on the bridge . Can not wait to go again this time thinking about an apartment and not a hotel any good ones xxx ps also forgot to mention the amazing food and beer unbelievable country loved every second xxxx <p> When you are in Cologne , you should n't miss to visit also Cologne Zoo , EL-DE Haus ( former headquarters of Gestapo ) , Church Gro+ Sankt Martin and museum Ludwig ( if you like art ) . I really love this city ! I hope next time I 'll have the chance to visit the Christmas markets in Cologne . <p> The Christmas season is one of the good periods . Now they have since a few years a gay Christmas Market with daily performances and specials , and close to the famous gay neighborhood .

Do your research <p> Personally I think the majority of people 's fears come from not being aware of the current situation of a destination or lack of information . <p> Let 's be honest , many people around the world are afraid of other places and cultures , even if they pretend they are n't . <p> The first time I went to the Middle East , my family went beserk even though where I was going was considered very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa , I heard over and over again about Ebola , even though there has n't been a single case there . <p> I find the best way to combat this xenophobia , for lack of a better word , is to be armed with all the facts . <p> In a nice and friendly way , I 've found it 's better to point out the truth and use it as an opportunity to educated than to just ignore it and remain frustrated . <p> In Cape Town , South Africa <h> 2 . Show that you take safety seriously when traveling <p> Another way I have been able to deal with negativity , especially from my family who worries about me , is to demonstrate to them over the years that I know what I am doing on the road and I do n't take dangerous risks and am a very safe traveler . <p> I think each time that I come back safe and sound , they worry less . <h> 3 . Stay connected when traveling <p> I think for the most part that friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are worried . <p> Maybe they do n't travel themselves much or just care about you a lot , which is something very special . I take that very seriously , and that means when I am on the road I stay in as much contact as possible with my family especially . <p> I send them my itineraries in advance , let them know when my plane lands , and send updates and messages while on the road . I know that means a lot , especially to my mom . <p> In Istanbul , Turkey <h> 4 . Be open about how you make your travels happen <p> Another cause for negativity from people might be the fact that they ca n't afford to go on the same trip or do n't even know how to go about it . <p> I know I agonized for a year before I took my first big solo trip and that was way before the days of travel blogs and online personas encouraging everyone to hit the road . <p> I ca n't stand it when people say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how I make my travels happen . <p> Whether that 's explaining on my blog now how I earn money on the road or 5 years ago when I would casually tell friends about how I saved for certain trips , I 've always been very open about how I was able to make trips happen in the hopes that it might be helpful to other people too . <h> 5 . Decide to be positive <p> Finally I think the most important thing to remember when dealing with haters or negative people about traveling is that at the end of the day it 's your life and your journey , and if you decide to not listen to them and be positive , you are going to have a great time . <h> About Liz Carlson <p> Liz Carlson 's blog Young Adventuress is about experiential travel and storytelling .

I do n't  travel a lot by myself ( usually with my hubby ) but many family and friends always seem to think " Why would you want to go there ? " I like the idea of being well informed with reasons to go , instead of not to go . Thanks for a great post . <p> Haha this is very true !

You GO , girl ! <p> This article is great , I definitely have dealt and done all of these . I love traveling solo , yes I do get the " oh my god , again ! Why do you want to go for such a long time ? " my family I know is very proud of me because I am hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling . I 've done three 7-9month working holiday overseas and love that I can have my own freedom to see the world . My family always ask me " is your vacation over yet ? Are you coming home yet ? " Ha only if they knew the stories of work places and what kind of labour jobs I 've had to do to support myself along the way . My family are n't  travellers , so for me to branch out and travel is odd to them . But to me is completely normal as I love seeing other cultures and how people live all over the world I am still trying to figure out how to work and travel permanently . <p> I totally agree on all of your points , especially on the first one . When talking to many people , I feel like doing something on their own is completely out of their comfort zone . Relying only on yourself is tough and it seems like many are n't  ready for that . For many people going on a holiday that is n't an all inclusive tripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evil and scary and why on earth would anybody do that ? Really hard to ignore such voices ! <p> I do n't  really think that travelling alone is more or less dangerous than travelling as a couple or with friends . Use common sense and be aware of what is going on around you more importantly , enjoy travelling ! <p> this is very nice to try ! I have traveled so much by myself , and EVERY TIME I still get raised eyebrows and eye rolls . But , I also get high praise for being brave , and sentiments of jealousy . So I guess it depends who you 're talking to . I personally think it 's the best way to travel ! I like this travelling = <p> This post really resonates . I think as a solo traveller you should follow your passion and go for it , but still do your due diligence and make sure the people at home wont worry too much . <p> Its also important to shrug off negativity or weird vibes WHILE you travel . Its rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple occasions taxi drivers assumed that I , a solo male from a Western country , was definitely there to see prostitutes and kept offering to take me to a red light district . Nope , just here to travel actually <p> I started travelling in my early 20ies and 30 years later I am still doing it and loving it even more and more . While my parents were open minded , I once had to face the negativity of family overseas on my first solo trip to New York . At first I did n't  ignor my uncles advice , as I knew his concern was meant to protect me . Nonetheless I still remember how terrible it all sounded and how unsecure this made me feel about my surroundings . So I picked up the phone and spoke to a distant relative who lived in the city . This contributed to restoring my confidence and enthusiasm of being there alone and wanting to explore the city by myself . Most of times negative sentiments come from people who are close to us because they worry about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and build a shelter from negativity is key . Great post ! 
@@21820694 @1820694/ <h> Should I Get a Loan Out to Travel ? Is It Okay to Travel with Debt ? <p> You know from our story that we traveled and lived for 5 years with debt . <p> But , it was good debt based on appreciating assets , and we had tenants paying off the debt via renting . We had a very clear management plan in place and were disciplined in sticking to it . <p> There 's nothing wrong with traveling with good debt , or even bad , if you have income streams to help you manage it . You have to be honest , otherwise you 'll screw yourself over . <p> When I first left to go overseas , I was 21 and had just graduated from University . I was impatient and knew I could earn money while I was gone . I did not have a lot of money in savings to leave with . I decided to get a personal loan . <p> Stupid ? Maybe . <p> Actually , I do n't recommend it , but I do n't regret it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return on that investment is infinite . <p> My ROI in growth and opportunity is way more than any stocks or property could match . It made me a better person and completely changed my life direction . Here I am 18 years later still traveling and I 've created a business around my travel passion . <p> I had a very strict management plan in place for my personal loan . <p> I did not over borrow ; my interest repayment was low , and the term of my loan small . <p> I knew once I started working I could pay it off . I had work teaching in the UK pre-arranged on a working holiday visa and I knew what my average wage would be . I 'd researched carefully to know how I could afford to live , travel and manage the debt . <p> Teaching 4th grade in London , 1997 <p> I also had my parents go as guarantors . Therefore there was no way I was going to mess up . They took a risk to support me and I would never let them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ensure you might not use this as an backup to allow for sloppiness . <p> I put enough money aside to cover the repayments for the first 5 months of my travels , which brought me to my first London pay check . I was earning British Pounds , so each month I sent home the balance owing in pounds , which at the time gave me triple the amount in Australian dollars . I paid that debt off super-fast . <p> I also worked in bars at night in London just to cover myself and to give me play and travel money . If I did n't have a guaranteed teaching job in London , I would n't have done this . ( Yet another benefit to following the working holiday strategy it gives you more options ) . <p> If you do n't have a guaranteed way to repay the loan , I do not recommend this strategy ! <p> You can see the total commitment and discipline you would need if you were to take that path . If you do not want the hassle when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a big risk . <p> I know Americans , in particular , tend to have large student loans . I do n't know what the terms are in regards to paying those down , but the same principles apply . <p> How can you travel with that debt ? What is your management plan ? What 's your back up plan if you cant pay off the debt ? <p> Be honest with yourself , arrange a plan and bring on someone to hold you accountable . <p> Tired of the money struggle ? <h> Can I still afford to travel if I own property ? <p> Congratulations on owning property . <p> There are plenty of people traveling who own property . Property ownership does not have to be a shackle . We traveled for five years successfully with two properties .

We only had to cover an extra $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to put aside money for taxes and possible maintenance . We knew wed be working on our travels so would continue to have that income flowing in . <h> Consider the following : <p> Can you rent out the property while you are gone ? <p> What are the total property costs for the year ? <p> How much of that will the rent cover ? <p> How much extra do you need to put in each month ? <p> Do you have a savings buffer for things that go wrong ( maintenance/interest rate rises ) ? <p> Can you lock in your interest rate ? <p> Do you have a great management company to take care of all the rentals , repairs and bills ? <p> Is there someone you trust at home who can sign documents on your behalf while you are gone ? <p> Can you follow a strategy like house swapping ? <p> Have a smart and strategic plan in place and then celebrate that you can have the most amazing experiences traveling while someone else pays your mortgage ? Isnt that the ultimate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop you from traveling . You can make it work . But , you must be very disciplined and focused . <p> ( Btw , just in case .

@@21820697 @1820697/ <h> 4 Anxieties You Face As a Solo Traveler and How to Beat Them <p> Leaving the comfort of friends and family back home , of all things familiar , in order to go travel alone is no easy feat . <p> For the majority of people , solo travel is an incredibly challenging decision . That being said , the rewards for going off on an adventure alone outweigh any fears you might have before leaving . <p> In my seven years of solo travel as a surprisingly nervous person and my conversations with other travelers , I have learned there are some common anxieties we all face on the road alone , and I 've put together my tips for how to beat them . <h> 1 . Eating alone <p> It can be surprisingly stressful to find yourself alone with no one for company or anyone to talk to and make decisions with . <p> I remember I used to get so anxious when I would have to check in at hostels or go and find food by myself . At least for me , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant . <p> The great thing was that after a while , you get used to it . I think for the first year I used to always get takeaway food and bring it back to wherever I was staying to eat I was so self-conscious . I got over this anxiety in two ways . <p> I forced myself to go eat out alone when I was traveling . If there was a good restaurant I wanted to try , I would go , whether or not I had someone with me . Otherwise I worked harder to make friends wherever I was staying , be more outgoing and talk to people . <p> Oftentimes I would end up out to dinner with people I just met , sharing great food and conversations with new people in an amazing place . <h> 2 . Not having any backup <p> I used to get nervous about the fact that I did n't have anyone with me in case something went wrong or if I needed help with something . This could be anything from trying to figure out where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign language , to even getting sick on the road . <p> While there is n't a simple solution to this , I found that over time I learned to be more and more self-sufficient and independent . <p> A lot of people ca n't cope with being alone , and the only way to get over it , is in fact , to be alone . I focused on the outcome , the positives that I knew would come if I learned to be more independent . <p> Luckily , this does n't take very long , and I promise even if you are only traveling solo for a weekend , by the end you 'll come out a different person . <h> 3 . Danger danger <p> While being afraid of being mugged or attacked was never at the top of my list of anxieties on the road , over the years , I am told over and over again by friends , family , and even strangers that I should be more afraid than I actually am . <p> I got over this by minimizing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , there are certain places I would n't walk alone in at night or making sure I 've organized transport from the airport when I arrive in a new place beforehand . <p> I 'm also very careful about what I reveal to strangers , often I do n't tell people straight away that I am alone and I definitely do n't say where I am staying . <p> I also always leave my plans with someone and make sure to check in often while traveling . Little things like this can go a long way in protecting yourself when you 're traveling alone . <p> Luckily , as a solo traveler , you have a lot of control over this ; i.e. you do n't always have to talk to people you do n't want to . You can be outgoing when you want to , and you can be alone when you want to . It 's great . <p> That being said , there are a few times when you will be forced to talk to people when you probably do n't really feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport . Asking for directions . Buying tickets to something . Asking someone to take your picture . It happens . <p> The easiest way to beat them ? Be super friendly and outgoing . Force yourself to smile and be approachable . Or if that does n't work , join in on a tour . Whether it 's a day tour , an activity or even a long tour , that 's one way to beat that anxiety . <p> Do you suffer from anxiety ?

Luckily , as you say , by forcing yourself it quickly gets better and its just a matter of time before the frightening situations starts being fun and rewarding . Great post ! <p> I would add the peoples face when you say you 're traveling solo . I just started a two-week vacation ( the longest Ive been by myself , though I 've traveled regurlarly ) and even some friends were shocked by the idea . Sometimes they can get in your head and mke you think stuff twice , when in reality there are zero regrets afterwards . <p> You absolutely get used to being yourself when you travel alone and its amazing how resilient and self-sufficient you become . I remember when I first headed to Central America by myself I was terrified , particularly as I did n't  speak Spanish then or know anyone there . But 2 years later , after ripping up a ticket home over a year before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working and journeying all over Latin America by myself still . I was amazed how far I 'd come in terms of the confidence I had in my own abilities and the self-motivation I 'd grown to go out and get what I really wanted in life without anyone by my side . Exhilarating ! <p> Thanks for sharing ! I have n't done solo travel in awhile and am hoping to do some soon . So far Ive been trying to " practice " while exploring the local area . Not the same but breaking the habit of avoiding eating dinner alone and taking the time to talk with those around you . <p> I can totally relate to these ! Travelling alone is n't without its obstacles but it is incredibly rewarding , particularly on a personal level when you realise all you were able to overcome by yourself , be it shyness to talk to strangers or gaining courage to eat by yourself ! <p> Hi , since I was working as a waitress in the centr of Prague seeing many tourists who just lunch or even diner ! ! alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying the moment by myself . I always think of all those peole I served , how they were super nice to me , sweet calm enjoying their travelsand act like them now : ) <p> I travelled by myself for the first time just recently . I loved the experience ! I actually found it easier to deal with these above mentioned anxieties with the thought in mind that no one around knew me nor would I be likely to ever see them again . Most people were extremely friendly , I had no problems chatting to other travellers and everyone tends to be so engrossed in their own company and activities they take little notice of a lone traveller . <p> Good points , thanks you for sharing . I totally agree that not having any backup can be tiring and overwhelming at times . I was completely surprised to find myself fighting anxiety right a few weeks ago at the beginning of my RTW trip , having done much traveling before . The idea of solo traveling for one year suddenly became reality and I started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since I had quit my job , given up my flat and sold everything I owned , there was no turning back for me at this point and I knew I had to be patient . As you suggest , it does n't  take long to overcome these fears , and only a few weeks later I could n't be any happier . In addition , to first-time solo travelers I suggest to start with shorter trips to " easy " tourist locations in order to become more confident before traveling to places with few public transport options or simply traveling during low season when its more difficult to meet fellow travelers . In case the anxiety still hits you , slowing down your pace usually works for me . <p> Just stumbled across this post Liz- How inspirational , travelling alone is definitely a scary thought but what a wonderful thing to be able to do and you 've made some great points that are sure to give those who are a little anxious- a vital push <p> Almost all of my travel is alone and the biggest challenge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird really . I love being alone but at dinner time as the sun sets and the couples come out in full force I feel almost embarrassed . LOL Im embarrassed to say I am embarrassed . bleh . It is easy for me to talk to strangers but I cant seem to move it from chatting to " let 's go for a bite to eat " . There 's usually a big age difference and if there is n't then it is the couple thing . Awkward . It does n't  stop me from travelling alone or enjoying it immensely but it is a pain . <p> Thank you for sharing these tips . I guess there is no better way but to think positive at all time . You have to be mentally prepared when you do solo travel and make sure you have a back up plans when these hassles happen . <p> I 'm sitting and writing you from Auckland New Zealand when I 'm usually from the United States . I feel as if I took a bigger bite than people usually do but here I am , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole month by myself . I 've had so many people say how inspiring it is and a handful of people look at me as if I 'm crazy . My anxiety has definitely spiked since I arrived ( lol its only my second day ) and what I realized is I feel completely scared . I 'm away from people who I personally know and love . In addition , I 'm learning that I have no control over my trip and though I can have plans I still need to learn how to live by the saying " it is what it is " . My trip is my trip and I get caught up in the thought of making sure its perfect so others can go " ohhh , ahhh " but accepting things for what it is has left me in an uncomfortable place yet given me a chance of growth . facing these anxieties is a lot of easier said than done but that 's life I feel like . <p> I 've just come across your article as I 'm due to travel to Venice in a couple of months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , but have a thirst to see the world and travel . Not the easiest combination because a part of me wants to go out there , while the other part sends me into panic and makes me want to hide away from the world .

I did a solo travel for the first time back in February when I went to the Middle East and I was surprisingly fine ! Hopefully I 'll be ok with this trip : who knows I might come back with some wonderful stories , lots of inspiration and feeling refreshed ! <p> I was googling on how to fight with my anxiety and depression for my upcoming solo trip . Its not really a solo trip , but i 'm meeting my husband across the border in 5 hours bus trip I may sound hideous , but i 'm suffering frm a severe anxiety and depression <p> Liz , cn u advice me what I should prepare for myself ? ? As I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Totally agree with all your suggestions ! I recently went on my first major trip on my own and by chance I lost my wallet . Luckily I had spare cards in a different location but it did make me realise that its nice to have someone with you so that you have each other as a backup . <p> And it definitely takes a while to get used to eating along ! But once you have done it for a while you do n't  even notice anymore and it becomes quite normal ! Also you may even get chatting to the local staff whilst sitting which is nice ! = 
@@21820698 @1820698/ <h> What to Do in Pittsburgh , PA <p> As part of our City Guides " series , we interviewed Jeremy and Angie who have been living in Pittsburgh a total of four years . <p> Jeremy and Angie- share with us their insider travel tips on Pittsburgh for those looking for the best places to see , eat , stay , drink , and explore . <h> Why visit Pittsburgh <p> As far as cities go in the Midwest USA , between New York City and Chicago there are no major " must see " tourist stops . <p> Pittsburgh is a great city halfway through for those passing by that has a great history , dozens of museums , a few of the countrys top sports teams , and is just a fun place to hang out for a day or two . <p> Whether you like sports , food , or a good view , Pittsburgh has it all . <h> What to Do in Pittsburgh <p> Our favorite highlight in Pittsburgh is taking the Duquesne Incline up to the top of Mount Washington to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , now that we actually live on Mount Washington we get the view every day . <p> Other popular attractions in the city include : <p> 1 ) Andy Warhol Museum a collection of the Pittsburgh natives most impressive works , North Shore . <p> 2 ) Phipps Conservatory - incredibly large indoor botanical gardens , butterfly sanctuary , and themed conservatory . Artwork is cycled out each quarter for new themes , and the spring flower festival is the highlight , Oakland . <p> 3 ) **25;595;TOOLONG Sports taking in a sporting event is one of the biggest prides of the city , but good luck getting through the traffic on game days , North Shore and Downtown . <h> Best Neighbourhoods to Explore n Pittsburgh <p> There are many unique neighborhoods in Pittsburgh , but here are the top three that are worth exploring depending on what you want to see . <p> 1 ) Oakland The college district of Pittsburgh . Home to Carnegie Mellon , University of Pittsburgh , and several other universities . There is always something going on in Oakland , which maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away ) . Check out the Cathedral of Learning , a lone skyscraper in the area that houses many of Pitts classes and contains themed class rooms from different time periods around the world . <p> 2 ) Mount Washington Not only is this part of Pittsburgh where we call home , Mount Washington is famous for stunning views overlooking the entire city of Pittsburgh . Take one of the two 100-year-old cable cars to the top of the mountain for some of the best views the city has to offer . The Duquesne Incline is the recommended choice of the two for better views of the city . Take a quick walk up the hill to the right after exiting for an even better vista . <p> 3 ) North Shore A must for sports lovers as it is the home of the Steelers and Pirates stadiums as well as the local casino . <h> Where to Eat in Pittsburgh <p> How can we talk about Pittsburgh and not mention Primanti Brothers ? <p> This iconic sandwich shop is famous for putting common sides , french fries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With half a dozen shops around Pittsburgh , you can not go far without finding one , although their location in the Strip District is not only open 24 hours , but is the best to visit ( and is also cash only ! ) <p> With living in and visiting the city for nearly four years , we have come to appreciate a number of other restaurants that are highly recommended : <p> 4 ) Pamelas , delicious hotcakes and other diner breakfast and lunch foods , in Squirrel Hill , Oakland , and the Strip District . <h> Where to Drink in Pittsburgh <p> South Side is the best region of town for those looking for a good bar crawl . The neighborhood is full of boutique shops , tons of great restaurants , and many bars to keep the night life going until the sun comes up . <p> Church Brew Works is in Lawrenceville and is a brewery in a converted church . Great beer , good food , and unusual ambiance for sure . <p> Many microbreweries and wineries are found throughout the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Strip District that opened up in early 2012 . <h> Best Place for a Night on the Town in Pittsburgh <p> There are several parts of the city that are worth checking out for a night out . As mentioned above , South Side is always great for a bar crawl and the Strip District is always good for a night out at the bars when a game is on . <p> The Cultural District in downtown Pittsburgh is another avenue to explore as the half-dozen theaters located right in the heart of downtown are sure to always have a production on every night . <p> From local performances from the citys symphony and many colleges to full productions of the worlds best shows , it may be an incredibly difficult choice to pick only one show to see . <h> Where to Stay in Pittsburgh <p> Affordable hotel accommodations are relatively lacking in Pittsburgh . <p> Our personal favorite recommendation for family and friends is the Quality Inn University Center in Oakland . There is nothing special to report about this particular hotel except that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Otherwise the best hotels in the city are centralized in downtown , and have price tags to match . <p> For more places to stay in Pittsburgh choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com . You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Markets &amp; Shopping in Pittsburgh <p> For all food lovers , head to the Strip District , a converted warehouse district that is comprised of many specialty food stores , farmers markets , ethnic grocery stores , and international restaurants . <p> At last count there were at least 4-5 Asian grocery stores , a Mexican grocery store , a Middle Eastern grocery store , and several Italian grocery stores , each with a corresponding restaurant or street food stall . <h> Events &amp; Festivals in Pittsburgh <p> Pittsburgh loves fireworks . There is no other way to say it . From late spring until late fall , there are great fireworks shows every month corresponding with Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games . <p> Fourth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the less-visited lookout spot on Mount Washington we mentioned above . <p> Light-up-Night in November is a similar event where the city lights up the downtown Christmas tree . Of course , fireworks are included . <h> Getting Around Pittsburgh <p> Pittsburgh is ever-so-slightly past the point of being a walkable city , and public transport is one thing that has been cut quite substantially in recent years . <p> The rail system known as " the T " only has a select number of stops ; bus service covers most of the rest . As traffic problems plague the city quite significantly , buses are known to get delayed quite a bit . <h> Finding WiFi in Pittsburgh <p> The city itself has been slow to embrace WiFi , although many local business provide WiFi to guests of their establishment . <p> Downtown Pittsburgh is full of WiFi hotspots that offer 2 hours of free internet per day for those looking to connect , which will hopefully be expanded in the future . <h> Favorite side-trip from Pittsburgh <p> Ohiopyle is our favorite day trip from Pittsburgh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities are plentiful in the area with the summer months being great for biking , hiking , and white water rafting . Ski resorts open up in the winter time for novice to intermediate skiers to hit the slopes . <h> Best Time of Year to Visit Pittsburgh <p> Pittsburgh is best seen in spring when the flowers are in bloom and the fall when the trees turn colorful . <p> But like everything else in the Midwest , temperatures can vary by the day . Do not be surprised if one day in the spring it is quite warm and the next day it is snowing . It comes with the location , sadly . <h> Getting there and Away <p> Megabus operates a hub in Pittsburgh through many major cities in the North East and Amtrak has a station just on the edge of downtown , within walking distance of the Strip District . <p> Pittsburghs airport is not a major hub and is located approximately a 20-25 minute drive from the city during non-peak hours ( 40-60 minutes when traffic is bad ) . <h> Best insiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duquesne Incline is our favorite insider tip . Every time we walk along the main road outside of the incline we spot dozens of visitors viewing the city from the enclosed lookout point attached to the incline station . <p> Only a small fraction ( &lt; 10% ) know to make the 2 minute walk to the much nicer viewing area nearby . <p> To reiterate , as you exit the incline station , turn right and walk the sidewalk up the small hill . You 'll know when you make it to the viewpoint we speak of , and the beautiful statue that sits there is an even bigger hint ! <h> I Love Pittsburgh because <p> it is not what youd expect . The first thought of Pittsburgh is always of the crash after the steel bust several decades ago , often lacking the necessary follow up question of " whatever became of them ? " . <p> Luckily the city has recovered in more ways than one . With many great universities , hundreds of fantastic restaurants from every corner of the world , some of the countrys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival the worlds best cities , Pittsburgh is truly a unique gem in the Midwest USA . <p> While we are not advocating Pittsburgh as being the largest tourist destination in the Midwest , it is definitely one that should be on your list for a day or two if you are passing through on a great North American adventure . <h> Plan Your Trip to Pittsburgh 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation in Pittsburgh <p> Booking.com has over 45 properties in Pittsburgh including hotels , apartments , , and hostels .

I have to disagree with your assessment of it being a nice place to visit for a day or two . Pittsburgh is definitely a standalone destination worthy of at least a week ! = <p> Awesome , let us know when you get settled in ! I do think there is enough to keep people occupied for a week in Pittsburgh , but with how large our country is I often find myself pointing out other great cities within a few hours driving for those coming through too ! = <p> LOVE Pittsburgh ! ( Though I do n't  need to tell Jeremy and Angie that ) Their tips are great ! The Duquesne Incline is a must-do , and Pittsburgh has some of the best museums I 've ever been to . The Andy Warhol Museum and Carnegie Museum of Natural History are my favorites ( the latter has dinosaurs ! ! ) . And YUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Glad to see there is Pittsburgh love going around by all . If you make it to Pittsburgh in the next year let us know ! Well be around until at least the end of May 2013 ! <p> As I read this , my son and his family are on their way there to see a Pirates game . They live a few hours away and take the kids there sometimes . They love the Carnegie Museums- they love the Science Museum and my 10 year old grandson requested the Warhol Museum birthday . My favorite road trip from there is Falling Water , the Frank Lloyd Wright designed house . Enjoyed reading this . BTW heard Primante Brothers had a huge line at 1am . Is it always like that ? <p> Primanti Brothers has about 6 or 7 locations in the city and a few in Florida ( I believe ) . The original is in the Strip District and is 24 hours . Unless you get there at 11 am or 3:30 pm ( unless its a game day ) then there is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that get popular in the evenings and the way I understand it is that Primantis is always the go to place to soak up the alcohol after the bars close . <p> I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Travel Blog as it brought back so many wonderful memories for me of the three weeks I vacationed there in 2011 . It is such an exciting , wonderful , cultural and friendly place to visit and had such an amazing time visiting all the places you mentioned that I will be definitely returning ! <p> Hello everyone , those of you who are new to the burgh , who like to be social , hang out , meet new groups , do new things , and just have a good time ! Feel free to join out group " Pittsburgh Hangouts " and come have a good time during one of our events . <p> Thank you so much or this review of Pittsburgh . I want to go there one day because this is the city my family is from . My father is always talking about going back to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there and see the city . Seems like a lot to do there if you know where to look . <p> My blog just featured a similar article , but targeted towards what NOT to do in Pittsburgh . This is a great article . But we disagree with you on one major point . We think that you should NOT eat at Primanti Bros . Theyre overrated and there are some much better restaurants around like Gaucho Parilla or Cafe Raymond . LONG ...

I was born without an organization gene . <p> It does n't  matter that I 've traveled the world for over 17 years , I 've only ever packed a suitcase one way throw everything in the bag , sit on it , and then zip it up . <p> And then get the shits three weeks later when I cant find anything . It was n't too bad when I had my backpack because the different compartments helped me stay a little organized . <p> My shoes would go in the bottom compartment of my backpack , my clothes in the top rolled and strapped down and my towel laying on top of that . It was pretty simple . <p> But , now we are road tripping , with kids , we have suitcases , and a little more room . The disorganization was driving me insane . I could never find the shirt or pants I really needed as it was one tangled up mess . And finding the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know about these before ? God , I live under a rock sometimes . <p> I found some in the Kathmandu store in Melbourne , but held off buying them because I felt they were too expensive to justify the benefits I 'd get from the organization . I 'd just keep sucking up the mess . <p> But , then it would lead to head explosion , so I marched down to Kathmandu determined to just put it on the credit card and pay it off later . <p> I believe in the magic of the Universe . When you set your intention for your hearts desire it delivers this time with a 60% off sale . Hello cheap packing cells . <p> I 've done similar packing arrangements for the girls . I have a mixture of large packing cells and smaller packing cells . You can get a pack of different sized packing cubes from Amazon here . ( cheaper than Kathmandu ) <p> In the top zipped section of the suitcase is where I put my underwear . And on top of the packing cells I lay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made finding my clothes that much easier and faster , it also saves a lot of extra room in your suitcase . <p> Before my trip to Kathmandu , I also had my toiletries scattered across a few different bags , which was also driving me to the loony bin . The large toiletry bag I had my eye on for ages was also on the 60% sale woohoo ! <p> toiletries <p> Happy happy days . <p> Now its all in one place and I just pick it up and walk it down to the showers when its time to freshen up . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> I have never heard of packing cells . Do n't  know if they have them in Canada . Worth checking out . When packing for a longer vacation I do my best to limit what I take and I roll up everything , a trick I learned . I find it takes up less room and I could put in more stuff if I have to . <p> I have never used packing cells will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan of rolling clothes , rubber bands ( great especially for kids outfits ) , ziploc bags and lately the compression sacks from EagleCreek . <p> thanks for that about 15 years ago i made similar for us to travel , packing undies in one and tops in another etc and when traveling for a long time halving the case with winter on one side and summer on the other ( of course i use both for layering ) but it does separate the woolen wear . its so good that we can now buy them and not home made ! ! ! ! no more making for friends i will send them to the store ! ! ! thanks again liz <p> Have always packed that way . Started off using department store bags then the zipped ones . I 'm not a roller . I 'm old fashioned and like ironed clothes so I when I use a roller suitcase I pack from the bottom up . Everything is folded small . Works a treat for us .. <p> Completely agree ! ! ! ! I bought 2 each for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to our Canada trip that started in May also on a fabulous sale at Kathmandu ! So handy , as we ended up living out of our truck for 3 months , and loved having my clean knickers all together and easy to find ! Come Christmas this year , when everyone was asking " what do you want for Christmas ? " I figured we could n't go wrong with more packing cubes , seeing as wed be on the road another 8 weeks , and traversing both Canadian winter and tropical Pacific Islands , our clothes needed to be sorted ! <p> We had a couchsurfer stay who introduced me to packing cells and I instantly knew they were the answer . We ordered one each from and we are now packed for our adventure with everything fitting beautifully and leaving room in our bags for other things <p> I have n't done this yet but now with that sale I just might = Would highly recommend you look at soniastravels YouTube channel . AMAZING packing tips and hints including the cubes = plus just general travel tips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pond . I have some packing cells but I 'm not a total convert . I 'm not sure if its because I have n't committed to packing everything this way or if its just because when I pack flat I leave fewer gaps , although I agree its a stressful crumpled mess . That said , if my underwear is n't packed in a cell it finds its way to the four corners of the earth , and that 's never good = <p> That 's right , and that 's where I bought mine . They a freakin awesome and very affordable . One can find ours at Ikeas travel/ Familycard section and they helped me packing all my stuff in a tiny carry-on . Love it ! <p> Caz , I have always used the equivalent of a packing cell . For my first big trip over 20 years ago I bought a collection of various sizes and colours of fabric bags with drawstring tops . I have a bag each for clean underwear , dirty underwear , other clothes , toiletry bag , miscellaneous bits and pieces etc . The newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can also see inside . <p> They definitely help to keep things organised ( and you sane ) so congrats on getting your suitcase organised ! <p> Uhm , why buy these packing cells ? I 've done it for years just with ( firm ) plastic bags that I get for free ( for example in clothes shops ) . These days a lot of shops give quite fancy bags . For my laundry I even use a bag made out of 100% cotton , got it for free years ago . A lot of those bags even have fancy zippers and buttons or have easy ways to tie them up . And since I use a lot of different ones , I know that each bag stands for something different ( skirts , swimmers , ) . Not only did I get those bags for free , I believe a thin plastic or cotton bag even takes in less place then those cells . Though I do have to admit : a good bag for toiletries is essential ( I have an other big one just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in my backpack : in each bag goes clothes that can be worn as a set , for example a singlet + a T-shirt + skirt . I put it all on top of each other , and when I unzip my backpack completely it looks like I have a closet with shelves = <p> Nice post Caz . My wife bought a whole heap of these before our 8 months backpacking and I was teasing her about them . After a few weeks on the road I had wished I had got some of my own . Next time = <p> Ahaha I love this . I only go on really short trips ( read : I do n't  bring enough to make a mess ) or reeeeeally long trips ( read : I transfer everything to a closet when I arrive ) . But I just roll everything and stick it in too ! I never have too much of a problem though because of the aforementioned points , but the travel cells do actually sound weirdly tempting I like accessories . <p> I love packing cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubes for about $25 on amazon . I like to use a combination of packing cubes and travel space bags ( great if you want to pack a lot in a suitcase ) . <p> This is awesome ! I essentially do the same thing with my backpack , except its way more ghetto. = I like to separate shirts , bottoms , skirts and dresses , and undergarments all into separate plastic bags . That 's it ! It makes living out of a backpack SO MUCH EASIER ! No more " backpack throw up " everywhere . yay ! <p> I am not a total packing cell convert although I have found some vacuum pack cell things ( that do NOT require an actual vacuum ) that pack my clothes down nice and neat . I just love having my things packed in an organised manner rather than just chucked in . I do think that all toiletries in the 1 pack is good and not to over pack those things as you can get most things shampoo , conditioner and moisturiser in many places ( if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am trying to teach others the joys of packing = <p> I have tried the packing cells and am a believer ! Instead of taking everything out of my suitcase to find one items , I just need to find the right cell . It is a time saver and just makes the process of packing a little bit more enjoyable . <p> Yes ! Kalyra got into my suitcase the other day and took everything out of the cells and threw it in the bag . It was one gigantic mess and totally stressed me out . I was appalled that this was how my suitcase once looked . I do n't  know how I ever managed . Thank goodness I found the way ! <p> Instead of spending the money on packing cells , I 've always just used mesh laundry bags to separate and organize my luggage/bags . Admittedly its no packing cell , in terms of accessibility ; you sometimes have to dump them out to get to that pair of pants you rolled at the bottom . Still they are cheap , light weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a laundry bag too . <p> My packing cubes are similar to net laundry bags , too . I believe I got a set of three from my Regal lady for about $7.00 CAD . They are see-through and flexible always an advantage at security . I watched a ladys " exploded " suitcase coming onto the baggage carousel last year which really made me appreciate the organization of my suitcase . <p> Ive been using packing cubes for years and love them . I 've even converted a number of people to using them . I 'm a folder of clothes as no matter how neatly I roll them they always come out so crumpled that I have to iron . If you fold the clothes to the size of the packing cube things fit in far better than rolling ! I use a number of them in different colours that way I know what 's in each one . I also take one ( with things I 'll need on a flight ) in my carry on bag and put it in the seat pocket when on long flights that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have a number of items that I leave permanently in my suitcase ( in a packing cube of course ) , like nail clippers , nail file , eyeshade , phone charger etc so I do n't  have to keep packing and unpacking them . I also have a laminated packing list in my suitcase so when its time to pack I tick off the items with a non permanent marker , then just wipe it clean ready for the next time . <p> I love love love packing cells . Now that I travel with my husband and 2 kids , I have different colours for each person and then different sizes for each type of clothes . Even when we arrive in a hotel there is no need to unpack the items just stay in the cells . I also mix up the cells into the suitcases or bags so if one bag gets lost by the airline then one person has not lost everything . <p> I used Kathmandu packing cells for the first time on a recent trip and they are so much better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no noise ! That rustling plastic used to drive me crazy . I bought a selection of different sizes and colours to easily identify and categorise my things . Our backpacks were checked by customs when we came home and the customs officer was really impressed by our packing cells ! ! <p> Love them , yes to rolling clothes and a couple more ideas : Tightly pack the cells as they act similar to compression bags . I prefer small/medium ones for that reason . We travelled Europe for 10months in a self converted van . Used the cells strung onto bamboo poles which attached to the van walls to keep clothes in as we were very short of space . = <p> I have not purchased a packing cube product but have adapted to a pre-sorted bags and cases within a larger suitcase or travel bin and backpack . An important part of packing and unpacking is having the toiletries well organized . I prefer an essentials case for teeth and eye care , a wet case for in the shower ( and everthing that can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everything else sorted into pockets . These items now live in their travel cases so I feel at home when retrieving my nail clips from the same pocket of the same case no matter what my zip code . <p> How do I prevent my cloths getting wet when in the rain forest . I was in South America travelling from the rain forest to the airport . When I arrived at my destination everything in my case was soaking wet . Would appreciate any advice <p> I also found that you really need separate bags inside your bag when you 're traveling . Like you , I learned that the hard way . I thought that the bag will only get in the way . I did not know how easy it is to pull out what you need with these cells than digging through your stuff . <p> I love packing cells bought some on Amazon last year , then discovered them at Ikea of all places . Bought them for my whole family for Christmas this year . I travelled to Mexico last year they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got the red button and toddled over to the customs guy . He unzipped my bag and looked in amazement at all my packing cells , shrugged his shoulders and waved me through !

Haukadalalur <p> Part of the Golden Circle in South West Iceland , the geothermal area is quite an attraction . It is home of the famous Geysir but you need to be lucky to see it erupt . <p> However the little brother Strokkur is very active . Its powerful jet of water happens every few minutes , so you have plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing followed by the column of water which reaches 15 to 20 meters high , sometimes to 40 meters. <h> 2 . Jokulsarlon Beach <p> One of the most touristic spots on the south coast of Iceland is the beautiful lagoon of Jokulsarlon where the glacier releases huge icebergs . However most visitors do not cross the road to the black sand beach and miss one of the country 's highlights . <p> The icebergs actually float through a channel into the sea and are pushed back towards the beach by the tide . You can approach these giant blocks of ice and touch them . Some are white , other black and a few are blue , but all look stunning against the waves and the black sand . Truly a privilege to see this work of nature . <h> 3 . Hverir <p> Iceland has many geothermal areas but my favorite is Hverir in North Iceland . <p> You can feel the Earth boiling just under the crust with the powerful gas released from the fumaroles and the mud pools . All this activity is intensified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Namafjall , the hill behind . <h> 4 . Sigoldugljufur <p> one of the lesser known places in Iceland <p> Hidden in the Central Highlands , the canyon of Sigoldugljufur is one of the lesser known places in Iceland . We ended up there by accident and it was one of those moments where you feel you have reached paradise : nothing around , just you and nature . <p> As the others kept photographing , I sat there in silence enjoying every curve of the canyon and every small tear ' waterfall . Mother Nature is an artist ! <h> 5 . Hverfjall <p> I had seen small volcanic craters before Hverfjall in North Iceland , but its size and bare landscape makes it one of a kind . <p> As I walked the 1km long rim of the 140 meter deep volcano , my mind started traveling back in time 2,800 years ago and imagining the power of the eruption . I felt privileged to see the evidence of such an intense event . <h> 6 . Blue Lagoon <p> I must admit , contrary to most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Blue Lagoon . And by that I mean the spa and the huge flow of tourists . <p> The lagoon itself is man-made but the fascinating part is that the geothermal seawater comes from 2,000 meters beneath the surface . It has traveled through porous lava , reaches us at 50-C and ends up at 38-C in the lagoon . Can you imagine it coming from so deep under us ? <h> 7 . Leihrnjukur <p> Imagine walking in a field of fuming lava . Crazy ? Well , not that much . <p> You can actually do it in North Iceland on a walking track around Leirhnjukur which is still steaming 30 years after the last volcanic event . Of course you have to stay on the path if you do not want your shoes ' soles to melt . But what an adventure ! <h> 8 . Pseudo-craters <p> I know the title says you can connect with Mother Earth , but now it is time to connect with Father Mars . Let me explain . <p> The pseudo-craters of Lake Myvatn are the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where water is trapped under lava . But scientists believe the same is happening on planet Mars ! <h> 9 . Aldeyjarfoss <p> An off the beaten track waterfall , Aldeyjarfoss offers the evidence of both volcanic activity and erosion by the glacial river : the land of fire and ice . <p> This place in Iceland is where you go to appreciate how the powerful flow of water created a passage allowing us to see various shapes of basalt columns from the successive volcanic events . <h> 10 . Dimmuborgir <p> And finally , if you want to sing the jingle Denver , the last dinosaur ' and feel like one could appear any time , I recommend visiting Dimmuborgir in North Iceland . <p> Most lava fields are spread but low . This unique one has huge lava formations surrounding you that make you feel like you have traveled in time . <h> Plan Your Trip to Iceland 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 <p> Booking.com has over 1,100 properties in Iceland including hotels , apartments and hostels .

But the lagoon are now getting bigger without adding more guests in it so it will be a plenty of space in it . 
@@21820704 @1820704/ <p> Phuket island has a rich cultural history , especially in Phuket Town where I live . The locals there , they live at a more traditional pace ' and there are many beautiful examples of Chinese Shrines and Temples . <p> You are seriously spoiled for choice for food options in Phuket with probably a greater variety of cuisines than anywhere else in Thailand , outside of Bangkok of course , from hawker stands , beach vendors , local noodle shops , great Thai and Seafood restaurants right up to the finest International Dining . <p> While the beaches and blue skies are a major draw , I think it is the range of activities on offer that makes Phuket such a great all round destination . <h> What to do in Phuket <h> Kalim Bay <p> At the northern end , this Phuket beach has become the ultra-hip place to hangout and you will find the trendiest bars and restaurants along this stretch of coastline . <h> Vibrant and Chaotic Phuket Night Markets <p> Stretch all the way along the beach road and just about every available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , souvenirs , clothes and dubious counterfeit items is an experience that is integral to travel in Asia and they do n't come much more full on than in Patong . <h> Colorful Nightlife in Phuket <p> Patong has an infamous reputation for it 's colorful ' nightlife and everyone should experience the beer bars , discos and go-go bars of Soi Bangla ( the main strip ) at least once in their life . <h> Kata and Karon Beaches <p> There is still enough going on here to keep you interested and the beaches are some of the very best on the island . There are also some amazing viewpoints nearby , which you can visit by motorbike , car or Tuk Tuk . <p> Karon Beach <h> Cherng Talay <p> Another area I like is Cherng Talay . It is a couple of beaches up from Patong and generally caters for a more discerning clientele in the high end resorts of Surin and Bangtao beaches , and of course the massive Laguna Complex of resorts . <p> Cherng Talay is a good place to rent a villa or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pace of life is very relaxed here and there are some great international restaurants , bars and beach clubs . <h> Singh Beach <p> If you rent a motorbike or car while you are here , I 'd recommend trying to find Laem Singh Beach . It is accessible by some very steep steps and is a very laid back bay with fantastic snorkeling around the rocks on the beach and has a great , relaxed vibe . <h> Quiet Phuket Beaches <h> Cultural sights on Phuket <p> I 'd say the big 3 cultural attractions on Phuket island are Wat Chalong , Phuket Old Town and Big Buddha and as they are quite close together you could easily visit them all in one day . <h> Big Buddha , Phuket Island <p> Sat on his mountaintop is always awe-inspiring , it is huge and can be spotted from most places in the south of the island . It is even more impressive from the top and there are some brilliant viewpoints all the way up the mountain , not just from the summit . <p> Big Buddha <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most recognisable symbols of Thailand and Wat Chalong is a shining example . It is the largest temple in Phuket and is richly decorated with beautiful colours and countless images of Buddha and icons from Thai and Buddhist mythology . <h> Phuket Old Town <p> Is a great place to be and really gives you a glimpse of what life was like on the island 100s of years ago when the Chinese and Europeans arrived and started mining for tin . <p> There are many stunning examples of Sino-Portuguese architecture and Chinese shop houses , which are still to this day operating as traditional textiles , gold and printing businesses . <p> Nowadays , they are also home to quaint cafes and coffee shops , clothes boutiques and some lovely restaurants , guesthouses and local bars . <h> Where to eat in Phuket , Thailand <h> Budget places to eat in Phuket <p> I do n't think you can do much better than Natural Restaurant in Phuket Town . It 's a rickety wooden , traditional Thai shack with an eclectic jumble of plants , waterfalls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including fish tanks made out of old TV sets . <p> It has an extensive menu of Thai food , probably one of the best I have seen in Phuket and the prices are very reasonable . <p> Also , for breakfast in Phuket Town , head to The Gallery by Pinky for Eggs Benedict or Norwegian Eggs ( Eggs Benedict with smoken salmon ) . <h> Stylish places to eat in Phuket <p> In Phuket Town , a restaurant called La Gaetana is great fun and completely eccentric , serving the best in Italian and International cuisine . <p> There are only about 5 tables in the place , which is a good job as the very ' personalized service from the Italian Owner is exceptional , including him personally adding the finishing touches to desserts at your table , custom made wine decanters and shawls for the ladies if they feel a slight chill from the air conditioning . <p> For more fine dining experiences in Phuket , check out 18 of the best fine dining restaurants in Phuket . <h> Where to drink in Phuket <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Phuket Town .

You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Best places for sunset in Phuket <h> Catch Beach Club , Surin Beach <p> The coolest place to enjoy a sunset cocktail with the other hipsters is Catch Beach Club on Surin Beach , where you can lounge about on comfy sofas listening to dubby beats and chilled out electronica , although it will set you back a few Thai Baht for the privilege . <p> Catch Beach Club <h> After Beach Bar and Small View Point Restaurant , Kata Noi Beach <p> Sit next to each other on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Andaman sea , great seafood and a continuous stream of Bob Marley . It is easy to see why this is a popular , chilled out place to enjoy the famous Phuket sunsets . <h> Best Markets and shopping in Phuket <p> The prices at Naka Weekend Market on the outskirts of Phuket Town are generally cheaper than at the markets in Patong , but you still have to bring your best bartering skills with you . Many of the products here come from Bangkok . <p> Naka Weekend Market <h> Events and festivals in Phuket <h> Phuket Vegetarian Festival <p> The most bizarre experience I have ever witnessed in my life , bar none , is the Phuket Vegetarian Festival . Do n't be fooled by the gentle sounding name , as this festival is more famous for its blood soaked , death defying acts than it is for it 's vegetarian food . <p> Spirit mediums in a state of trance cleans the soul by climbing ladders with rungs made of knives , walk barefoot across hot coals , perform brutal acts of self-mortification , piercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects . <p> Some of the weirdest I have seen are cheeks pierced with AK 47 barrels and the long poles attached to ceiling fans . <p> The whole 9-day festival is accompanied by incessant rapid-fire explosions and clouds of smoke from Chinese Fire Crackers and is a full-on assault of the senses that leaves you wondering if you have in fact crossed over into a different realm along with the spirit mediums . <h> Songkran Festival , Phuket <p> One festival that you can not miss is the Songkran Festival in April , which marks the beginning of the traditional Thai New Year . It is basically the world 's biggest water fight and is probably the most childish fun you will ever have in your life . <h> Loi Kratong ( Festiveal of Lights ) <p> Loi Kratong or Festival of lights ' is one of the most important and traditional festivals in the Thai calendar , representing the close bond between Thai culture . <p> Loi means to float ' and kratong ' is a small lotus shaped float , traditionally made out of the trunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , candles and incense sticks . <p> It is a very beautiful and serene occasion as thousands of these small candle lit boats float gently out onto the water and fire lanterns light up the whole of the night sky . <p> Vegetarian Festival <h> Best side trips from Phuket <h> Maya Bay <p> Maya Bay is the most popular Island Tour from Phuket and is world famous as the location of the utopian beach in the movie The Beach with Leonardo DiCaprio . <p> I recommend visiting in the Low Season as the bay is overrun with boats and tourists in Peak Season and loses some of it 's appeal . <p> Plus , in the Low Season , Maya Bay can only be accessed via the back entrance due to the heavy tides and this only adds to the adventure . The boat takes you into a small lagoon where you transfer to a canoe and paddle over to a spider web rope net attached to the side of a small rock face . <p> After that , you walk through a small jungle to arrive on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movie . This way , you get to experience the same impact of this beautiful bay with its ' towering limestone cliffs as they did in the film . <p> Maya Bay <h> Phang Nga Bay <p> Surrounding the north and eastern coast of Phuket , is a magical place of such breathtaking natural beauty that James Bond Villain Scaramanga opted to build his secret hideout amongst the limestone outcrops and tiny islands , in the classic film The Man With The Golden Gun . <p> You can visit James Bond ' Island by boat and depending on your tour itinerary you can also enjoy island hopping in the stunning bay , snorkeling , lunch at a floating Muslim fishing village and sea kayaking through spectacular limestone sea caves ( hongs ) . <p> James Bond Island <h> Raya Island , Koh Khai and Coral Islands <p> There are many beautiful islands close by to Phuket , which are less than a 30 mins boat ride away . <p> For a group of people ( and depending on your budget ) , I 'd recommend chartering a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chalong , Rawai or Laem Ka beach . <p> Agree your own itinerary with your captain , but I especially like for snorkeling , swimming and beautiful white sand beaches . <p> Railey Bay <h> Similan Islands National Park . <p> The most stunning island tour I have ever been on is to the Similan Islands National Park . It takes a little longer to get to The Similan Islands than it does on some of the other island tours , about 3 hours , but it is well worth the extra journey time . <p> Similan Islands <p> The snorkeling and dive sites in this area are amongst the Top 10 Dive sites on the entire planet and the natural rock formations and jungle scenery are spectacular . <p> Similan Islands <h> Best time to visit Phuket <p> Phuket is an all year round holiday destination , but I would generally say avoid peak season in January and February as the island beaches are overcrowded and unrecognisable from the paradise you can experience the rest of the year . <p> Green Season from May to October is supposedly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Phuket as the rates are lower and the beaches are less crowded .

Public buses between the beaches are non-existent , although hopefully this is something they may sort out in the near future . So , at the minute , hiring a motorbike to cruise round the beaches is your best option . <p> If you want to see Phuket Town you can get the public bus there and back from most major beaches for about 20 or 30 Thai Baht each way . <h> Do n't be afraid to eat the local street food <p> It is inexpensive , delicious and generally speaking you should n't experience any major problems with food poisoning . BBQ corn on the cob on the beach is fantastic , especially when accompanied by a fresh fruit shake and bbq chicken .

Sure , they have the best lemon/mint soda in the world , but their food I find kind of expensive and a bit on themeh ? side . For really awesome cheap food , get out of the tourist areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the menuand then point and hope for the best ! My family loves to eat by mystery pointing ! There are some excellent restaurants in the Bangkok Hospital part of town , and over near the end of Phang Nga road on Surin road . <p> Perfect timing . Thanks Craig . Were flying into Phuket before we go island hopping in Thailand . We have one free day in Phuket Town so this is EXACTLY what we needed ! Now the tough decision is which islands we decided to hop within 2.5 weeks ! <p> Sorry , but I beg to differ . After having spent five days in Phuket , where it costs 10 times as much to live as elsewhere in Thailand , my wife and I were elated to leave . The entire island is a great example of what rampant overdevelopment and greed can do to destroy a natural paradise . It is relatively inexpensive to get to Phuket . Our flight in was cheap and transport to our hotel was also cheap . But getting around and departing the island without paying a hefty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rica . The area is set up to fleece retirees and wealthy jetsetters who use tour groups . <p> As the author indicated , the only way to get around is by scooter . But those things are dangerous as hell . Phukets roads are no place to learn if you have n't ridden a moped before . Just a few days earlier , four Swedish teenagers died in a car accident ( the cab they were in was hit by a truck ) . They had hired a private cab to take them somewhere , because the regular cabs charge too much . Its a complete travesty . Buses do not run between beaches , only to and from Phuket Town . If you are at all on a budget , avoid Phuket like the plague . <p> We have had great luck with the busesthey all run to Phuket town , and you can catch another bus from there . We have lived here for 6 months and get around exclusively by city ( pink ) buses and island ( blue ) buses . If you were not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right area , because we are a family of 5 and live on around $1000-$1200 American a month . <p> Hi Dana , Yes , I would recommend Natural Restaurant for budget food as it is a restaurant that I go to quite often when friends come to visit and everyone always enjoys the ambience , food and prices here . You are quite right though , the local restaurants do offer cheaper prices and if there is no English on the menu you can bet the food is authentic and delicious = <p> Chris , Phuket is Thailands most developed tourism island , so in some ways your points are quite valid , but it is a over generalisation to say that the " entire island " is destroyed by greed and over development . Maybe , as Dana says , you just werent in the right area . If you go to the main tourist areas then you will pay tourist prices , but I do n't  think this is any different from any other tourist destination in the world . <p> I agree with Chris that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the safest place to take a crash course . However , in the 2 years I have been riding a motorbike here I have never had a problem and from my experience it is generally safer than other parts of South East Asia , where the roads are not always in such good condition . <p> Gerard , for island hopping , I would generally say avoid staying on Koh Koh Phi as it is Peak Season there and you might be disappointed . Instead , maybe opt for Koh Lanta and Railay Beach ( Krabi ) is always a great option . You can take a day trip to Koh Phi Phi from here as well so you get the best of both worlds . Have fun = <p> We stopped over in Thailand when we relocated from the UK to Australia and stayed on Phuket in Bangtao for ten days . We stayed in Patong before having children and definitely would n't want to stay there with younger kids , Bangtao was much more family friendly . Perhaps teenagers would enjoy Patong but we feel its too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bangtao beach , we also spent a day at Phuket Laguna . We 'd love to go back one day . Ive provided tips about staying in and around Bangtao in this post : LONG ... Thanks for all the other tips you 've provided . <p> My intention was to highlight that moves have been made recently to make Patong a more family-friendly destination with magic shows , theatre etc , but I would have to agree that Bangtao would be a more family-friendly option overall , especially with younger children . <p> The Cherng Talay area ( including Bangtao ) has a much less touristy feel to it and it is very popular with expats with families as well as holiday makers looking for a quiet family holiday . <p> Thank you Craig . The info you provided is informative and I love your style of writing . Question though , I 'm very much into the Trance / dance scene . However , after seeing footage of the Full Moon Parties etc . Im put off by the hedonistic young moronic vibe and litter that sadly seems to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any more chilled dance venues with good Djs away from the crowded mainstream in Phuket or the surrounding islands ? <p> Great general info in this post . I call Phuket my home since 2004 and can just say that yes there is a lot of development and yes there is a lot of traffic especially during high season . BUT there are still so many areas which are beautiful , unspoiled and full of friendly locals . It all really depends where you spent your time there . <p> I was in Phuket 40 years ago when I rented a cabin at patong beach with a hammock and resident monkey in the tree outside and had a SURF at the beach 20 metres away . In 10 days I will go back to see the change . We will stay in the hotel with gym and lap pool , eat local food and fruit from the markets and take buses . I hope it has n't  been taken over by a subculture of tattoed muscle-bound bozo westerners on hogs with the token tiny thai fucking machine on back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have the shock of your life ! If you are after beach and peace , stay on Bangtao beach , Nai Yang or Mai Khao beach but prices are pretty high around there if you want a room near the beach , mostly luxury resorts . Anyway you should go have a look at Patong Beach and see for yourself . Great for party and a lot more easy going than Pattaya , but get ready for an overgrown hectic city ! <p> So many wonderful things to do on our island ! ! And you covered some of my favorites ; about to participate in our third vegetarian festival here , and this year we actually live in Phuket Town , right in the heart of the action ! <p> I have first visited Phuket in 2006 and I 've decided to move in right then . Ive been living in Phuket Town since . Phuket really is an amazing place and it amazes you even more every single day you 've spent in here . <p> I 'd recommend to try local Thai food whoever planning to visit Phuket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to get some tips and recommendations . You can meet with many expats if you visit Roxy bar or Rockin Angels pub in Phuket Town . <p> Phuket is really special holiday destination and everyone should visit at least once . And definitely you should read this amazing article to get loads of useful information . Thank you for this great write up . <p> Thanks for all the tips guys ! I 'm planning my trip to Phuket for June or July . I 'm taking my mom . Where will be a good area that 's central to stay . Were going for shopping and touring . Any affordable guesthouses that anyone can recommend ? <p> I second your recommendation for Air Asia . I 've traveled them to various destinations around Asia ( and once back to the UK when they used to do their long-haul flights ) and they 're an excellent airline . Sure , what you get is minimal and you have to pay for food and drinks , but their flights are cheap so its worth it and they are an excellent airline . <p> Hey people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on costs of living . Coming to Phuket in August for 3 months and am wanting to know how much cash to bring etc . Accommodation is paid for Thanks ! <p> I have always been wanting to go to Phuket since I was a college student . Right now I am in Singapore working for more than a year , I still did n't  have any chance to visit the place . This September when my american friend is coming to visit Asia , she is offering me to go with her since she is traveling alone . Hopefully I can go with her that time . <p> Phuket overpriced overcrowded full of rats and snakes mostly outside the populated areas . Garbage everywhere drivers are stupid don t care kids or tourists . If you die in a Phuket road accident its nothing but normal . And a smile you get only if showing your money . Thais like only themselves never ever farangs . They can bring their money and go . A land of pharisee . <p> Weve visited Phuket this summer with friends and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the beaches to the restaurants , everything was just perfect . As we were 5 couples , we 've decided to try to rent a villa and it was probably the best part of our trip .

If there are any Aussie bloggers in Phuket at the time I would love to meet up to eat the street food ! <p> Your post is great ! Thanks . I wish also to add that diving in Phuket is also a very rich activity . You can explore all islands around Phuket but under the water this time = Similan Islands are really one of the worlds top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have done a good work ! <p> Phuket is an amazing place because everyone can find what he is looking for here . Many factors are combined together here good infrastructure , natural attractions , amazing beaches , unique location right in the center of SEA . What makes Phuket perfect place to stop for travelers . <p> Phuket has everything . If you need a busy and crazy place you go to Patong , if you need a tropical escape with almost no people go to the north of Phuket . And If you need even more peace go to some islands such as Ko Yao Noi or Ko Lanta . <p> A very useful read . I found that if you book a car rental in advance ( a few weeks before ) from the airport , its actually cheaper to drive to your hotel yourself if you are staying about the beaches further south than hiring a taxi . <p> This is what I did the last time I was in Phuket . You 'll need a phone with Google Maps though as it can be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : D. <p> I can totally recommend Rainys Tourist and Taxi services . Weve been in Phuket Thailand many times and only used Rainys travel services , she speaks very good english and is friendly woman . Also this year we will definitely be using her services , which are very much cheaper than tourist offices provide . Its so good to find someone you can trust . <p> Feel great to read your blog . Phuket is Thailands largest island , and arguably the most famous . Blue waters , sandy beaches , great food , and diving are all part of the attraction . For relaxation and adventure , you can know more about famous places in phuket by clicking here : LONG ... <p> Hey man , thanks for this blog post . You wonderfully describe Phuket .

I cant decide which one is my favourite . I would add to this list the South West of West Australia Esperance to Albany . Also the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia was very spectacular . <p> Have to agree with Kathy . We went south of Perth a couple of years ago and it was brilliant . The scenery was fantastic along with the caves , tall timber , wild flowers whales everywhere and Wave Rock . As for Eyre Peninsular there are spectacular coastlines all around , great fishing , national parks , swim with wildlife ( great white sharks , tuna sea lions and cuttlefish ) <p> Michiel , there so much to see in SA , We did it in two different trips . check out the website http : //www.southaustralia.com The state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booklets from all the information places .

Did a bus trip to the Barossa to the wineries , caught an AFL Game , the most magnificent oval ! Hope on there us and enjoy the sights for another day , get on and off as you want . Another day visiting harndorf a beaut little German town about 20 mins out of Adelaide with lots of great galleries and botanic gardens . Then to wilpena pound for three night which is the Flinders Ranges , fantastic . We nada couple of nights at Clare then onto kangaroo island for three nights . Costu $400 to get over there and back but such a beautiful place and so much to see and do . Hope this helps ! <p> Sounds fantastic . Thanks for sharing your South Australia trip Donna . We must get to SA ! <p> James Carter 69801 @qwx269801 <p> Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day guided Perth to Broome trip , one of the best of my life-time . Inspired by your insistence that Broome is one of the best places in Australia and by a young patient who had shown me his photos swimming with whale sharks , I decided that this was the trip for me . Swimming the Ningaloo reef , swimming with the Whale Sharks and swimming in the rock pools of the Karajini gorges are suddenly three highlights of my life , all achieved in one short trip . And in the middle of winter , where else would you want to finish a holiday than in Broome where it is 32 C. day in , day out in June . Go West travellers ! <p> Of course , I now have to find the time to undertake the 13 other Australian road trips you suggest . The only one of these I have done is the Great Ocean Road , many times , but it can never be done enough . As a local , I completely concur with your advice to your readers to take their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get inland and explore the Otway Ranges . Little known places like Gebbs pool for a refreshing swim ( only a 20 minute walk from Cumberland Caravan Park ) and Lake Elizabeth where you can paddle amongst the platypus ( a 40 minute drive from Lorne ) , are largely unmentioned little gems . I 'm sure there are many more that I am yet to discover . <p> would like to recommend the Great Inland Way which runs between Sydney and Cooktown visiting centres . This is a true alternative to the coastal routes . There are a variety of communities which you pass through on the way . The landscapes are amazing and the people are even better . Come visit us ! <p> Great post . We like you had the pleasure of taking our two daughters around Australia in 1996 for twelve months before they started school . There were a few places we did n't  get to that you did but I would agree with you on the ones we did . Australia is such an awesome ( literally ) country . <p> Well Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa so no wonder you did n't  have the time or finances ! Like many other posts here maybe out of 14 road trips there should have been at least one in south Australia . Many great SA trips mentioned in comments here ! Hope to see them added to your blog soon . <p> Hi Liz , what I meant was I was n't sure whether the reader was referring to South Africa . I know SA is South Australia . I guess I had Africa on my brain as I was working on another topic related to that and have been to South Africa many times = <p> Weve since visited the Barossa and will be back to South Australia for sure . <p> Craig , South Australia is riddled with wine regions . Coming from the east you can go through the Riverland over to Burra then down to Clare Valley and off to the Barossa again . Or the Lime Coast , then head for the Coonawarra along the coast to Langehorne Creek then up to McLaren Vale side turn and the Adelaide Hills call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Lincoln and I would n't be surprised if there was a winery or two on Yorke Peninsula among the wheat fields . In South Australia you never know what is around the corner . <p> denjse 69801 @qwx269801 <p> Hi , u missed one amazing trip the one take u to Rainbow Beach with a 4+4 drive from Noosa <p> this was so timely for us we will be starting our adventure in August . Even though we plan to work our way around you guys have given us a great insight in to what not to miss . Thanks for sharing . We cant wait to get going . <p> You will love it . Been to Tassie 3 times , last time was the best , drove from Sandy Bay to Port Arthur then up to Swansea &amp; Bicheno ( stayed in a great house there almost on beach &amp; reasonable too ) then across to Launceston , loved the Cataract Gorge , Launceston shops , &amp; up to Bridport &amp; Low Head Lighthouse . So much to see &amp; do . Craig is so right when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Loved Hobart the Salamanca Place , Battery Point , Botanic Gardens &amp; Peppermint Bay cruise also Richmond , 0h just about everywhere . <p> Hi Craig Great post . I have done a few on your list when I had my trusty cruiser and canopy . Now I have a few extras I need to up grade . Few questions how was it like getting around some of the remote places with a van . Also what type of van have you got . As we have a 2.5 yr old boy and a baby girl <p> Have been on almost all those drives . A little too much outback and some long boring trips with only occasional highlights Nullabour for example . Oxley Hwy from Tamworth to Port Macquarie is worth doing plus if you drive from Broome to Perth you must detour inland to Karajini National Park and Tom Price fantastic . <p> My cousin will be moving to Australia . I did not know that there are a lot of good places to travel there . I really enjoy reading your blog . I get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even got my cousin to read it so she knows a little more about the country before she moves . <p> Bookmarked !

We are just north of Sydney . The plan is to head west to Flinders Ranges , Uluru , Katherine , Kakadu , Gibb River Rd , then down the west coast .

Love it max ! <p> I have done 11 of your road trips and have to agree with you on all parts of this I did the train across the Nullaborloved my time in Australia and recommend that people take their time with any road trip and see all the little things , do n't  rush to get to all the big thingsthe little things are the best experiences ! <p> So true . We stayed in Coffs Harbour , but too late we were told about Sawtell ( which we Had never heard of ) . Very pretty place . Nothing wrong with Coffs but its so busy . You can stay in Sawtell &amp; just drive the 10 mns to Coffs for the day . <p> Beautiful road trips ! ! Ill be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 weeks enough ? Some people are telling me to fly from sydney to melbourne as the drive is nothing special ! Advice would be great ! <p> People who say that the Australian drives have unsettled minds because they always have to see something different.For example me and my husband drove across the Hay Plain in NSW and my sister told me how boring the drive is.Well we drove across it . The landscape was flat as a bored . The sky looked so huge , it actually looked like it joined the landscape.You could look as far as the eye can see and the road seems endless.We also saw kangaroos and emus.So i told my sister that all these things that i mentioned is beauty <p> Hume Highway from Southern Highlands to Holbrook is beautiful . All the towns are by passed which makes a very easy drive but go off &amp; explore the towns , such as Gunning , Yass , Jungiong &amp; Gundagai . Also the drive from Kiama on the east coast down to Merimbula is beautiful including Shoalhaven , Berry &amp; too many towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entrance . <p> Nice post . I would really love to explore more of Western Australia and the NT , especially up by the Kimberleys . We have done many of these drives- I love Tasmania and the trip Sydney to the Sunshine Coast .

Beautiful trip- Margaret River is fantastic and the coast around Denmark was amazing . <p> Oh my god ! You have no idea of how helpfull your beautiful work has been . We are from brazil and we love Australia . we are going back there to do a motor home trip and I could n't ask for anything more than the travel blog .

We have n't been there for 35 years so I guess it has changed a lot . From what Ive read it is still a unique place and I love that it will be in our travel future ( some day soon I hope ) . Fantastic photos , especially of the W.A. water how beautiful is that blue ! <p> We 've just returned from our first big trip with our new Jayco Camper we did Adelaide Darwin , Litchfield , Kakadu , Katherine , Mataranka , Alice , Uluru , Adelaide .

Tassie and WA ( again , as the kids did not accompany us and we lost all of our photos in a house break from an unbacked up laptop that was stolen ) .

But as long as you 're traveling the benefits are priceless ! <p> Love these road trips and glad we can tick of many of them .

Basically my dream is to work in a small city or village , near the jungle , sea , forest . I plan to buy a scooter . I d love to rent a hut , cabin cottage in a remote area ( peaceful sea , forest ) 5 to 10 km to my job . I prefer hot climat . I do n't  have cars driver licence . But drive scooty well . I have done plenty of researches but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please tell me which area in that huge Australia would fit the best my wishes .. ? I am a animal lovers , specialy dogs . I have worked in quite a few shelters and rescued and adopted street dogs . ( was in India and Nepal for the last 4 years ) i 'd like to work in a zoo or national park but if i do n't  find place , i will take whatever comes . But at least the area i will stay will fit my dreams = please in advance , thanks for answering . I have 2 more might in hotel in Perth then have to decide to move or get into a condo again your blog is awesome thanks for that too ! ! <p> This is cool . I good to think that others agree with me . I 've managed to do 10 and a half of these drives on a motorcycle . Although to continue from Jervis Bay right round to Melbourne is a great drive as well as the Great Alpine Way and the Alpine Way would also be right up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me some great insight as to where I should go on my Australian road trip . I saw at the end that you were away for 18 months , did you work at all during your travel ? The reason I ask is I am looking to cover Australia and America in my trip and am just wondering how much I would need for my accommodation , car hire etc . <p> Really enjoyed reading your blog with some really helpful info . My husband and two boys ( 6 and 8 years old ) will be travelling from Cairns to Sydney for two weeks this August . Deciding whether to fly from Cairns to Brisbane then drive to Sydney from there are do the whole lot by car . Would appreciate any advice , we are travelling from the UK and will have spent two weeks in NZ prior , so a really exciting trip , but all on a very tight budget ! Any top tips on places to stay or visit would be amazing . <p> I reside in India and we are planning a road trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location has some unique places to visit .

I do n't  think I wiil ever see it again . I am 93 so I love to see picures of my beloved country . Many thanks . Yvonne <p> Have done 3 round Australia trips by motorcycle since the early 70s . The roads have definitely improved , I remember when the Nullabor Plains road was all dirt . But each trip has been as enjoyable and exciting as the first one . Many people do n't  realize how big Australia is until they start traveling around it by road . There is not a town over every hill but there are many things that will excite you . <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to do a trip around Australia .

Well , first of all , let me tell you a little secret . <p> " There are better Phuket beaches than PATONG ! " <p> Who knew ? <p> Not me , apparently , considering it took me three visits to Phuket to get out of Patong . <p> Having just returned home from my third visit to Phuket , over a ten day period , I 'm happy to say I did n't  set one foot in Patong . <p> By all means , if you 're looking for tourism on steroids including a packed beach , jet ski city , tons of accommodation , loads of shopping and restaurants , endless bars and nightlife , Patong is where its at ! <p> On my previous two visits to Phuket in 1999 and 2002 it was all about Patong I was younger then and looking to party but this time as a family we were looking for something much different . <h> Which Phuket Beaches Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches in Phuket were Layan Beach , Karon Beach , Kata Beach , and Surin Beach . <p> Personal photos and tips on these Phuket beaches are down below , but firstly , how much does a day at a Phuket beach cost ? <h> Layan Beach , Phuket <p> In our eyes , Layan is the best beach in- Phuket , and we stumbled on it- almost by accident . <p> It was our first stop on our Phuket beaches discovery drive with Mr Dam . We were in the Bangtao Bay area , and if we did n't  ask for a coffee stop , we may have never visited Layan Beach . <p> We pulled up at the end of a narrow beach road , stepped out of the car , and there in front of us was our Thai bliss . <h> Easily the quietest and most beautiful beach we visited in Phuket . <p> I cant believe we almost had this piece of paradise all to ourselves , in peak season ! No jet skis , no touts , the water was crystal clear , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Layan Beach is just north of Bang Tao Beach and we were at the southern end of Layan . We picked a spot in front of a hand full of quiet restaurants , such as Sabays , and this location was PERFECT for our family . <p> We had access to all the essentials : good food , beach chairs , beer , coconuts and a fresh water shower . This beach made our Phuket holiday ! The best beach in Phuket for families for sure ! <h> Karon Beach , Phuket <p> We enjoyed Karon Beach . The water and sand is nice , and its a long beach which is great for walks . Although there is quite a few resort developments , and plenty of restaurant options , its nowhere near as developed as Patong ! <p> On most days we could be found enjoying a sunset beer , or a cocktail , and the vibe is great for families , couples , or a solo traveller . <p> If you 're standing in front of the Phuket Hilton , head left or right and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple markets were a hit , and we loved the location as far as exploring the rest of Phuket . <p> Night Temple Markets <p> You can walk to Kata Beach , and if you need the crazy mental party scene of Patong , its in close proximity . <h> Kata Beach , Phuket <p> Kata is one beach further south from Karon , and probably a bit more scenic as its more of a cove shaped beach . And whilst it was busier than Karon , it did n't  feel like it and still had a nice relaxed vibe , again , perfect for families . <p> We liked the tree-lined street running adjacent to the beach which also provided some nice shady spots on the sand its HOT in Thailand even under big beach umbrellas ! <p> After a day on Kata we recommend you head up the hill for a sunset drink at the " After Beach Bar " . Just do n't  do what we did and choose the cloudiest day of your trip to watch the sunset . <h> Surin Beach , Phuket <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it grew on me . Its the smallest of the four best beaches in Phuket and whilst full of beach chairs and umbrellas , its quite scenic actually with lots of colours going on . <p> We ended up spending a whole day at Surin swimming in the ocean , chilling on the beach chairs , getting a great Thai massage ( 400 baht ) , and grabbing a delicious cheap lunch from the street carts nearby . <p> In the early evening we found a nice restaurant on the beach , Pla Seafood , and enjoyed a good quality , reasonably priced dinner , whilst watching an amazing sunset . <h> - Looking for a place to stay on Phuket , Thailand ? <p> For more information on where to stay in Phuket , Thailand check out a range of hostels , hotels and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com .

Do you have any recommendations for places to snorkel ? Were going to be staying on Coconut Island and prefer calm to crazy ( we provide the crazy ) . <p> Hi Craig , I 've been going to Phuket for a few years now and our favorite beach is Nai Harn at the very south ( west ) of Phuket in Rawai . Gorgeous cove and pretty quiet compare to Kata and Karon . Really nice to have a cold beer at the end of the day watching all the little lights from the hotel on the hill . Some little restaurants nearby . Enjoy the rest of your trip , I 'm counting the days to my next trip in Phuket next April .

Where are the other beaches in relation to Karon ? We are going to rent a car so we can drive . Thanks ! <p> Kata beach is the next beach south from Karon , you can actually walk if need be , so very close . Surin and Layan beaches are to the north , not too far away , depending on traffic , but you will need a car . <p> P.S. judging by your email address I 'm guessing you 're from North Carolina ? ? We used to live in Raleigh = <p> My husband and I are going on vacation there in August . We are not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really stayed on a beach before .

Is it difficult to get there from Pantong , and what is the best way . We are a bit nervous driving there . <p> Hi Craig , thanks for the reading .

I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running around the lake nearby , its a great 2km track . <p> My favorite beach is the Laem Singh Beach . This Beach is right in the neighborhood from Surin Beach .

While in the background is an original forest of palms . With favorable winds can be found here the highest waves . 
@@21820722 @1820722/ <h> 11 of the Best Beaches in NSW to Set Foot On <p> Growing up in NSW and having road tripped extensively both the north and south coast regions , I 've been to most of the best beaches in NSW . <p> But coming up with a list of my favourite beaches is never easy . <p> We are spoilt for choice on the east coast and there is a beach for everyone whether you are looking for a family friendly beach or to go surfing , swimming , walking , fishing , snorkeling , diving or even four-wheel driving . <p> Hitting the beach in summer is typically the best time of year , but in the quieter months many of these beaches are still spectacular and much less crowded . <p> So if I had to recommend a list of my favourite beaches in NSW that I have personally set foot on , below are my top eleven suggestions . <h> 11 of the Best Beaches in NSW <h> 1 . Hyams Beach , Jervis Bay <p> Hyams Beach is famous . The Guinness Book of Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't know you could get sand whiter than at Whitehaven Beach in Queensland , but the sand at Hyams is definitely fine , soft and white . <p> Hyams is a quiet beach side town in the Jervis Bay region of south coast NSW , - just 180km south of Sydney . It 's a great family beach and does n't  have the highrise development like many north coast beaches . Be sure to finish off your visit by heading to the Hyams Beach Cafe for good food and coffee . <p> Hyams BeachHyams Beach <h> 2 . Red Rock Beach , Coffs Harbour <p> We have done the Sydney to Gold Coast road trip many times but up until this year had never been to Red Rock Beach , and had actually never heard of it until a friend in Coffs Harbour recommended it . <p> Red Rock is about a 30 minute drive north of Coffs Harbour and is one of those hidden gems that is tucked away 6 kms off the Pacific Highway . Its a beautiful sweeping beach with an impressive headland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal clear water . <p> Red Rock BeachRed Rock Beach <h> 3 . Palm Beach , Sydney <p> Palm Beach is Sydneys most northern beach and possibly our favourite beach in the Sydney area . Scenically its incredibly beautiful with the golden sand stretching for 2 kilometres and the colours in the water move between spectacular shades of turquoise and aqua . <p> On one end is Barrenjoey Head where you can take an easy 1km bush-walk up to the old sandstone lighthouse for stunning views back over Palm Beach or across the Broken Bay region . <p> You do n't  have the crowds you get at say Bondi or Manly Beach , and in winter it 's the perfect place to spot migrating humpback whales . <p> Palm BeachPalm Beach <h> 4 . Greenfield Beach , Jervis Bay <p> Greenfield Beach is another pristine beach in the Jervis Bay region with that beautiful white powdery sand . Another family friendly beach perfect for swimming with clear aqua water and small waves , and its a top spot for a beach side BBQ . <p> And its here that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ofavouritetie coastal walks in NSW . <p> Greenfield BeachGreenfield Beach <h> 5 . Green Patch Beach , Jervis Bay <p> When I first set eyes on Green Patch Beach I was blown away . I 'd never heard of this beach or Booderee National Park where it is located , and it was just as spectacular as Hyams in nearby Jervis Bay . Are you getting the hint yet that the Jervis Bay region has some amazing beaches ? ! <p> The water , whilst a little cool for swimming in September was clean and clear and the sand soft and beautiful to walk on . We spent two nights camping in the campground right on the beach which offers a real bush camping experience . Be sure to walk around the headland from Green Patch and explore the amazing Scottish Rocks . <p> Green Patch BeachGreen Patch Beach <h> 6 . Main Beach , Byron Bay <p> Byron Bay is that legendary beach side town on the NSW North Coast famous for surfing and an alternative lifestyle . If you 're a surfer , Byron actually has 5 great beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the visitors walking , swimming and enjoying a beach side BBQ . <p> Whist at Byron , do n't  miss the Lighthouse Walk to Australias most easterly point . <p> Byron BaySunset at Byron Bay <h> 7 . Wategos Beach , Byron Bay <p> Just around the corner from Byron Bay is beautiful Wategos Beach . This beach is protected by the headland which makes it an awesome beach for swimming AND riding a long-board with the gentle waves and long rides . <p> There 's a BBQ area to enjoy or make yourself up a picnic and sit on the beach admiring this picturesque location . You 'll also pass this beach on the coastal Lighthouse Walk , but if you have the time spend at least a few hours here . <p> Wategos BeachWategos Beach <h> 8 . Pebbly Beach <p> Located in Murramarang National Park on the NSW south coast , Pebbly Beach is probably most famous as the place to see wild kangaroos hopping around on the sand . They are used to human interaction and there 's a chance you can get up close and personal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometres south of Termeil . <p> Pebbly Beach is a popular camping area with a good surfing beach and bush walks within the park . <p> Pebbly BeachPebbly Beach <h> 9 . Seal Rocks <p> If you are planning a Sydney to Brisbane road trip- I highly suggest a stop at Seal Rocks , a quiet fishing village offering clear bays for swimming , snorkelling , boating and fishing . This beach is just perfect , and much quieter than your usual east coast beaches . Seal Rocks is also a great place to go camping . <h> 10 . Bronte Beach , Sydney <p> There are many great beaches in Sydney but another of our favourites would be Bronte Beach in the eastern suburbs . It 's a beautiful beach with a small main street giving it a great vibe . <p> We always stop at Bronte when we do the Bondi Beach to Coogee coastal walk and just love it as a family beach . The rock pool is awesome for the kids to swim in , the HUGE grass and BBQ area is a bonus for families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disorderly . <p> The people watching is first class , and the views from Bondi Iceburgs as you sip on an afternoon beer are legendary . <p> Bondi Beach <h> Plan Your Trip in New South Wales 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 69803 @qwx269803 <p> Flights 69807 @qwx269807 <p> Car Rental 69806 @qwx269806 <p> I am definitely looking forward to visiting the Jervis Bay region for my birthday this year even more now ! Bronte ( love the natural rock pool ) is definitely one of my favourite Sydney beaches along with Freshwater , Coogee and Balmoral so many incredible beaches in Sydney ! <p> Burning Palms is south of Sydney in the Royal National Park . You ca n't drive there , so the only access is down a longish walking track ( with spectacular views ) . <p> A few people live at Burning Palms in delapidated old shacks from the Depression era . One of the owners saw us walking past and invited us in to have a look , and everything in it was like a time warp from 60-70 years ago , because the residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all and must abandon them once they fall to ruins . <p> The actual beach is incredibly beautiful and remote , with big waves .

Sitting here in cold WA the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk is something that Ive put on my bucket list , and Seal Rocks with a stay at the Lighthouse Keepers Cottage has definitely piqued my interest too = <p> Hi Craig Thanks so much for finding all these lovely beaches for us . Some I 've never been to but am looking forward to seeing them soon . I 'm am rather lucky though that I live at Jervis Bay and yes have seen the whitest sand at Hyams Beach .

Florence <p> My personal favorite , Florence , is a beautiful city full of history , architecture , art and food. - After visiting one or all of the world famous galleries like the Uffizi or the Accademia Gallery to view Michelangelos David treat yourself to a steak Florentine. - <p> You will want to skip lunch if you are going to pay homage to the altar of steak but if you need something to bridge the gap head to the San Lorenzo market and pick up a lampredotto sandwich. - <p> The simmered fourth stomach of a cow , sliced thin and garnished with green sauce and a splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only served up in Florence and has been for hundreds of years . <p> Now that you 're fueled up , hit the city and open every door because behind one could be a hidden feast for the eyes or stomach. - <p> The Museo di Palazzo Vecchio is open late so you can end your day by slipping into an art coma from its over the top interior . <h> 2 . Lucca <p> We- loved Lucca and fortunately our apartment was only a fifteen minute drive to the walled town . <p> Once called the city of a hundred churches , because it seemed that there was a church on every corner , Lucca is now a nest of art , artisans and all things Tuscan . <p> Lucca was the capital of Tuscany and was fortified with huge walls that you can now walk or cycle around for a great view of the town and the surrounding hills . <p> For a better view climb the steps of either one of the two towers Guinini or Torre delle Ore . <p> Before hitting the stairs up pop down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of the best coffees you will ever have. - A honey soaked pastry or treat along with that and you are ready for the climb . <p> Back on the ground do n't  be afraid to check out every street , you cant get lost and you will find some of the best places where you may not expect like Forno Casali where they make an all corn foccacia that is a unique and delicious bread. - <p> Don be surprised if its still warm from the oven and good luck walking a block without tearing into it . <p> View of Lucca from Torre delle Ore- <p> Street Art Lucca Style <h> 3 . Chianti / Siena <p> If you are lucky enough to have a car on your trip you could not have a more romantic and beautiful drive than through the rolling vineyards of Chianti. - <p> Perfectly cultivated rows of grape vine line the estates along with olive trees , vegetable gardens and flowers. - <p> Lunch at a vineyard or estate is a must and we highly recommend Casamonti Estates . At Casamonti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wine splendid and the estate incredible but you get eat the legendary Cinta Sinese pig. - <p> In fact not only do you get to eat it but you can see the whole process of raising and processing this historic swine into mind bending prosciutto , salami and guanciale , a gigantic cured cheek. - <p> If you call ahead they may even sell you fresh Cinta meat , such as ribs or an arista ( roast ) . <p> At Casamonti Estate <p> Within ten minutes you can drive into the bustling city of Siena. - <p> The walled portion of the city sits up high in the middle and once inside you can walk all through its sloped cobblestone streets and steep stairs . <p> Siena has a long list of museums and galleries worth checking out but you may have a sore neck if you do it all since some of the best paintings are over head . <p> If you 're short on time do n't  miss the Cathedral of Siena , it is a great example of the Italians love of extravagant art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panforte , a dense unleavened fruit cake , originated in Siena and is wonderful with a piece of pecorino cheese and a glass of prosecco . <p> The Cathedral of Siena <p> Inside the Cathedral of Siena <h> 4 . Apuan Alps <p> If your drive through wine country was a little too mundane this drive is sure to clear the cobwebs . <p> Highway 13 from Castelnuovo through the alps to Massa on the other side is the most spectacular piece of dangerous road I have ever driven . <p> A virtual one lane ribbon of pavement glued to the side of the mountains that wiggles its way along the Garfagnana valley , through the Alps ( literally ) and down the mountain side to the ocean . <p> Your reward for braving the insanity , is some of the most incredible views of marble capped peaks and lunar like landscape you can find . <p> Hiking trails are available at every possible stop so you better bring some water , the Apuan Alps produce one of the finest waters in the world , my opinion . - Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We loved the Fonteviva brand , it tasted like you were drinking from a glacial stream . - The fact that we had just climbed a mountain in 40+ Celcius weather may have had something to do with it . <p> Village Along Highway 13 <p> Devils Bridge in Borgo a Mozzano <h> 5 . Viareggio <p> If spending a day driving is not your thing maybe a day at the beach is more your style. - Viareggio- has some of the most interesting beaches we have encountered . <p> The main beach running down the coast through the heart of the city is serviced by a beautiful boardwalk lined with restaurants , shops and gelaterias . <p> The ocean however is only accessible through private beach clubs that own sections of the beach . The clubs will rent you a chair and umbrella on a beautifully kept beach for about +25 a day , people will often rent out space for the summer like a cottage . <p> A Tuscan tan is something to be proud of here and the darker the better , some so dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in like cordwood so good luck flinging a frisbee or tossing around a football . <p> If free is more your style ( you still have to pay for parking ) and you do n't  mind a relatively unkept beach , head towards Torre del Lago and the dunes. - <p> With no trouble at all you can find your own stretch of sand and the people are much more interesting. - No beach chairs here just a few kilometers of drift wood strewn coast , same ocean , same Tuscan sun . <h> Plan Your Trip to Tuscany 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 <p> Booking.com has 15,000+ hotels , apartments and hostels in Tuscany .

Then our time ran out . But I am in love with the sound and sights of Lucca . Thanks for the great pics . <p> Staying in a farmhouse sounds great . Lucca was definitely one of our favourite spots , we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to go back and spend even more time in Tuscany , anywhere in Italy really , European really know how to live . <p> I first fell in love with international travel when studying abroad in Florence . I have been back a couple times and continue to write about it a lot , especially the art and history of the city . You include a couple places I have not been , so thank you for the ideas ! <p> I enjoyed this article very much . We often read articles about Italy and they are about the same places we have heard a thousand times . But this post is like a breath of fresh air because it showcases some unique places ( and it is really interesting ) . I did n't  even know about the Apuan Alps . Well done ! <p> I am surprised to see the Apuan Alps on the list , not many people make their way up there ! We loved that area too ( esp . Barga , which made our Top 5 Tuscany list ) , but Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest . There were so many people , it was hard to enjoy the town . Two more places we ADORE in Tuscany are San Gimignano and Volterra cant wait to go back there . <p> We loved the Apuan Alps so much we drove through twice , loved Barga and San Gimignano . Sorry to hear you did n't  enjoy Florence . It was pretty busy when we were there as was most everywhere in Italy but we got such great advice from our innkeeper that it really made our visit worthwhile . <p> We visited all these wonderful spots when we did a 2 week trip to Tuscany ! A good tip is to stay in the hilltop village overlooking Florence called Fiesole especially in summer as its a bit cooler and less frenetic . It is a quick bus ride down to Florence and buses run frequently . Our Dave part of Tuscany was the Chianti region and encourage yout to look up all the castles in the region . Sipping sundowners and eatin pizza at a trattoria in the main piazza in Sienna was a highlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the region . <p> Sounds like you had a good time . We stayed at a friends apartment that we rented out in Massarosa and drove to all the nearby towns . Ended our Italian leg of the trip with 3 days in Florence . We cant wait to go back . <p> I fell in love with Italy when I stayed in Lucca and with a hire car explored as far as I could drive in a day and then I was lucky in life to live in the historic centre of Florence for many years . And , yes , Chianti , Siena , Volterra , San Gimignano , Monteriggioni , Pisa and many other places hold great memories for me . But , if you have the opportunity to visit Tuscany again I can not recommend more highly unknown la Maremma . It is a land of breathtaking natural beauty where la dolce vita is in everyday simple things that make you smile . Today I visited one of its marshlands and watched a hundred pink flamingos take flight Donna <p> How lucky you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real " city " , the energy reminded us of our days living in Manhattan . Thank you for the tip on ma Maremma , we will definitely check it out next time around . <p> I adore Italy ! I have never been to Tuscany but I am heading there as part of a trip to Umbria in April . The suggestions here and the beautiful photographs have made me even more excited about my trip . The Apuan Alps look particularly stunning . Do you have any suggestions for a good place to take a cooking class ? Would love to do that while I am there . <p> I come from Tuscany , in particolar from Camaiore ( a short drive from Viareggio and Massarosa ) . I lived many years in Florence and since 1 year I am working in Germany . I am very proud of my country , especially since I am living abroad in a modern city , empty of history and with a permanent grey sky . I am very happy when I read also foreigners feel themselves welcome and appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of homesick ! Thank you very much for your blog post ! : ) ) ) <p> Jennifer , sorry that we made you home sick . We felt very welcome throughout Tuscany . Only one person was a little cranky , a shop owner who did n't  want to sell us pine nuts haha . We found Tuscans to be very proud of their region and country and rightly so , it is gods country , so amazingly beautiful . I hope you make it back once in a while . <p> Never been to Italy before , the Devil 's Bridgeis is really nice and beautiful as i can see from the photo above , we are planning for Europe tour by end of this year , maybe to include Italy in our travel plan : ) <p> How not to love Italy ? Food , wine and the loving mediterranean weather I loved Siena and Firenze as they are full of history and art . In Siena , I specially enjoyed the BEST artisan ice-cream ever in a gelattaria nar the left corner of the Palio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 2 ice cream cones ! I hope to get back there . I do agree with you , Pisa is n't worth staying for too long . Half a day is more than enough to know a little . Its just a tower , the baptistery and tons of burglars ! I wish you nice trips ! <p> Tuscany is beautiful and offers such a variety of landscapes and activities for all tastes .. For a less touristy side of the region , I suggest visiting the " Maremma " in the south , still quite unknown to foreigners . Lots of wine tasting , great food , hilltop vineyards medieval villages , beaches ! <p> Thank-you very much for your wonderful advice . My dad and I are travelling to Tuscany in June this year and it gave us heaps of really cool ideas . We loved the idea of driving from Castelnuovo through the alps to Massa . I would love to know more details on this drive , how long it took ? Where you stayed ? Any advice would be great ! <p> Hi guys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rent a house in Tuscany ? It seems cool .. You can book also restaurants and tours and other stuff .. Please write me if someone used it .. <p> What makes it extra-jaw-dropping ? - Renowned for its Italian Art Nouveau architecture , the Tuscan beach town of Viareggio is again in vogue . There is 15-kilometer-long beach that goes- from Forte dei Marmi- in the north- to Viareggio- in the south . I fell in love with the Tuscan Riviera when I went here last summer . The photo is taken at Bagno Arizona in Viareggio . You can also read Caz and Craigs post about it at yTravelblog.

That said , Adelaide is one of the greenest cities in the world , the most affordable city in Australia , and we have a huge passion for sport and the arts . <p> Adelaide has the best of everything Australia offers within 20-minutes of the city centre " who would n't love that ? <p> Best of all , there 's minimal traffic problems in Adelaide . <p> See koalas and other Australian wildlife at Cleland Wildlife Park <h> Things to Do in Adelaide <p> Take in a game of cricket at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by players and one of the few places where you can still sit on the hill ' and have a picnic . <p> Spend an evening at Henley Beach This has to be my favourite area of Adelaide . Beautiful clean beach that not many tourists frequent ( they seem to head to dirty Glenelg ) , wonderful meals , and a great atmosphere in what is turning out to be quite an artsy neighborhood . <p> Take a wine tour We 're mad about our wine and know that ours is the best in Australia " take that Victoria ! I recommend either arranging for a short-stay in one of the wine regions " we have 18 to choose from whether you want to be near the water or close to the city " or doing a Wine tour with a reputable company , such as Groovy Grapes . <p> Enjoy Hahndorf The oldest Germany community in Australia , Hahndorf has n't lost all of it 's old-style architecture or fun , and do n't forget to have a pint at the Hahndorf Inn . <p> Meet the locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia 's native flora and fauna , head to the Adelaide hills and see kangaroos and koalas up close . <p> Explore the River Torrens The river that runs through the heart of the city is small but there is plenty going on . A hub for festivals , paddle boat for some fun , or take the Popeye river cruise . <p> Eat Haighs Chocolate Whilst there is a shop in Rundle Mall , visit the Haighs factory on Greenhill Road to see chocolates being made and taste samples of this South Australian companies chocolate . <p> Chocolate time at Haigh 's Chocolate factory ! <p> Mount Lofty For a view across Adelaide this is the place to visit . It 's quite a way out so if you 're happy with something a little closer to town visit Windy Point instead . <p> Victor Harbour Horse drawn carriages , fairy penguins and cute markets are found in this coastal town about two-hours out of Adelaide . Especially popular in summer with locals who own beach-side properties . <p> Kangaroo Island Made famous by Oprah , Kangaroo Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penguins and of course a few kangaroos ; Kangaroo Island is the perfect place to visit all year round . See a lavender farm , birds of prey display or taste the local produce , there 's plenty to do on this island . <h> Best Neighborhoods to Explore in Adelaide <p> Hahndorf <p> Wander the main street and enjoy a proper German stout at the Hahndorf Inn , enjoy the leather or wood-craft stores , eat some lebkuchen ( that is , gingerbread ) or other traditional German cakes at the bakery , and enjoy the atmosphere . <p> If you have time I highly recommend you walk or take the bus one stop out-of-town to the Beerenberg Farm . The jams and condiments made by Beerenberg can be found around Australia and internationally , and if it 's strawberry season you can pick your own berries to enjoy . <p> Glenelg <p> Connected to the city by Adelaide 's trams ( and the historic carriages on the weekends ) , Glenelg is Adelaide 's busiest beach . Personally , I 'd choose to visit Henley Beach if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't go past the restaurants , bars , shopping and nightlife in Glenelg . <p> Henley Beach is quite an artsy places with plenty of galleries along Seaview Road popping up and a weekend organic market . <p> Rundle Street East <p> In the city centre , but if you 're looking for boutique stores , a range of pubs and plenty of great places to eat then Rundle Street East is your place to go . <p> Be sure to check out the laneways as there are more galleries , more restaurants and more shops than just on the main road ! <h> Where to Eat in Adelaide <p> Restaurants <p> Lenzerheide " celebrating Adelaide 's abundant fresh food and Swiss/Austrian cuisine , the Lenzerheide has taken home a slew of awards , including Best European Restaurant ' . Located 10 minutes out of the city the restaurant is easy to get to by public transport or car . <p> I highly recommend the potato &amp; leek soup and the chateaubriant ( roasted beef tenderloin ) at this somewhat pricey , but worth it , restaurant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once sister restaurants ) , Alphutte brings German and Austrian cuisine to Adelaide . Centrally located on the corner of Pultney St and Wakefield St , the prices are quite expensive by Adelaide-standards . <p> Estia " If you took my advice and headed to Henley Beach then Estia is the restaurant I 'd recommend you dine at . Greek cuisine in Henley Square , tapas or single servings , a laid-back family atmosphere , and the sounds of the beach in the background " do I need to say more ? <p> GoodLife Pizza " Hutt Street has plenty of choices but I go for cheap and cheerful Good Life pizza any day of the week . Wood oven fired organic pizza which not only is healthy but tasty " perfecto . <p> Dumpling King " A student favourite in China town . Cheap , cheerful , and tasty Chinese food on a budget . The dumplings are n't standout but when you 're paying AU$6 for a plate of 15 , I 'm not complaining . Top picks are the pork dumplings and the silver thread loaf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just off of Rundle Street East on Bent Street ( next to American Apparel ) . Highly recommend one of their curries and some samosas ! <p> Welcome to chocolate heaven at the Chocolate Bean Cafe <p> Cafes <p> Chocolate Bean " have you ever wanted to try chocolate soup ? Well this is the place to do it . Located on Union Street , just off of Rundle Street East , they serve great sandwiches and chocolate everything ! They 're also vegan and vegetarian friendly . <p> Cibo Espresso Alright , I 'm not much for chains but in Adelaide Cibo does coffee best . Located through the city and metropolitan area and expanding rapidly into Queensland and other Australian states , their coffee knocks all of the competition out of the water . <p> Zambreros gourmet Mexican food . I 'm talking close to foot-long burritos burritos made in front of you . There are two great things about Zambreros : 1 . they 're open late . 2 . They can serve beer and tequila ! <h> Where to Drink in Adelaide <p> The Duke ( of York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the back and DJ + dance floor upstairs Thursday til Sunday makes it the perfect place to hang and have a good time . <p> Zhivago One of Adelaide 's newest and perhaps most edgy club , Zhivago is one of the hottest places to be and perfect for the inner hipster . <p> The Austral if you want a pub , a real pub , with a pub atmosphere , the Austral on Rundle Street East is the place that you need to go . Three areas , a few video games , seating out the front and a bar " what more do you need ? <h> Where to Stay in Adelaide <p> If you 're looking for a central location that 's budget friendly my top choice would be Adelaide Central YHA . Located in Light Square it 's a two blocks to Rundle Mall " Adelaide 's main shopping strip and there are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby . <p> If you 're after luxury in Adelaide then you ca n't go past the Intercontinental Adelaide . On North Terrace , you are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torrens River , Rundle Mall , the museums , and even Adelaide Zoo ! <p> If you are wanting a beachside getaway be sure to enquire about Oaks Liberty Towers and Oaks Plaza Pier at Glenelg . One is on the water and Marina whilst the other is one street back . Offering larger apartment-style rooms it is a great choice for families looking to stretch out and relax . <p> If boutique is more your style then I 've heard good things about the Clarion Hotel Soho . Slick , sexy and modern , the Clarion Hotel Soho is perfect boutique hotel for a couple 's getaway . <p> For more places to stay in Adelaide choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com . You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> BEst Markets and Shopping in Adelaide <p> My personal favourite type of shopping is through little boutiques and King William Road , Hyde Park and Rundle Street East take the cake for choices . King William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild Child for a great range , though sizes do run small . <p> Rundle Street has big name bands like Australian designer Lisa Ho and Zimmerman to favourite miss gladys sym choon and alternative chain , Dangerfield . There are also some quirky boutiques in the backstreets including Mid-West Traders . <p> Go shopping at Miss Gladys Sym Choon on Rundle Street East <p> Adelaide love their markets , but the one closest to our heart has to be Adelaide 's Central Market . Open Monday to Saturday the restaurant is home to fresh produce from across the state , an array of boutique stalls , as well as a camera store and second-hand book seller . If you want a quick , cheap , fresh bite then this is the place to go . <p> Adelaide also has a Farmers Market at the Wayville Showgrounds . Farmers from across the state come every Sunday to sell their produce and cut out the middle man , meaning you get great tasting produce and get to support farmers from around the state . There 's everything from fruit &amp; veg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If fashion and design are more your style then the Gillies Street Market , which happens twice a month , will be a winner with you . Find your inner vintage goddess amongst live music and food stalls . <p> Taste cordials and lots more at the Adelaide Farmers Market at Wayville Showgrounds <h> Events and Festivals in Adelaide <p> January we play host to the Tour Down Under . Forgiving all the locals who will done lycra and think they are the next Cadel Williams , Adelaide puts on a good show . Think outdoor parties by the Torrens River , a big parade welcoming the athletes , 7-days of intense racing through the best areas of South Australia , and of course " street parties , the chance for many of the neighborhoods that riders will start/finish in to host a party and celebrate what 's best in that area . <p> For four weeks during February and March Australia 's largest arts event , the Adelaide Fringe Festival comes to town . Similar to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival , Adelaide opens its doors to artists from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comedy , circus , dance , film , theatre , puppetry , music , visual art and design . <p> Adelaide Fringe Festival is a flurry of dance , cabaret , circus and comedy " favourite show has to go to Hans ' <p> The Clipsal 500 is the beginning of a busy March . V8 supercars turn the cities East into a race track . Its not just the V8 Supercars that will take to the track as the GT championship is back in 2013 , as well as playing host to the Dunlop racing series . <p> WOMADelaide , the dance , music and arts festival is held mid-March . A unique music experience runs over four days in the cities Botanic Park and show cases performances and workshops by the best traditional and contemporary musicians , dancers and DJs . WOMADelaide also has a very cool Taste the World ' cooking program and environmental discussion forum , and supports a number of charitable causes . Best of for families , all kids 12 and under get free entry into the festival ! <p> If contemporary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend checking out the Future Music Festival . A one-day festival from noon til 10pm , Future Music Festival showcases the best of up &amp; coming or the summers top performers . This year features big name performers like The Prodigy , Bloc Party , Dizzee Rascal , Rita Ora , Ellie Goulding , Fun , The Temper Trap and Psy " and that 's not even half the line up ! <p> Adelaide is also home to the Schutzenfest in January " the cities equivalent to a German beer fest ; the Adelaide Festival , an arts festival which runs alongside the Fringe Festival in March , and the Adelaide Cabaret Festival in June . There 's also the Adelaide Fashion Festival in October for the fashionistas among us ! <h> Getting Around Adelaide <p> If you 're in the city centre it 's pretty easy to walk around between the main sites or take the free connector bus . <p> If you 're heading to Glenelg , from one side of the city to the other , King William Road , or the Entertainment Centre , I recommend you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on or off , and if you 're travelling through the city its free ! <p> I 'd recommend visitors use buses to get around but to make your own decision check out the Adelaide Metro website or visit the Adelaide Metro store on the corner of Currie Street and King William Street in the city to plan your journeys . <h> Finding WiFi in Adelaide <p> Adelaide is n't the most WiFi friendly city . I 'd say that all hotels and hostels will have WiFi , and many cafes will but it wo n't be the best quality . <p> If you 're having connection problems I 'd check out China Town and Grote Street as there is quite a few Internet cafes , otherwise check out Internodes Hot Spot locations for cafes that offer free WiFi . <h> Best Time of Year to Visit Adelaide <p> Little tip from a local " visit between January and March . Not only will you get the best weather but this is when Adelaide really shines and proves that it can compete with Melbourne and Sydney . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting There and Away ? <p> Adelaide is a big city and serviced by all Australian airlines ( Qantas , Virgin Australia , Jetstar ) , including many regional ones . <p> Getting from the airport to the city is easy . It 's about AU$15-20 for a taxi or there are airport JetBus services from the city and many surrounding suburbs . <p> If you prefer the scenic route , Adelaide is the heart of many of the overland train journeys offered by Great Southern Rail . Take the Ghan from Adelaide to Darwin , via . Alice Springs ; The Indian Pacific from Sydney to Perth , via Adelaide ; the Overland from Melbourne to Adelaide ; or the Southern Spirit from Adelaide to Brisbane , via . Melbourne . <p> Trains get into the station at Mile End , and though only minutes from the city I recommend you take a taxi or catch a public bus from Richmond Road . <p> If you prefer taking the bus then they arrive at the Adelaide Central Bus Station . Two choices of operators are Greyhound Australia and Firefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a view of the city , a great place for a picnic or somewhere to go ice blocking ( yes , you sit on a rug on a huge piece of ice and hurtle down a hill ! ) then I recommend visiting Lights Point . <p> Enjoy the view over Adelaide from Light 's PointTake a walk along the River Torrens or find a quiet spot for a picnic <h> - I love Adelaide because <p> Adelaide has the beaches people travel to Sydney for , the arts &amp; culture of Melbourne , plenty of great food , but the laid back attitude of a small city/country town , which makes Adelaide a brilliant blend of everything I want in a city . <h> Plan Your Trip to Adelaide <p> Booking.com has over 150 properties in Adelaide including hotels , apartments , and hostels .

For a city with such a strange and unusual- history , its steeped with culture and awesomeness . <p> For a city with such a strange and unusual- history , its steeped with culture and awesomeness . <p> There a million reasons to love the- land of McDreamy , but I recommend just visiting and deciding for yourself what makes- you fall in love . <h> What to Do in Seattle <p> If its your first time in Seattle , make sure you hit the typically hyped tourist attractions. - Theyre necessary adventures , not to mention famous attractions for a reason . <p> Take a- trip up The Space Needle , visit the first Starbucks and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hop on the brass pig and try some flavor infused honey sticks . <p> Feel- free to use fruit humor when talking to the produce guys . Its a perfectly acceptable- form of communication . <p> The Underground Tour in Seattle provides great historical- background as well as gives you the Readers Digest version of its surly past . Its not- something you 'll do again but you 'll start to notice and appreciate the little nuances- downtown ( like the skylights in the sidewalk ) that you would n't have noticed before . <p> underground tour <p> Take a ferry ride to Bainbridge Island to get a different perspective on the city as well as- to experience some local living . Its homely charm will make you think you 're walking- through a fairytale . <p> Of course , if you 're really adventurous , take a tour of Mount Rainier and a hike if you 're up for climbing one of the countrys most dangerous and active- volcanoes . <p> I prefer to view it from the plane but I 'm not nearly as ballsy as some of you- hiking enthusiasts ! <p> Mt Rainier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely my favorite area of Seattle . You can find anything and- everything to do on this hill . Each bar has more flavor and atmosphere than the last . The- eateries are just as unique . <p> The second-hand stores and novelty shops are bound to delight- and you will even find a centurys old ballroom packed with couples dancing to jazz- music weekly . What more could you ask for ? <h> Where to Eat in Seattle <p> If Seattleites know how to do anything well its coffee ( its why I love them- so ) . <p> Starbucks , Tullys , and Seattles Best were all founded here . And while- you cant go wrong with any of these choices , I recommend trying one of the- smaller but equally delicious cafes like Victrola . <p> Victrola <p> You ca n't visit Seattle without trying a triple layer cappuccino and Victrola has a great- one . Its 1/3 espresso , 1/3 milk , and 1/3 foam . They are more expensive than a traditional- cappuccino but I promise the extra few cents are worth the deliciousness- waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of healthy options for lunch dining . <p> I am a fan of The Honeyhole on Pike Street . They- have sandwiches for everyone , including awesome vegetarian options . <p> Dinner Dining Delights <p> Want to treat yourself to the ultimate seafood experience ? Have a bowl- of clam chowder or lobster bisque at- Ivars- Acres of Clams . The fish couldnt be any fresher- and you 'll adore the waterfront views . Its the perfect upscale dining experience after- a day of fun on the pier and exploration at The Seattle Aquarium . <p> My other favorite ultimate dining experience is The Steelhead Diner located just steps from Pikes- Place . Do n't  let the name fool you . You 're in an array of aromas and flavor , even with- perfected seasonal desserts to please your palate . Service can be slow but the food is oh-so worth the wait . <p> Steelhead diner <h> Where to Drink in Seattle <p> I 'm not a big fan of drinking but Capitol Hill makes bar hopping easy . With them being- squished together in close proximity , you can down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stumble ten feet to the next bar to high-five new friends . <p> While you- wont find the bartenders overly friendly ( they 're hipster like that ) , you 'll be sure to meet- visitors from around the world sampling brew . <p> I enjoy spending time at The- Tin Table- conveniently located across from The Century Ballroom . The ambiance- is groovy , quiet , and laid back . <p> During the week you 'll find dances of all kinds hopping- across the hall . Have a drink and then- have a dance . And if you get too drunk you- can always just stare at the pretty blue glasses . <p> Tin Table <h> Best Places for a Night on the Town in Seattle <p> Who does n't  like a night of good food and dancing ? Start by having a drink at one of the bazillion pubs off of Pike and Broadway . Then mosey on over to The Century Ballroom for a night of dancing and jazz/salsa/or swing music ( depending on the night ) . <p> Century Ballroom <p> After you 've worked up a sweat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parlor. - I do n't  care what time of year it is . You must try one of their delicious homemade flavors- that 's made in the back of their shop . I recommend the lavender-honey or strawberry-balsamic . <p> Also , make sure you treat yourself to a fresh waffle cone . The sweet smell of- the cooked sugar will make your heart melt , even if the weather is freezing . <p> Molly Moons Ice Cream <h> Where to Stay in Seattle <p> There are tons of options but I 'm a big fan of The Silver Cloud Hotel . They have a chain of boutique hotels- situated all over Seattle , but I love their Broadway location . Their room prices are decent , - even given their prime locale and a big breakfast is included . <p> During peak season rooms- will run about $130/night . And even though this is kind of expensive for backpackers like- me , you 're guaranteed a level of quality when booking with this chain . <p> If you 're looking for something waterside , I recommend the appropriately- named Edgewater Hotel. - This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The price per night will depend- on what type of package you book ( they offer a wide array from honeymooners to- family getaways ) . Their cheapest rooms run $200/night during peak season . <p> Edgewater Hotel <p> For more places to stay in Seattle choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com. - <h> Markets &amp; Shopping in Seattle <p> Make a visit to Pike Place Market a must . But I 'm biased . I could probably spend days in Pikes Place eating myself to happiness . Plus- all the fresh flowers , kitschy knickknacks shops , - and interesting international markets- gives it such color and vibrancy . <p> But my thoughts are controlled by the mini deep-fried- doughnuts available by the pig . They are mind numbingly yummy . If you eat them you- will only think amazing things about Pikes Place . Consider yourself warned . <p> Flowers at Pikes Place <p> Downtown Seattle also- has some great shopping . Youve got streets lined with mainstream designers and a mall- full of credit card comas waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I prefer- the unusual shops of Pioneer- Square . Here you can find crystal shops that put a price on mysticism and hipster- guitar centers full of vintage Fenders and vinyl records . I promise you there 's a specialty- shop for every unique soul in this wonderfully weird district . <p> Pioneer Square <h> Getting Around Seattle <p> The bus system is very reliable , consistent , and cheap . I highly recommend it if youre- going to be navigating all the typical tourist attractions . Downtown and Capital Hill- themselves are not large areas but they 're set up much like San Francisco . <p> Taking the bus- can be beneficial to your knees instead of hoofing it up-and-down Skid Row . The Light- Rail is also a great way to get from the Sea-Tac airport to downtown Seattle . <h> Tours , Sightseeing &amp; Passes <p> Viator- is the industry leader when it comes to tours , activities , tickets and passes with a list of hand-picked tours and things to do in Seattle- from local insiders . <p> Check out the Seattle City Pass- which gives you- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving you time and money . <h> Finding WiFi in Seattle <p> It better be , what with it being the home of Microsoft and coffee shop sitters ! Pretty- much every coffee shop has free WiFi or WiFi time available with purchase . <p> I have yet to- find a location that does not offer internet access . But if you do happen upon one of those- dark unicorns , make sure you cry , " Heretic ! " The Seattleites will run to your rescue with- pitchforks . Treason like this is rarely tolerated by the steadfast locals . <h> Best Time of Year to Visit Seattle <p> Peak season is definitely March through August . Because of all the rain you are- guaranteed the prettiest flower blooms , best weather for outdoor activities , and variety of- festivals during the height of the summer . <p> If you 're brave and decide to visit during the- fall/winter off-season , be sure to bring a waterproof jacket and rain boots . <h> Best insider Tip for travel to Seattle <p> Do n't  trust the cab companies when they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like its going out of style . Plus they normally take at least a half hour to reach you- anyway . <p> I recommend learning the bus routes and utilizing those as much as possible . <p> Seattleites do n't  use umbrellas but do n't  view this as a competition . Feel free to pack one- if you 're planning on spending a lot of time outside ( just do n't  ask them what they think- about you carrying one ) . Invest in some sturdy rain boots and a weatherproof jacket for- walking around . <p> The goal is to stay dry . If you stay dry , you wont be nearly as cold as you think . And after running through your first downpour , I think you 'll realize why these- Seattleites are such hot beverage freaks . <h> I love Seattle because <p> For me , Seattle is a blend of everything that 's great in the world . The city is brimming- with delicious espresso , culture , art , open-mindedness , jazz music , and intellect . It has- three-story bookstores and libraries that are built to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire city is filled with a salty breeze from The Harbor and all the- food is made with quality and ingenuity unmatched on the west coast . <p> There 's just something about Seattle that feels like happiness . Its got a very distinct vibe- and flavor and I love that . You 'll never be bored . Its a place where people are n't  afraid to- be themselves and that resonates deeply with me . <p> penguin hugs <p> Some cities just look and feel like every other city , but Seattle gets my seal of approval- for its originality and personality . And I double dog dare you to find another city like it . Happy Adventuring ! <p> Hilary is a Las Vegas local and world traveler .

Lived downtown for 2 years and it instantly became my favorite US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and there 's so much more if you go again see the neighborhoods of Freemont and Ballard to name two or hit the Olympic Sculpture Park , spend an hour at the butterfly pavilion or go walk the sandy beach of Golden Gardens . <p> Definitely hit up Ballard . Some of the best food in the city is there . Also Madison Park . Discovery park is a great place to escape for a hike in the city , but if you need to clock some miles head to Green Lake to run the loop around the lake . After Green Lake head to Zoka Coffee for some of the best roast in the city . The city is an amazing place to live . My favorite months ? August and September because there is no rain . October because it is the perfect autumn month ! <p> Thanks for the great tips ! I have n't spent much time in Seattle yet , but would love to go back . The pike Place fish market is definitely on the list , along with some good seafood and I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ithe hates people who carry umbrellas with a passion ! <p> We just moved to Seattle last summer . Yes , the winter was BRUTAL ! So much grey . So little sky . But it is by far the most breathtakingly beautiful city . Its been such a blast to explore with my kids . I adore living next to Puget Sound . Weve explored so many beaches , lakes , and other nooks and crannies . Love it ! Havent made it to the underground old Seattle yet . Definitely on the bucket list , along with a whale watching trip ! <p> Your photos took me back to a family vacation in October 2002 . Three glorious weeks with no rain whatsoever . The leaves in so many colors were just wonderful . I live in Puerto Rico , so the change in scenery was outstanding . I did almost everything you mention , ( sadly no Underground Tour ) and I enjoy every single place we went . <p> The Science Center and Kids Museum , steps away from the Space Needle , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially nice . We drove north and visited Olympic Game Farm , an experience we never had . <p> I am planning to take my daughter again and again to such a beautiful and charming city . <p> Seattle is such a beautiful city , especially in the summer time . But what would be a memorable stay without getting to know Seattle areas ? If you 're visiting Seattle , make sure you get to know areas from Capitol Hill to Ballard . They have some really cool activities ( bars , rock climbing , beaches , etc. ) = <p> Hillary has used the more colloquial Pikes Place . From my research online it seems as if this is an accepted reference , perhaps more local talk . <p> We like more informal posts on this blog as it helps the reader feel like they are more amongst friends . <p> But since , out of a 2000 word post offering extremely helpful tips on Seattle , people cant help but pick out one reference that is really not a mistake , I have added Pike Place Market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awesome . You might be able to add a tip that is not in this post that would really help our readers . I know theyd appreciate it a lot . I 'm certainly keen to visit and learn more . <p> ( 1 ) RE : " From my research online it seems as if this is an accepted reference , perhaps more local talk . " =It is NOT acceptable . It is NOT local talkLocals know the correct names of places . Please tell where online you found reference to this error . ( 2 ) RE : " people ca n't help but pick out one reference that is really not a mistake . " =What do you mean people cant help it ? It IS a mistake . 3 ) RE : " I 'm certainly keen to visit and learn more . " = If you have n't visited , how can you comment ? ( 4 ) RE : " Perhaps you 'd like to share why you think Seattle is awesome . " =Everything about Seattle is awesome and it would take volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how . My point in commenting on your error was not to tell what I think of Seattle , but to correct what YOU think , which is wrong , and to have you correct the information that your readers will assume is the truth . ( 5 ) RE : " We like more informal posts on this blog " =Are you saying that informal means errors are all right ? Your error of publishing the erroneous " Pikes Place is NOT " more colloquial , " and your saying so makes it even more of a mistake . ** BY THE WAY , where is my original comment for the first reply ? I posted 2 identical replies for both of the commenters , who called attention to your error . <p> I deleted your other comment because I did not realize you had replied to it , I thought you had posted it the second time because the first one had not been approved yet , so you thought it must not have gone through . It happens all the time . There 's really no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to visit Seattle and learn more about it for when I go . Not sure your response to 3 . Maybe you are confusing me with the person who wrote this post , Hillary Billings . I have n't been to Seattle , but am very keen . <p> I have no problem with names being called the right thing , which is why I corrected it in the page . I also have no problem with people letting me know so I can fix it . You have a pretty awesome post here on things to do in Seattle . It would have been great for you to comment on that first , perhaps leave a suggestion or two and then say , btw I 'm not sure if you knew but Pikes Place should be Pike Place Market . And then I say , " Oh gosh thank you so much for letting us know . Btw , love your tip . " <p> Just a personal gripe of mine . From my years of teaching experience , children listen better to your feedback and respect you more when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just makes for a healthier exchange . <p> But , of course at the end of the day you were right ! Thank you for pointing out our mistakes and making today a good learning day for us . <p> Now , I really would love to know something you can recommend about Seattle . Where is your favourite place to eat and why ? I 've heard nothing but good things about the city and am super keen to learn more . We should be going there on our road trip around the States in 2 years . What should we put on our list of things to do and see ? Food is always a biggie for us and our readers . <p> These are some fantastic suggestions and tips . Seattle is an incredible city . We love wandering through the different neighborhoods ( Queen Anne , Capitol Hill , Magnolia , etc. ) to experience the different views , restaurants and people . The Emerald City is easily one of the most diverse places weve ever been , and that 's what makes it so unique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle , " check out our website : http : //seattlebloggers.com ! <p> The MUST EAT ice cream in Seattle is definitely Bluebird Microcreamery &amp; Brewery in Capitol Hill , Fremont and Greenwood . Not only do they have the best ice cream in town , they they also brew their own microbrew ( very Seattle ) and specialize in beer floats ! <p> I live in the greater Seattle area and own several large hooded rain coats . I use my umbrella for standing on the sidelines watching the kids play sports . i have spent the night at the Edgewater Hotel and thought the restaurant was poor however there are several other fantastic places along the waterfront to eat . Ivars is a favorite . Pike place is more than meets the eye , be a little snoopy and check out its multi levels as well as across the street you can easily spend the whole day exploring all the little shops and restaurants . Pioneer Square offers a wide variety of pubs and bars with live music from blues to grunge for some easy bar hopping fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the LOUDEST stadium around for some fantastic football . If you make it to Ballard check out the Locks . A ferry ride is a must , you can take a high speed one to Vancouver B.C. or the San Juan Islands for a day or an overnight excursion . Or a quick round trip to Vashon or Bainbridge on a Super Ferry is just as fun . You can ride to the top of the Space needle for free if you dine in the restaurant , however it is quite spendy but you can always just order a drink and appetizer or coffee and dessert so you can relax and enjoy the 360 deg . View from the revolving restaurant for a fraction of the price of dinner . If you ca n't drive clear to Mt . Rainier maybe you can go to Snoqualmie falls instead . I like the lounge for appetizer and drinks with a view because again the restaurant can be pricy . The water plays a big part in our lives , whether were trying to stay dry , viewing its splendor or gliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet in Seattle ! <p> It is simply Pike Place , not Pikes Place . It truly is a lovely city though . Have you checked out charming Wallingford ? Or Discovery park ? Fremont is also fun to go through and they have a great farmers market ! Another favorite is Bakery Nouvea over in West Seattle . Going in you feel as though you have been transported to the bakeries in Paris ! <p> We will be spending 4 days in Seattle in mid June . I am so pleased I found these ideas / travel tips for Seattle . I shall use them as great resources for our time in this city . Thanks ! Cowra , NSW , Australia . <p> I agree with a lot of what the author is saying . But he missed sooo much more on the to do list . Ive been in Seattle and the puget sound area for 30 Years . You will not find anywhere else like Seattle . Yes , pike place is cool . But extremely crowded . Capital Hill is fun but no where near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks . The food is amazing everywhere , but the outlining cities offer so much more . These places are usually one bus ride away . Places like Ballard , Greenwood , Fremont , shoreline , edmonds , lynnwood . These are a small amount of cities that boarder Seattle . Give me a shot . Oh and go for a ride on " The Ducks " ! <p> Check out The Lodge restaurant located on 4th and Spring . Its fun to take a ferry to Bainbridge Island for the day or for dinner . Its just $8.00 per person round trip if you walk on . Columbia Tower is the tallest building in Seattle they have murals on the walls so you know what you are looking at . Take a water taxi to West Seattle to take great pictures of Seattle . They also have a restaurant there called Fried Chicken and Whiskey that I heard is to die for . <p> We have just completed a post about Seattles Underground Tour and we hope that you 'll have a look at it . If its interesting enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun things that they can expect in Seattle <p> Hello ! I just opened a new store in West Seattle called The General Store Seattle and I wanted to take a moment to introduce you to our varied &amp; unique selection of local products , many of which are great souvenirs for visitors . Why get stuck with a coffee mug made in China when you can get a beautiful cutting board in the shape of Washington made right in the PNW ? We have even made up a small sampler package for those that want a variety of items ! I would love to invite you to come check out the store so that we can put a face to a name . Let me know if you have any questions , thanks ! <p> I have to come and see you . I own Alki Bike and Board in the Admiral District . See post about waterfront construction : Downtown Waterfront Construction Get away from the construction and noise on the Downtown waterfront . It 's easy to catch the West Seattle Water Taxi at pier 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the best views of the Seattle Skyline and the Olympic Mountains . There are also many other activities on Alki Beach including , volley ball skateboarding , bicycle riding , hiking and kayaking just to name a few . From the Elliot Bay Water Taxi you can catch a shuttle bus that takes you to the top of the hill on California Ave . to visit Alki Bike and Board . There you can rent a variety of bicycles including electric bikes . Children 's bikes and trailers are also available to rent as well as longboards . <p> I live here so it was intriguing reading about your experience . A favorite of my familys for dining out are any of the three restaurants owned by Ethan Stowell that all happen to be next store to each other ; Staple and Fancy , The Walrus and the Carpenter , and Chippys ( In Ballard ) . If I do n't  end it here , I 'll be typing out a paragraph of things to visit or do in Seattle . P.S. beware of what 's living under the Freemont bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours but really want to see the Underground areas . Are there access points that you do n't  need a tour guide but are still legal to go into ? Can I do the Underground Tour without a guide might sound cheap but I know the history pretty well , I just want to see it and not pay 20 bucks for a tour . <p> Loved this article . Taking a trip to Hawaii this fall and have a long layover in Seattle ( flying from Boston ) . We have a small child and are worried about getting to and from the airport workout renting a car and seat .. would the light rail be our best choice to get from the airport to downtown ? We want to eat and see the needle , is that possible south a 6 hour layover ? <p> Anyhow , I really enjoyed your blog post . I 'm taking the day to read about other peoples experience in Seattle since I recently came back from an amazing trip there . I wrote about it here if you 're interested http : **38;748;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm going to Seattle , Washington for a week in mid-March ! Besides meeting the three aforementioned criteria , Seattle has so much going for it : right on the water with lots of islands a ferry ride away , tons of parks to hike in , great museums , and underground tours , to name a few . here 's an excerpt from Y Travels Guide to Seattle :

Just like I wanted it every time I watched another TV episode in Australia of Getaway or the Great Outdoors . <p> I was shocked when I 'd hear behind the scenes tales of just how un-glamorous and exhausting it could be . Yeah right ! It did n't matter how exhausting it sounded , I knew that was the life for me . Getting paid to travel was more attractive than teaching you want to know exhausting ! <p> It turns out travel blogging is exhausting , and really not very lucrative , especially in the early years of your business , just like most businesses . <p> BUT , it IS a damn site better for me than teaching and I love it . I 've never worked longer hours and I 've been ejected so far out of my comfort zone that I no longer recognize the planet I 'm on , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild ride and I 'd do it all over again this time much smarter ! <p> So , firstly let 's answer some commonly asked questions about how to make money travel blogging we consistently get in our inbox from people wanting- the travel lifestyle a travel blog can bring . <p> here 's a content guide for this post on making money travel blogging .

You can make money off almost anything , either directly or indirectly . It 's incredible the doors that can open once you build an audience around something , and its amazing the amount of people I 've met who make money off their passions . <p> The best way to earn an income travel blogging is by doing something you love and are good at . But you 've got to earn it . Youve got to build a foundation , a brand , an audience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your foundation in place first . By that I mean things like : <p> You cant build a skyscraper on a one inch slab of concrete .

Ill move you through the six stages of business to help you create a profitable business and lifestyle you love around your travel blog . Check out more here about how to move your blog to business <h> Is it easy to make money as a travel blogger ? <p> No . But it could be easier if you- learn how to create a business and make money travel blogging from the start . <p> There 's a learning curve and it takes an investment of time and commitment like any business . It involves a lot of smarts and learning from the right people . <p> We 've made huge mistakes , but over the past year have- figured out how to do it the best way for us , and there will be a best way for everyone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , time commitment , goals , location , travel experience , and demographic . <p> Different doors can open whether you 're a family travel blogger , couple or solo . Whether you 're based in Australia , Europe , North America or elsewhere . Whether your strong at photography , or writing , or video . There are many variables at play . <p> Were always innovating and growing and adding different income streams to our travel blog and using our data to evaluate how were making money travel blogging , what 's working , and what needs to change . <p> Experience , and having the right teachers helps immensely . <p> I want to be upfront with you " travel blogging takes a lot of time and energy and other blogging niches appear to provide a better income . It also takes an investment of money but much smaller than if you were building a brick and mortar business but still you 're going to have costs . <p> If you treat it like a business from the get-go , and that means investing in education , tools and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as a hobby . <h> What 's the best way to make money travel blogging ? <p> Think like an entrepreneur , not an employee . It 's a huge mental cross over and if you 're not ready for it , it could take you out of the game . <p> You 're no longer trading time for money , but trading value for money . <p> Grow- to the point where you have a lot of value to exchange . That 's the best way to make money- as a travel blogger . <p> You ca n't come into travel blogging and expect to be partnering with brands on paid campaigns or getting comped trips after two months of blogging . <p> It 's a marathon , not a sprint . <p> Put in the hard yards to establish your credibility , build your value and- build a community . If you do n't , you 're building a business on peanuts and they wo n't get you too far out of the jungle . <p> It took us two years of intense work before money started flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last year that we 've seen a healthy profit . <p> The best way to make money travel blogging depends on what skills and value you can bring to the table - play to your strengths . <p> Be creative . Be different . Explore many different income avenues . <h> How much money can you earn as a travel blogger ? <p> There is no simple answer to this . Too many variables at play . It 's totally up to you and the audience you build around your brand . <p> I suggest you set big goals and then work towards them step by step . I think the higher your goals the more you 'll grow and the more you 'll eventually earn . Some people like to set more realistic goals . <p> I just put out the big numbers and then believe I can move closer to that . You know the saying , shoot for the moon and land amongst the stars ! <p> Some travel bloggers make a few hundred dollars a month , some a thousand and some even more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their travel blogs . <h> What are your financial independence goals ? <p> The majority of travel bloggers can earn enough money for them to live well in developing countries . This is a very worthy goal . As long as you are happy and living a good life , then it does n't  matter where you live or how high your income can grow . <p> If you can reach that state of happy financial independence by living in a country where your expenses are much lower , then that could be a raging success . <p> But for me , especially with our kids , I did n't want to have to live in a developing country to hit financial independence . I wanted to be able to earn enough , no matter where I lived . That was the whole point to us starting a travel blog in the first place to have time freedom , to be location independent . <p> We wanted the freedom to live wherever we choose . That involves being able to survive , as a family , in a place as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reached that level now . <p> Twelve Apostles Great Ocean Road <p> We earn six figures because of our travel blog . This is not normal , its the top tier level " BUT , and this is one of my life 's mantras " if we can do it , so can you . <p> Adopt this as your mantra too . <p> If someone else has done it , it 's evidence you can too . Now all you have to do is learn and carve out your own path AND why not try and do even better ? <p> It 's exactly why we share this information on our travel blog . We want you to believe you can do it and we want you to go out and do it too ! <p> You can achieve a full-time income from your travel blog when you focus on longevity , establishing your authority and credibility first , and building a loyal following that you give a lot of value to . <p> You 've got to help your peeps believe in their own dreams and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Join our free Digital Lifestyle Travel Tribe and grab some free training to help you make money travel blogging : <h> How do we make money travel blogging ? <p> We are not big believers of having one income stream . We like multiple income streams . It 's safer . <p> Before I started travel blogging , I once had 9 part-time jobs . I was n't taking any chances if one of them should get all plugged up . Besides , I hated the box of a ground-hog-day job . <p> The thing you must understand and this ties in so well to the value thing you will not make much money OFF your travel blog ( you can but you need super high traffic numbers ) but BECAUSE of your travel blog . <p> Blogging can open up many doors for you , but they wo n't open until you 're established as an authority figure and have a strong readership base . If you want this to be a long-term lifestyle then treat it as such . I see far too many travel bloggers getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . That might be all that you want and that 's fine if you do it in an ethical and credible way , but its not a viable long-term business plan . <p> CAVAET : Take it from someone who travelled for 12 years before starting a travel blog ( and then getting free trips ) Free press trips are the WORST way to travel . If you just want to travel the world for free , and you have no higher purpose for starting a travel blog , then do n't start one ! It 's too much time and effort . <p> Get our travel eBook , and discover the many other amazing ways you can get free or cheap travel . It 's less responsibility and WAY more fun ! <p> If you want to make money as a travel blogger , you need a long-term business plan , not a free ride . <p> Back to how we make money travel blogging. <h> 1 . Our own products <p> Man , this took us 3 years too long to dive into this income stream . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel blog . It was my damn insecurities and fears that got in the way . <p> I 've just finished my exciting 30 day Money Cleanse helping you develop a better relationship with the stuff that will help you travel more ! <p> I have my premium training : How to move from Blog to Business- and I have collaborated on a course with my business coach and his wife called Confidence Igniter its all about gaining confidence and control in your life essentials for success and happiness in any aspect of your life . <p> So when you write that business plan of yours for your travel blog , start investigating the different products you can create and the value you can provide through them . ( Be creative , there 's so much you can do ) <h> 2 . Paid marketing campaigns with brands and tourism boards <p> I know what we do looks like a lot of fun and it is , but we also do a lot of work behind the scenes promoting destinations . <p> We work with destinations to promote their experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them to choose activities , experiences and destinations that we know we 'll enjoy , that are of high quality and we know our readers will be interested in . <p> We do n't  participate in campaigns that do n't  fit with our brand or readers , and very rarely go on group campaigns with other bloggers or media . We just do n't think that it best fits with our travel story and we just like to do our own thing . <h> 3 . Making money with Sponsored posts <p> Yes , we do sponsored posts , and we 've been doing them for three years now . A few times a month we 'll have a sponsored post published on our site . This is when a brand wants us to promote their product or experience for any particular reason . Again , we choose carefully based upon the criteria above . <p> We 'll share products or services we understand , believe in , would use ourselves and we think is valuable to share . And we disclose , and so must you . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose credibility . <p> Sponsored posts are basically like an advertisement that is written by us . Sometimes these may come in the form of a sponsored social media update as well . <h> 4 . Speaking <p> Something I 'm really enjoying lately is public speaking . <p> I was a teacher for 15 years so have no problem getting up on stage to share my thoughts and experiences . It 's definitely something I want to do more of and am really digging into to sharpen my abilities in this arena . <p> Lately Ive been presenting at conferences organized by tourist boards , but have spoken at several blogging and social media conferences such as Problogger and SoMeT . Some speaking gigs are paid while others are n't . <p> It 's a case by case basis depending on the packages offered . And it has to be a pretty awesome package for me to leave our road trip and family if they want me to speak without any compensation . <h> 5 . Mentoring and coaching <p> We have a private mentoring group that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of income , but I put it here as we actually offer a mentoring bonus instead of just taking the affiliate commission and sending them on their way to fend for themselves . So it 's a fair amount of work that we put into it . <p> We offer coaching calls where we share our tips and insights , and we have an active Facebook group where we answer questions from the Dreamer Fools and help guide and support them . ( They are such a cool group btw ! ) We 'll be opening this again in Feb next year and will have some exciting bonuses to go with it . <h> 6 . Affiliate marketing <p> Affiliate marketing is one of the best ways to make money from your travel blog because you only set it up once , and the income keeps coming in forever more . Its passive income and is where you find your true freedom . <p> Now there is work required and you do need to have traffic and an audience who trusts you , and you want to be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its the best form of leverage when making money blogging . <p> Affiliate marketing is where you promote other peoples products and services and receive a commission . We recommend products or services that we personally use , like and trust . There might be the odd few that we have n't had personal experience with , but we know the source as a highly trusted and reputable one . <p> We have affiliate partnerships with Booking.com , Airbnb and RentalCars.com We pretty much only promote these two companies as we feel they are the best , we use them allt he time ourselves , and its less confusing for you as our reader . We do n't  want to be shoving 13 different accommodation booking sites in your face just so we can make money . We 'd rather give you fewer options from a trustworthy and valuable provider . <p> Learn how she went from $0 to over $50,000 a month in affiliate income . Thats freedom . Weve done the course and loved it and learned a lot ! I wish we had it when we first started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . <p> And if there is one income earning strategy I recommend you implement straight away , its affiliate marketing . You wo n't get immediate results , but it will pay off i n the long term . Six years later you wont be like us , face palming yourself as you realise the thousands of dollars you 've left on the table and have to spend the next year going back through hundreds of posts to implement the strategies . <h> 7 . Freelance content creation <p> We have various freelance content creation gigs running in the background . <p> I wrote for the Kidspot Going Places campaign sponsored by Nissan for 2 years . Kidspot is the largest parenting website in Australia and I wrote a column on family travel , which has just ended . <p> Craig currently writes two articles a month for HomeAway and we 're about to start writing two posts a month for the Destination NSW blog . We also write for Skyscanner . <p> We 've created videos for tourist boards and often do some ad hoc freelance writing gigs here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income streams we 've not yet tapped into but see as a possibility <p> Just to give you a few more ideas . Here are some other streams we 've considered tapping into , or known of others ' who are making- money from their travel blog in these ways . <h> Consulting <p> There 's a huge market here for us to be able to help DMO 's and tourism companies with their social media and blogging strategy . Think about what skills you have learned through blogging . How could you then empower other businesses to do the same and improve their visibility ? <h> Blogger Brand- Campaign relationships <p> If we had the time we could easily organize and manage blogger brand campaigns . We know how to make them work best . There are plenty of these groups popping up now that manage these types of relationships for travel bloggers . <h> Travel agency <p> There are plenty of mobile travel agencies . Travel blogger Chris from Backpacker Banter has just launched Epic Gap Year which acts like an online travel agency for- epic experiences- around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could become your own tour guide . Wandering Earl offers group tours around the world . As a seasoned traveller he is more than experienced in showing people how to have similar experiences to what he does . The Planet D and Gary Arndt- have also hosted tours . <h> TV travel show <p> Would love to fulfill my dreams of being on Getaway . Love to have my own film crew following me around so I could just enjoy the adventure and relax ! ! Our friends from Places We Go do this ! <p> This is not an exhausted list of income streams . There are others creating and doing different projects all the time . It will be up to you to decide where your focus should be . <h> Pin to share : <p> Can you add any helpful insights or suggestions on how to make money travel blogging ? <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> As usual a comprehensive article Caz . Travel is definitely a market unlike any other . I see so many people take a gap year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then think they can make a career out of it . <p> While this may be true in theory , the fact is most blogs fall by the wayside when the trip is over , therefore never really reaching any decent sort of monetization . You mentioned that it took 2 years before seeing any real returns and this is why only a handfull of blogs are on your level . Just look at the other blogs you have mentioned Wandering Earl , Planet D and Gary Ardnt have all built their brand over a number of years . <p> The only thing I would like to add is to find niche . If I was to ask anyone what your blog specializes in , it would be easy to see that you focus heavily on travel with kids . That is not to say you cant grow out of your niche , but you need to start somewhere as the influencer in that space . <p> Thanks Dave and Michael ! Definitely agree with you both even though we have n't done that ! ! It was so hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our story has evolved with us . Its made what we do to be quite the beast and difficult to manage , but we 've made it work and recently figured out a good plan to manage it better . We have the traffic to make it work . <p> But , I 'd definitely recommend newbies niche , but leave room for their brand to evolve as they do . <p> Great to hear you say the niche thing Michael . I came home from a bloggers clinic for Dutch and Belgian travel writers last night and they kept on mentioning it , too . And yet still I know plenty of blogs who have not defined their niche . When we started blogging we wrote about anything and quickly realised that would n't work as there are already plenty of those blogs around . Even though our niche is small and not for everyone we appreciate returning visitors that actually have a feel for what we do . <p> Thank you so much for your generosity , mindfullness and gifts you give us in every article you write . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you . I have a new travel blog and I just want to be happy traveling and sharing in it . I write a french blog and I do n't  find such a great blog than yours in french . I nearly read every new article you write even if I am french speaking and not bilingual . I am used to write articles for many years in my blogs and I know that only heart written articles have success . Long time together , thank you so much Have a wonderful time Do <p> Great tips ! I 'm a big fan of diversification as well . I do n't  think any travel blogger has made a fortune in just one outlet , and all who have succeeded had their hands on multiple projects ( although , the word " fortune " is relative here since most travel bloggers value freedom over money ) . <p> Everyone established themselves as bloggers first , but I think the service/product offerings theyve put out have only gone to strengthen their credibility as experts . It is a self-propagating circle at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is an AWESOME article ! I feel like you 've written it for especially us . Whilst we 've built an amazing website that 's now the go-to for fabulous people planning an outback trip , we really struggle with monetization . We do n't  even need anything like 6 figures to survive -although our totally amazing jobs bring us well over this amount , and provide content as we really do stuff that others only dream of- but we 'd like to website to be our main income within the next 2 years . So THANK YOU ! And yes , B-School is in the diary as is Donna Moritz . <p> Great tips ! Its certainly daunting when you start out . I think its most important to enjoy what you 're doing . People often say I 'm lucky , but they do n't  realise the ridiculous number of hours Ive put into my website behind the scenes . I sometimes think to myself I could have just worked a regular job more hours and then put that money towards my travels , but then I think about how much joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help other travellers to meeting so many fantastic bloggers at networking events . I will probably never come close to making the kind of money you do , but I have absolutely no regrets = <p> Thanks for the tips and I hope you continue to have success with these ventures , especially your new book ! <p> Yes ! ! I try not to think of the money I could have earned working the same in other jobs ! ! I think its essential you love what you do , and when you find that you 'll happily work for less . But , still have the intention to earn more as I think its essential every person earn a valuable income for doing what they love and giving value in exchange for that . <p> I see you did a surf tour with Mojo Surf . I grew up in the same town and hung in the same circles as the owner , Nathan Folks . He s a really great guy who 's done amazing things with Mojo . <p> That 's awesome ! I really loved our surf lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour as it was part of an organised tour with Contiki , but I can imagine it would be a really great place to stop for a week or so to really get to grips with surfing ! <p> Thank you for the great tips . I think you have done a pretty amazing job of creating your brand . I actually heard about your blog for the first time when I attended a Travel Massive networking evening in Sydney , and was told to aim to have a blog like yours . I only started my blog in April so I still have a ways to go in order to start making any money off it . I 'm trying to achieve mote than 1000 views per month still ! As an office jockey with a 9-5 , its a bit difficult for me to put in as much work as I would like into my blog , but my evenings are spent plotting , planning and writing . I will get there eventually <p> Wow that 's lovely to hear . Thank you ! Keep working on the dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income , and part-time on your fortune ! Step by step is the best way to get there ! <p> It does n't  always have to relate to traffic though . It depends on the monetization model that you work towards . I know lots of people who have far less traffic than us and make more . I do n't  feel like I have much of a business head , and definitely did n't  when I started , but I believe you can learn these things . So the trick is to find out what areas you need to work on and choose the best teachers and mentors to help you <p> I agree that the niche is so important- its what helped my blog grow faster than I thought it would . I wanted my blog to be about typical solo female travel &amp; budget backpacking but I live in India and travel A LOT in India plus I get to stay at nicer places because its cheaper here , so I noticed all my traffic was driven from people googling about backpacking India I recently changed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " glamorous travel in India ( and everywhere else ) " . I guess people picked my niche for me . Thanks for all your tips ! <p> Although I have many posts like this , it is still refreshing and helpful . I know that the first step towards becoming a successful blogger is building great readership and that 's the toughest part . ( Probably you should do a post on that ! ) = <p> Great article , Caz . On one level , my mindset was frustrated by where we are ( eastern Thailand not a lot of tourists come here ) Its just an excuse , of course there 's plenty of folks around that could use some advice . Now , to figure out which of them have a budget to pay = ) <p> Thanks for this comprehensive guide . Its always interesting to see how other travel bloggers are earning money and inspiring to try some new techniques . I started to earn a full income exactly after 1 year of blogging , another 6 months later I told my partner to quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live part time in developing countries and it allows us to save money and to enjoy the better life quality for a small price . <p> I 'm really proud of you guys , making a 6 figure income from travel blogging is absolutely amazing ! More power to you all and please , keep inspiring us ! <p> Great article , thanks for sharing ! One year ago , ytravelblog was one of the blogs I stumbled upon and motivated me to take my " blog for friends and family " to the next level . One year later I 'm making a little bit of money . I 'm not planning on becoming a fulltime blogger ( I love my tourism job too much for that ) but a bit of extra money makes me able to travel more and share those experiences with my readers . <p> Its great your blog can help give you the extra money you need for your fun stuff . I think its really important that people recognize there are so many ways you can bring more money in so you can have those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so glad we could help inspire you ! <p> yeah its really hard . I 'm a big thinker kinda person so I see it and then want it straight away . I have to breathe really deep and remind myself to just enjoy the journey and let it all unravel rather than pushing to get it here now . <p> Hi Caz , thanks for sharing all this valuable information with us ! I love your posts about travel blogging and digital lifestyle . I will be waiting for your travel blog course ! I started my blog two years ago but it is only a hobby and unfortunately I ca n't put the time that I want in it . I already realized it is really hard work and I will do the best I can given my current time limitations . Your post are always so inspiring and full of helpful information . Thank you ! <p> No worries ! Just always remember you can only do the best with what you have from where you are . That ; s something I always like to remind myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as time , are against me . <p> I love it when you write posts like this because they 're always so inspiring . I love seeing how others are growing their businesses because it just lights a fire under me and assures me that I can do the same especially as I 'm fine tuning my products in preparation for launch . Like you , I 'd love to eventually be able to curate content for tourist boards and DMOs as well as delve into consulting down the line . Just want you guys to know that I 've appreciated your mentorship through the DF group on Facebook and being able to pick your brains for insight/advice . Keep inspiring us ! <p> Thank you so much Dana ! I 've loved our Dreamer Fools group ! ! I think its so important to see how others grow their own business . It really helps in those moments when you feel like you want to quit . I really believe if someone else is doing it , its evidence that I can do it too . Youve just got to believe and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article as usual ! I would love to see a list of seminars , and meetings for bloggers who want to take classes , hear others speak and exchange ideas . Is there a yearly International get together or conference ? How about regional conferences ? <p> There is TBEX that happens once a year in North America and Europe . There 's also Problogger in Australia , which is my favourite one . I always learn so much from this conference and I love how blogs from a variety of niches are represented ! I always learn a lot from what those in other niches do . <p> That is such great advice , especially for people who are starting out now . You are completely right travel blogging is not easy and yes , free trips ( especially the big blogger campaigns ) are the worst way to travel or see a new place . They all seem so rushed = <p> Its posts like these that bring me back to life and re-light that spark inside me that wants to keep fighting the good fight . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in many others ! = <p> Excellent and comprehensive article , Caz . Like you and probably many others I " learned by doing " and made many mistakes . One thing , however , was very clear to me from the beginning : I had to build a brand , credibility , an audience and a network . I only half agree with you that launching a blog only to get free trips is not a good idea . travel . As you say , blogging is a lot of work . But I 'll add If you do it seriously and professionally . A lot of people do it like a hobby , to score a few freebies , and that it . And many tourism boards and tourism operators apparently are still happy to host bloggers providing very little value added . Its changing , though . And that 's good because it means that people working hard and professionally will be able to get properly paid . <p> Yes . The industry really need to get better at vetting who they work with . There 's a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want to check off the boxes , instead of taking some time to research and plan it first . Those who have the solid foundation in place are the ones they will eventually come to . <p> Wow I 'm so inspired by your journey . Thanks for sharing the tips . Having an entrepreneur mindset is very important in this blogging business . Its absolutely not easy but anyone who is willing can do it . <p> Entrepreneur mindset is key . We were focused in the beginning on working on this to get it right . I 'm still doing a lot to develop it . Its really tiring but Im inspired to keep moving forward as the thought of having to return to teaching nearly kills me <p> Dear Caz , thank you for this clear and concise post . As always , I get so much value from everything that you do and write . As a new food and travel blogger , all the work can become daunting at times . However , As a member of your mentoring program the Dreamer Fools , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " marathon not a sprint " , and I keep going <p> As always I really enjoy your honesty and insight . There is little doubt that you work incredibly hard and have earnt the success you now reap . Full credit to you both . <p> I must admit that Ive never sought out a press trip , it is not what I do nor am I interested in . I 'm also trying to grow my audience rather than trying to communicate with advertising agencies . If they contact me then yes I 'm more than happy to consider what they have in mind . <p> You did mention media kits . Ive been sending them out when people have approached me yet I find it frustrating that they never actually read them ! They then ask a string of questions which are already addressed in the kit . I know I have to service them and be very polite yet their approach is very time inefficient . <p> I 'm approaching my 2 year blog anniversary . I know you 've been at this a lot longer than me . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than I want them to be . Any advice ? I do know that I should offer a gift/freebie which I 'm thinking of devising . Yet others who do n't  offer anything seem to be excelling in this way and I need to learn more from them . <p> Oh yeah we have that problem with the media kit too ! ! It is frustrating . Social media is really hard . You just have to be persistent and post good stuff that your community want . Make it fun and engaging . Ask a lot of questions and share inspirational content . <p> Consistently good content is key . Make sure that it has your keywords in there so you can capitalize on search traffic . It took us a good three years before we started seeing search traffic benefit and now it drives a lot of traffic to us . All we did was produce good content that people wanted and we focused a lot of guest posting . <p> You can definitely offer a gift or freebie . HAve some sort of free ebook or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and focus on giving them a more personal connection with you . Just be careful with the giveaways because it will often attract people who just want to win and do n't  care about what you have to offer . Its best to have subscribers and readers who do want to be there . <p> The best way to increase your numbers is to focus on giving the best experience to the ones you already have . I think things tend to grow organically then because you are less worried about the numbers and more about the value you 've got to share . <p> Thank you so much Caz . I really appreciate your detailed and encouraging response . I know it is a long haul thing , just every now and then I need a pick me up . I 'm trying to be more active when I can " socially " . Always a time balance but as a part timer rather than full timer I need to keep realistic targets . <p> Thank you ever so much again . Like everyone else here , I really appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its so important now to select a niche . I have mine selected , but I think the problem lies in the fact that I have n't quite expressed what my niche is succinctly or clearly enough for a first-time visitor to my blog . So that needs fine-tuning . ( Or at least that 's the way it appears to me we are always our own harshest critics hey . ) <p> Ah that we are ! But definitely you are right that you need to express it the right way it is not an easy task . Were constantly trying to refine ours . Just keep working at it and trust the right words will come <p> Great post ! Its always inspiring to read other travel bloggers sharing their tips . For me , one of the best things I did was take last years tax return and invest it in myself , and the blog by hiring a designer I loved . It was tempting to pay off some of the credit card instead , but much smarter in the long run to spend it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Oh good investment . I think investing in anything that will make you grow is a smart choice . And sometimes that might mean delaying the credit card , youve just got to work out what is best . Design is key . We never realized in the beginning how important it is and not many people invest in it . <p> Lot of people think that its easy , but truth is that could be complicated as many other jobs . Even making good profits as travel blogger I really woudnt reccommend anyone to start a blog just to make money . Is like earn money being singer , you can earn cents or be a rockstar . Great post Caz ! It covers almost all the alternatives . <p> We have years of travel and hundreds of blogs on publuc blog spaces . We 've only just started our own blog ( S ) and started to realize there might be a way to make some $ from our passion . Successful travelers like you guys act as inspiration for what might be and yeswe are starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to learn though . Baby stepsbig dreams . <p> I have no desire to live in a developing country myself ( primarily because we do n't  like hot climates ) . <p> I love what you said about a blog being not just a money making platform but a pillar of your strategy , and having a long term plan . I have to say that there is one travel blogger Ive been keeping an eye on a full time travel blogger recently who seems to do nothing but constant press trips , and while it sounds glamorous when I think about the hectic lifestyle she lives and how much content she has to create in return it does n't  really sound all that fun , to be quite honest . <p> Great post Caz . You guys are such an inspiration to us . I wish I read this 2 years ago when I began . Its funny , only the other day I was explaining to friends that blogging professionally is a marathon and not a sprint . Hopefully our paths will cross in the " real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post is filled with so much knowledge and honesty , and actionable tips ! I 'm a fellow B School grad and I can say with certainty that what I learned there prompted me to make a much better income from my blogging endeavors then when I was trying to monetize my blog . I seriously can not believe it took me so long to realize that people were asking me for services and I had n't  even charged them . Instead I was caught up in the sponsored post realm of travel blogging which I could n't scale . I then started working with a few clients via referrals , and eventually started announcing to people yup , in addition to writing I also do social media strategy . I am so happy I finally took the plunge , and now am working on my first course . <p> Hi Caz ! Thanks for a REAL article with honest , REAL information ! Ive been researching what feels like hundreds of travel blogger sites and none have delved into this level of detail . As an avid traveler ( used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 years ) , I had n't  thought of starting a blog until a few months ago . The drag and grind of a 8-5 job just is n't inspiring my dreams anymore and until I stumbled upon your website I really did n't  think that travel blogging was a viable avenue for alternative income or an alternative lifestyle . Ill definitely be subscribing and look forward to reading more on your site for tips , tricks and the honest truth ! I finally have a domain registered , but now to get to the hard part and bed down my blog , the value I can add and get cracking ! <p> This is such a well-written post . One small question : how do you figure out how much to ask for example for press trips , or sponsored editorials ? Travel blogging is still a new media for some , and many brands will devaluate your work ! What is the average pricing here ? Thank you ! <p> I think its so nice that you 've created this article with the sole purpose of helping others and wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A really nice sentiment . Its something we have just started , we enjoy travelling and one half is a writer and ones a photographer so fingers crossed we shall see . <p> I like this article and also how its augmentative and how factual situations and scenarios have been taken into account . I recently started an affiliate revenue driven travel website . The website had a search box that a user uses to search for hotel and flight deals therefore earning me affiliate revenue through leads . 100% of my revenue was generated from leads that paid between $0.75 and $2.00 . In the first month I only made $3.25 . Getting targeted traffic that converted well was very hard for me . However , after meeting a lady by the name Marie , on Facebook , things changed for the better . She offered me real genuine organic traffic with real computer IP addresses that really converted well . Conversion was my issue , therefore , for every $10 that I spent I earned $37 making a profit of $27 this was great for me because The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After checking my analystics , there were NO repeated IP addresses I made a profit at the end of the day There was no Issue or complaint from my affiliate program because I did n't violate any rules The traffic was spread out evenly on a monthly period depending on the amount of traffic that I needed per month I contacted Marie recently for my new travel website project and I learnt that she has moved her services to fiverr , and she is now starting to sell her Gig on fivers marketplace . If you need her services you can contact her through this link http : //9nl.it/target-trafic <p> If you plan to make money with your blog that could result in taxes , should we get a business license ? Its a partnership so we would n't want just one of us to end up with tax liability . What do you recommend ? <p> I 'm still quite far from the idea of earning any money from my travel blog , but it would definitely be rewarding if my blog starts providing me some small money that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice you mentioned in the post above , so that results of a hard work could be seen in the future . Thank you for sharing , Anca <p> This is something me and my family definitely want to do but are really new to it all . Were currently saving every penny we have to start our first travel with our three children in a camper van around Europe . Would you recommend starting a blog asap in time for the start of our travels ? Any other advise would be awsome . <p> Thanks for the post ! I have just started my own travel blog and dream of the day I can put teaching behind me . I can totally relate to you here ! I think I could put twice as many hours a day into my blog and never go to bed as tired as I do after 7 hours in a classroom ! Traveling is what I love most , and I hope one day to be able to share my experiences with many . It sounds like a pretty tough road ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As always , your article is the best .. Making your own products while growing your blog is the best way to monetize it .. The time that you are still growing your blog , think of a product that you think will sell to your ENGAGED readers . More Power <p> I am seriously considering moving to Australia in the near future ( a month or two ) and have been looking in to travel blogging as a profession . I like what you said about not doing this for free trips , but because its something you really love . I do n't  know if you do this , but I would so love to connect and maybe ask some questions if possible by email , Skype or meeting you once I move . I understand that this industry is no overnight success , but takes years of hard work , and I believe I am ready to work for it . I have a plan to support myself until I can make this dream a tangible reality . I hope to talk soon . <p> Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business mentor and the lady who turned it around for me .

Ill be sharing more about my mentoring group that opens in a couple of weeks . Its the only mentoring I do as I get requests daily , and do n't  have the time , so do n't  offer anything on an individual level . <p> Dear Caz , its such a pleasure to find blogs like yours ! No wonder its one of the best-rated ones in the travel blogging market , as I found out when looking for interesting sites to learn from . You guys have such an inspiring story , thanks for sharing it with the world ! <p> I 've just started my travel blog a couple of months ago , based on my personal experience and places Ive visited , mainly in South America . Like many others , my goal is to make some money off my blog and , why not , achieve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even though I cant do it full-time right now , I 'm putting every effort in this project and I 'll certainly make the most of every piece of advice you share . BTW , and just out of curiosity , did you ever worked with banner-based monetization systems ( like Adsense ) ? It looks like the easiest way to start generating some income , but I 'm not sure if it would affect blogs reputation in any way , for example . <p> Anyway , my congratulations on your outstanding project , and wish you every success in the future ! Hope to meet you on the road some day = <p> there is a great couple who are from Costa Rica who have a travel blog , you should look them up , i think their site is Mytanfeet they are good inspiration to the both of us , , ( as we are both new to starting out ) <p> Brilliant article , for someone like me that has just entered into the travel blogging , , its a joy to come across this article tonight <p> really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge market for that <p> currently i 'm trying to target scuba divers for their holidays as we all know , they have money to spend and i really enjoy writing an article to inspire some one to visit a place , , even though i do n't  make money , i still enjoy it <p> i really do agree about the niche , , to be more targeted and i also see the points you made about choosing your name for the future , <p> Loved what you said " It 's a marathon , not a sprint . " . Everyone is so adamant about making money that the patience is the first thing they lose . Glad to have come across your article . Great tips . Thanks ! = <p> I am inspired by your story . Blogging is n't new to me , but travel blogging is . I stumbled upon this post while searching on Google about ways to monetize a travel blog . Cool tips . I have just started working on my travel blog . I do n't  expect to make any money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better afterwards . I enjoy travel writing , so I think I will have the motivation to continue . <p> Thanks Caz . That 's a very honest article with insight on other money making avenues of travel blogging . Making money anywhere ai n't  easy it requires dedication and patience . After 2 months of travel blogging i finally broke into the $200 mark last month ( I have been blogging on another niche topic since 10 months and i made $0 but it taught me a lot of things ) . Was a lucky streak though , this month is halfgone and i am still on $50 . I feel the key lies in publishing good quality articles and not overdoing things from the start ( the mistake i made earlier ) . One should start at a pace at which they can commit to even if it is 2 quality posts a month and hold onto to it for long . I am still an amateur writer so i limit my articles to 600 words which is good enough to communicate the story my readers . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that keeps the traffic coming mostly through shares by friends and family . Let 's see where this approach takes me to but i plan to be in the blogosphere for a loooongg time . <p> I love your tips here Caz !

If anyone is looking to earn some money for their travels , please get in touch with me . I work for a currency exchange company called WeSwap and we are currently recruiting travel bloggers to be Brand Ambassadors for us . This is a really easy and fun way to fund your travels .

My gf and I just started a travel blog based in Asia too and we are getting serious this year ! Hoping to read more articles on advices on travel blogging. = <p> Have you had much success with Youtube ? I 'm aware that video is going to be the future of online media . I read somewhere that video will be 75% of online traffic in a few years . <p> I know many travel bloggers , but are they really making much money with Youtube ? Also , I am considered about Youtube owning my content and possbily suspending my account for no reason . The lack of control bothers me , but the # of eyeballs on Youtube is staggering ! <p> Your comment about a TV show is interesting . How would you approach a strategy geared towards travel video content ? Would you use Youtube or host the videos on your own website ? <p> This is incredibly helpful and insightful ! Thanks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my desk job had me thinking " what about travel blogging ? but with only fantasy thoughts and no solid understanding of what goes on behind it , I channeled my google-fu and found you .

@@21820750 @1820750/ <h> Steps for packing up for long term travel . <p> It- can be overwhelming and full of mixed emotions . You 're taking years of memories and boxing , donating , or selling them and you 're leaving everything behind for a life you are unsure of . <p> Swapping certainty for surprises . <p> Hold onto the joy and excitement of that , rather than the fear and longing . <p> We become so attached to our possessions , we often lose sight of who we are without them. - When you strip down to just a few things , you can finally get to know yourself , without the clutter butting in . <p> ( Note : If you are preparing for long-term travel with children , it is important you involve them in this process . Its important they feel the adventure is theirs to own too and they understand the very valuable lesson that possessions should not be the focus of lifes journey . ) <p> We show you how to do that more in-depth in our family travel planning toolkit . Click for access ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Do n't  even donate it , it has such bad energy surrounding it . " <p> With each toss , we said our thanks and gave our blessing to the past , <p> " Thank you for the lessons . We would n't be here now if it werent for you . " <p> The only way you can make peace with your past is to understand how it helped you to stand in your shoes now . <h> 2 . Eliminate the back door <p> A few months ago , I made the decision to burn my teaching license . I did n't  want any doors for quitting and retreating to be left ajar . It was scary , yet liberating . <p> But , I had held onto my teaching resources : boxes of books , posters , units of work , and lesson plans . I went through each file , pondering the hours I had spent researching , planning , teaching , worrying , and helping my students . <p> Teaching took me around the world . Its hard to turn your back on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over. - I hated teaching in the end , but I loved my students and all they taught me . <p> The biggest hurdle was releasing the fear attached my 15 years of teaching wrapped up in the box . I had carried them around with me across five continents , terrified that if I did not have them for backup , I would n't survive . I wanted to keep holding onto them just in case what we are doing now does n't  work , and I may need them again . <p> Its difficult to give up the just in case and trust your chosen path is the right one . What was once my security was now holding me back . <p> I lovingly took my valuable teaching resources down to the local school for other teachers to use with their students . <p> No more back doors . <h> 3 . Detach yourself <p> There 's no doubt ; you 've been planning your long-term trip for a long time . Do n't  leave it to the last minute to reduce your possessions down to a backpack . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . <p> Start detaching yourself and reducing your dependency on your stuff a few months away from your departure date . Box up a few things and make yourself go without those extra handbags and shoes and books . <p> Ease yourself into it . Once you start giving up a few things , you 'll see that its easy , and you do n't  think about them much . <h> 4 . Sort in stages <p> Some like to eat the frog first ; others like to start with the small stuff and work up to the awful ones . We ate the frog first by sorting through our possessions in the garage . <p> Work through it one space at a time . Do n't  overwhelm yourself and do n't  leave this to the last minute ; its huge amounts of stress you do n't  need just before you embark on your trip of a lifetime . <p> Be strict with what you choose to keep and get rid of . It costs a lot of time and money to maintain your things . What will it cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my things have been sitting in boxes now for 15 years . What is the point of that ? True , many hold precious memories , but what good are they to me in boxes . How are those boxes stuck in a garage holding those memories alive ? <p> They are n't  , my heart is . <p> Every time I go through my boxes , I cull the insides by at least a third . I 'm often baffled as to why I wanted to keep them in the first place . Im baffled now because I am very different to the person who first boxed them up . <h> Have four boxes and fill them in the following way . <h> 1 . Keep <p> Be very strict with your decisions ; Ask yourself : <p> Why do I want to keep this ? <p> What purpose does it serve ? <p> How will it help me when I return ? <p> We usually keep : <p> photos . <p> special mementos . <p> souvenirs or artifacts . <p> appliances and utensils . <p> furniture that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use upon return . <p> any good clothing that can be stored and will be used upon return . <p> Do n't  hold onto anything that has bad energy attached to it . <p> On our clean out last week , we discovered boxes of books and materials that we were keeping that had a lot of bad energy attached to it . As soon as we opened it up the horrible memories came flooding back , and we felt sick . <p> Do n't  box up sickness . <p> You 're choosing to start a new life , allow only goodness to flow through with you . <h> 2 . Sell <p> There is nothing like making a bit of extra cash to take on your trip with you . <p> What can you sell ? <p> What are things you have of value , that are still in good condition , and you feel someone else could use ? <p> Put it in the sell pile . You have a lot of work to do coming up with selling it , but it will be worthwhile as you 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra few hundred to thousands of dollars doing this . <p> $5 might not seem like much , but in Asia , it will give you a few beers . That makes you a happy rich traveller . <p> Once you have your sell pile , decide how you will sell them . You might like to have a garage sale , or sell them on sites like EBay , Craigslist , or Gumtree. <h> 3 . Donate <p> Work out which of your possessions you feel you have outgrown and have no need for anymore . <p> Can they make a difference in someone elses life ? <p> Anything you feel you cant sell , or ca n't be bothered to sell , donate . <p> We usually sell the large stuff that will bring in a bit of cash , the smaller stuff that could only fetch us small amounts , we 'd rather give away . Its not worth the extra time . <p> Throw it in the donate box and then arrange to have it dropped off at your local second-hand store or the Salvation Army . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no good to anyone . Dump them . Make sure you follow the recycling guidelines as we want to be as kind to the environment as we can . <p> De-cluttering , culling and clearing the dust , this is the most liberating thing you can ever do . You do n't  have to be travelling to make space for the things that matter . We recommend you do it frequently . At least yearly , if not every six months . <p> A good rule of thumb is if you have not used it in the last six months , or with the full seasonal cycle , then you do not need it . Decide to sell it , donate it , or trash it . <p> Clear your life of the clutter and give yourself more space to appreciate and enjoy the moment . That is where the lessons , the growth and the joy comes from . <p> Here is to the open road and a backpack my friends . I do n't  think I 've felt this happy and free in years . <h> About Caz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post Caz I feel like I could have written it myself ! I have , for the last few months , been doing exactly what you suggestgoing through sections at a time so it does n't  feel overwhelming , donating and selling things and also learning to let go of painful items or reminders that I had kept over the years . <p> This is the first time Ive ever had the need to do this ( as I 've obviously never began a life of indefinite travel before ) and its certainly becoming a steep and emotional learning curve . I feel like I 'm grieving for the memories some of my possessions hold so I feel a little lighter every time I get rid of a bit more but I know that its the right thing to do . <p> It really is like a grieving process Toni . I 'm feeling quite a release doing it , although crying a bit too much ! ! Better out than in . I 'm at the stage now where I just want to gather everything in my site and trash it ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ive been doing the same thing lately ! When I left NZ , after 4 years of being an expat my jaw couldnt help but drop at the amount of crap that we had accumulated ! I had a huge biff out , hit the market to sell as much as I could and whatever did n't  sell , was donated . We left a much smaller pile of stuff with Thoms mum , for us to re-assess when we return to NZ next summer . <p> Since coming back to my parents house , I tackled their basement the boxes that I 'd stored while I went away to university , and their belongings that theyd hid out of sight , out of mind . We had a huge yardsale , and everything that we decided we did n't  need anymore , was n't allowed back in the house ! <p> Minimalism is so liberating ! Even if I do n't  continue a life of indefinite travel , I will certainly try to employ buying and keeping less crap ! <p> It is one of the biggest benefits to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then it is way too much . It causes me so much stress and at the moment , it feels as if it is growing out of the walls . We cull and I feel clearer and then I turn and there is more ! ! ! Where does it all come from ? <p> Its tough when you have kidsthe toys they acquire drives me bonkers. we 've got them each a small toybox and they are allowed to fill that with their must haves for our road trip , and then the rest is going . I secretly ca n't wait . Give them the sand and a few sticks and theyll be much happier ! ( at least I will be ) <p> Great advice in the article . I recently did this and got rid of most of my possessions . I moved countries at fairly short notice so did n't  have many months to prepare . I managed to sell most of my furniture and gave everything else away to a couple I know who would distribute it to poor families . It was all fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture and would be left with it . <p> I kept all my travel mementos as they hold such wonderful memories . The most difficult thing to let go of was books , especially guidebooks . I have every guide book I 've bought in the last 20 years and have visions of them lining the walls of my home when I finally settle down in one place . A lot are in storage in my home country but those Ive acquired in the last 5 years where laid out in front of me and I desperately wanted to keep them . In the end I could n't let them go , they are in storage too but when I go back to Dubai ( where I was living ) to collect more stuff I may have to bite the bullet and just bin them . <p> We struggle with the books too . I was pretty good this time in letting more of them go . I 've really been strict with the " Am I really going to use these again ? " rule . ITs been so difficult , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great post . New to the whole blogging world but just ran across this post and felt compelled to comment . Everything you say is so true . Its incredible how much stuff you can accumulate and how quickly you can do so . I 've lived on my sailboat for the last four years and with such a limited amount of space you really have to be actively de-cluttering your life on a daily basis . If I get something new , something goes . If I have n't used something in the last year ( this gets you through all the seasons ) , Its gone . The more I get rid of , the better I feel . It makes me wonder what my limit is . Probably flip flops , trunks , and a row boat . Not quite ready to put that to the long term test just yet though . <p> Lugging two stuffed sail bags of dirty laundry to the laundromat a couple days ago I was appalled at the amount of clothes I had . Could barely cary it all . If the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of my life , why do I have all this crap . Half of everything never made it back on board . Getting ready to head off on a long voyage in the next couple of months , I find myself going through what you just wrote on a daily basis or at least should be . Freeing up a space the size of a shoebox can be a game changer . I can only imagine the amount of junk that piles up in most homes ! On that note , I think I 'll just post this little comment and pack up another bag of crap to unload before the sun goes down . <p> Thanks Geoff ! I 'm glad you found us too ! Living on a sail boat would be an amazing experience and I can see how it would definitely help you get used to living off less . Have you read Torre De Roches book " Love with a Chance of Drowning ? " She sailed across the Pacific . Its a good story . here 's a link to a podcast interview we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategieswe are divesting of our belongings in trade for some long term travel . Current goal is " sell one thing a week ! " <p> here 's where I 'm having the most difficulty : letters . Letters from family dating back to before the 20th century ! These chronicle journeys , loves , wars , moves , deaths , historical witness as well as the mundane ! What second life can we give these ? ? <p> Thanks Caz , this is a really timely post for our family , and I really appreciate you sharing your plans and tips . I 'm also a teacher who recently donated and binned all of my teaching resources to mark the beginning of our journey toward long term travel and living with less , ( really why do we keep so much ? ? ! ) . But most of all I can relate to your feelings about attachment to the items all families inevitably collect when we settle in one place . Thanks for sharing your tips on how to purge and only keep the things that matter . Youve given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process can feel at times . Thank you = <p> So awesome that you guys are heading off for a year , or for however long it is you get addicted to exploring Australia for = Its been a truly emotional roller coaster for us , as far as selling our business , parting with everything and finding our way to a better , more free , calm life . We did the same , sorted , donated , threw out and ended up keeping things that we really will end up getting rid of now the move is over . None of it has been easy , and were still not quite where we want to be , but nothing feels better than knowing that our backyard is the entirety of the country = Hope to catch you guys on the road , and cant wait to see what you get up to ! <p> Do n't  have much experience in long term travel and packing for it but we had to move into the " rentals " home while we organise ourselves ( long story ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of rubbish ! Every Sunday I tidying up to get ready for the next week and go through a few boxes , throw out a heap of stuff and think I do n't  want to do that again .. yet the next Sunday rolls up and I have to do the same thing . I have no idea how we accumulate so much rubbish ! I would hate to have to go through everything if we were travelling full time . I might just throw it all away ! ! I 'm forever going through everything , feeling guilty when I give away/sell or throw something away , each thing seems to have a memory attached ! <p> Awesome tips Caz and Craig . Packing and losing the possessions has always been a freeing experience for me . Coming back from New Zealand , I did n't  have much besides what could fit in the backpack , i 'm but I have accumulated some things while back in the US . The biggest is my bed , which after a year in hostels was my prized possession . But I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before leaving to SE Asia in 2 months . And I 'm really excited to start packing again = <p> Great tips here . While I do not plan to move for a while I will make sure to bookmark this page for the future . Sorting and organizing is something I am good at already . I buy stuff to resell on eBay , so that will be easy . <p> Learning to detach myself from somethings will be hard though . I have so many childhood memories with so many different items it will be hard to determine what to keep and what to throw away . Ill have to figure it out once that time comes . <p> Great tips guys , really nicely laid out and structured ! We were away for a year last year , and after 4 months back well be heading off again so going through the same packing up process again ! This time I think we will actually get rid of some stuff instead of simply putting into storage ( read : parents house ! ) . <p> Really , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period of time about 2 years ago when I was living semi-nomadically , but still have stuff stored at my mothers house . Shes now moving house while I 'm away and will move what little of my stuff remainds at her house to my partners mothers house and no doubt when I get back there to sort it myself , I 'll find all kinds of rubbish I did n't  need to keep . The way I see it : if I 've been parted from it for a year and I did n't  remember I still had it and/or did n't  miss it , I probably do n't  need itso I 'll be following through these stages again in a few months when we return to Europe ! <p> Awesome post ! And great timing . My husband and I are doing a working holiday in Australia for a year leaving mid October . We are in the process of deciding what to bring and what to leave behind along with de-cluttering . Maybe well see you there while you are on your journey around the country = <p> I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually easy for me . Not so much deciding what to keep The whole process took more than a year and it was exhausting ! So I 'd only add , give yourself time for de-cluttering , minimizing , and packing . As for the Keep box(es) , make it , then go through it again in 6 months , then again at least once more . You may be amazed how much smaller the box gets . <p> Imagine that storage facilities that rent locker space are found world-wide because sure are all over USA . Problem is that its too easy to lose track of what 's in a storage locker because they are typically not that close to home plus they can be a big money waster if just paying for items in storage . So try to avoid them if possible by keeping things simple and minimizing number of items stored using methods that you and comment writers suggest . <h> Trackbacks <p> 35. - How to Pack Up and Prepare for Long-Term Travel- Caz and Craig from- yTravelBlog- " have relocated internationally 10 times , so preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .

This park was founded- by the great Eric Worrell , Australias first naturalist. - The only zoo in Australia committed to saving lives with a Venom-Milking Program in place for the past 50+ years . There are plenty of wildlife shows and chances to interact with the animals . They have quite an extensive range of Australian animals . <p> The latest is the Australian Wildlife Park , a little more personal and interactive + its the only time Ive ever patted a dingo .

For the surfers , just head north to North Avoca for better waves . <h> Terrigal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach town on the coast .

By day or night , Terrigal is buzzing with cafes , restaurants and the beer garden at Crowne Plaza . <h> Toowoon Bay <p> Picturesque sheltered bay for swimming . <h> Norah Head <p> Norah Head is another picturesque beach . Walk up to the lighthouse for a great view , and for the surfers head south to Soldiers Beach . <h> Killcare Beach <p> Many of Australias wealthy like Alan Jones and John Singleton have homes here . Its a quieter beach and has great waves when conditions are right . Head north around the bend and you have Putty Beach , the Bouddi coastal walk . <h> Enjoy some family fun on the Central Coast <h> Go local at the Avoca Beachside Markets <p> These are small markets run every 4th Sunday of the month . <p> There are the usual craft- and food stalls .

@@21820756 @1820756/ <h> Australias Best Shortcut The Sunshine Coast Great Beach Drive <p> Of the 55,000 kilometres we drove around Australia on our 18 month road trip , only once did we venture onto the beach in our vehicle . <p> As you know we did n't have a four-wheel drive , therefore beach driving was n't an option and we had to stick to bitumen or solid dirt roads . <p> So jumping in a four-wheel drive hire car a few weekends ago and taking on Australia 's best shortcut , the Great Beach Drive from Noosa 's North Shore to Rainbow Beach confirmed there 's only one way to do a lap of Australia next time with a 4+4 ! <p> Leaving from our home on the Gold Coast we picked up our 4+4 at Fleet Crew in Brisbane , so if you 're in that area , theyll get you beach ready too . <p> I 'm calling it- Australia 's best shortcut because instead of taking the M1 ( Bruce Highway ) from the Sunshine Coast to Rainbow Beach via Gympie , you take the prettier and quicker Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sparkling Pacific Ocean , and on the other the Great Sandy National Park. - <p> Why take the busy and boring M1 when you can take natures expressway ? ! - This is my kind of commute . <p> Our adventure started at Tewantin , down the road from Noosaville on the Sunshine Coast . The Noosa North Shore Car Ferry dropped us across the river to Noosa 's North Shore . <p> The ferry costs $7 and operates seven days a week . Before commencing your beach drive be sure to purchase a daily vehicle access permit for Cooloola Recreation Area . It 's a small fee and can be purchased online here . <p> Once you drive off the ferry follow the road all the way to the coastline and take the third sand exit onto the beach . Youve just entered paradise . <p> The Great Beach Drive stretches for 50 kilometres and is also known as the Cooloola Coast , a remote strip of beach backed by the Great Sandy National Park . <p> If you 've never driven on a beach before there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fresh air in your face . <p> No traffic lights on this road , and if you avoid the peak Christmas and Easter holidays , little traffic . <p> Or visit between the months of July to September and there 's even the chance of spotting migrating whales who head north to warmer waters along Australia 's East Coast . <p> We were a little early for whales- but were having so much fun making tracks in the sand and exploring a unique part of Australia we had yet to visit . <p> This long stretch of beach is also known as Teewah Beach and even though you 're driving on sand , normal road rules apply , including a speed limit of 60 km/hr . <p> Another important thing to note is when low and high tide is , as you only want to be driving along this stretch two hours either side if LOW tide ! <p> On the way up the beach take the opportunity to stop ( safely ) and take some ocean shots and photos of the bordering National Park . <h> Double Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island Point , and we timed our stop perfectly to coincide with a lunch break . <p> We parked our car at the bottom and did the two-kilometre walk up the headland to the lighthouse , which offered spectacular ocean and beach views over Teewah Beach and all the way to Fraser Island . <p> It 's was a great opportunity to get out of the car and stretch our legs . We took a light lunch and let the kids run off some energy around the base of the lighthouse . <p> If you do n't do lunch here , at least take a bottle of water on the walk , especially in the summer months ! And keep your eyes peeled for dolphins surfing the waves Double Island point is a famous surfing spot . <p> And of course , look out for those migrating whales in season ! <h> Rainbow Beach <p> Back in our car we drove along the short access road from Double Island Point and entered Rainbow Beach , and were like wow ! <p> Another whole world of paradise opened up before our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach passing the famous multi-coloured sand cliffs along the way , and possibly the most spectacular stretch of the whole beach drive . <p> Time your drive with the tide is super important here as the water comes right in against the cliffs . It was getting on in the day and the tide was coming in , so we had to time our moments with the water retreating after the waves had come in . <p> We made it around the bend to town and grabbed a coffee whilst the kids played at the playground overlooking the beach below . <p> Rainbow Beach is a tiny town with a holiday vibe at the base of the Inskip Peninsula . If you want to , you can even continue your Great Beach Drive with easy access to Fraser Island , only another 10 minutes away by barge . <p> But our drive ended here , it was time to switch from the motorised version of 4+4 for a four-legged animal . We were taking on Rainbow Beach on horseback . <h> Horse Riding on Rainbow Beach <p> Rainbow Beach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only places in the State where you can go horse riding on a beach . <p> This was going to be a unique family experience for us . We 'd ridden horses before along trails , but never along the edge of the surf on a pristine stretch of beach . <p> Andrew , owner of Rainbow Beach Horse Rides enthusiastically mentioned that Rainbow Beach had featured on the front cover of the 2012 publication of " 101 best beaches of Australia " . And the Huffington Post ranked it at number 5 in their article of " Nine of the Most Incredible Beaches in the World " <p> That 's some pretty good creds right there ! <p> Andrew and his crew carefully matched us up with our horses , and little three-year-old Savannah even had her own horse , which was so cute , and was led along the beach by Andrew on his horse . She did awesome ! <p> As did Kalyra who was also safely led . <p> Of course , we declined the opportunity to trot or canter , and simply relaxed as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The area in which they conduct their rides is the only stretch of beach between Noosa and the Northern tip of Fraser Island ( about 300 kilometres ) where vehicles are not allowed . <p> Again , if you time your visit right for whale season , being on horseback gives you extra elevation for spotting whales- and dolphins . <p> But if you do n't visit in whale season there 's every chance you 'll be treated to another show like us , as Rainbow Beach lived up to its name and displayed a beautiful rainbow that framed our family photo . <h> Camping at Inskip Point <p> So it was a refreshing change to just rock up to our camp site on the- Inskip Peninsula and literally have everything already set up . <p> The tent , the beds , the large tarp containing the kitchen and dining area , the portable shower and toilet , the tables and chairs , and all the food and drink chilling in the big esky . <p> You name it , it was ready to go ! <p> All we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed the hammock , with cold drink in hand as the kids played on the beach in front of us . <p> Did I mention we had absolute beach frontage and a fire pit ready to go for toasting marshmallows later in the evening . <p> Pure bliss . <p> Although I did have to get up out of my camp chair to take a snappy of the sun going down . And to drag Caz out of her hammock to help prepare our dinner , lol . <p> On the menu was : <p> Marinated steaks and marinated chicken skewers , bbq potatoes and salads ( all part of the package ) . <p> After dinner , we sat mesmerized around the fire , toasted up those marshmallows with the kids , enjoyed a few red wines , and fell asleep to the calming sound of the ocean . <p> The next morning we simply rolled out of bed , took a morning walk along the beach , and ate breakfast by the ocean . <p> This is stress-free camping all the way , and would be an awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't own their own equipment , or do n't have the time and energy for set up . <p> Rainbow Beach Hire a Camp is owned and operated by the friendly Rachel who leaves nothing to spare .

@@21820761 @1820761/ <p> However , we also discovered there are some things about traveling- with kids in Thailand we werent prepared for . <h> Travel with kids in Thailand 19 Lessons <p> 1 . Get a direct flight to Thailand . We flew from Sydney via Kuala Lumpur ( 4-hour wait ) and it was too long a journey for the girls and an unnecessary extra leg of travel each way . Sorry Air Asia , but I think our " long haul " relationship with you is over . Yes , you were cheaper , BUT next time we will fly direct and pay the little bit extra . <p> 2. - Time it so you arrive in Thailand for your childrens bed time or before . We FINALLY checked in to our hotel in Bangkok at 2am ( Australian time ) . This was a little too much for the girls to handle . <p> 4 . If you can , save visiting Bangkok until the end of your trip- when the kids have adjusted to Thai culture . Bangkok can be a little too crazy for a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wont have to carry all your " shopping purchases " around with you . <p> 5 . Allow for several days before your children adjust to the change in time , temperature and culture . <p> 6 . Only do one big activity a day- in Thailand with the kids and make it in the morning while they are fresh . Relax more in the afternoon . <p> 7. - If you have a toddler , take an umbrella stroller . They will be lighter and easier to move around the crazy , uneven streets . <p> 8. - If flying with Air Asia which operates out of the old Don- Mueang airport , save money for a taxi to and from the airport in Bangkok into Siam ( approx 500 600 baht ) . It is worth the spend . <p> Having to get the shuttle bus from the airport to Chit Lom sky train station , and then into the city can be a hassle . Not all sky train stations have escalators , and it can be hot , or raining , and tiring with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of your time in Bangkok , the Skytrain ( BTS ) is awesome ! <p> 9 . For toddlers , make sure you check your hotel room has baby cots- unless you co-sleep . It is not common and you do n't  want to be chasing a toddler around the room at 4 am. ( read tips for travelling with toddlers ) <p> 10 . For short-term visits to Thailand with kids , plan to go to just one or two places . Moving around a lot is too taxing for your children and you . <p> 11 . Most baby essentials are easy to find across the country , but if you or your child is fussy to a certain brand then pack enough supplies . <p> 12 . Its rare to find a seat belt , let alone a baby car seat in Thailand . Be prepared to wrestle your toddler the whole trip , or bring your own car seat if you are that concerned ( not sure how you will go hooking it up though ! ) . If you are travelling in a van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough space to pop in your pram with your baby strapped inside ( what we did ) . <p> 13 . Youll be able to find Western food easily enough , but if you want your childs taste buds to explore then we recommend Pad Thai or Pad See Ew as an easy way to start . Other foods might be a little too spicy for your childs stomach . You can ask for a dish to be not too spicy ( nid noi ) which means little bit in Thai . <p> Pad See Ew <p> 14 . Keep your children hydrated with plenty of water . 7/11 stores are EVERYWHERE and you can buy bottled water for cheap . Fresh coconuts , if they like the flavour , is great for hydration ( and cheap too compared to here in Australia ) . ( Read more : Tips for travelling with kids in the heat ) <p> 15 .

We are heading to Thailand in two weeks , Bangkok and Koh Samui . Our son is 15 months and while my hubby and I are well travelled , I am a little nervous about hygiene and sterilising for our little guy .

Any advice would be great ! <p> We take our girls there every year and love it so much ! You 're so right about doing the one big activity in the morning . I also find that if you 're staying somewhere with a pool , letting them swim in the morning before the activity is essential , otherwise theyll nag all day until they do . <p> We swim between 8.30-9.30 then head out on adventure , making sure to be back by 3.30pm before the almost certain rain . The heat of the day is best spent in shopping centres with them I find . <p> Also , if they are getting too tired and fractious , my magic wand tip is to take them for a massage .

Taking the afternoon off and snoozing or playing in the pool and then going out for dinner was plenty of " activity " for the rest of the day . We quite often ended up running out for takeaway or street food and eating out of plastic bags on our bed because even dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic bowl and spoon . <p> We loved the movies in Thailand . They were so cheap and a great way to cool off and have a break from walking around . <p> I have not travelled with my children to Thailand , but three quarters of these tips apply to adults as well , especially first time visitors to Asia . These are great ideas for Asian travel with kids that could make the difference between a stressed out holiday and a pleasant peaceful one . <p> Agree with Jan , lots of really usefl tips that apply to adults here as well . Ca n't agree enough though about doing trips/sightseeing etc in the mornings when the kids are fresh . Hot , sticky , grumpy afternoons are no fun for anyone . <p> Great Post . We ( my son and i ) are heading to BKK in under a week for a 4 month stint between thailand and Vietnam as part of our 12 rtw trip . The pre-travel jitters have set in and the nerves of it all too but reading this post has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its also reminded me of really how wonderful it will bewarts and all ! Thanks for re-inspiring me in my pre-jetting jitters ! <p> Huge list of great tips here . A lot of these are really good tips for ANYONE ( not just families ) going to ANY DESTINATION . Especially the tips about just relaxing and keeping your cool . <p> People often want to pack as much as possible into a trip . Moderation can be a good thing . Enjoy yourselves . Take your time . <p> Travel is a " leisure " pursuit . Be leisurely . <p> Holidays do n't  always have to be fast-paced scavenger hunts where you 're just rushing through a checklist and getting red faced in the process . ( Though there is room for fast-paced travel in the world too Its just not for everyone , all the time . ) <p> Great blog thank you ! I 'm going with my son ( 5 years ) and wondered if there 's a resort or area you would recommend or equally one to avoid ? We are going for 3 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first break just the two of us = <p> I would avoid Patong in Phuket . I really like Krabi , or Koh Lanta and I 'd choose Koh Samuii over Phuket . If you go to Phuket I 'd head more towards the north west part of the island . Enjoy it . You will be so relaxed ! <p> I came across your website through pinterest and I , m so glad I did . My partner &amp; I did a dream trip to laos , koh samui and bangkok after a year saving , it was my 1st long haul trip from Yorkshire ( UK ) where we live . We loved it so much we vowed to go back but had conceived our daughter Amber on the beautiful island of Koh Chang . I adore that she originated from such a lovely place but had always wondered if we actually would make it back now we have an infant of 3 . The long flight especially fills me with dread , even I was grumpy towards the end even though we did it direct , so what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you managed it with 2 kids no less and will be saving your post to keep me informed . Thanks for the time you put into your post its made our dream trip revisit now likely to happen . Helen Shevels <p> Hi Helen ! Thank you for finding us . I love that your daughter was conceived in Koh Chang . I think you will have the perfect time going back . Travel with a 3 year old is not that bad . I think its ages 1-3 which are the most challenging . Once they turn 3 they find their feet and are more settled . The tantrums will still come but they are manageable , more so than the constant toddler chasing . <p> Thank you for your blog ! I am half Thai and American , my mother is Thai and we usually spend a lot of time in Bangkok with family during Jan through Apr . I have n't been back since 2010 because my twins were born that year . Now that they are 3 , were planning a trip for a couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking all 3 of our children ( 6 y/o boy and 3y/o twins ) . My Thai mother recommends that my children be immunized and to prepare them with a gastric distress treatment before we travel to Thailand . What do you think about this recommendation ? <p> Also , with three children , well be renting a microbus type vehicle to be able to fit the whole family . I 'm hoping that I 'll be able install their car seats in those types of vehicles with either seat belts or carseat hooks . <p> Had I seen your blog before , I would have booked a direct flight , but were taking EVA and the stop over is in Taipei with an hour layover . So , hopefully they 're ready to travel there and meet their cousins , more so , am I ready to take them .. ! Michael <p> Hi Caz , this is a great blog ! our daughter will be 3 in September and I have been wanting to take her backpacking since she was born ! We are considering a month- 6 week trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen to get in touch with you for some advice ! thanks Cat <p> Enjoying your site very much , tnx ! Planning my trip w/ husband &amp; 2 kids ( 3 and 5 ) starting next week for 4 weeks ! First 3 nights in BKK are bookednothing else yet . Have some ideas though about the jungle , but still not sure which beach/island to go . Deciding between Krabi , Ko lanta , ko samui ( only because of weather ) and Hua Hin ( even ko samet as we will prob go twice to a beach place ) . Like to go right after our stay in BKK . Do you have recomendations on where to stay in Krabi or Ko Lanta ? Love your picture of Ko Lanta beach we like relaxed places bit lay back not too cultivated , but also do like to run in some other people and may be have a choice where to eatand snorkling . Sorry for long message <p> I think Ko Lanta is the perfect place . It has everything that you just said you wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we stayed several years ago and just lobbed up to some bungalows on the beach . I cant even remember the name or where they were . That was before blogging when I did n't  feel I had to record everything = Have a little search online and you should get lots of suggestions . Be sure to read the reviews and poke around a bit . I also love Raileys Bay near Krabi . Its actually my favourite place in the world . Its much quieter , very laid back a little isolated , but has enough people around and choices of places to stay and eat . My dream place to stay there is Rayavadee . It is number one on my bucket list . May be some time before I pull that off = <p> Wonderful blog ! So glad I found it through Pinterest . We have been contemplating a trip to Thailand for a while now but are terrified to make the flight(s) from the US to BKK with a 3 and 1 1/2 year old . Any suggestions on what time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones ? I feel once we nail down the time of year then we can get to planning the rest ! Thanks ! <p> I 'm so sorry Daniela , I 've only noticed your comment and question now . The best time is between November- Feb . Dec and Jan will be pretty busy . April is incredibly hot so you might want to miss that month . The rest of the year will be the rainy season , but its not too bad , usually a big downpour once a day <p> Excellent blog and very informative . I have just returned from my first trip thailand , 5 nights in pattaya and 2 in bangkok for a bucks party with 5 other late 20s males . After returning home I spoke with my wife about going for a family trip with the 2 kids ( 1 aged 6 and 1 aged 1 ) would you recommend bangkok for 10 days or break it up with somewhere else ? I loved bangkok when I was there and 2 nights was nowhere near enough <p> hi , what wonderful tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking our kids along for ceremony and holiday i hope its safe for them and should i vaccinate 5 year old daughter , what meds can take along ? <p> awesome thank you for the feedback , i will ask our travel agent to get as much info as possible with regards to foods , allergens etc i am so excited about this vacation = <p> Kristen <p> 4 years ago <p> Hi there , Thanks for all the great tips ! Were thinking of taking our 1.5 yo to the north and are considering driving ourselves around do you have any tips on transportation rentals ? Have u ever ridden a motorbike with your baby , like the thais do ? ? ? Thinking of busing out of BKK to someplace more peaceful then renting from there ? Your thoughts ? THANKS ! <p> Hi Kristen , We rented a car in the Chiang Mai and drove in the north . It was fine and the roads werent overly crowded . Great way to see a different side of Thailand . This was pre-kids and with another couple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rental through his friend who owned a guest house . It was pretty simple and cheap . I have n't put my kids on a motorbike and do n't  think I 'd have the stamina to do it . I know others who have and havet had a problem . <p> me and my husband are planning to travel to Thailand ( Phukhet ) , with our 16 month old girl , and I 'm wondering if you could answer a few questions ? Are there a lot of mosquitos , should we take a strong repellent with us ? Did you , or anyone you know had any problems with the food , our little one is quite adventures and likes to eat weird food , we would like how possible will that be . <p> Hi Micaela , There will be lots of mosquitos so take some repellent definitely . We 've never had problems with the food , but I 'm sure others have , just like they do in their own country . Generally , its pretty safe . There 's plenty of cockroaches for sale at the markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know anything about baby sitting . I know how much a night out is needed for the parents ! ! Perhaps you can contact some of the hotels/resorts , as they often provide baby sitting services , so they may know of reputable companies to contact . Let me know how you get on <p> hi ! Great post , thanks ! Really helpful . We are going to koh samet for three weeks with our baby , which will be almost 5 months when we arrive ( going Nov 21st-dec 12th ) . Do you have any tips regarding packing ? Were planning to bring our car seat , BabyBjorn , a stroller ( light&amp;easy ) , a floating west and travel bed . Were bringing some uv-suits , sun hats etc , but I am really unsure about how much clothes to bring otherwise . Do you have any thoughts ? Are there any essentials you think we are missing ? Appreciate it if you reply : - ) <p> I would reconsider the car seat . I 'm not sure how you are planning to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat belts , so you would n't even be able to attach the car seat . Unless you are travelling in a pre-arranged private car . That 's the challenge with Thailand you have to travel with the kids on your lap- its scary , but you get used to it . Try to limit the clothes to save on packing , laundry is pretty cheap in Thailand so you can easily wash what you have . I think you have it covered apart from that . The baby bjorn is a must ! <p> You 're itinerary sounds great . Good combination of mountains and island life . I 'm not too sure about the malaria risk for Khao Yai . Its usually only deep in the jungles up north , but I would check that with your doctor , or you can probably find out online . <p> Enjoy your trip , it will be amazing ! P.S One day well enjoy a stay at Rayavadee- Im determined ! ! <p> Remember last year ? We 've had all kinds of questions about Thailand . And you have helped us ! Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradise ! Included , you may find a movie we made from our trip through Thailand . http : //youtu.be/sNqEgWS2kL0 <p> Hi , were traveling to Phuket in April with our girl , shell be 15 months then . I am a little worried as I am pregnant with number 2 and will be 23 weeks then . We 've tentatively booked a seat for her on the plane , although to an extra $900 ! Debating whether to do it or not but I think we should ! My hubby and I have been to Thailand 2 times before so it will be a very relaxing holiday and a little bit of shopping ! Do you have any tips for me ? Nervous ! aha <p> I think you should be fine . Just talk to your doctor to make sure and be very careful of what you eat . It will be very hot in April so something else to think about . We honeymooned in April and I think its one of the hottest Ive ever been . Its a great place to take it easy so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> i know that american airlines charge a seat for extra if you want a big leg room for you and your child . but other airline like qatar are nice to move you to big leg room seat at no charge . we tried air france and other airlines other than american , they are nice for moms to move up to big seat if no one sits there . i hope this helps . <p> We are gon na be travelling with a 3 month old and with another friend who would be 5 months pregnant . We are planning to do a Mumbai(India) Krabi Bangkok Pattaya Mumbai from the 15th of May for around 20 days . I need to know how would the heat and mosquito situation in these places . While we have n't booked a 5 star hotel , the accommodation seems pretty . Should i be worried about anything else too ? ? <p> Helpful tips . Thailand and generally big cities in southeast asia are n't dangerous . I have been working and living here in Thailand with my family for 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working and living here in Thailand for 3 years and I 've never felt unsafe . I guess it 's just a matter of exercising caution and using common sense . <p> Thanks for a great blog that I am just discovering . We live in Nepal with our two girls ( 3 year old and 1 year old ) and are trying to plan a quick get away April 10 for about 9 days . Am I a bit late in planning this , I wonder ? We were thinking about Koh Samui and staying in a resort with pool for kids , playground , yeah , maybe even a kids club . Do you have any good recommendations on resorts or places to go ( maybe instead of Koh Samui that seems to be quite booked ) ? Thanks for your help : - ) Ingrid <p> Another great article ! Thailand is November , after Japan , China and Cambodia on our upcoming ten month rtw trip and you really helped me picture the day to day of it . We are doing BKK , Chiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stopping . Then we will be off to a month in Sri Lanka . Thank you for your great site and Pinterest boards ! <p> Thanks for sharing such usefull information . We are going to Thailand this month ( 5 days in Krabi and 2 days in Bangkok ) with my 16 month old girl . I would greatly appriciated if you could give me some more information as mentioned bellow : 1 . Should we take my girl on a speed boat to Koh Phi Phi ? 2 . Is there any non-spicy food for baby ? such as : steam rice/porridge with omelette or something like that because we do n't  want to bring too much jarred food . Thank you so much ! ! ! <p> hi , i also will be bringing 16 month old . i was told to take a ferry from phuket to ko phi phi , not speed boat . because of bumpy ride . i 'm sure there are non spicy food . maybe order plain white rice from your main lunch dinner plate , and ask for non spicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about travelling with small children . Were planning a 3-week trip to Thailand in June/July with our 1 year old son and I was wondering if you could answer a few of my concerns . We went there 2 and 3 years ago before we became parents and ( of course ) fell in love with the country . I know that there is some rain during these months , but as I understand it usually comes within shortterm spans in the afternoon , which I 'm sure is no problem . Were planning on flying ( direct as you also recommended ) from Oslo , Norway to Bangkok and then going directly to Phuket where we will book about 4 days at the Kata beach , and were also thinking of going to Koh Lanta and perhaps one more place ( but no more as we do n't  want to move around too much ) . Well decide on where to go on from Kata after we get there and figure out how the little one agrees with the heat and humidity . <p> Were thinking og bringing a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit heave for the baby bjorn ) and also a lifewest for him ( or do they have small ones available that we can rent ? ) . Were also not sure of how much food ( porrage and dinner ) we should bring , or whether these things are available at the local stores ? <p> Do you recommend any specific hotels or places to go on from Kata that work well with children ? And are there any other concerns we should have with taking the little one as opposed to when it was just the two of us ? <p> Thank you for any advice and pointers you can throw in my direction . There sure is a bit nervousness attached to travelling with him for the first time , compared to the worry-free trips that we have enjoyed in the past . But as you apparantly also set out to do , we will not let that stop us from continuing to explore Thailand and hopefully many more beautiful places and countries in the years to come . Cheers ! <p> Hi Tobias , We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did have 2 tins of formula for her though . She ate the Thai food , or western food from the restaurants and was fine . She was sick for a couple of nights but I 'm not sure what caused it . I 'd bring your own life vest- just to be sure . I do n't  know of any hotels in kata for families , but there are plenty there , it just depends on your budget . IT is daunting for sure , but you will have a great time ! <p> Hi Thanks for writing such a great blog . Me my wife and my 2.5yo daughter are travelling to thai in mid may . 4 days in phuket 4 in koh samui and 2 in bangkok patong . Is patong a good place to stay with the family and does my itinerary contain beachea shopping and nightlife as this is my first time . Any suggestiona of a nice itinerary and good hotels ? <p> On Koh Tao Island they offer childcare for infants to teenagers ! = kindergarten called Koh Tao Childrens Day Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to example go Diving together , enjoy night life etc .. = and this is good to know if planning staying long term . <p> Hi , Great tips ! ! I have been to Thailand with my wife , but now we go back with 2 families . In total 5 kids from 2 till 7 yo . We start in Bangkok and will move to the islands . We try to avoid the western ( expensive ) hotels . Do you have suggestions for places to stay in Bangkok or a great website to get info from ? <p> Great blog and great tips . Just take it easy is good for evrybody . Flying direct is a good tip , but sometimes too expensive . For us ( AMS-BKK ) a direct flight is at least 40% more expensive . Starting to fly in the morning instead of the evening gives you a headstart though . For dutch speakers : take a look at our website ( " travelfamiliy " ) , or the excellent website http : **31;816;TOOLONG . <p> Love the blog ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in Thailand in a couple of months time with my 3 year old . He s well used to budget travel , having been to over 20 countrieson a shoestring budget already ! We will be in the North of Thailand for a few weeks and then have 5 days to spend at a beach on the way to malaysia . Were thinking the East coast due to the weather in the Andamans at that time of year , although I have always wanted to visit Koh Lanta . Have you ever been to any islands in the rainy season ? If so would you recommend against it ? Should be just stick the the east coast ? What beach on what island would you recommend for young kids and parents that like a quiet , a laid back vibe , no crowds and beautiful beaches ? <p> The islands can be hit an miss in the rainy season . You must just get daily downpours that do n't  last long or you could have torrential rain all day . Its hard to say . It depends on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I like Koh Lanta the best for the quiet laid back vibe. m not sure of the best beaches though . Its been years since we 've been there <p> We are planning on going to Thailand for my 30th in jan 2016 . We have a 2 year old little boy . Where is the best family place to visit ? I have been to Bangkok and Phuket before but did n't  find it family orientated . Mainly ladyboy bars and dancers etc . <p> We are in the process of planning a trip to Thailand for July/August 2015 . We have a while to organise as we want to make sure were well organised.my husband and I will be travelling with a 16 year old and a 10 year old . Chiang Mai has been recommended to us , but were hoping to travel for a few weeks so will want to travel around . My husband wants to visit kanchanaburi too . How easy is it to travel across the country ? Any recommendations would be great . We like animals , beauty spots , architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and I have travelled to Thailand 3 times before however our upcoming trip in feb 2015 will be very different as we will have our 8 month old son with us . We roll be staying in Bophut on Koh Samui and was wondering if there are any activities or tours you can do with a baby ? Also with regards to food for bubs what would you recommend as I 'm presuming he would have old been started on solids for a couple of months ? ! ? Thanks so much <p> Yes . He will be on solids . He should still be on forumla , or still breast feeding . If you are using formula just take what you need with you to ensure you do n't  get stuck . The tours just depend on what is on offer and how comfortable you feel I 'd research it before hand and find out how suitable it is for kids . Bear in mind safety wont be as big a deal as it is in the western world . <p> I would carry cards that have the dietary issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for the issues and have them written down . That way you can show it to the waitress and clearly show your needs . I think Thai curries should be okay , but I do n't  want to say that in case its not . <p> Hi , we are travelling to Thailand in March next year with our 4 year old . We have both been before and are visiting Bangkok , Krabi , and the quieter side of Phuket and will be looking to re-visit some of the fantastic snorkelling spots that we done before . I 'm looking forward to it but am paranoid about anything happening to my little boy Oliver , particularly in the reefs where I am a confident swimmer but by no means a match for a shark . Last time we went I could n't wait to go swimming with the black tips off Phi Phi so am quite comfortable with the wildlife but now I have more important things to think about . Any tips would be much appreciated as my partner is beginning to think Im loosing the plot with questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ? " .. I think she may be right ! ! <p> I think wait until you get there and see how you feel . Ask around to see what other families there think if they 've been snorkelling . Ask the guides . I do n't  think you need to take a diving knife though . Look at the facts and statistics have they had incidents before where sharks have attacked people ? Are there any sharks bigger and hungrier than black tips . <p> I totally understand your fear and when we become parents it goes to ridiculous levels and often illogical . I freak out whenever my kids go near the window of a high rise building , even though logically I know they ca n't fall out of it . Its truly insane . <p> But , if you just try your best to calm those fears down so you can see the facts and get a better assessment . If its too overwhelming for you and you just do n't  want to risk it then do n't  feel bad about it . That 's still a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , one go snorkelling while the other stays behind on the beach and then perhaps switch the next day . <p> Btw , weve just had the past five months in the Top End of Australia and I almost did n't  come because I was so scared of the crocodiles and my girls getting too close to the river bank in a moment when I my hawk eye watch faltered . I would seriously wake up in a sweat at night over it . Alas , we 've had no problems and we 've had the most amazing time . I 'm so glad I did n't  let me crazy Mumma bear fear get in the way . <p> Great blog . Really great . Heading to Natai Beach for a friends wedding at Jivana Villa ( chaCHING ! ) this Apr w our 15mth old . We are seasoned budget travellers , preferring to arrive , check the scene and find a nice but cheap place but have resided to the fact that a reservation is probably a good idea with the baby . Will budget accomodation be doable or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels . Does anyone know of any nice but cheap places on or near Natai Beach ? What about leaving the babe with someone for the day to go diving ? What about live-aboard tours ? Know of any for families with small kids ? Is it even advisable to try to do one with babe ? Thanks for any tips ! <p> I think budget accommodation will work okay . As long as its safe and comfortable and you 're okay with it . It might be a good idea to get a reservation just so it is one less thing for you to worry about . Youd have to ask around for baby sitting options . I 'm sure there are some there just be very diligent with checking credentials etc . Usually the big resorts will have that as a service . I do n't  know of any diving tours that would cater for kids . Its not likely , but you never know . <p> Hi Caz and Craig ! Your information is so helpful , not to mention your family snapshots amazing and getting me so excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2 1/2 weeks . Can you suggest YOUR favourite beach and resort for us to go to in the south for 5-7 nights . We really want to swim , explore the area , sleep well at night . I 'm thinking Railay Beach in Krabibut there are an overwhelming number of beaches and blogs to try to get a handle on . Please help steer me into making the right choice . With thanks and appreciation , Charlotte <p> Hey there Great Blog I have been to Thailand twice and trained in Mauy Thai Its always been my dream to take my son there , He will be 4 in March .. Its odd because I have never had travel anxieties ! but now a parent its a weird change ! I am thinking Koh Lanta as its chilled , has yoga for my sister and a gym for me to train .. My main anxieties are travelling down from Bangkok with my son , I was thinking of getting a flight to Samui ? then a boat across ? Anyone else done this with a child ? Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my son I want somewhere pre-booked .. We are going for 3 weeks . I have n't decided on Koh Lanta and also looking at Koh Tao and Krabi .. We are going April-May .. so I know it will be super hot .. What 's the best way to get down to the islands with a child ? Pre-book ? just turn up ? Thanks <p> I would n't get a flight to Samui as its not in the same ocean as Lanta and Krabi . I 'd fly to Phuket and then get either a bus or boat . With a child it might be best to prebook something its just one less thing to worry about . <p> Hi Laura , we got a flight from Bangkok to krabi and then got a taxi van to Koh lanta . Air Asia flights were cheap . There were loads of families holidaying in Koh lanta and you are close enough for a day trip to Koh phi phi . <p> Hi , I 'm a sole parent looking at taking my 10yr old daughter to Thailand in January for 2 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think it is safe to travel by train , bus ? I was thinking of hiring a driver but appears to expensive . Can anyone give advise please . <p> We did a month of travelling in Thailand with our 3 children aged 8 , 4 &amp; 2 back in February 2014 . We would advise to book accommodation in advance ( we were there in high season ) as the last thing you want to be doing is driving around desperately looking for a suitable room with kids in tow . In 4 weeks we covered a lot of ground visiting Koh Lanta , koh phi phi , koh Samui , koh phangan , kanchanaburi , koh samet and Bangkok . With 6 of us in our group we used private mini van hire to get around the country . The kids did n't  mind the long road trips and we could all stretch out and relax with out disturbing anyone . I have to say we did have a few crazy experiences with the Thai peoples interest in our children . The children and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly touched through the streets of Bangkok , photographed and filmed with camera phones in markets and malls where ever we went . It did get a bit creepy at times . 7/11 shops were great for picking up yogurts and snacks for the children for days out and long journeys . <p> Hi there ! I am so grateful to have found this blog ! My husband and I are planning on travelling to Thailand for 6-12 months with our two children , aged 3 and 1 1/2 . A major concern is how we are going to get around with them ! We are not sure whether we should bring a double stroller or kid carriers . Keep in mind that we intend on spending anywhere from 1-3 months in each location . Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ! <p> Hard choice as you are going for so long , you do n't  want to be carrying them all the time . I would n't worry about a stroller for the three year old . And possibly not worry for the younger one as the footpaths are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Although if you are staying in one place for awhile it might be worth it . Maybe just take a small , cheap one for the little one and then if it becomes too much of a hassle you can just leave it behind . <p> Hi We will be traveling to Thailand with a 5/6 mo old . We live in Asia , so I do n't  really care to spend too much time in the big city of Bangkok , but I do want to fly in/out of there . Any recommendations for a small town near by ( have been to Laos , Cambodia , Vietnam etc. so I do n't  feel like I 'm dying to see every stupa etc. ) just want some sights and some relaxation . Thanks ! ! ! <p> Thank you for the helpful information ! We have never been to Thailand and we have a 1 year old and a 3 year old . We are most concerned at this point with car seats and how to travel with small children once we are there . It sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? Any help would be greatly appreciated ! <p> We have been to Krabi many years ago and loved it . But that was before we had kids , so ca n't recommend from the family angle so to speak . But it was one of our fave spots in Thailand and I 'm sure its still great . <p> We will visit Thailand on the second week of February 2016 . My 8 year old son wants to visit elephants show and wants to experience elephant ride . Can you suggest places in Thailand near Pratunam area with elephant show <p> Hi guys . Thanks for the helpful post . We are about to leave for a 2 week stay in Koh Lanta/Krabi with our 2 year old . I was all cool with everything until I started reading up on the roads there , and now I am very anxious about getting into taxis at Phuket , transfers here and there etc. especially since they do n't  care for safety seats . What can you tell me about this ? Also , we have changed our plans so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok in January ? I am a bit of a worrier unfortunately ! <p> I-m considering going to Thailand for two weeks alone with my 5 year old daughter would you consider it safe for me , as a single female , to travel alone with my 5 year old daughter ? ( Bangkok and Islands ) <p> This is a great article ! We spent six months living in Bangkok last year with our two-year-old daughter and she absolutely loved it . The Thai people are so accommodating when it comes to children and we felt very welcome everywhere we went . Also , if you have a fussy eater then 7eleven is your best friend .

It is almost unbelievable to see such a beautiful and large expanse of greenery right in the middle of a bustling city . The gardens are huge and there is a lot for kids to do . Try the Childrens Garden for hands on exploring . <p> My kids loved the cool room in The Orchid Garden , a misty garden with a waterfall in a chilly glass house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiosks to grab an ice cream or cold drink . <p> Hot Tip : The gardens are huge ; you cant see the whole lot with little kids as they will get too hot and tired , so plan your route and head straight to your preferred spots .

Take the kids to Universal Studios to rock it with The Sesame Street Gang or go to Underwater World and see the Pink Dolphins . <p> There are also rides galore from The Skyline Luge to the Wave House . If you do n't want to do the big ticket attractions , the island is still worth a look and getting there is half the fun . <p> You can go by the Sentosa express monorail , walk via the boardwalk or even high above the ocean on a Cable Car . <p> Hot Tip : This is where the Singaporeans like to play , so avoid it on the weekends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands <p> If you are looking at keeping the kids busy and escaping the heat , head to The Shoppes it is an upmarket shopping centre . <p> Firstly , follow the escalators all the way to the very top and wander around the roof top gardens .

You will find everything from Chinese style slippers , jade jewellery , cheap souvenirs and more .

Boom . Hands down victory . <p> Seriously , New York is great and I 'm from that area , so it did take me awhile to admit it out loud , but Chicago has everything NYC has , except its cleaner , greener , and more friendly .

See a free concert , snap photos of the " Bean " , check out the video fountains , just enjoy the gardens , or grab a beer at vast outdoor beer garden at the Park Grill . <p> The Loop <p> This is the heart of the business district . During the week its full of workers scurrying about . <p> This is Chicagos most popular shopping street . Michigan Avenues most popular stretch is just about a mile long ( hence it being called the Magnificent Mile ) and full of all the favorite shops like Macys , Nike , the Disney Store and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite buildings the beautiful Wrigley Building and its neighbor just across the street , The Tribune Tower ( a building I had the pleasure of working in a couple years ago ) . <p> Chicago Lakefront <p> One of my favorite parts of the city is our huge , ocean-like lakefront . On warm , sunny days folks of all kinds will be out enjoying the lake by running , cycling , roller blading , boating , walking or just sunning themselves . <p> Rent a bike and ride for miles north from Navy Pier , through Oak Street Beach , to North Avenue Beach ( stop for a beer and a burger at Castaways at the Boat House ) , watch some volleyball and enjoy the view of the city . <p> Chicago is a city of neighborhoods . Nothing will give you a better feel for the real city than getting out of downtown by just a couple of miles and venturing into the hoods where real Chicagoans live , work , and play . <p> My favorites are the village-like areas of Lincoln Square and Andersonville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrigley Field ( the second oldest baseball field in the U.S. ) plus the neighborhood is full of fun bars and restaurants . <p> The Home of the Chicago Cubs <h> Where to Eat in Chicago <p> My favorite thing to do in Chicago ?

Go for a great comedy show . <h> Where to Stay in Chicago <h> Markets and Shopping in Chicago <p> Michigan Avenue is our 5th Avenue , but prettier . Gorgeous Christmas decorations in winter and flower-filled parkways in spring and summer . <p> Oak Street is just at the north end of Michigan Avenue .

The snow is pretty at Christmas time and there 's ice skating and the amazing German Market in Daley Plaza . <p> But for the most comfortable times of year , - I would say Spring , Summer , and Fall between May and September or October . <h> Getting There and Away <p> Chicago has two airports OHare International and Midway and both are connected easily to the city by the CTA train for just $2.25 .

@@21820769 @1820769/ <h> Loving Federation Square Things to do in Melbourne <p> When I first walked upon Federation Square I did n't know what to think . <p> Is that it ? Why is this place so well known ? Why is this the centre piece and one of the recommended things to do in Melbourne ? <p> It was just a square . An open square with a bunch of elaborately designed , albeit attractive and interesting , buildings surrounding it . We had arrived during the middle of the day and Fed Square was relatively empty and seemed a little lackluster . <p> The problem with coming from a stunning city like Sydney is that you tend to gaze at places with these glasses that expect to be wowed by an outside appearance . <p> The sparkle and shine of a stunning harbour grants you permission to not dig a little deeper . <p> Melbourne does n't have the visual wow factor , so you 're forced to dive deeper into its soul . Once you do that , you find yourself slowly slipping into LOVE . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the main open-air square .

It was a peaceful , relaxing and warm atmosphere . <p> I was a bit uncoordinated , but did n't feel like anybody cared . It was about your own Zen experience , not anyone 's perceptions of you . <h> What an amazing free experience <p> My attitude towards Federation Square had suddenly shifted . <p> I was learning that Fed Square is an example of what happens when a city cares about its community . It adds vibrancy and experiences that cause people to be happy and return again and again . And many of it for FREE ! <p> At Fed Square you get free Wi-Fi , free daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey bees and gardens , restaurants and bars that have deals , and free sports on the BIG TV screen we were there during the Australian Tennis Open . <p> One of the events became our favourite .

Oh , and it comes complete with free beach chairs spread out in front of the stage . <p> Savannah &amp; Kalyra dancing to the music <p> Fed Square is buzzing with festivals and fun . <p> From the live sporting events on the big screen like the AFL Grand Final , Tennis Open and the Formula One Grand Prix , to the quieter moments when people laze around on those beach chairs soaking up the atmosphere , and if Melbourne is playing nice , the sun . <p> And if you 're lucky , you can stumble upon an entertaining performance from a busker , which kept our kids amused for 30 minutes . <p> Kalyra &amp; Savannah watching a busker <p> We could sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which overlooks Fed square and the stage Sunday $12 carafes of white sangria and jugs of cider is a little hard to ignore . <h> What else is at Federation Square ? <p> The Melbourne Visitor Centre is located underground with its entrance at the main corner , drop in for some free info . <p> The Atrium- is one of the major public spaces in the precinct populated with galleries , specialty shopping and cool cafes . <p> ACMI The Australian Centre for the Moving Image is worth a look , and its permanent exhibition Screen Worlds : The Story of Film , Television and Digital Culture is free ! <p> Need to catch up online ?

The girls loved creating Universes outside in the garden . <p> One other highly recommended place you must see nearby is Hosier Lane , made famous for its sophisticated urban street art ( graffiti lined walls ) . Hosier is literally a 60-second walk away . <p> Federation Square grows on you the longer you are in the city and the more chances you get to experience the space and the various events . <p> If we were locals , I know its a place wed frequent often , especially on those special occasions .

I remember loitering around Flinders Street Station , while my sister was busy shopping . Melbourne is n't a cultural capital of Australia without a reason . <p> Fed Sq is great especially when there is something going on . I have visited a few times and loved it most during Melbourne International Comedy Festival when they have stages set up for the comedy acts . There was a great buzz about the area . The Riverland Bar does some great mulled wine in winter . We sat outside under one of the umbrellas on a cool drizzly afternoon all rugged up in our coats and scarves and drank the mulled wine . Its one of my happiest memories of Melbourne . <p> I absolutely loved visiting Fed Square when I lived in Melbourne !

When I was at the White Light Festival in February there was a massive crowd watching the live music show here . <p> You also highlight the many bars and eateries too . This place can be bustling on a night and a great starting point to explore the city .

The Savannah Gulf region is a dry and barren side , yet on closer look , a thriving one . <p> It 's worth spending a few minutes stopping at one of the many wide , dry river banks and contemplating what it must look like during the wet season when its completely full of water and then some. - <p> Imagining that water breaking the banks and rising up like the 1974 floods . <p> It will blow your mind . You just ca n't imagine how it can go from bone dry to flooding with enough water to provide the needs of Australia and then some . <p> But that is this amazing Gulf country in northern Australia . <h> The Savannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling along The Savannah Way with our own little Savannah . We named her Savannah for two reasons : because we love the city in America , and because we love the African Savannah a wild place . <p> Now she gets to meet her namesake in Australia , except this Savannah is filled with kangaroos and emus instead of man-eating lions . <p> There 's plenty of things here that will kill you though from snakes , to crocodiles , and poisonous plants , so keep your wits about yourself . <p> The majority of the svannah Way is sealed road , but there are sections that turn to gravel and plenty of tributaries offering that wild off-road driving experience . Our Ford Territory is an all-wheel-drive and not built for the hard-core 4wd section so we took the alternative routes . <h> Cairns to the Northern Territory Border <p> Below is our suggested guide and places to visit along the Queensland section of the drive from Cairns to the Northern Territory border . Just reverse it if you 're coming from the opposite direction . <h> The Atherton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights in Atherton , and depending on your interests this is enough time to see the highlights . It 's a beautiful region that varies from agricultural farmlands , to ancient rainforest with stunning waterfalls and scrub land . <h> Places to stop on the drive from Atherton to Undara Lava Tubes <p> Ravenshoe is the highest town in Queensland- and worth a pit stop if having a drink in Queenslands highest pub is your thing . Otherwise , there 's not much else to see , <p> Stop in at the Innot Hot Springs . Do n't expect to see any springs on a grand scale like Rotorua in New Zealand . It 's actually more of a small puddle , lol . But , it 's nice for sitting and really hot. - <h> Undara Lava Tubes <p> What a fascinating discovery Undara was ! Here you will find the worlds longest lava tubes a phenomena I knew nothing about until coming here . Plan to spend two nights so you can make the most out of what 's on offer . <p> Do the Archway Explorer Tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your caravan or camper trailer , or how about sleeping in an old railway carriage . <h> Drive from Undara to Cobbold Gorge <p> Stop at Mt Surprise along the way . Grab a burger like they used to be before they were ruined at the BP cafe. - <p> Fuel up at Georgetown before taking the unsealed 80km road to Cobbold . Pulling our Jayco Camper Trailer took us about 90 minutes for this section . <p> The scenery is true outback gorgeousness with the red dirt , blue skies , huge termite mounds and scrub trees . I 'd so love to see it in the wet when the greenery comes out . <h> Cobbold Gorge <p> Yet another special place on the Savannah Gulf . We stayed at Cobbold Gorge for one night , you might like to rest a while it 's peaceful enough with plenty to keep you entertained , and the infinity pool has amazing views . <p> The only way to explore this narrow gorge is on a three-hour tour , which takes you on a boat trip through the gorge and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely knowledgeable about the area and the Savannah Gulf and so passionate about it . It was easy to fall in love with it too . <p> She shared many stories about the flora and fauna , took us to some beautiful view points and told stories about the early settlers and the mysterious death of pioneer John Corbett . <h> Drive to Normanton <p> There 's not much in between here and Normanton so be prepared for a drive of about 4 1/2- hours . <p> We arrived in the afternoon- and stayed for a night at the Albion Hotel so we could arrive early in the morning for our Gulflander experience . Do n't  expect too much comfort here but the barra &amp; chips for dinner in the pub restaurant was enjoyable . <p> Normanton town is basically a refueling stop , although you can stick your head inside a replica of one of the largest crocs ever caught , Krys the croc , who measured a whopping 8.5 metres . <h> The Gulflander Experience <p> Train enthusiasts will love this experience on the historic and- legendary Gulflander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of Normanton with the rich gold fields of Croydon , today the Gulflander is a tourism icon and working tribute to the early pioneers of the Gulf of Carpentaria . <p> We experienced the " Billy tea and damper " excursion to Critters Camp located at the picturesque 11-mile camp . The three-hour journey is filled with anecdotes , facts , fascinating trivia and information about the history of the Gulflander , the Savannah Gulf landscape and its rich past . <p> It was one of the best billy and damper teas Ive experienced on this road trip so far . <p> Cost : $61 adult $37 child <p> Damper and scones on the Gulflander trip <h> Karumba <p> If you love fishing- or stunning sunsets then Karumba , only an hours drive from Normanton , is worth a visit . <p> It 's a very chilled beach town , but remember no swimming in the beach here this is croc territory ! <p> Grab a drink , and some takeaway fish and chips from Ash 's across the road and sit on the beach and watch the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a sunset tavern should you wish for tables and chairs and a more formal dinner . <p> Fishing is the thing to do here and many people get stuck here for months spending their mornings bringing in the catch for the day or perhaps for the week . <p> Like our friend Emma- who returned with six blue salmon and a beaming smile. - <h> Drive from Karumba to Gregory River <p> There are two ways you can go here . The unsealed road via Burketown , or the sealed road via the Burke and Wills Roadhouse . We found the Burke and Wills disappointing and just a fuel stop and a place to stretch the legs and grab a quick bite to eat . <p> The drive on the sealed road takes about four and a half hours and takes you through pretty outback scenery . This was the first time we 'd seen emus in the wild- and the Big Red kangaroos . <h> Camp at Gregory River <p> This is one of those moments where the difference between wet and dry water levels will blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry river banks of the Gregory River . Look up several metres into the paperback trees and see the debris of branches stuck above so you know how high this river gets . <p> The little fast flowing stream next to your campsite leaves no clues. - <p> Except those related to fun . <p> Grab your tube , or boogie boards and jump in and allow the stream to take you for a- ride . Watch the sharp turning corners odds are you 'll end up in the pandanus bushes on the other side . Kick yourself off though , do n't grab them as you could slice up your hands . <p> This outback oasis is a little piece of serenity and a definite place to kick back for a day or two and converse with the trees . <p> There 's a small pub a short walk back up the hill that does meals , cold beer and fuel . <h> Drive from Gregory River to Adels Grove <p> Next up was a relatively short drive of 90km from Gregory River to Adels Grove , which feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of open road and blue sky to take in here . <h> Adels Grove <p> For those wanting a little more civilization and facilities , you can either camp at Adels Grove or stay in furnished river tents or rooms . <p> There is a beautiful creek and natural swimming hole beside the shady camp sites , or a more secluded camping spot out the back . A two-course meal and buffet breakfast is on offer at the restaurant . <p> From Adels , you have easy access to the amazing Boodjamulla National Park via a 10km unsealed road . <p> Camping at Adels starts at $34 and Dinner , bed and breakfast packages start at $270 . <h> Boodjamulla National Park / Lawn Hill Gorge <p> Boodjamulla National Park has been one of the most delightful finds on our Australian road trip so far .

That would be great information . Thanks a lot for sharing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QLD east coast and the NT border = <p> Yes definitely consider it .

Have you written a post on how to equip your car for full time travel ? I 'm planning a trip around the world by road and would love some tips on what to look for in a car . ( I used the search function , I promise ! ! = ) <p> Great post , guys ! That 's a fantastic resource for people doing that route . I 've done it a couple of times with my parents as a child , and did half of route ( twice again ) with my hubby updating guidebooks . We really took our time , taking months to do it with my family , and weeks with Terry . As you discovered , there 's so much to see and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although we experienced on coastal Queensland . I was only seven years old but I distinctly remember the water entering the car and I had to put my legs up on the seat . It was a short trip so we were driving Mums purple Mustang ( no 4WD and caravan that trip ) which was never the same again . But it was quite an adventure ! <p> I did part of the Savannah Way in 2012 ( Normanton to Cairns ) in a Commodore . I did part in 2015 ( May ) including Undara and Cubbold by motorcycle . This was a section of a fund-raising ride for the RFDS ( Cairns to Perth along the Outback Way ) cut short by an accident halfway between Yulara and the WA border . There are so many beautiful areas in the outback but few actually visit them , preferring instead to travel overseas . I want to visit as many as I can but people like you keep on finding more and making planning more difficult ! 
@@21820774 @1820774/ <h> 9 Ways We Save on Accommodation in Australia <p> Saving on accommodation in Australia has never been so important . Australia an expensive country to travel , but one worth exploring . <p> Do n't think you ca n't travel Australia yet ? There are many ways you can save on travel costs . <p> Instead of setting a daily budget , we set a weekly one , to allow for a bit of daily movement . Melbourne blew that budget out of the water , but other than that splurge we 've been able to keep under budget . <p> Below are nine ways we 've saved money on accommodation costs on our Australian road trip . ( It will be your biggest expense so listen and learn ! ) <h> 1 . Stay Mid-Week <p> If you can time your visit right by staying mid-week , you can really save some cash . Especially avoid the big cities over a weekend if possible . <p> We 're stunned by how much the prices for a bed can rise on the weekend some places triple . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly see the fluctuations in prices from mid-week to weekends . <p> And we 've seen better prices mid-week for all accommodation types from hotels to apartments to caravan parks . <p> If you have to visit a city over a weekend see tip number 8 for our best online booking sites , or consider staying in a hostel . We stay in family rooms at YHA Hostels . If you have a group of 4 consider staying in a 4-bed dorm to cut down your expense . <p> Our cabin at Port Campbell Great Ocean Road <h> 2 . Negotiate for a Better Deal <p> One of our favourite ways to save on anything ! There 's nothing wrong with a little conversation to help you get a better deal . <p> Competition is pretty fierce in the travel industry as people are finding smarter ways to travel for cheaper and longer . Put your smiley face on and either call the property in advance , or speak in person once you arrive . They can only say no right ? ! <p> Here are a few ways to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best price you have at the moment ? <p> What if we stay longer ? <p> Are you able to waive the fee for children ? ( Many of the campsites in Australia charge per child . We 've negotiated it off several times ) <p> Does breakfast come with that ? Are you able to include it ? <p> Is there any chance for an upgrade ? <p> I did notice XYZ property down the road is advertising $X can you match that ? I 'd much prefer to stay here , but I have to keep to my budget . <p> You might even negotiate a better deal by giving up some of their services . <p> We recently got an entire night for free in Wilsons Promontory National Park as there was a mix up with another booking and our cabin had not been cleaned . We told them not to worry , we 'd clean it ourselves ( we were desperate to stay here and there were no other options AND it was pretty clean ) . <h> 3 . Rent an Apartment or Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families or small groups . <p> Apartments , or home rentals , are a great way to save on accommodation costs . They are usually cheaper and more practical than a hotel , or even a caravan park cabin . And sometimes even cheaper than a private room in a hostel . <p> Traveling with other family members or another couple ? Why not get an apartment big enough and share the cost . <p> Craigs parents visited us during our trip in Tasmania and several times we rented either an apartment , or a cabin with 3 bedrooms . Sharing the apartment really reduced our per-night rates . <p> Check out these sites for apartments and home rentals : <p> AirBnB they have a growing list of inventory in Australia whether you need an apartment for a night , or a home for a month . <p> Booking.com they are not just about hotels , they have a large inventory of apartments around the world . <p> We found this 3 bed home near famous Wineglass Bay in Tasmania on Stayz.com.au <h> 4 . Go Camping <p> One would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no. ( just do n't compare it to other countries . ) <p> On average you 'll pay $35 per night , but this can rise to as high as $80 depending on where and when you camp , how many people per site , and if you want a powered or un-powered site . <p> For families , they will charge you per child , and we have even been charged $12 per night for Savannah she 's 2 years old which got up my goat and was able to negotiate away ! <p> We look for the right deals and we use our negotiation tactics to at least remove the fees for the kids . One good thing about now having a camper trailer ( see tip number 7 ) is we are self-sufficient so can utilise the many free camping sites in Australia . <h> 5 . House-sit <p> We have n't used the housesitting strategy yet via an official membership site , although we did sign up for a few at the start of our trip . <p> To be honest , we 've found these a little frustrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to land a house-sitting job . Many of the house-sits were in outer areas , and we did n't  want to visit these locations for the sake of house-siting . <p> You also need time to organize it , or be super flexible to move on a whim . With kids and a business , and a country the size of Australia , its too difficult for us to commit to apply for that awesome house-sitting job in Perth in 4 months , or last minute . <p> In saying that , if you are very flexible on your locations , are retired or semi-retired , work a digital business , or are on a working holiday I totally get the value this can provide . <p> However , we have been very fortunate to be able to house-sit a few times on this trip for friends in some great locations like Melbourne and Bright . Relationships can really pay off and we hope to return the favour one day ! <p> Enjoying our house-sit in Bright , Victoria <h> 6 . Couch-Surf <p> We have not used the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which we 've been told by others is a great way to travel like a local ) , but we have been fortunate to be able to stay at several friends homes in various states . <p> And we do n't usually end up on their couch either , but a spare room which is always appreciated . The bonus of this is you get to have a night of great conversation with friends and re-connect with people you may not have seen for a while . <h> 7 . Buy a Camper Trailer ( or Caravan ) <p> Although the initial investment is large , over time it drastically reduces our per-night cost of our accommodation . Plus , it has a kitchen which reduces our eating out expenses . <p> We purchased a brand that has a high re-sale value , so if we desire at the end of our trip we can sell it and recoup the majority , if not more of our purchase price . Apparently , if you sell up in North Queensland , or over in Western Australia you can actually make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventory is down south so people are willing to pay more up north ) . <p> Also , we have solar panels on top of our camper so we can free camp in National Parks and there are many beautiful spots in Australia for this . We can also stay in un-powered sites in caravan parks instead of powered which again reduces our per-night cost . <p> For free and cheap camping options purchase the orange covered Camping Around Australia book found in all camping and book stores . Or visit their website ExploreAustralia.net.au <p> If you are on an extended trip around Australia , or on a working holiday in Australia , buying or renting a vehicle that you can sleep in , then re-sell at the end of your trip is a great way to reduce your accommodations expenses + give you unparallelled freedom to explore ! <p> What if you just want to rent a campervan / motorhome ? Some rental sites for booking include : <h> 9 . Partnerships Exchange Accommodation for Exposure <p> Through building our business and our travel blog , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships with YHA Hostels and Mantra Apartments. - <p> Even before we had these official partnerships we always stayed at YHA Hostels and at Mantra because they offer great value . <p> YHA hostels are the best for families in Australia and we trust them and have not had a bad experience yet . And we adore Mantra properties they are our favourite chain in Australia . <p> Just because you do n't have a travel blog , or work in the industry , does not mean you can not use this strategy .

You can just park anywhere in places like along the Great Ocean Road . And the cities are tough too with signage and meters . <p> If you stay at one of the free campgrounds , just make sure others are there as well , just to be on the safe side . <p> Great tips guys ! I have n't stayed at a YHA hostel I did n't  like yet in Australia . I 'm not a dorm person so the fact that most of them have great private rooms is why I stay there .

I also recently discovered ( and can now recommend ) Trivago ( i used them for an overseas hotel but believe they do Australian hotels also ) which helps narrow it down quickly as they show all the online hotel sites and their prices for the same hotel on the one page so you can see who has the cheapest and/or choose who you want to book through . Saved A LOT of time looking up each of the sites individually = <p> Combining the above with a mobile income source ( s ) is so incredible from making a small amount of money to breaking even or even a small loss over a short period of time , I have been able to see Canada largely stress free , and I hope to do the same in Australia soon ! <p> Weve loved house sitting and have saved probably around US$10,000 from doing it .

@@21820780 @1820780/ <h> 9 Beaches in Margaret River You Must Set Foot On <p> Margaret River is not all wine tasting and gourmet food you know . And its not even just about over indulging on cheese , chocolate and coffee either . <p> Sure , you must come to Margs and sip endless glasses of the internationally recognized wine they have 150 wine producers and to feast on all the amazing food on offer ( we 'll be writing about our fave wineries and food spots soon ) but there 's another great reason to visit this region in South West Australia , the beaches ! <p> After road tripping around Australia for the past 18 months , I can safely say this stretch of coastline that makes up the region has some of the most stunning beaches in the country , for quality and quantity . <p> They are some of the most beautiful beaches you will ever walk on and for the surfers , some of the best waves you 'll ever ride . <p> Although the water temperature is a little cooler down south , it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visually they truly are spectacular . <p> After spending a month in the area , it turns out Margaret River is many things , and when it does something , it does it better than most . Then throw in the amazing diversity of people from wine makers , farmers , artists , and of course the surfers the place has such an addictive vibe . <p> But today were talking beaches . <p> Whilst we did n't  get to play on all the beaches , because there 's just so much to do in the area and well definitely be back , below are my top 9 picks . <h> 1 . Hamelin Bay <p> Possibly the most picturesque beach for me was Hamelin with that fine white sand , crystal clear turquoise water , and those natural dunes . Its a great spot for swimming , snorkeling and apparently scuba diving . <p> What makes Hamelin Bay different is its the best place we 've seen stingrays in Australia . Theyre super friendly and will come right into shore and swim around your feet . Not sure if there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just head down towards the boat ramp and you 'll see the crowd gathered . <h> 2 . Yallingup Beach <p> We camped at Yallingup Caravan Park for three nights , which is right across the road from the beach . This beach has powerful surf and I enjoyed our morning ritual of grabbing a coffee from the mobile coffee man at Yallingup point car park and watching the surfers ride the waves . <p> Yallingup is a favourite spot for snorkelers as well with the sheltered swimming lagoon at the southern end of the beach , and as you walk down the steps from the car park in town there is a kid-friendly swimming area and then a nice stretch of beach heading north for a walk . <h> 3 . Smiths Beach <p> Next door to Yallingup , Smiths is an expansive flat beach with more of that pure-white sand and beautiful blue water . We enjoyed a few swims here and it seemed one of the more popular beaches in the region . <p> Besides the bathers , I noticed quite a few boogie boarders getting amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Prevelly Beach is close to Margaret River town and is famous around the surfing world as being home to the pro surfing event held every April at Surfers Point . You get stunning coastline views as you drive down into Prevelly town and then around to River Mouth . <p> But our family this beach was all about the kid friendly River Mouth with the shallow and calm water being a top spot for our kids to have a paddle on their boogie boards and a swim . It also looked like a top spot to do a bit of stand-up paddle boarding and kayaking. <h> 5 . Gnarabup Beach <p> Neighbouring Gnarabup was mostly occupied with families swimming , snorkeling and fishing . Its much calmer on the waves side of things due to the reefs out to sea providing a bit of shelter . <p> The highlight for me though was n't actually the beach , but the cafe overlooking the beach . Just thought I 'd throw this in that at the southern end there 's the White Elephant Beach Cafe overlooking the boat ramp and little jetty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good coffee and quality food ! <h> 6 . Meelup Bay <p> The family friendly Meelup Bay is another picturesque beach totally worth a visit . Our kids happily played in the sand here and enjoyed a swim in the calm waters whilst I kicked back on the grass and read a book . <p> There 's also kayaks for hire here which seemed a popular activity for those looking to get out more on the water in the ideal conditions . <h> 7 . Eagle Bay <p> I recommend having a morning swim or beach walk here , then hitting up the nearby Eagle Bay Brewery for lunch great pizzas , a kids playground and the beer was pretty good too ! <p> Eagle Bay in yet another expansive beach , and then the coastal drive from here to Meelup is short but one of the most picturesque in the country ! I 'm not sure if the little beach in between the two has a name , but the orange rocks and turquoise water create a stunning scene ! <h> 8 . Bunker Bay <p> I hesitated to put Bunker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense its up there with the best beaches in Margaret River most of the year , but at the time of our visit the flies were out of this world and I could only stand being around long enough to take this one quick photo . <p> Its the first time Ive ever seen people sitting on a beach before wearing fly head nets , they were that bad . You 've been warned . But the beach looked beautiful though ! <h> 9 . Injidup Beach <p> We did n't  swim at Indijup Beach and only visited once but visually I had to add it to my list and from the surfers riding the waves it appeared to be another handy surfing spot ( very uncrowded ) and a beautiful place for a swim . <p> Apparently there 's a pod of dolphins that call the bay home and are known to ride the waves , and at the southern end of the best a group of sand boarders were riding down the steep dune which looked like fun ! <h> Where we stayed in Margaret River <p> Looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this awesome house we stayed in twice and just cant get enough of ! <h> Plan Your Trip in Margaret River 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 69803 @qwx269803 <p> Flights 69807 @qwx269807 <p> Car Rental 69806 @qwx269806 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I just have to say you guys are taking some stunning photos .

Kensington is a great place to shop around and people watch . Another great place is down by Ryerson University . Salad king is the place to eat . Noisy and busy , the Thai food is amazing and dirt cheap . I highly recommend it .

It is consistently ranked at the top of healthiest city lists and it is the capital city of the least obese state in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the abundant sunshine and access to world class hiking , cycling , rafting , rock climbing , and skiing in their own backyard . <p> Denver <p> Denver is a city that seeks adventure , and the best way to experience Denver is to get outside run the trails , cycle the roads , or take a kayak down the rapids that run right through the middle of downtown . <h> What to Do in Denver <p> Denver has many of the same attractions and amenities of most major US cities with the added bonus of being at the foot of the largest mountain range in North America " reaping all the benefits that go along with that distinction . <p> There are a few ways to experience the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountains while staying close to the city . <p> Red Rocks Amphitheater A world famous concert venue located in the hills above Denver . Towering red rock formations create a natural amphitheater with amazing acoustics . Some enterprising individuals added seating and a stage to turn it into one the most unique concert venues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary performers including The Beatles , U2 , and Jimi Hendrix . Though a concert is the best way to experience the venue , it is open to the public for free when there are n't any concerts . <p> Mount Evans " Colorado is home to 53 14,000 foot ( 4260 meter ) mountains and is often referred to as the Roof of America ' . Though you can summit every one of Colorado 's 14ers ' via hiking and climbing , Mount Evans offers the unique distinction of offering a road to the top . <p> Visitors can hop in their car and summit one of the tallest mountains in North America with their automobile . Along the way there are numerous scenic overlooks and plenty of wildlife including the famous Mountain Goats who are always willing to pose for a picture . <p> Confluence Park " Located right downtown , confluence park offers a scene of nature in the middle of the city . Located at the confluence of the Cherry Creek and the South Platte River , Confluence Park offers a kayaking course , city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship REI store , a mecca for outdoor sports enthusiasts . <h> Best Neighborhoods to Explore in Denver <p> Capitol Hill " A vibrant and funky neighborhood southeast of downtown that is also one of Denvers most diverse . Around the gold-domed state capitol building , stately 19th century mansions mingle with mid-century apartment buildings and punk-rock clubs line the same streets as high-end restaurants . The neighborhood is flanked by two of Denvers best parks , the Greek Revival styled Civic Center Park and the spooky Cheesman Park which still contains many bodies buried underneath from its past life as a cemetery . <p> Lodo The oldest neighborhood in Denver , Lodo is where Denver started . Old brick warehouses have since been converted into eclectic restaurants , trendy nightspots , high-end loft apartments , and boutique retail shops . The 16th Street Mall is a pedestrian-only shopping district and general hub of activity connecting Lodo to the Central Business District and Capitol Hill neighborhoods . <p> Highland " The Highland neighborhood is adjacent to downtown but offers a more residential experience than some of its other neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multi-level town homes along the broad , leafy avenues that characterize the neighborhood . Quiet coffee shops , neighborhood bistros , and pubs each claim their share of regular local visitors . <h> Where to Eat in Denver <p> I 'll be the first to admit that Denver is not a food city ; food is simply not one of the citys strengths . But there are still plenty of unique Denver cuisines to try and restaurants to visit . <p> Mexican food and wild game are local specialties , with green chile being the quintessential Denver ingredient . Rocky Mountain oysters ( deep fried bull testicles ) are a regional delicacy , though we usually only order it for our out-of-town guests to watch them squirm . <p> Tocabe " An American Indian eatery where the- speciality- is fry bread tacos served with shredded bison . Topped with hominy and corn salsas , these tacos are unlike any others . <p> Cherry Cricket " A landmark dive bar/burger joint that stands as the lone blue-collar joint in the Tony Cherry Creek neighborhood . It is a favorite of locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chili cheeseburgers in town . <p> Biker Jim 's " A food **28;1047;TOOLONG restaurant , Biker Jim 's serves up the best sausages in town . Meats like pheasant , bison , reindeer , wild boar , and rattlesnake are seasoned and stuffed into sausage before being topped with cream cheese and onions caramelized in Coca-Cola . <p> Santiagos This ubiquitous Denver-based Mexican chain is a staple for city residents . The food is authentic , the prices are cheap , and the green chile is hot just the way Denver locals like it . <p> Buckhorn Exchange Denvers oldest restaurant proudly displays liquor license #0001 . The Buckhorn Exchange specializes in wild game including ostrich , yak , elk , quail , bison , and alligator . The walls are covered with old western memorabilia and stuffed animal heads from all over the world . <p> Casa Bonita The Disneyland of Mexican restaurants , Casa Bonita was already famous before it made a cameo on the popular television show South Park. While the food is nearly inedible , visitors come for the experience . A jungle atmosphere , caves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three story waterfall with cliff divers make Casa Bonita a delightfully kitschy experience . <h> Where to Drink in Denver <p> Denver is a beer city . It constantly ranks as one of the top beer cities in the nation and plays host to the Great American Beer Festival . <p> Even the former mayor ( and current Colorado governor ) is a former brew pub operator . Because of this , there are plenty of great places to drink beer in Denver . <p> Wynkoop Brewing " The first brewpub in Denver , founded by now-Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper . Wynkoop offers great beers and an incredible atmosphere in an old brick warehouse in the heart of the Lodo neighborhood . <p> Great Divide " One of the oldest and largest breweries in Denver and located right downtown . Tours and tap room tastings are offered every day of the week . <p> Falling Rock " The best beer bar in Denver ( and possibly in the US , according to some ) , Falling Rock offers a wall of taps and an extensive bottle list providing craft beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they crave . <p> Williams &amp; Graham Denvers newest speakeasy offers a prohibition-style secretive drinking establishment ( you enter through a faux-bookshelf door ) . Classy cocktails are served the old-fashioned way with hand chipped ice and panache from some of Denvers best bartenders . <h> Best Area for a Night on the Town in Denver <p> Lodo is a popular place for the young and the young at heart . Bars like The Sports Column , The Tavern , and Jackson 's pack their rooftop patios after Colorado Rockies baseball games while locals and visitors alike fill the upscale clubs and restaurants that line the fronts of Blake and Market streets . <p> While Lodo has the densest concentration of bars , restaurants , and clubs , every neighborhood has its own commercial strip giving visitors a great way to get a taste of local Denver life . <h> Where to Stay in Denver <p> The Brown Palace An elegant and historic hotel in the heart of downtown . It has played host to presidents , royalty , and pop icons . For those such as myself who ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit to the afternoon tea ceremony in the lobby is a suitable alternative . <p> The Curtis A much more affordable hotel that offers a unique and whimsical alternative to the high class of The Brown Palace . Each floor has a unique pop culture theme ( think one hit wonders , sci-fi , etc. ) that is carried through to all of the rooms . <p> For more places to stay in Denver choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com . You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Shopping in Denver <p> Larimer Square is a unique Victorian era street that offers boutique shopping and dining in Lodo . Just a few blocks away sits Rockmount Ranchwear , providing a one-of-a-kind shopping experience . Rockmount introduced the first Western style snap button shirts and is still the premier supplier of the iconic clothing to clients in Hollywood and all around the world . <p> Just down the street from Rockmount Ranchwear is The Tattered Cover Bookstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the largest of its kind . Its an incredibly atmospheric store with ancient hardwood floors , exposed bricks , and plenty of comfy chairs and hidden corners to settle into with a good book . <h> Events &amp; Festivals <p> As I mentioned before , Denver is a beer town . Part of this reputation comes from the host role the city plays to the Great American Beer Festival each year . The festival is the brewing industry 's top competition and public tasting session and there is no other place in the world where you can find more beers on tap . <p> Every October , More than 450 breweries come together to pour more than 2200 different beers to thirsty festival goers . Visitors can find EVERY type of beer at the festival and many types they never even knew existed . <h> Getting Around Denver <p> Denver has a comprehensive bus system and an expanding light rail and commuter rail network , but the most fun form of public transportation are Denver 's community bicycles . <p> Denver was the first city in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large-scale form of public transportation , and bicycle sharing stations have been popping up all over the city since . <p> For just a few dollars , guests can pick up a bicycle at one of the check-out stations and ride it all over town before checking it back in to another station . <h> Best Time of Year to Visit Denver <p> Late summer in Denver is spectacular . <p> In early September , the city is still in full on summer-mode with residents flocking to the outdoor cafes , rooftop patios and the parks in the largest public park system in the United States . <p> But within a short drive , the mountains are beginning to show the signs of autumn . This is the time when the aspen leaves flash their vibrant gold hues , lighting up the slopes of the Rocky Mountains . Visiting in late summer provides visitors with the best of summer and autumn in Colorado . <h> Favorite Side Trip from Denver <p> Rocky Mountain National Park is the most accessible national park from Denver and it couldnt be more different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain views , unique wildlife encounters , and amazing hiking opportunities amongst the alpine wilderness . <p> Icy glaciers , glassy lakes , and the iconic Longs Peak all compete for attention along the continental divide in one of the crown jewels of Americas National Park system . <h> Getting There &amp; Away <p> Denver is incredibly isolated " the closest big cities are Phoenix and Dallas which are both more than 14 hours away by car . <p> Thankfully , Denver has one of the largest and busiest airports in the United States . Three major airlines use Denver International Airport as a hub " United , Frontier , and Southwest . This competition helps keep the prices in and out of Denver relatively cheap . <h> Best insiders tip for Denver <p> Denver has an excellent music scene . While it might not be as famous as Austin , Nashville , or New Orleans , there is a growing folk/Americana movement with groups like Paper Bird and singer/songwriters such as Danielle Ate The Sandwich and Patrick Dethlefs . <p> Additionally , the indie scene is healthy with bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also recently been a launch pad for larger , mainstream acts as well . Groups such as The Fray , One Republic , The Lumineers , and The Flobots have all found international fame after recognizing popularity locally in Denver . <p> Alternatively , visitors can turn their radio dial to 1340 am for Open Air Colorado , a Colorado Public Radio station that plays local , independent music . <h> I Love Denver because <p> The city seeks adventure . <p> Work comes second to play as residents take powder days off from work to hit the slopes on exceptionally good snow days , pack their backpacks for extended camping trips , or strive to summit every one of Colorados 53 14,000 foot ( 4260 meter ) mountains . <p> Denver offers the best of both worlds with all the amenities of the big city and the Rocky Mountains as its backyard . <h> Plan Your Trip in Denver 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation in Denver <p> Booking.com has over 800,000 hotels , apartments and hostels worldwide .

Check out the following : Root Down , Uncle , Steubens , Bittersweet , CafeBar , Vesper Lounge , and the list goes on . <p> Denver seems like a great place to visit .

How to get around East and South Africa comes at a price and in order to experience them you need to make cut backs in other less important areas of your travel budget. - Check out our article on Budget travel in Africa tips . <p> One of the most popular backpacking trails is through East and South Africa . Getting around East and South Africa is rough travel , but its cheap and it will provide you with some of your most entertaining stories . <p> There are many transportation options to suit each travellers budget , desired experiences and comfort levels . <h> Overland Africa Safari Tours <p> For those travellers who feels a little intimidated about backpacking Africa independently , or a short on time and want to be spared the hassle , there are organized overland safari tours . Craig , and I decided not to travel Africa in this way , although we ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite an insight into how they operated . We were able to travel more slowly through each area , and had a lot more contact with the local people . <p> Overland safari tours will be more expensive than independent travel , - but costs usually cover meals , transport , and accommodation Companies to check out include Kumuka , Acacia , and for what seemed like a more mature and less party type experience try Dragoman. 7 day all inclusive tours start at around USD$750 ranging up to $6,000 for a 63 day Kenya to Cape Town ' tour . Travelling Africa independently for 5 months cost us $7,000 total . <p> The overlanders <h> Baz Bus <p> The Baz Bus is a hop on , hop off style transportation company organized to help backpackers and travellers get around South Africa in comfort . It has designated travel route that follows the backpacking trail , taking you to the most popular destinations . You can choose the route you want , and the bust will pick you up and drop you off at your selected hostel . Tickets can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more open-ended fleixible tickets are available . Prices for the Baz Bus range from USD $175 to $500 . <p> After 4 months of traveling around Africa using public transport , I welcomed the Baz Bus luxury ' experience with open arms , using it for the last two weeks in South Africa to travel from Durban to Johannesburg via Zululand , Swaziland and Kruger Park . Getting picked up and dropped off at my hostel door , spreading myself out on my own spacious seat while I watched videos and swapped stories with other travelers , was pure bliss and so worth the extra expense . <p> The Baz bus experience <h> Public Buses <p> There was n't a bus journey we went on in Africa that did not involve a laughter and conversation with the locals , having a child thrown on your lap , a neighbouring rooster dangerously pecking around your head , a protective mother figure curing your motion sickness with matchsticks , or dramas such as punctured tires , highway roadside ablutions and bus drivers leaving behind those who did not get back from the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experience it . <p> Public buses ( USD$3-$32 ) are usually taken for longer journeys and across borders where there is a good network of sealed roads . These buses are generally comfortable , safe and spacious . Places that have fewer or no sealed roads will have ancient buses that frequently break down , and are crowded . A step up from the local public buses is the Intercape , the largest privately owned intercity bus service in Southern Africa . Think modern coach service with reclining seats and restrooms . We experienced the comfort of this from Cape Town to Durbanahhh ! <p> Craig on the Intercape from Cape Town to Durban <h> Mini Vans <p> I thought Asians knew how to fill a mini-van , but they are quite spacious in comparison to mini vans in Africa . Africa is the place that sets the outer limits as to how many people can be transported at once in a vehicle. - Just when you think they could n't possibly fit another person in , they have them stand on the window sill outside the van . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mini-van , and spent the majority of the journey eyes closed to avoid seeing the drivers careen around mountainous corners at speeds of over 80km/h , overtaking anything from bikes to livestock trucks . Travel in Africa , like this , is not for the faint hearted . Africa is poor ; the drivers want to overfill the beat-up , rusty van and go as fast as they can in order to make more money . <p> Mini-vans are a very cheap way to get around , and are usually taken for up to 6 hour journeys within a country ( usually around USD$0.20-$8 ) . They do n't leave until they are full , so jump on one that looks ready to go and avoid sitting in the front seat , commonly referred to as the death seat . ' <p> Of course there is more room ! <h> Pick Ups <p> Pickups are cheap ( usually not much more than USD$2 ) and tend to go a lot slower , traveling more on the smaller rural or village roads . I appreciated pickup travel a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the pickup tray with bags of rice and potatoes , bicycles , and generally the whole village , I still felt a lot safer . Traveling in this way is extremely uncomfortable , but the communal aspect of it makes up for this . <p> A local African took me under his wing , as his muzungu ( white person ) , on an 8 hour , 97km pickup trip to see the gorillas in Uganda . No one was to touch me or make me uncomfortable ; he even threatened to beat two handcuffed prisoners for accidentally sitting on my shoulder . We sat under a blue tarp as rain pelted down on our drive through treacherous mountain passes . Benson rescued me several times from sliding off the side of the truck to certain death below . You can always count on African pickups to give you memories like this . <h> Hitchhiking <p> Hitchhiking is something that would turn most peoples blood to ice , especially with the thought of doing it in Africa . It can be a relatively safe and cheap way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hitchhike through Namibia and South Africa than any other East African country . Hitchhiking can be free , although many times you will be expected to leave a small tip , you have to be able to judge each situation . It is always a good idea to ask how much up front . <p> Accommodations and internet message boards often have notices for those seeking rides , in return for the sharing of fuel costs . If you hitch from the side of the road it 's best to wave your hand up and down to flag a lift , as sticking out your thumb is considered a rude gesture in Africa . <p> Craig and I hitchhiked from Namibia to South Africa , only because other transport options were limited . A Namibian trucker , for a small tip , drove us halfway , sharing stories with Craig about Namibian life while I slept comfortably in his bed . Chinese students drove us the remainder of the way to Cape Town , for the sharing of fuel prices and stories of life in South Africa as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a common form of transportation in East and South Africa , there will be times when the opportunity for train travel should be taken as it is a pleasantly relaxing , cultural experience . Passing through a Game Reserve and seeing giraffe , wildebeest and zebra from my sleeper class cabin window was a surreal experience . It was a treat to pick up passengers from small African towns and have goods hawked at our windows while children raced up to smile broadly and wave at the passing Muzungus . <p> Usually with travel in Africa you are squashed in like sardines , but if you pay for the higher class ticket ( USD$20-$30 ) you will have your own sleeping cabin , giving you the space and freedom to walk around and appreciate African travel . <p> Lunch time <h> Car Hire <p> If you are not doing a guided safari in the Game Reserves , then leave room in your budget for car hire . There is no other way to view the wildlife of Africa , and let 's face it this is one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear on where the best viewing areas are for your chosen game parks and plan accordingly so you can cut down on mileage and fuel expenses . Car hire can be expensive , but can work out to be a more cost effective way to go on safari and tour certain regions of Africa . We hired cars for safaris in Namibia and South Africa and to experience the beautiful Garden Route , a popular and scenic stretch off the coast of South Africa . <p> Car hire in South Africa can be found for as cheap as $30 a day especially if you book online . In other parts of Africa it ranges from $75- $100 a day . Be careful of where you have to pick up your vehicle from . If it is too far from the safari park you will have to allow for extra mileage and fuel expenses . If you are planning on long term travel in Africa you may even consider buying your own 4WD to tour the continent in . South Africa would be the best option for purchase , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick with a gear shift ? <p> Getting around East and South Africa can be done really cheaply if planned well . Carefully consider your budget and safety interests for getting around Africa. - While public transport is cheap and authentic , it is uncomfortable and less safe . Hiring or buying a car is the more expensive option , but will give you greater freedom . Overland Safari tours will be expensive and less authentic but will give you an all inclusive package and a greater sense of safety . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> WOW this is a phenomenal guide !

Just trying to figure out what 's possible <p> WE caught the train from Dar Es Saalam in Tanzania to close to the Malawi border . WE did n't  visit Ngorongoro or Serengeti . We went to the Masai Mara instead . I 'm not too sure about hire car in this area . We did n't  hire cars until we got to Namibia and South Africa .

So start listing down all the things you want to see and where you want to go , then you can start researching to find out how you can get there , how much it will cost , where you will stayetc .. all the logistics . You should find a lot of info on our site under the planning tab . You could also consider working in another country . that is how we have gotten ourselves around the world .

Once I stepped on the plane , I have never looked back and my life has been so enriched by travel . <p> Let me know if you have any other questions and what you decide to do . <p> Breath taking ! Breath taking ! Great tips , most are the times when we find ourselves caught up in crazy situations just because we did n't  have someone to give us tips on how to handle stuff .

She was gallivanting around while Dad was keeping the house spotlessly clean and working out how to turn on the oven .

This can make things difficult if you are bouncing from time zone to time zone in a short period of time . <h> When is jet lag worse ? <p> I find the jet lag hits me worse travelling East .

As soon as you can after arrival , kick off your shoes and put your bare feet on the ground ( grass , dirt or sand ) for at least 30 minutes . <p> No I am not crazy . Why would I be ? <p> The earth provides everything with life and works perfectly , why would it not help to cure our imbalances , especially jet lag ? <p> As travellers , I am sure you are well aware of how great it feels when you connect to the earth . I know as a traveller I spend days if not weeks in constant earthly contact . <p> Remember when we were kids how barefoot was the norm ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They always relied on the earth to heal them . <h> A very simple explanation of how it works <p> The earth holds tons of negative electrons and when we connect with our bare skin ( most notably the feet ) they buzz on up inside of us and overpower all the positive electrons ( the bad stuff ) that is wreaking havoc on our body causing inflammation , imbalance and general all round wackiness . <p> And jet lag is an all round wackiness . <p> Think of the Earth as the worlds biggest anti-inflammatory . And inflammation is responsible for a vast majority of the worlds illnesses . <p> As a flier , you spend a lot of time off the ground and in the further reaches of the Earths atmosphere .

Have enough sleep before you leave <p> Sleep deficit will make jet lag worse . <h> 2 . Drink warm water <p> The lovely JJ from 84th and 3rd shared this with me recently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is an Ayurvedic technique . You know that ancient Indian philosophy that created meditation and yoga . I feel as if they know their shit ( They also did the whole bare foot thing ) . <h> 3 . Nap during the flight <p> Take short little naps on the flight when you feel sleepy . It will help build those reserves . If you can sleep for longer make it so that you sleep during the sleep time of your arrival time zone . <p> For early morning arrivals , ensure you get some sleep on the plane to help you to stay awake until night time . If you are arriving at night , avoid sleeping much during the flight . <p> Hot Tip : As soon as you board your plane set your phone to the new time zone and play to that . <h> 4 . Eat small meals frequently <p> Make sure you are filling your body with lots of healthy food : fruit and vegetables . Avoid sugar as much as you can . <h> 5 . Get up and walk <p> Walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so many reasons . <h> 6 . Avoid alcohol and caffeine <p> Its not the sleep imbibing drug we all think it is . Alcohol will keep you awake and when you combine it with the jet lag haze it can get nasty . Caffeine just messes with your internal clock on a normal day . Avoid alcohol and caffeine the day of your arrival too . <p> Note to all women wishing to have children one day : The first 12 weeks of pregnancy feels like you are hungover and suffering from jet lag at the same time . #BestWayToDescribeIt #JustSayin #Hideous <h> 7 . Expose yourself to daylight <p> When you arrive at your destination get out in the sun ( may struggle if in England ) . The sunlight will wake you up into the new time zone . <h> 8 . Do not sleep at the wrong time <p> No matter how tired you are when you arrive in your new time zone , you got ta put those match sticks in and stay awake . Wait until it is bed time . Its okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , but it is best you wait till then . Help your body get used to the new time zone ASAP. <h> 9 . Travel in a westerly route <p> We learned above why this can help you . If you are flying westward , try to go to sleep as late as possible for two to three days before you leave <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> My worst jet lag memory was thinking I was going ok , then smelling brussels sprouts boiling on a stove top . I have never wanted to be sick so badly ! I think I 'll try earthing next time otherwise I just eat &amp; drink well and try to adjust my body clock to the destination ASAP to combat jet lag . <p> Right now I 'm awaiting a flight in Saigon heading to LAX . I have been stressing for the last few days on how to beat jet lag going west . The last time I did this I was horrible to my parents for a week ! This vacation home is so anticipated I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may just flip off my shoes right outside LAX and just " earth " . = Thanks for the perfectly timed tips ! <p> Good tips ! Funny , someone had just mentioned the concept of earthing to me a couple weeks ago interesting to think of in the context of travel ! I think 8 is most important and I always find I adjust better when I fly into places at night ( then you can sleep it off , and are mostly in sync the next day ! ) <p> My jet lag cure it to stay awake through the entire flight ( well as much as I can ) and upon arriving at my destination until its actually time to go to bed . That way I 'll be too exhausted to not sleep and usually with one good nights sleep on the normal time , I 'm back to normal . That said , it does n't  always quite work that way . I do n't  know if traveling East or West makes a difference , but the trip back to my home country USA , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I just force myself to be normal on the trip out , but when I get back I 'm not as excited . A recent trip from BKK to NYC was the worst ever for me . It was at least a week until I was normal and I was all over the place , like your mom . I think jet lag just needs to run its course . But your tips will definitely help keep you healthy until you 're over it ! <p> I live on east coast of Florida . Great beaches . Lots of places to walk barefoot . Havent tried " earthing " to alleviate jet lag . Hey , its worth a try ! <p> I remember reading an article years ago about a Japanese CEO ( Mr. Sanyo , I think ) who would only drink bottled water when flying overseas-never ate a meal until he reached his destination , and never suffered jet lag . <p> Hi Caz ! Great post you have there ! = This would help a lot of travelers especially those that are newbies ( I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before but It was a good thing that there 's no time difference with my country to that place so I have n't really experienced jetlag but I often hear it with travelers. = I am planning to visit Mexico next year and that would be I think a difference of 16 hours . So I am glad to have found this post as I will surely follow your tips ! = <p> Great tips ! I usually do a few of them already , but some I have n't heard of , so look forward to trying next time I fly long-haul . Definitely want to try earthing ! <p> A little off-topic .. one things been bugging me . You say you are both vegetarian , but Craig had a fish burger . Ive been veg for quite a few years now and know for certain that someone who eats fish is not a vegetarian . Pescatarian would be the best term , but definitely not veg . <p> Ohh , how I 've hated those flights back to Europe from the US .. It really fucks up your system ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that I find it very hard to believe ! To me it really sounds like a joke . But then again , its free and I 've promised myself to test it when we fly to South America this fall ! So ! I will test it . You should never just write off something without trying it even if it seems a little silly = <p> I absolutely agree Celia ! Why not try it and see ? It could be the greatest thing you have ever discovered . I do know that just from earthing every day I am feeling really good . So I reckon this could be the winning jet lag cure . <p> Thanks for telling us your tips on how to get over Jet Lag . I have not heard about " earthing " but will surely do it since I struggle alot when it comes to adjusting new time zones . It makes me feel tired and sleepy , just like the first time I went to Philippines to check something . It took almost 1 week before I adjusted to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my notes . Thanks for this again . <p> Definitely ! This is one helpful blog . Thank you so much for sharing this . I will surely try this and will let you know if this works for me . I agree with you , jet lag is a total killer ( I hate that everytime I travel ) . <p> Your blogs are amazing , and I love reading those as it will inspire and give tips to the reader . Keep up the good work . <p> Late to the comments party here , but I 'm interested in ways to get over jet lag , and I do love your idea of earthing , and will definitely try that . I think having a small snack and something milky along with a couple of Schuesslers ( Mag/Phos ) tissue salts just before I go to bed helps me with the sleeping at night . West to East and daytime though , I 'm generally a wreck by about 2pm and only wake up again at about 5pm ! <p> Ive been taking those tissue salts since you recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might also like to try fossil shell powder . I do n't  think it helps with jet lag , but its really good for your body and cell growth . I hope you have recovered from your jet lag and you 've been able to test out the earthing . <p> The earthing tip would have helped me while I was away recently . I would kick off my sandals at any opportunity to feel the soft feel of grass underfoot and my fellow travel companions would just look at me . I think it comes from feet being enclosed in joggers all day . <p> Great list and extremely helpful ! Another tip we often is use is to start shifting sleep patters the day before leaving to make the transition less jarring . For instance if I 'm taking a red-eye the day before I 'll get up extra early so that leaving at 9:00pm feels like the middle of the night and I can sleep . <p> About to take a flight from **28;1111;TOOLONG . Am racking my brain for ways to walk around barefoot in Madrid when I land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible this trip , but next time I fly to Arizona to visit my parents I am absolutely going to try this earthing technique upon landing .

I love it I LOVE earthing and I do n't  know why I do n't  do this more often on arrival ! So I will from now onbut my fave ( and my husbands fave ) is to get to your destination and get outside and straight away get SUN on your forehead to help reset your circadian rhythmplus drink lots ( water , not wine ) and just hold out till the end of the day till you can sleep at the destinations time .

It is our passion and the thing that drives us to live life on purpose . But we are also aware that not everyone desires to live a life of travel . Everyone has different hopes and dreams . It does n't  mean that because your dreams do n't  involve travel they are any less than mine or not worthy of talking about . <p> Any life can be beautiful and any life can involve travel . And I do n't  mean travel as in hopping on a bus , train , or plain to arrive at a new or exotic destination . I mean travel as a journey into the unknown . That unknown can be in your own backyard , or within the depths of your own soul . Travel means to journey , and you can journey anywhere you choose . Here are some very simple tips on how to travel without travelling . <h> Try something new <p> I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a night out because she was starting her first knitting group .

This is why I always advocate to never hide the great things about you away . I believe you should really let your light shine , as it is doing so that you unconsciously allow others to do the same . When you start to live through others you begin to see what is possible for you . <p> Right now I am drinking a glass of wine , and listening to some music that is setting my soul on fire .

I feel as if the teachings of " Stranger Danger " have made us all too paranoid and fearful to extend a smile or a few kind words of friendship . When you are travelling you are always meeting new people , and you soon discover that talking to strangers is pretty easy and a lot of fun .

We have been catching the train down to Sydney each week and spending time exploring the nearby lively Terrigal Beach . <h> Live your purpose <p> What did you come here for ? It is imperative that you ask this question ? Ask it every day until you find the answer . I believe that if you are not living your purpose then you are off track and your life will reflect that Shit will happen . Major shit. - Shit that is there in order to wake you up . <p> This is not a dress rehearsal . You came here for a reason . You came here with something to do . You are so special that you arrived here with a job to do that no one else is capable of doing . What is it ? - Ask ask ask . And say yes yes yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you will be traveling each day . <h> Laugh , Laugh , Laugh <p> The statistics and reasearch is there to prove the benefits that laughter brings into your life . Laughter is a journey into joy . It is pure uninhibited travel . Laugh every day . Are you struggling for things to laugh at ? - Go look at your self in the mirror and pull funny faces . You are so ridiculous is n't it funny . Sit with someone you feel comfortable- with and take it in turns to give your loudest most ridiculous laugh . Pretty soon you will find yourself laughing uncontrollably- for real . <h> Spend time with Children <p> This is probably something I never would have spoken about before I became a mother to Kalyra- my wild and pleasant place . Children transport you . They take you to a place you had long forgotten about . Life to them is new , its interesting , its joyous , its simple , its loving , its laughter , its pure . And this is travel . My daughter has me crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me trying to touch the sky with my toes on a swing . We dance with reckless abandon , we live as princesses and princes in the world of our creating , and we scream out our frustration and in a minute they are gone . When we look at life through the eyes of a child , it becomes so simple , so easy , so loveable . Children are more connected then we are and they speak wisdom through their eyes and their words : <p> " Be nice give me chocolate .

May you always knit the best jumpers . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> great post , guys ! very inspiring and , whether we travel or not , we should all be trying to live this way everyday . oh , and by the way , i believe knitting is all the rage in the US over the past year or so . it has become totally hip ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a pub , knitting . i couldnt believe my eyes ! <p> Loved this post . Its always one of the hardest things to do when you get back home from a long stint of traveling as well . We always try to incorporate a number of things that we would do on the road . Like taking a different route to work or like you said , speaking to complete strangers . Great inspiring post guys ! <p> Thanks Anthony ! You really have to force yourself to do these things when you get home from travelling . It helps you to get over the doldrums and feel like you are living again . I played touch football for the first time last night and I really loved it . I felt that travel buzz return . <p> Very inspiring post , Love it ! True , Traveling is not just the act of displacing yourself from one place to another ; it can also be the physical and mental exploration of what intrigues you and of your surroundings . <p> I 've found that randomly talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm shy by nature , so sometimes its hard for me to start a conversation with a random person , even when I would love to . But , on the other hand , I project myself very approachable , so people tend to talk to me first . I guess I should push myself more to talk to someone new every now and then . Lots of interesting conversations and opportunities have come from this . <p> Thanks Norbert . I used to be really shy as well , so did Craig actually . I think the more you throw yourself out of your comfort zone the further that stretches and the easier it is to approach people . I think projecting yourself as approachable is so important . <p> Love when serendipity happens , just started my blog kind of about the same thing , finding ways to still be a traveller when I 'm not actually traveling in the traditional sense . One way is to read great travel blogs like yours . Thanks for the reminders . <p> Everyone has different hopes and dreams . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are any less than mine or not worthy of talking about . <p> SO nice to read that on a travel blog ! I feel like a lot of times the travel community looks down on people who do n't  want to travel full time . I have a job that enables me to travel ( wedding photographer , we do weddings all over ) and I actually LOVE having a home base to come back to . I would n't want it any other way ! But sometimes I feel like I am less of an authentic traveler because I do that . <p> Travel means different things to different people . I do n't  think there is one set definition for it . I certainly understand what you say about the travel community looking down on those who do n't  want to travel full-time . It really is not something that is for everyone . Different strokes for different folks as my good Irish friend used to say ! Thanks for commenting Kyle . <p> Great ideas . Not everyone can travel , even if they can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way . I 've got a really inspiring reader of my blog who has severe arthritis and can only just walk , but loves travelling with me through my writings . So we bloggers are doing it for them , and with them . <p> This is such a beautiful post . Its something I think avid travellers really get , though we often need a reminder to remember to travel at home. For me , laughter is a very important one . When you 're stuck in one place dealing with the daily grind , it helps to keep a good sense of humour . Every single one of these points resonated with me fantastic advice ! <p> FANTASTIC post guys ! My friends who are working and/or married with children always tell me that they 're jealous of all the traveling I do and I 'm constantly telling them that they can still have adventures in their daily lives that do n't  involve traveling ! Thanks so much for reinforcing that ! I 'm going to have them all read this post ! <p> I love these kind of posts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially discovering your own backyard . People always forget the restaurants , sights , and nearby cities that they can explore . Whenever I move someplace new , I ALWAYS end up doing more things than people who have lived there for years . Its really sad ! <p> I loved this post ! You 're very right about inspiring others.Gary Arndt uses the word " travel porn " when discussing his travel photography because people love to view his photos and in a sense live vicariously since they probably wont ever get to do the kind of traveling he is doing . I recently read a quote that traveling begins when you step out your door , so I like your suggestion of exploring your own backyard ! <p> Thanks Emily = I 'm so glad you appreciated the post . Photos can be such a powerful source of inspiration . Its funny how we 've noticed some talk going on lately around the web that some people think bloggers who post photo essays are taking a cop out- which I think is ridiculous . Most of the time its pictures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Love this post ! I live in Manhattan and treat my MetroCard as my passport jumping on the subway and heading to a different neighborhood is just like jumping on a plane and heading to a foreign country there is so much to discover . You do n't  have to cross an ocean to travel just cross your street and observe your surroundings as if you were in a foreign country for the first time ! Happy travels ! <p> Absolutely Shannon . We are off to discover a new area not far from us today as well . You can easily keep the travelling spirit no matter where you are . We published a post yesterday with photos along our local coastal walk . It was just as good as any walk I take overseas <p> Awesome post ! When not traveling , we try to live by this philosophy with our two year old . Even something as simple as trying a new playground or setting up a tent in our living room can bring adventure every day . <h> Trackbacks <p> When you start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its not that they do n't  want travel to be a part of their life , they- just cant envision how to make it a reality . Its costly , involves planning and the apparent hassle of the journey combined with disrupted routines can be too much to bear . But , making travel a part of your life is easier than you think . Travel can come with a day trip in your local area exploring something new , taking a short weekend break , or even lying in a hammock in your backyard with a glass of wine and the travel section of the newspaper .

Here is what Sheila Scarborough recommends for a first-timer 's trip . <p> Tokyo is an exceptionally vast city , with a culture that is embedded with etiquette and rich in history and experiences .

But however you manage to get around , there 's much to love about the exciting metropolis . Here 's Forbes guide to spending two days in Tokyo in style . <h> Saving Money on travel in Tokyo <p> Eating out in Tokyo is affordable if you follow a few basic budget tips and if you know where to look for your next meal .

Follow them , and you may well have funds left over for a few splurges . <h> Brilliant articles on Tokyo travel by Beth Williams <p> Beth , from Besudesu Abroad , has written several comprehensive posts .

Whether you want to eat amidst giant Gundams , cats , or cutely dressed maids , Tokyo seems to have something for everyone <p> Beth also has an series of articles about Tokyo Disney that are incredibly informative and useful for those who are struggling to decide what to do and where to stay : <h> Visiting Japan with kids <p> Nicole Avery- took her five kids on a holiday to Japan , staying three nights in Tokyo and three nights in Osaka .

I will probably be returning to Tokyo within the next year or two as a close friend plans on getting married there , so have been keeping an eye out for interesting tokyo articles and travel tips . <p> As for a Tokyo travel tip of my own , I recommend going on a day trip somewhere from the centre of Tokyo . Its so easy to do with the efficient train system that goes everywhere . I especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples to explore and the Daibatsu ( giant buddha statue ) . <p> Kamakura is great indeed . The Daibutsu ( not Daibatsu ) is famous and is one of the biggest buddha statues that is placed outside in Japan . Another one can be found on Nokogiriyama , a mountain in Chiba . That 's also a nice day trip from Tokyo . = <p> I am sure that there is no lack of things to do in Tokyo this looks like a great guide . I 've never been to Tokyo but its definitely on my " must see " list . Along with almost every other place in the world . I 've got some work to do , haha ! <p> Ive been to Tokyo a few times as I live in Japan . Its not my favorite place , but certainly something tourists should experience . I recommend trying to get a good mix of everything Tokyo has to offer from the electronic and anime home in Akihabara , to the crazy shopping districts of Harajuku and Shibuya , the beautiful nature and things to do for families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples e.g. in Asakusa . <p> There are several things you can explore as a day trip from Tokyo , e.g. Kamakura , Hakone , Nikko or even Mt . Fuji . = <p> In summer many people leave from Shinjuku in Tokyo to climb Mt . Fuji all the more since it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site last year . <p> Great collection guys ! I am planning a trip to Tokyo in October , so all these awesome links are bookmarked ! Ca n't wait to read them all and pick the coolest things to do . Just have to wait for a decent priced ticket . <p> Great round up of Tokyo resources ! I absolutely loved Tokyo . One great tip I have to add is to hit the Tsukiji Fish Market try to catch the 5 a.m. live tuna auction . <p> The only problem is that unless you 're lucky enough to be staying right in downtown Tokyo ( which is crazy expensive ) getting to the market for the early morning auction is tricky trains do n't  start up again for hours and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US . <p> So the best thing to do is dump off your bags at your hotel on arrival , then hit downtown Tokyo while the trains are still running and stay out all night ( you 'll be jet lagged anyway so you wo n't know the difference ) . After the auction , join the crowds for a 6 a.m. sushi breakfast at the market it will be the best sushi youve ever had ( I recommend the tuna belly ) . I did n't  think we could pull it off but it turned out to be a memorable night and actually a pretty common thing to do ( everyone else we met at the market had done the same thing ) . <p> Awesome post , Craig and thanks for the inclusion . But I wish you put this guide together before I left . ha ha . Lots of wonderful links in here- you 've easily distracted the start of my morning with reading about Tokyo . <p> Thanks for featuring my post on where do locals shop in Tokyo ! Also check out my other Tokyo travel posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping tips ! Ill be add more Tokyo related posts real soon ! LONG ... <p> Going to Tokyo was amazing , it was the time when I really felt so far from home , but in a good way . Totally new culture and I just fell in love with Asia ! It made me realise how small the world can be and how achievable those dreams of travel can be ! Not to mention the craziness that is Tokyo itself ! = <p> Its a bizarre World , like not even from this planet Staggering shocking high prices , though . I was on budget and I could barely move , it was so expensive . I think many things have changed since I was there in 1999 . But Tokyo had me lost in there from Shibuya to Akihabara I explored as much as I could . <p> Tokyo is indeed a huge city . There are so many things to do in Tokyo that it is impossible to do it in only one or two weeks . Seeing the picture of the capsule hotel reminds me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know are pretty afraid to sleep in a 1x1x2m box . But it was actually totally fine . I actually really enjoyed the night in a capsule hotel . Anything needed was there . Capsule was big enough to be comfortable . <p> Thank you for the really nice post that reminded me my first time in Tokyo . <p> Even though I have been to Japan before there are some useful tips in here . I did n't  know about the voluntary tour guides . But that is an awesome thing = When I was in South Korea I encountered some voluntary tour guides and exploring some of Soeuls sites with them was a lot of fun and interesting . I should try it again in Japan = Btw , for people who are interested in reading about my journey in Japan , feel free to visit my blog ! http : **37;1141;TOOLONG If you have any questions about traveling in Japan , you can always contact me = <p> Hi Craig ! Thank you for sharing these great Tokyo travel tips . I have to agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local fast food chains like Matsuya beef bowls are cheap ( starting at USD4 ) , of very decent quality and are very filling . <p> I love the massive public parks in Tokyo especially during the cherry blossom season Ueno , Shinjuku Gyoen , Yoyogi and the East Gardens of Imperial Palace . These are great places to experience hanami picnics . = <p> That 's super interesting ! Ive been in Japan for the first time last year and I can not wait for my next trip . I actually just post an guide for 48h in Tokyo . Here it is : LONG ... Its a wonderful country ! ! <p> During my first year student I slept in a guesthouse in Asakusa , which for me is the best area to stay in Tokyo because many tourist attractions are nearby . And I also experienced hotels capsules : awesome ! 
@@21820796 @1820796/ <h> 10 Reasons to Fall in Love with Transylvania <p> Its wonderful and challenging to talk about the place you first knew in this world and the one that 's closest to your heart . And , above all , to stay objective , too . But , when it comes to Transylvania a dose of subjectivity is recommended to everyone . <p> I can not remember exactly the moment I realized what an awesome place I was born in . <p> But I know that it took me a long enough time to become aware of how beautiful Transylvania is and of how many incredible experiences it can give a traveller . <p> As usually happens : you want to go farther and farther , as far as possible from the places you think you know too well . But , there comes a day when you arrive home and discover the many beauties that have waited patiently to be explored . <p> This is what has happened between me and Transylvania . <p> I had long been convinced that Translyvania could no longer show me anything to excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had lived all its possible adventures . <p> I was wrong . So wrong . <p> It 's only now that I understand that I 'll never be able to fully know Transylvania , to see every piece of it , to find all its mysteries . <p> For every traveller prepared to venture here , this land in Central Romania has something magical , spectacular , and original . <p> Here are 10 reasons that inspire me to wander over Transylvania more and more . <p> Are you ready ? <h> 1 . Beautiful Nature <p> Apuseni <p> If nature and hiking are part of your life , come to Apuseni . These mountains are located in the western part of Transylvania and belong to the Carpathians . A large area is included in Apuseni Natural Park . <p> In Apuseni , too , there is the region also known as +ara de Piatr- or +ara Mo+ilor . <p> It is one of the most charming areas , with houses scattered along valleys and ridges , with idyllic landscapes and villages barely touched by modernity . <p> Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2 . Villages with Fortified Churches <p> Fortified Church Biertan <p> In Transylvania , there are over 150 ( once 300 ) fortified churches . These picturesque Saxon villages can be viewed via different tours and will amaze you with their architecture and beauty . <p> Many of these simple fortresses around the churches , founded by Transylvanian Saxons for defense , could never be conquered by their attackers . <p> But they conquer me every time with their charm . <p> The Saxons ( sa+i ) , a German-speaking population , arrived in southeastern Transylvania between the 12th and 13th centuries , invited by the kings of Hungary and they built numerous villages . <p> Some of the most beautiful fortified churches are those of Biertan , Prejmer , Viscri , C+lnic , D+rjiu , Saschiz , Valea Viilor , included on the World Heritage List . <h> 3 . Lovely Cities <p> Sibiu <p> Every city in Transylvania , large or small , has its charm and sprinkle of poetry . <p> Sibiu , the only city in Romania which has so far held the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its old romantic places , and with the multitude of performances taking place each season . <p> T+rgu Mures is worth visiting for its elegant palaces ( the Palace of Culture is beautiful on the outside and full of splendor inside ) and cultural diversity . <p> With one of the few medieval cities in the world that is inhabited today , Sighisoara has to be put on the must see list- More than once have I forgotten about myself wandering through the paved streets . <p> Sighisoara Town <p> Brasov is the city where I like passing time in the secluded streets of the Old Town , or sitting at one of the dozens of terraces . <p> In Alba Iulia you have the opportunity to explore one of the most beautiful citadels in Transylvania . Every day , the change of the Citadel Guard takes place , and that 's a show that you should n't miss . <h> 4 . Kind People <p> Transylvania people <p> Transylvanian people are said to be faini ( meaning good and nice ) , serious and reliable . I absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , because they are open , they find time to sit and talk , to laugh and joke . <p> They like to show their kindness and be welcoming . You can find yourself invited in their house and sitting down at their table , before being able to tell them your name and where you come from . <h> 5 . Crafts <p> Beautiful handmade gifts <p> In Transylvania , you can find dozens of small workshops where craftsmen work various objects by hand : of wood , painted furniture , glass icons , ceramic pots . <p> If you go in winter through villages , you are likely to attend a +ez-toare ( meaning a social evening ) . In the long winter evenings , women gather in a house ( this gathering is called +ez-toare ) , some sit at the loom , others spin wool and while weaving colorful rugs , they talk and sing . <p> A magical atmosphere ! <h> 6 . Traditions <p> Nun working the loom <p> This is where I rejoice every time I see how beautifully celebrations and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves to celebrate such moments . <p> If you get to the villages , for Christmas or for the New Year , you will see groups of young people , often dressed in traditional costumes , wassailing from house to house and wishing people a good new year . <p> It should be easy for you to fit in a holiday celebration no matter what time of the year you travel to Transylvania . <p> Our celebrations are another reason why Transylvania seems full of life and authenticity . <h> 7 . Fabulous Landscapes <p> Perhaps I am most attracted to this land by the fabulous landscapes it was blessed with. - Large valleys , impressive mountains , wild gorges will arise before you . It 's enough to leave cities behind for a little while . <p> The houses surrounded by forests and scattered over the hills form a charming rustic picture . <h> 8 . Picturesque Villages and countryside life <p> Rimetea Village <p> In many small settlements in Transylvania , time seems to be different from the time we townspeople are accustomed with . <p> In villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , household , family . <p> If you 're an avid photographer , you wo n't be able to let your camera down . Every window , every tree , every moment is there to be snapped for memories . <p> I can not stay away too long from the places where almost everything has remained exactly as it was in my childhood . And I find that extraordinary . <p> I can see men mowing and women gathering hay . Animals returning from pasture slowly , in the evening , in the ringing of bells hung around their neck ; this is a day by day picture . I like to give up the car and occasionally take the means of transport as old as mankind , a cart full of newly mown hay and pulled by a horse . <p> All these simple bucolic scenes , of an unparalleled charm , will delight . <h> 9 . Tastes <p> walnut-pound-cakes <p> I should say that I love Transylvanian cuisine . And so it is , just with a small personal note : being especially based on meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before giving up meat , it occupied a place of honor in my menu ! <p> Whether you like to eat meat or not , Transylvanian cuisine is so varied that you will undoubtedly find your favorite dish . But do not expect exquisite specialties . It is not at all a sophisticated cuisine ; it is a blend of Romanian , Hungarian , Transylvanian Saxonic flavors , but with a special , delicious taste . <p> Sour soups ( recommendation : taste bean sour soup with smoked ham ) , stuffed cabbage , walnut pound cakes just taken out of the oven , are easily entered the list of culinary preferences of travelers. <h> 10 . Atmosphere <p> Rasnov Citadel <p> Everything that makes me come back again and again to Transylvania points to the atmosphere : traditional , simple , profoundly spiritual . <p> In the long summer days , I am overjoyed with those leisure moments when dusk slowly descends over the village . Under the myriad of stars and among the songs of crickets , long stories go off , between friends . <p> Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . It is an essential experience to celebrate with the locals . To get to know their superstitions , which are not limited at all , their beliefs , and their dreams . <p> This superb atmosphere gives life to Transylvania . And I madly love this patriarchal , original , mysterious land . <p> BIO : Mira Kaliani- is a travel writer and photographer and owner of C-l-torii la Singular travel blog .

I live in Arad , closer to the Hungarian border , though . and ps : yes , tuica ( plump brandy ) is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous kurtos which originates in Transylvania but when it used to be in Austro-Hungary . <p> Transylvania is wonderful ! I love the people , the citadels , the beautiful landscapes . Everything about it has a special charm . Its a place full of culture and history and nobody should miss it while in Romania . <p> Nice view , there 's more to see from Romania than people think . Have you tried Deva , Sibiu , Cluj and Petrosani ( near the Retezat Mountains ) . Are such nice places with beautiful landscapes if you are impressive with that . <p> When I went to Romania I was impressed with the singular culture they have . <p> For who did n't  visit this country yet , a good tip is to use bus and minivans to cross the country . <p> Just a question ? What do you mean with this : " with the singular culture they have . " ? ? Who have this culture ? ? Because the Romanians do n't  have to much Culture here in Transylvania , because Transylvania is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seclers and Hungarians have culture , history and tradition ! <p> From 1918 , 1 December ( politically ) , nationally they ( WE ) are Romanians from the beginning of the millenium = ( this is not a minority opinion , I do n't  think you can find even one Transylvanian that will think about himself otherwise than Romanian from the end of the Roman colonisation except for those who are not i.e. hungarians , germans , etc . ) <p> And there is so much more ! Caves like Pestera Ursilor and Pestera Scarisoara ! The Salt Mine from Turda ! The Monasterys from Moldova ( just take a look on google at Manastirea Barsana or Manastirea Voronet ) The train called Mocanita ! The most scenic way in Romania called Transfagarasan ! You will be impressed with Romania ! <p> Absolutely can not wait to visit this Beautiful country , we are booked to fly to Targu mures in may and look forward to it very much as do my children , everyone i have spoke too have said i will be inspired <p> My longtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first visit to Romania began in Arad , Timisoara , then the village of Birchis . From there we visited numerous cities and villages throughout Transylvania : Brasov , Poiana Brasov , Bran , Rasnov , Moiecu , Sibiu . . . We rented a car and drove up through the Carpathians to northern Romania to visit the painted monasteries and back down through Sighisoara . The country and culture is beautiful . Of course , I have the perfect travel guide , and after multiple visits Romania still remains top on my list of favorite places to explore . I look forward to each trip ( making sure to lose a little weight before hand , allowing room to overindulge on cozonac , galuste cu prune , langos , and everything else ! ) <p> I was looking up Transylvania because my great grandfather was Transylvanian . I got to thinking about it because of Halloween , and realized that I had never bothered to learn anything about my heritage . I really enjoyed this page because I can see so many of the traits of the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings together , doing crafts and art of various kinds , etc . To really top it all off , the country and the cities are spectacularly beautiful . This is now my top travel destination if I ever make it to Europe . <p> For seven years we 've been travelling in Romania , from North to South , from East to West . How many times we have crossed the Mountains we 've forgotten ! Romania is beatifull , smiling and friendly and.we are going Again this year ! <p> Its wonderful to see that more and more people discover all the mazing things Transylvania has to offer . Sibiu and Targu Mures are not the only beautiful cities , Brasov or Cluj are also worth visiting .

@@21820799 @1820799/ <h> Solo travel : Why I did n't  think I could travel alone <p> Its too scary , you 'll be lonely , the details will be overwhelming without a travel partner . <p> Those fears are too easy to listen to , and they can convince you to stay home and ignore your desire to travel . <p> I used to have these same fears . I did n't  think I was strong enough to travel alone . But I still wanted to see the world . It took awhile , but eventually , in the battle between my fears and my wanderlust , travel won . <h> I cant travel alone <p> For as long as I can remember , travel has been a big passion of mine . I took several organized trips to Europe when I was a teenager , which sparked my travel addiction . From then on , I was always dreaming of more places I wanted to visit . <p> When I was 18 and realized I did n't  need to go on an organized tour , I dragged my best friend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I studied abroad in Spain , and even though several people from the group traveled on their own after the program was over , it never occurred to me that I could do that too . <p> For many years , I did n't  have friends to travel with me . So I spent that time traveling within the US , happily using my vacation time to visit friends and family , but never satisfying that desire to see the world . <h> I lacked the confidence to try it alone . <p> I saw one of my closest friends travel alone all the time , but I never considered myself the type of person who could travel solo . After college , when I knew of people setting off to backpack through Europe for three months , I just thought <p> " I cant do that " but never asked myself " why not ? " <h> What was I waiting for ? <p> I think I was waiting for a friend to volunteer to go with me or for a boyfriend to appear who wanted to travel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip and go on my own . But when I finally realized that I had n't  been out of the country in almost eight years , I was determined to make a change . <p> I finally did ask myself <p> " why cant I travel alone ? " What was I waiting for ? <p> There was no reason to postpone my dreams simply because I did n't  have a travel partner . My desire to travel overrode my fear of going alone . <h> Still scared but taking the leap anyway <p> I started by planning a 10 day trip to Greece , and I used a travel agent to help me sort out the details . I figured it was a good way to test out solo travel without having to worry about getting overwhelmed with all the planning . <p> It was my safety net in a way . Letting someone else do the planning meant the only hard part left was for me to just go . When I finally got to Greece , the feeling of satisfaction was more than I ever expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Of course I can do this ! <p> Knowing I was fully capable of traveling on my own , I began taking more solo trips . I was no longerholding myself back from traveling . If I wanted to go somewhere , I just saved my money , planned the trip , and off I went . Places like Croatia , Hong Kong , Australia , and Cambodia were no longer out of reach . <h> Learning to love solo travel <p> Nothing beats the confidence boost that comes with traveling alone . Without someone else around to share the burden of decision making , I had to rely on myself more than ever before . <p> While sometimes that meant a little extra pressure , it also meant I did n't  have to compromise . I had the flexibility to do what I wanted , when I wanted . And that was empowering . <p> Solo travel was never as lonely as I thought .

Little things that seemed scary became huge triumphs when I found I really was capable of traveling on my own . <h> Traveling by myself made me realize I 'm stronger than I thought I was . <h> Traveling alone is within your reach . <p> If you 've been thinking of going somewhere , there 's no reason you have to wait for a travel partner . Do some research so you know more about the place you 're going to and make plans for at least your first few days to make yourself feel more comfortable . <p> I had fears when I took my first solo trip , and sometimes I still do , but I pushed past those fears and went anyway .

I went solo traveling only once before to Belize . I had an amazing time , saw what I wanted to see and met some lovely people along the way . I do n't  know why I 've let the fears sink in again but , after reading your post I 'm very inspired to do it once again . I was hoping my bf would want to do it but , he seems to never come around to doing it with me and no friends are really travel fans . So I guess I 'm on my own . The most inspiring thing you reminded me of is the fact that it is very empowering . Glad I came across this today . = <p> Thanks Jess ! I 'm so glad I could help . I understand letting those fears creep back in , happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also remind yourself of that great solo trip you took to Belize , remind yourself how empowering it was , and plan the next trip . And plenty of people travel without their boyfriends , send him a postcard ! I hope you take another solo trip soon and have a wonderful time ! <p> Thanks Caz &amp; Craig ! I appreciate you letting me share my solo travel experiences . Its such a wonderful thing to try at least once , and not so scary once you take the leap . So glad I finally tried traveling alone ! <p> The only times I traveles solo were to meet someone abroad . So that does n't  really count : ) I 'm not afraid of all the planning I LOVE to plan - , I 'm more afraid that I wont be able to talk to someone whenever I feel like it . I do n't  appreciate things I see and experience as much when I 'm alone . I know that you do n't  need to be alone when you travel solo . Its easy enough to mee people abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have their own sights-to-see and their own planning ( or not : ) ) Mind you , I 'm NOT , definitely NOT , writing against solo travel ! Just explaining why it has n't  appealed to me yet <p> Thanks Sofie ! Some people truly do n't  enjoy solo travel . I love traveling with my husband now , but traveling on my own is a completely different experience . If you 're on your own and you meet another solo traveler , chances are they 're up for a little company too , even if its just for an hour to grab a meal . The nice thing about being on your own is you can decide at the last minute if you want to change your plans to hang out with someone else . Or you can decide , nope , this is something I really want to do , I 'm not changing my mind for anyone . Its wonderful flexibility . As far as appreciating things , I think you just experience it differently if you 're solo instead of with someone else . You end up appreciating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . <p> I think its great you moved through this fear gradually first locally , then abroad with the planning help of an agent , then on your own . Something else people can do is practice things like sitting alone at a restaurant or going to the movies or going on a walk alone before they even travel . <p> Also , one can always make sure in advance they know how and where to call if they need help have their hostel/hotels info , the embassys info , numbers back home . <p> Solo travel is as fun and empowering as you wrote and its definitely worth exploring despite fear . <p> I can totally relate to this . I 'd always travelled with my boyfriend of 6 years until we broke up 6 months ago . I was literally the other side of the world from my family and knew no-one . But I think I cracked on quite spectacularly met some friends , got a job , tried to move on and did some solo travel ( and some travel with friends too which I 've actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) and I think I 'm kinda getting there ! Well done Ali , love your story = <p> Thanks Beverley ! Definitely sounds like you bounced back from your break up quite well ! Solo travel is great for getting over a guy too , reminds you of how strong you are on your own . I 'm glad you made some new friends and you 're having a good time ! <p> i have traveled solo out of necessity after the last trip with steve , but everyone has a steve story . now after more than 20 years and a blog for Italian Americans , i will begn a new chapter : http : **25;1180;TOOLONG hope you will all share your ideas on where to staywhen you rebeyond te all night train or the hotstel , best solo places to eat , etc . I am working with yltours in Italy to create solo friendly events that a traveler can participate in. stay tuned . <p> I have always been comfortable doing things alone in my home country . I eased into long-term solo international travel during a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Mendoza on my own and even stayed in a hostel dorm for the first time . This helped me build my confidence enough to take the next big leap . <p> That sounds like a great way to ease yourself into solo travel ! That could easily work for someone who is n't traveling long term too by starting a trip with a friend and then spending a few days apart , or doing half the trip together and the other half solo . <p> I 've done solo travel a few times , but generally I only do it for a few weeks at a time . I am not extremely social and have a hard time approaching people so I tend to get lonely on longer trips . Luckily , my husband loves travel as much as I do so he is usually eager to come along . <p> I 'm not the most social person either , and it is the first solo trip was a bit tough from that perspective . But I 've found over time that I need that social interaction , even if I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little harder to talk to people . I 'm glad your husband loves to travel too , that 's always a great set up ! Thanks Jade ! <p> A really nice post . I 'm a Hotel owner in Greece and the last few years we have more and more solo travelers . We are a family run resort and us with also with other guests we try to make them feel as a part of our family . Just i wanted to say anywhere you travel do n't  be afraid , everybody will come in touch , the only think you have to do is smiling and be always positive . Nobody bother why you are single when are you on Holidays just everybody wants to have a nice time . <p> What an inspiring post . Thank you for sharing . I took the plunge and travelled alone and to be honest , its the best way to experience a country . At times it can get lonely , but at other times you will have the chance to meet and spend time with so many likeminded travellers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ! <p> Thanks Charles ! I 'm so glad you took a chance on solo travel and enjoyed it . It does give you more flexibility to be alone if you want to , or to reach out to other travelers and make new friends if you want some company . <h> Trackbacks <p> Solo Travel : Why I Did n't  Think I Could Travel Alone on yTravelBlog .

Luckily for us Caz is a qualified Primary School teacher and has been teaching around the world and in Australia since 1997 . <p> We know that travel offers so much to our kids as far as education goes , and opens their eyes to a whole new world . Most recently we witnessed this when Savannah met Alida in Vanuatu . <p> There are life lessons to be learned that can not be taught in any classroom , text book or movie . History , Science , Language , Math and the Arts can all be studied hands-on through travel . <p> We certainly do n't  plan on home schooling our kids full-time , but for now traveling together as a family , and creating lifelong memories as a family is very important to us . <h> Meet Ups <p> In every major city we plan on having reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Its cool that you can do a loop and make the seasons work like that . This makes me think about doing a long road trip around New Zealand . I 'd never thought of that . <p> I 'm looking forward to hearing about all your travels and tips on places to go and see as next year my partner and I are packing in our jobs , heading to Australia and travelling for a year .

With kids and work , its hard to comment or even read the blog . But your blog has always provided great information as well as inspiration . Keep up the good work and enjoy your EPIC road trip . <p> We spent six weeks with our 3 teens and 7 year old in 2011 traveling the S half of Oz West Australia , Nullibor to South Australia , Victoria and then flew to Brisbane area .

My boyfriend and I bought a Ford Explorer , and have been camping in the back of it for the past 6 weeks ! Were not travelling quite as slow as I 'd like ( we ended up racing across the Prairies and going to TBEX ) but its pretty amazing experiencing the diversity of the country I am so proud to be from . <p> I am ( well , used to be since I quit to travel ) a primary school teacher too , and totally agree that these kind of hands-on learning experiences will be completely more valuable and memorable than anything in a classroom ! <p> Please do n't  make the normal mistake and stick to the coast and the tar seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . We drove 35000km in 6 months , and the best of Australia is a long way from the east coast .

Love tropical North Queensland . <p> Had n't  even crossed my mind about a satellite phone , but we will tick all of those boxes when it gets closer to departure . And will be changing from Optus to Telstra that 's for sure as far as our smartphones go ! <p> We already have a Nissan X-Trail well be using , and seriously considering a camper trailer as want to do the caravanning/camping lifestyle as much as possible . <p> Also be very careful to abide by the restricted alcohol areas .

Its wonderful to see such seasoned travellers dive into their own country . So many of us keep travelling the world saying " oh it will always be there " .

This will be an amazing adventure . There is just much to see in Australia it is not funny . I took five weeks to drive from Brisbane to Perth and I had to miss so much . Enjoy and take it nice and slow = <p> What an adventure ! I went on a road trip several years back to trace the footsteps of my ancestors who came to Australia to work in the copper mine in Burra , SA . Its a fascinating town that allows you to explore the old mine , brewery , jail , etc. on your own time by following a heritage passport . So not only was it a fascinating lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the graves , old house and stomping ground of various ancestors including my great-great-great grandfather . Have you thought about incorporating some of this type of exploration in your travels ? <p> We are planning to tow a camper trailer and really get amongst the camping / caravanning lifestyle . However , we are also planning on our fair share of hostels stays , apartment stays , and some hotels in major cities . Plus , potentially some house-sitting . <p> Look out country towns the blonde nomads are on their way ! Such an awesome adventure you 're embarking on . So many stunning places better than anywhere else in the world , this country of ours . Ok , i 'd best plan where i come and visit ! Xx <p> What a year of adventure you have in front of you . I think becoming an expert in your own country is brilliant and should open the door for lots of other opportunities . Lucky kids with parents like you too charging around the country . I spent almost 3 months in Australia a long time ago and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take a train trip across the country . One day . <p> Great new Caz and Craig . You will absolutely love it . When our kids travelled during school term their teacher just asked that they keep a diary ( come to think of it , that is sort of like an off-line Blog : ) ) . Can we expect some on-line photos or posts from Kalrya ? <p> Sounds like an amazing trip Criag ! Did half of Australia in a camper a few years back and loved it so will keep up to date with your blog to hear about your adventures and what we missed on the other half . Would be great to meet you , Caz and the kids when you come to Cairns , I 'm a local here so happy to help with local knowledge , the Great Barrier Reef and finding some of the hidden gems .

I am hopefully visiting Oz for the first time this year so am looking forward to your updates ! <p> What an amazing journey you have planned out for the year ahead or as you mentioned , possibly longer .

Ca n't wait to follow along and see your island home through your photos and stories . Just reading this and looking at your photos has me itching for a trip to Australia ( have never been ) ! <p> I cant wait to follow your trip . I just finished the Gibb River Road and will be heading back to do it again . When you are going to Mitchell Falls via Kalumburu Road drive with care ! This is seriously the worst road I have ever been on . It is worse than any road I have travel in Africa and South America . We meet so many couples and families that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twisted axles , shattered bearings , cracked petrol tanksthis road means business ! <p> The Gibb River Road is in very good condition and many portions are paved now which is disappointing . <p> Late to the party but just wanted to say yay , you guys !

I have never seen much of the US always travel over seas . Australia looks great always wanted to go but where do you start.Im starting in Cairns next week . <p> First time to the site and all I can say is WOW . First congrats on following the dream and making it happen ! Secondly I cant wait to see how this goes . Having a family of five the wifey and I have concerns about just dropping everything and traveling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out right now seems unfair . After they finish we would love to do more traveling with the younger one . I guess planning is a must especially when something so simple as location during a certain period can make a big difference . Congrats again and safe journeys ! <p> Hi Caz and Craig , I am so looking forward to following you in your year-long journey . My husband and I spent a year travelling around North America and quickly became snowbirds spending our summers at home in Canada and winters travelling in the USA . We have thought about doing a similar journey in Australia one day . One thing I wanted to suggest to you is RVing . We love living in our RV . There 's nothing like seeing new places and doing new things and still having your own bed , shower and kitchen . <p> This sounds like the trip of a lifetime . I just arrived in Sydney on a working holiday visa . Its a shame I have to do the work part ! I 'd love to meet up when you 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great trip ! This is something I would love to do at some point in my life . I once drove from Melbourne to Cairns , and when I got to Cairns I felt like I could have kept driving so I know I could easily do the rest . <p> I 'm back in Melbourne in December so that is too bad I will miss you guys . <p> Oh my !

Do you have anyway easy go to Australia ? Thanks for your shared ! <p> The beauty about living in this world is that its so diverse and unique in every single way that traveling in your own home country you will always find and learn about new things . Heck , even being a tourist in your own city can be surprising and wonderful ! ! <p> Great post , the listed destinations and reasons behind that is completely approachable . Whenever I travel in Australia , I discover something new in the same place . Australia is a complete package for holidays with kids , family and for all age people .

Each area or city is great for its own unique reason .

There is the research out there that does indicate this can be a reality , but there is also the research that is contrary to that fact . <p> Its a tough decision to make and we ended up immunizing Kalrya , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to risk her getting chicken pox instead of autism . <p> I do n't  think that would have made me a stupid moron , just someone who thinks in a different way , and who wants to make the best choice for my daughter and what I feel comfortable with . <p> I am open enough to look at alternatives , to look at different opinions and then make a decision . <p> I do n't  believe that I know everything , nor do I believe that doctors , or medical researchers , or alternative therapists do also . <h> Defending our Identity Does n't  Allow us to Evolve <p> It has really gotten me thinking about how some people become so staunch in their opinions of something , even to the point of abusing someone else because of it and allowing relationships to fall apart . <p> I am sure that if I had not traveled I probably would be clinging just as tightly to my beliefs and opinions , through absolute terror that if I was somehow proven wrong it would mean the end of my identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I also know that this can so easily change . <p> I am so happy to allow myself the freedom to do that . What worked for me yesterday or five years ago , may not anymore because I evolve and change . <p> When I first set out on my travels I had a certain identity and way of viewing and thinking about the world that was based upon my limited life experiences . Experiences that came only from my family , my small town , my friends , and my culture . <p> Sure , I was exposed to other ways of being and thoughts through books and movies , but if you do n't  experience these in the real world they can have limited impact . <h> Traveling opened my mind and eyes up to what other people believe and why <p> As I was on a great adventure , I was open to learn more about other cultures and viewpoints . I somehow did not see it as a threat to myself , just me exploring the world around me and being fascinated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly seeped in and opened up my mind more and more . <p> Eventually , I became this person who was able to listen to the viewpoints of others and see it as something interesting that I could perhaps learn from , rather than take it as a personal offense to myself . <p> Of course , I am not perfect , and there are times when my self-righteousness rears its ugly head . But , I have my travel experiences to pull me back on track and tell me to get a grip and remember what I know . <h> I do n't  know what I do n't  know <p> There is always someone who can help me learn something new and open my eyes up to new possibilities . I welcome that . <p> I may not believe it and want to accept it to be true for me , but I respect their thoughts . I do n't  want to let it anger me that much that I call them insulting names . <p> I never know , it could just teach me something new that empowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> The biggest thing that I have learnt while traveling is understanding . I can analyze differences and have a better understanding in different people , cultures and customs . This is n't saying that I agree with everything , its just saying that i can better appreciate and understand different perspective . As I travel more , I just broaden this perspective . <p> Understanding and tolerance are so important . You do n't  have to agree or like what others do or how they think , but you can definitely try to understand it and accept that it works for them and be happy for them . Some things you do decide you like and take on and your life is enriched by it . Beauty ! ! Youd never find this out if you werent first open to understanding . Great thoughts Nithya ! Thank you <p> I agree that traveling helps expose us to new ideas and ways of doing things . This is very good . However , I must admit that , even though I have lived overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get annoyed with people who do things differently from me . I can think that my way is right and their way is wrong . For example , I live in Asia and have a 6-month-old baby girl . In Asia , it is very culturally acceptable for anybody and everybody to tell a young mom everything she is doing wrong . I can not leave my apartment without a myriad of people ( strangers ) telling me that my baby is too hot , cold , shouldnt suck her fingers , shouldnt chew her toys , should n't be carried a front carrier , etc . I get asked by perfect strangers whether my daughter drinks breast milk or formula , whether she was born naturally or via c-section . All of this seriously messes with my American sense of independence . Sometimes I want to scream , " Is this your child ? ! " Sometimes I am kind and patient towards people . But other times I am cold and hostile . I 'm just being honest . <p> So , I write all this to say that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But I do n't  know that it is a " cure " for how I can be impatient and downright unkind to people sometimes . <p> I think it is perfectly okay to get annoyed in situations like this and I think that everyone goes through this in one way or another . It is much harder to deal with when it is a culture that is not your own . I think by being honest you are recognizing this is a part of you . You cant grow if you do n't  acknowledge and accept where you are now . <p> I would not beat myself up about it though if I was you . I really think it is natural for you to get irritated by that . i know I certainly would . I hate people telling me how I should be raising my child . I think you get that anywhere . People think they are being helpful but they just put you into a spin . i think just do your best to smile and say thanks for that and walk away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this sort of stuff , and it confused me . I ended up going against my better judgement and what I felt to be right for me as they had terrified me into thinking I had it wrong- their way ended up being a disaster for me . So now , I just kindly smile and say thank you and let it go in one ear out the other and change the conversation . For any new mothers my advice will always be , " Trust in yourself . Only you know what works best for yourself and child . " <p> Unfortunately , I think some people are so close-minded that even travel would n't helpalthough it certainly would n't hurt . <p> The word " moron " ( or its cousinsidiots , stupid , imbeciles , jerks , etc. ) has always rankled me . I believe all it really conveys is that the person who says it simply has a need to squelch others to make themselves look bigger , better or more important . <p> Hmmmmaybe I 'm close minded about people who are close minded ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it really conveys is that the person who says it simply has a need to squelch others to make themselves look bigger , better or more important . " <p> totally agree . It is so obvious to everyone else but them . I agree that those words are very harsh and grating . It is interesting when you stop and think about being close minded about close minded people . I think it all the time about myself too and try to do better . As long as you are aware and doing your best to improve . <p> Totally agree with you on this Cas . Whilst I admit that I 'm an incredibly judgemental person , I always keep my opinions to myself and never let them get in the way of meeting someone new and different and learning about new cultures . For instance , I do n't  believe in God but I would n't call someone that does stupid ; they 're just different to me . If the world realised were all different and accepted it , it might be a kinder place to live = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our opinions- after all only we know what is best for our lives , but I think as you said , you do n't  let it get in the way of meeting someone new and treating them with respect . On our travels we kept running into a particular race who were so rude , arrogant and condescending to the local people . It happened every time we ran into these people . Of course we could not help but form judgements about them , but every time we met a person individually we always were friendly and respectful and treated them as everyone deserves to be treated . It helped us to get to know a little bit more about the real person not just how we perceived them to be by some of the " groups " actions . I wish people did realize that it was okay for people to think in different ways , it is not a threat , it is what makes our world so colourful . I think it would be a much kinder place and we would n't feel the need to always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are gaining valuable skills from their trip along with their experience . Haha , I also love that some people here are completely comfortable to ignoring other peoples opinions at times . <p> Its a real talent to truly listen to other people with an open mind . Have you ever noticed how absent it is in topics that are most related to peoples core values ( religion , politics raising your baby ; ) ) . People just do n't  listen because its hard and it would be even harder to actually change what you believe . <p> Very true . It is hard to keep those minds open when it comes to religion and politics . Best not to talk about it . I think I can be very staunch in my opinion when it comes to raising my child . I am open to listening to advice from others though , but I would n't call them names just because they think differently to me. ( unless they abused their child then I would call them names ) <p> After reading the first 1/3 of the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing I 'll read today . In fact I have stopped reading further blogs for today , not that they of any less value , but so that I may savour the thoughts offered and allow what you 've written to breath . <p> " I know what I believe , but I also know that this can so easily change . " agreed . <p> How much different , and better would this world be if there was a mandatory " travel time " after graduation from high school , much like mandatory service in the army/navy , etc .. <p> Instead we are stuck mostly with hometown bumpkins that have it all figured out with their " worldly " view . Sadly , those are the ones that are most vocal . <p> I have no answers , just nodding my head in agreement : no evolution . Were doomed if we keep this up . Writing this in light of 80 or so people murdered in Norway off topic , but its times like this Im quite sure there is no hope for mankind . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has opened my mind so muchso has teaching ESL/EFL . Many people advised me not to travel to the Middle East last summer ( due to their narrow ideas and biases re : Arabs , Muslims , etc . ) . I did n't  listen since I 'd had experiences to the contrary ( much of it due to teaching wonderful students from Syria , Jordan , Palestine , etc . ) . I 'm glad I went . A closed mind would have meant missing out on one of my best trips ever . <p> My favorite line in this post is " Defending our identity does n't allow us to evolve . " Wow . I so get that . And sadly , Ive seen this in many people . And I know that I need to try to keep an open mind re : those who are more narrow in their thinking . Perhaps that 's my challenge <p> Its so great that you did n't  listen to the naysayers You always have to do what you feel is right based on what you believe .

( Its one of the reasons we love living on the Gold Coast ) <p> Get up at 6am on the Goldy and it feels like midday with everyone out and about walking , cycling and surfing . You ca n't help but get caught up in the energy of the place . <p> And the great thing about taking a walk is its FREE and you 're seeing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and appreciate an area more . The Gold Coast is so great for walking we live here and do n't  own a car . <p> You 're not sitting in traffic or rushing around on public transport , instead , you 're soaking up the local landscapes and walking off the over-indulgence of eating on your holiday . <p> So once you 're done with the theme parks and laying on the beach , get active and get beyond the concrete skyline and head off into nature . <h> 4 Gold Coast Walks <h> 1 . Burleigh- Heads National Park <p> Burleigh Heads is one of our favorite spots on the Gold Coast , but for reasons I cant answer , we 'd never ventured into Burleigh Heads National Park before . <p> Weve been recommended this walk many times as one of the best and most popular walks on the Goldy . Finally , we 've done it . <p> We suggest getting up early for this walk . Grab a takeaway coffee from Nook Espresso then head to the point and catch the magnificent sunrise whilst watching the surfers at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has risen and you 've had your coffee fix and been inspired by the surfers , head off on the ocean view walk around the rocky headland . <p> A wild , natural headland in the heart of the Gold Coast offers walks along the rocky foreshore and through rainforest , and the chance to see whales in spring and sea-eagles soaring along the coast . At Burleigh Head , where ancient volcanic columns meet the sea , this park features rainforest , eucalypt forest , pandanus groves , tussock grassland , coastal heath and mangroves . Its northern side is one of Australias most famous surfing point breaks.Walk the Ocean view walk around the rocky headland from Tallebudgera Creek and look at the tumbled masses of six-sided basalt columns .

Coolangatta to Point Danger <p> This is a great little walk we did over and over again whilst staying in Coolangatta for 5 days . <p> If you only do it once , we suggest saving it for late afternoon as the sunset views you get at the end are magical , as you 'll see in a moment . <p> This walk may not take you long , its about 2 km in total , but that really depends on how often you stop as the scenery along the way will have you reaching for your camera at every outlook . <p> Start this walk on the path that runs parallel to Coolangatta Beach and head towards Greenmount Beach . If you desire , grab a coffee from the Go with the FloCafe at Greenmount surf club then start heading around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach is our little piece of paradise on the Gold Coast , family friendly for a swim and from the pathway you get a nice view back over Coolangatta . <p> The point is also a popular surfing spot for the locals . <p> Once you 've seen the surfers catch a few waves keep heading around the headland and shortly you 'll get to Rainbow Bay which is also a top spot for families . <p> Rainbow Bay <p> From here you have two options . Walk on the sand up to Rainbow Bay Surf Club , or simply stay on the path . Along this section of pathway is a playground for the kiddies to enjoy whilst you take a seat on the grass and admire the beach . <p> Path optionBeach option <p> Continuing past the Surf Club you 'll come to Snapper Rocks , one of the most famous surf breaks in the world and home of the Quiksilver Pro surfing contest . <p> And once you climb the small hill up to Point Danger on the Queensland / NSW border you 'll be overlooking another well-known surfing beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this walk in the afternoon , now is the perfect time to grab a cold drink or even dinner on the west facing deck at Rainbow Bay Surf Club .

It has the best views on the Gold Coast ! <h> 3 . Lamington National Park <p> Fancy a bit of Rainforest bushwalking ? <p> Lamington National Park is in the Gold Coast hinterland , and the place to stay up there is OReillys Rainforest Retreat .

I did n't  realise the Gold Coast had officially linked all the coastal paths though , this might be a running challenge for me at some point . Thanks for the heads up ! <p> My other recommendation would be Springbrook National Park , but it is similar to Lamington for the casual observer . There 's one spectacular trail that winds down into a canyon , then passes BEHIND Purlingbrook Falls , before creeping back up out of the valley . Maybe the kids would have a rough time of it though ! <p> Echo Beach is a great little secret spot that is n't too crowded even on the hottest summer day well done for being " in " on that little bit of information ! Its one of the only spots in SE QLD I can think of where rainforest meets the beach , and you feel like you are much further north ! <p> WOW you guys had some fantastic weather during your adventures , and great skies too ! Thanks for highlighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 but did n't  manage to get to the Gold Coast . We had heard it was a bit of concrete jungle but this looks just beautiful ! <p> Surfers Paradise is where most of the highrise development is and you could consider a concrete jungle . The beach in surfers is pretty much in shade from midday onwards . But from Burleigh Heads southwards the Gold Coast is awesome with better beaches , walks and less skyscrapers <p> You guys captured some fantastic pics of my home town and some great walks . Another one ( for next time ) is along the Broadwater the Broadwater Parklanks are great for the kids and then you can meander up to the Grand Hotel at Labrador , plenty of pelicans and there 's also some interesting sculptures as you head north . Look back south and you get the Surfers skyline and all the boats on the Broadwater . <p> The Burleigh National Park walk is one of my favorites as is the Coolangatta to Point Danger walk .

Chocolate ! When do we want it , now ! <p> All around Australia kids are getting excited about Easter Egg hunts , participating in their schools Easter bonnet parade or attending the Sydney Royal Easter Show . <p> For us Aussies , Easter is also the first school holidays since the Christmas break and a time we like to travel and getaway over the long weekend with our families and enjoy the last warm days before winter arrives . <p> While this may be the norm in Australia , Easter is celebrated around the world in a surprising variety of ways , with traditions differing from country to country according to their ethnic and cultural origins . <p> Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history behind them . <h> 1 .

@@21820812 @1820812/ <h> Top 7 Things to do in Chapel Hill , North Carolina <p> There is a reason why Chapel Hill is consistently rated as one of the best places in America to live , and as being the best college town in the States . Its a town that is created around the college , which was one of the first public Universities in the country. - Franklin St , at the front of the college , is the street where all the vibrancy lives through its many restaurants , cafes , bars , and of course the ubiquitous Carolina blue merchandise stores . <p> Chapel Hill , is our favorite place to hang out , and at times its really hard to describe why . Sometimes a love for a place is unexplainable because its a connection you find with the energy that vibrates from there . And there is plenty of energy in Chapel Hill . A college town ; a major US basketball college town . In fact one of the best basketball colleges in the country . It is the place Michael Jordan says made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was flying through the air and winning any number of championships for the Chicago bulls , underneath his uniformed shorts were Carolina blue ones . Maybe that might explain a little the pull that this place has on you . <p> Here are 7 of our top picks for things to do while in Chapel Hill : <h> Suttons Drug Store <p> " Potato Munchers anyone ? " asks the Pharmacist <p> Four years of visiting Chapel Hill and we walked past this pharmacy every time without venturing inside . Why would we ? We did n't  need medicine . On our last visit to Chapel Hill , we needed some gum , so walked into Suttons to buy some and discovered instead a Chapel Hill icon . It was a step back in time . At the back of the pharmacy , the chemist in his white lab coat , walked around chatting to his guests sitting in the crowded diner . A small counter wrapped around the tiny cooking area , and patrons sat on spinning stools eating hamburgers , hot dogs and fries , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Along the walls and hanging from the ceilings were hundreds of photos of happy diners . On further investigation we found photos of Tyler Hansborough , Sean May , Danny Green and all our favorite basketball players . <p> " Where was Micheal Jordan ? " we asked . <p> " Upstairs in the safe . " <p> This is a true local hangout . In fact if we were only there a couple of hours earlier we could have had breakfast with Sean May . Craig was pretty devastated about that miss . We came back for lunch and had the tastiest vegetarian hamburger and then learned that Suttons is noted as the 10th best hamburger in America . A recommended try are the potato munchers ; which is potato , cheese , and jalapeno all wrapped up in a long ball and fried . Delicious . A burger will set you back at around $5 . <h> Carolina Basketball Museum <p> Winning Championship Trophies <p> Again , another treat we only discovered on our last visit to Chapel Hill and it is completely free . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hooked already on Carolina basketball . Even if you are not a Tar Heel or basketball fan , you will enjoy learning about the tradition and history of Carolina basketball and lessons of success . Reading the stories , listening to the audios , watching short video clips , and seeing memorabilia such as MJs championship rings , - recruitment letters , the size of Sean Mays feet with his match winning Carolina shoes on display , and the four championship trophies that stand proudly on display at the end of the tour , make for a pretty memorable visit . <h> Take a Walking Tour of the Campus and Shop for Carolina Blue Gear <p> Taking a walk on campus <p> There is a lot of history in Chapel Hill , and it is well worth taking a stroll through the campus to see its historic buildings , oak tree lined parks , and beautiful gardens . If you happen to be here during college time , there will be a hive of bustling activity to inspire you to perhaps enroll at the college yourself . Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the walk that the football team do every home game , to cheers of their loyal Tar Heel fans . Throughout Franklin St and the campus you will find many book stores and T-shirt shops where you can shop for Carolina blue gear . We cant help but buy something new each time we visit . We found the best store for variety and price was the student bookstore right in the middle of the campus in the famous Tar Pitt . <h> Catch a Final Four Game at a Bar on Franklin Street and then Jump Fires on the Street when we Win . <p> Ready .. set .. jump ! <p> On many of the walls of the establishments in Chapel Hill , sits a common two photo spread . One side shows Franklin St deserted , the other , shows an hour later where the same street can not be seen through the thousands of bodies crammed on the street celebrating a NCAA win in wild Carolina tradition . Twice we have found ourselves amongst the action . Within the bar , no room for even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - jumped , and cheered with each ball through the net , successful defensive plays and eventually the final victory bell . And then we ran , with the crowd out the doors and onto the streets . Bodies stream out from every bar on the street to celebrate with each other- all running straight for the fires . Crowds gather around fires that are fueled by whatever can be thrown in it , Tshirts , street signs , bar receipts and then the jumping starts . Egged on by the crowd with cheers and claps , you take a short running start and leap over the fire , hoping that no one does it at the same time as you on the other side . Check that one off your travel bucket list ! <h> Old Well White at the Top of the Hill Restaurant &amp; Brewery <p> Old Well White with views of Franklin Street <p> There are many places to choose from in Chapel Hill for dining and red wining . One of our favorite places to have a drink is the Top of the Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at the top of , not the hill , but Franklin Street , overlooking it from the 3rd story establishment . Top of the Hill is where Franklin and Columbus Street converge , and it is the place where the madness of NCAA fire jumping is in full swing . If you 're not brave enough to be jumping then this would be the best place to be a spectator from . Whenever we head to the Hill for a game , you can find us on the balcony enjoying one of our favorite all time beers , brewed by the restaurant , Old Well White which is a Belgian wheat style beer . Its a top notch place to have a drink even when a game is not on . <h> Go to a Live College Game <p> With our mascot Ramses <p> Whether it is football or basketball , get yourself to a live game . The atmosphere is buzzing and you will witness first hand the fervour that comes from loving UNC . We sat in the stands at the game when UNC football team upset Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations best . On the final bell , the crowds from the stands moved out onto the field mobbing the players and each other . We watched in fascination as they climbed either of the goal posts rocking them until they fell down onto the crowd below , and crowd surfed them around the field . The next day , the Dean in commentary about it said something to the effect of , " Oh well , well replace them . This is the spirit of Carolina . It can not be contained . " <p> Deon Thompson signing autographs <p> Secret tip : If you have a child ( if not borrow one ) enroll in the Tar Heels kids club . Through this club we managed to get $10 tickets to the opening football match withfantastic seats right on center line . We also were invited to attend a special kids club meet and greet with the basketball players . Craig could hardly contain his excitement as he raced around the courts getting autographs from his favorite players , dragging little Kalyra around with him and elbowing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalyras ear , " Let me do all the talking . Just smile and be cute . " <h> Weaver St Market <p> Hula Hooping <p> Next to Chapel Hill is the even smaller , alternative town of Carrboro . Weaver St market is a popular place to sit on the lawn with a wholesome lunch and a coffee and watch the hula hoop twirlers dance by or listen to some Sunday Jazz . There are a few boutique stores within the complex you can shop around in if you get bored by the entertaining Weaver St Patrons . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I almost went to UNCC on a swimming scholarship , but changed my mind .

This time , we had three kids in tow . This time , we were responsible parents and respectable business owners . <p> Although most of our friends and family did n't see it that way . When we told them we were moving to Central America they thought we were nuts . <p> You see we were already living the dream lifestyle , working from home with our own business on stunning Waiheke Island in New Zealand with its sub-tropical climate , laid back vibe and stunning beaches . <p> But once a traveler , always a traveler . No matter how great our lifestyle was , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure was too great to resist . The itchy feet got too much for us in the end . <p> So we chose to move to Costa Rica in Central America because we wanted to move somewhere which fitted these main criteria : <p> A country where you could get permanent residency and buy property " so if we liked it we could settle down permanently ; <p> Non-English speaking but with a widely spoken language because we wanted our kids to be bilingual ; <p> Cheap because we had three kids to support and we 'd be traveling for a while before we started working again ; <p> Somewhere we 'd never been before ( which excludes many places in Africa , Europe , the Middle East and South East Asia ) ; <p> Somewhere with amazing stunning beaches , nature and wildlife ; <p> Somewhere stable where our kids would be safe " we already felt guilty enough about uprooting our children from their peaceful existence , we did n't want to put their lives in jeopardy too . <p> Choosing Central America was easy compared to choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banff . Image : Shutterstock.com <h> 3 Reasons Not to Live in Costa Rica <p> Before leaving New Zealand we spent months researching which Central American country would be best for us before finally settling on Panamaand rejecting its more popular neighbor Costa Rica which seemed to be : <p> 1 . Too touristy. 2 . Too over-priced. 3 . Too over-run by expats . <p> But we kept our options open and decided to travel around Central America and visit as many potential places to live as possible before deciding where to lay our many hats . <p> We traveled through Guatemala , Nicaragua , Panama and Costa Rica before finally deciding Costa Rica was the one and only place that really got us excited for permanent residency . <p> In the end , we knew living in Costa Rica would be the place wed love most . <h> 3 Reasons You Should Move to Costa Rica Now <p> So why was moving to Costa Rica preferable to other countries in Central America ? <p> 1 . Although it 's a popular travel destination Costa Rica is still wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussy about beaches having been spoilt in New Zealand but since the one main aim in our lives is to live by a gorgeous beach finding a beach which made the grade in Central America took time . <p> We finally found those beaches in the Southern zone of Costa Rica . <p> 2 . Costa Rica was the only place where the wildlife is really rampant . I hope it stays that way . <p> When we were in New Zealand we dreamed of seeing toucans and in Costa Rica we had them in our garden every day . Toucans were n't the only creature we shared our lives with . <p> Friendly neighbour <p> We had everything from monkeys and pizote ( coati ) in our trees to hummingbirds or scorpions in the house and even bats in our toilet . It was quite an experience for the whole family . <p> 3 . We discovered that where once we 'd have been glad to be the only expats in town that was n't fair on our kids . <p> While we were happy to send them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local culture and language , we also thought they needed other English speaking kids to hang out with . <p> So , in the end , having a community of expats nearby in Costa Rica helped us make our Central American experience a success for the whole family because if our kids are happy , we are too . <p> We ended up spending 18 months in Central America and living in Costa Rica for most of that time . <p> In the end , it did n't turn out to be a permanent move for us . The schooling for our children was n't great and , although I 'm a homeschooler at heart , in practice it 's just not me . I wanted to live somewhere where my kids could go to school so I could have time for writing . <p> So eventually we packed our bags , waved adios to the tree frogs and toucans then moved to Queensland , Australia which was always plan B. <p> It 's a much safer , sensible choice and while part of me still yearns for the adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my kids go to a good school 40 weeks of the year , six hours a day , five days a week leaving me guilt free time to write . <p> I 'd love to go back to Costa Rica one day and although it did n't work out I 'm very glad we made that brave move . <p> In fact , I 'd do it all over again and who knows , maybe when the kids have left school we will . <h> More Resources for- Costa Rica <p> Have you ever moved somewhere you 've never been before ?

If you want to live , work , or retire in C.R. do your own research as to what you 're standards of living are and go on one or two trips there , many American English Speaking Corps. are there if you need work . Social Services are outstanding.Become a Citizen by marrying a Tica , that 's more for me since I 'm single = Bad part , bad road conditions and slow transportationbut as a backpacker I Love that . <p> Its acctually Tico not Tica and they are the true native " costaricans " since a big part of the population is acctually peoples from surrounding countries .

I live in Ontario , Canada at the moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there yet ? <p> Jan <p> 8 months ago <p> Hi Jan ( great name ) I moved to Costa Rica 4 months ago from England , if there is anything you would like to know or I can advise you in any way , <p> Breanna <p> 1 year ago <p> Hola Tica , <p> I 'm from Canada and just got back from a vacation to Costa Rica ! I 'm looking into moving to CR as I fell in love ! Would love to talk more with you ! <p> Jo-Ann <p> 1 year ago <p> I am a Canadian living in small town Ontario . We are seniors looking to find a winter home and return to Ontario for summer months . Apparently there is an area frequented by Canadian tourists/ex-pats and I 'm wondering if you know where that is ? Also , any information on making a move like this is welcome . My partner is 68 and I 'm 62 . We would have to sell the farm and a house to make a permanent move . That will take time and give us the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if it would work for us . Right now we are both in good health but I am curious about the quality of health care and other amenities . I like my " creature comforts " . Thanks for any advice you may be able to share . Also welcome additional website referrals or books . Regards , Jo-Ann <p> Jodi <p> 3 years ago <p> can you recommend a great school and its location ? trying to transfer there . <p> Hi ! Actually , " Tico " is the popular name people use for referring to Costarrican . This is because in Spanish , diminutives are formed with -ito at the end of a noun , for example : peque+o ( small ) , peque+ITO ( diminutive ) , but Costarrican people use to finish this diminutives by adding -itico to the original word . So , " peque+ito " becomes " peque+itico " , and that 's why we are known as TiCOS , coz we are the ones who finish the noun in TICOS And yes , TICO is a male and TICA is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that scorpions in the house and bats in the toilet ended up on the list of positives about Costa Rica . That would have been enough to send us packing right there . <p> We are planning on moving to CR soon . I am worried about the scorpions . I know they are not dangerous , but YUCK . I know they come into peoples houses all the time . If you live in a condo in Escazu will they get into the condo ? Does any one know ? <p> I live in Costa Rica , and Ive never seen a scorpion or a Toucan ( just in the zoo ) in my life because i live in the city , and they 're usually in the Beach areas like Puntarenas or Guanacaste , Costa Rica is not a Jungle where bugs , scorpions or Toucans are everywhere ! ! But obviously if you live in Guanacaste for example you 'll have to deal with them <p> I decided to move to London before I had actually visited there . I did have to do a trip there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  count that , as I had already decided to go = Costa Rica sounds pretty good actually , and well , you never know how you feel about a place before you 've actually lived there . <p> Very interesting . I know a family that is looking to move to Central America and they are considering Costa Rica for schooling options ( 2 kids ) . So the bit about the schools was especially interesting , will definitely share the article . Told them to go and visit first , just look around and spend some time before making a decision . <p> Hi Vasco , some areas have more expats and better schools . Its much easier if you 're kids are younger but my oldest was almost ready for high school so that was part of our problem : ) Thanks so much for sharing the post . Its great to connect with you here . <p> Do n't  do it ! We left Canada in July of 2012 to live in Costa Rica And I regret it every day ! We have 3 kids , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education system is ranked in the top 10 , the tico system here is terrible Their MEP education is not internationally accredited And the American schools are a joke . <p> Hello ! I live in CRC , in fact , I am from CRC . Its obvious that I 'm not going to speak bad about my own country , so yes , education system here is not the best one . But is not a general problem . There are a bunch of good schools . I think that depends of the plans your children have for the future . If they want to stay here , we have universities with a diverse careers . On the other hand , if they plan to study a professional career abroad , then they would have to study in the schools that offer the international degree . We have both private and public schools you choose in that case . Palmares Bilingual High School is one of the public ones and The European School is one of the privates ones ! <p> Lou Langrish <p> 6 years ago <p> Hi ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in England , now live in New Zealand . Volunteered in CR earlier this year and loved it , I agree with your comments . I love it there so much but not sure I could live there ALL YEAR ROUND ? I have a website about CR it would be gerat if you could check it out I would like to link you if that 's ok with you ? On the links page about moving to CR and in the E-Book I am selling ? <p> You had 18 months of costa rican experience , it is something that most people will consider a successful move anyway . Also , at the end you made a good choice , eduction is really important and it leaves you free to make such excellent posts something we all bloggers want . <p> Personally , i would have never been able to get enough courage to pack everything up and go to a different location/country and settle down there . However , i hope to make a Costa Rica travel some day , perhaps a long tour , but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private schools keep your kids from 7 am to 2:15 pm others from 8 am to 4:00 pm . BUT these schools are located in the Central Valley of Costa Rica unfortunately not there at Rural Areas or other provinces where everybody wants to live ( seeing Tucans , Monkies and Nature ! ) . Near rural areas of Costa Rica the schools are public and they have only basic services , since they do n't  receive some help from the Government , except there is not any payment are free . <p> Hi RG , great to hear from you . Yes my kids were at a public school there was no other option which went from 8am-11.30am . But it was often shut . We went for the Costa Rican experience and we got it so I appreciate that and it was free : ) My kids will remember it forever ! <p> I thought Costa Rica would be very touristy , but if you make a little effort , you can find some places that are n't  very saturated with visitors . Its still an amazing country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi Alexander , the locals are a friendly and welcoming bunch . The children were accepted at local schools with very little spanish . But they picked it up : ) That 's terrible in France . How are immigrant children supposed to learn French if they cant go to kindy ? ! <p> Hi ! ! I will traveling to Costa Rica in a weeks now . I have traveled before but this is the first time I 'm going alone . I do n't  plan to travel extensively throughout the country , just San Jose , Manuel Antonio , and the Caribbean side . Since I am staying in Hostels and do n't  know much about traveling alone , Is it wise to bring a backpack and a luggage roller ? Or Just a backpack ? Thank YOU ! <p> We are looking to relocate and want to know where you were exactly . We live in the Fla . Keys with our 3 kids and 3 dogs . All of our kids are teens . We have no clue where to start ! ! ! Please help us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be near the ocean and moutainsect , ect . Most important is the kids and socializing ! ! ! Thank You ! ! ! <p> Hi ! We are also researching and planning to move full time to CR with our 3 kids 3 , 8 and 11 . I am also originally from Key West , but currently live in VA = We have visited CR 3 times in the last year , including visiting Escuela Verde twice ( thought it was adorable and love the two owners ) . I would love to connect with anyone else in the same boat either planning or already doing . I am worried about the kids adjusting and getting a quality education so they can go to college and having friends . I would love any advice and input ! <p> Hi Annabel , I loved your writing . We are planning to move from Hungary to Costa Rica with our kids for a year or two . I have been searching the web for information about the relocation ( e.g. where to move , how to find a flat/job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children into school there .. ) . How can I get in touch with you privately ? I would like to know absolutely everything about this country = Andrea <p> Hi Carlos , I 'm so glad you wrote this . I agree that it was really disrespectful for them to call people nuts for wanting to live in Costa Rica . It is also disrespectful to evaluate Costa Rica as an " experience " or " adventure " rather than as a place where they are guests and having local resources shared with them . The funny thing is , their own countries are a mess . That is why they are trying to colonize again . Lori <p> I never check this web page . So sorry , I just realize about some mistakes in my past writing . <p> Thanks for your comment , I still believe in nice and respectful people like you . Yes , I ironic those people are all the time complaining about this , that , here , there , so , if they do n't  like why they don not leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this big problems ? . <p> I lived in Mexico for more than 10 yrs . The best thing about where I lived was most Americans cant handle the lifestyle and attitude changes . They spend a lot of energy trying to make the place the way they want it , and in the end , go home , complaining the whole way . These are the type I would avoid normally , so the country did the " weeding out " for me . Unfortunately , Mexicos problems , inextricably linked to the US , are beginning to invade my favorite sea side village . <p> Hello carlos , I have a brother that lives in El Salvador that wants to relocate to CR with his girlfriend he is a fluent english and spanish speaker what place would be best to find a job and rent a home ? Thank you <p> I have my auto in panama , and would drive it costa rica some time in Nov , or Dec. for vacation and look around , i also have some family members that have live there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i live in South Carolina USA.Iam retired . <p> On a monthly basis , my mind starts wondering all over the globe of where to live next . I just stumbled across your post today ! My kids are still primary school age so we may have more options but like you , education is very important to us . Do you know anything about Escuela Verde ? I would love to hear your thoughts . Thanks very much ! LONG ... <p> This is so crazy b/c I just last year quit my corporate job and started my own , rather successful business . My husband is still working full time , in the rat race , great salary , lot of demand on his time . We have visited Costa Rica- Uvita actually- 2 years ago . We stayed at Oxygen Jungle Villas- LOVED it- still my favorite vacation . We have talked about relocating for 2 years and I 'm just at that point . I want somewhere untouched by all the commercialism , I want a laid back , more simple life , I want to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , I want tennis courts for my daughter . We do have one ( 1 ) 8 year old- almost 9 year old daughter . We are ready to sell everything and go <p> I have lived in CR . It is a wonderful place , but it is no place to raise a family by American standards .. I have seen many families sell everything and move to the area where we lived only to return home disillusioned , broke and angry in 6 months . The schools are n't  great and the kids have way too much freedom . There is a lot of easy access to drugs and there is n't the stigma about premarital sex that one would expect in a predominantly Catholic country , lots of young unwed mothers Also , I hope you are independently wealthy , since you ca n't work in Costa Rica as a foreigner , Lots have tried to make a way , but you just cant do itthe economy wont support your endeavors . Sorry to be a kill joy , but it is the truth . It is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life for you and your kids . In the end the only way you can protect and raise your kids by American standards is to keep them out of the Tico culture , which will isolate and frustrate them . There is no such thing as paradise while you may gain in beauty and lack of commercialism , you stand to lose a great deal more in the quality of life you can offer your kids . Costa Rica is beautiful and unique but it is no place to raise your kids . <p> Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences Elle . I 'm sure it will help people to undertake careful research when making decisions on whether to move to CR . I think everyone has different perspectives and values so decisions must be made in accordance to that . I think living in a foreign country is indeed challenging and can be lonely , but it also can be very rewarding . If CR is not the right place then I hope people will consider some other countries that perhaps might be a better fit . Its always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So true .. Ive been in Costa Rica from U.S. for the past 6 months and have tried MANY times to connect with other fellow citizens who live here and homeschool , just as I do . They are unfriendly , and never respond to my messages . Everyone is doing their own thing , and do n't  care . While the Ticos are great , friendly people , the culture in general is very shocking . The tico women are really not that friendly , the man are . <p> This is my opinion which is at least depending on your preferences I honestly feel that there are less tourist sights in Costa Rica than there are in U.S.A. ( if necessary to point out I actually reside in Canada . ) To give you a better perspective let 's supposed that if you enjoy large shopping complexes , visiting or even residing in a high rise building(s) and theme parks your " best bet " is the U.S.A. so therefore I 'm doubtful that you 'll find places like these in Costa Rica but however I 'm sure that there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I lived in Costa Rica for a year with my Tico husband . As beautiful as the country is , we were tired of fearing for our safety all the time . We moved back to my home in Australia and we feel so at peace not having to worry anymore . We are still very nostalgic about CR and look forward to visiting again , but to live there , its not for everyone . <p> I am originally from Costa Rica , but been in th US for many years . My husband is a physician and we 'd like to retire in Costa Rica , somewhere in the Central Valley . We are interested in meeting expats who have chosen Costa Rica as their home . So they can share their experinces with us . Can e-mail us at email protected <p> Hello , I was wondering if anyone can help me . I 'm thinking of moving to CR and commuting to Houston for my job as a flight Attendant . How do I go about obtaining residency and where is the best place to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth to airport ? I want a nice 2 bedroom apt . <p> I 'm coming to Costa Rica next week and I 'm looking for some information about CR . Please contact me through my email if you 're still interested about sharing some information about your lovely country : email protected <p> Thanks for sharing your candid impressions on life in Costa Rica . Many people have the impression that it is overrun by tourists and expats as you say . But that 's really not the case . Yes , there are expats here and even some enclaves where expats dominate . But for the most part , expats blend into the scenery so to speak . The ones that stay are able to integrate into the community and learn a new lifestyle . <p> Awwww the title of this post was like a stab in the heart ! Glad it redeemed itself . = I lived a year in CR and miss it so , so much . I lived away from it all When a backpacker sends me a message , " It is SO expensive here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and am always right . But this post was great . Made me think of some lovely memories . = = <p> We love it here and are thinking of relocating here permanently but of course every place is suited to some and not others . So were going to do a trial year , we have had great experiences whilst on holiday but appreciate its different when you live there full time . Very interesting piece of writing and nice to see different peoples opinions . Were going to look for a rental villa and see how we get on . very interesting and also useful writing thank you <p> Old post but excellent points . Very touristy was also our first impression , and expensive , but there are upsides . We found a nice place from Manuel Antonio for work exchange : National Park Backpackers hostel . <p> My wife and I moved to Costa Rica two years ago . After just three weeks in the country we found ourselves wrapped with duct tape and laying on the kitchen floor for two days after being robbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning lady arrived to save us . I 'd never been so thirsty in my life . <p> Is worth to be mentioned that if you did n't  graduate from a state university in computer sciences then you-re screwed , you wo n't find a job that pays you enough for living as a citizen is supposed to live , the over-priced land is reaching more that ridiculous prices , the " social " medical care is in the dumpster now , job are disguised exploitation , capitalism is taking over , wall street broker wannabes are running this country , labor is in a shortage , call centers are the new sweat shops , the XXI century lower-layer of neo industrial revolution , we are the most pathetic , wrecked shameful inhabitants of America , poverty all around , we still buy hand mirrors from developed countriesfuck this country ! <p> I actually live in Canada move from Costa Rica and I have to say it was quite a dissapoinment even for my husband to come back from Costa Rica He was in Costa Rica many years and coming back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything again and move out of Canada Missing Costa Rica so much .. ! Love my beaches. ! And about the school systems maybe should n't blame it on the education system but more on the student. ! I studied in Costa Rica and I speak 6 languages and got my degree in surgery. ! Which as been approved in Canada . Wont be using it here. ! Thank God . A good student will be good anywhere a bad student , will fail everywhere. ! <p> we visited costa rica last year and I still cant get over this amazing peaceful country . I would love to check if anyone who live there has older kids and what areas better to look for few years relocation . Ages 14 and 12 for a bilingual school . <p> Hi Carlos , I 'm just finding this article and your offers of help . Ive been to cr 5 times in the last 7 years and am enchanted . I 'm a massage therapist , my husband is a graphic designer/artist and I have an almost 5 year old daughter who we will homeschool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country we 've loved so much . We 've only traveled to the guanacaste and Nosara in nicoya . The advice we 've received from other ex pats was to come and travel and find the right fit . We both loved playa grande in the guanacaste as its beachy , beautiful , low key and mildly touristy . I speak a little Spanish and my daughter is learning . My email is email protected if you find this response and have some input for me . Pura vida ! <p> Paz , please look at the comment I posted . I go into detail about my educational experience in Costa Rica . I was 11-13 when I studied there . I attended Teocali , a bilingual private school in Liberia . http : **28;1207;TOOLONG <p> I lived in Playas Del Coco and took a bus to Teocali in Liberia though . You do n't  necessarily have to live in Liberia to go there . A lot of beach town kids go there . They even had buses from Tamarindo which was like 45 mins to an hour <p> I lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am now 19 . It was the greatest experience of my life . I am insulted that you thought the educational system was n't top notch . They actually have a better education than the U.S. All students are required to take English as a second language , and in their high school years they pick a third language . Definitely do not attend an English private school there because you will get the American education system there . I personally went to Teocali in Liberia . It is a private bilingual school . All levels have half their day in English and the other half in Spanish . In the 7,8,9,10,11 levels you take on a third language for a couple hours once a week . When I attended it was French . Part of the curriculum involved a course called analytical thinking where you picked up quite a bit of Latin vocabulary . I learned Spanish very quickly and the teachers were phenomenal . Gym classes involved swimming in an outdoor pool and playing basketball in an open gym outdoors . They have tests you have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SATs and you are better prepared for these tests . I learned college math in seventh grade while there . I did not see that math again in the U.S. until I took an advanced placement calculus in high school . When I returned to the U.S. for 8th grade , I was placed in advanced classes and received high school credit . I believe this was all due to the education I received from Teocali . I have a close friend who went to Country Day School of Guanacaste , which is an English school , and he did not come out with the same level of education that I did . So , apparently you did n't  do enough research into which schools your children should have attended . The public schools are good , but a lot of people who attend there do not plan to receive secondary education so the attitude is spread amongst the students and teachers . Also the University of Costa Rica is free to attend if I remember correctly . The educational system is Costa Rica is phenomenal . I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiences from Costa Rica and the language has made me very marketable . <p> I loved reading your input . I am very , impressed with what you learned in their school system . Let 's face it : a majority of schools outside of the U.s. and Canada are way more advanced which is why we are looking to putting our son in a school that is elsewhere . I am Canadian and proud to be , except that the way they are teaching here is completely lazy . Even lazier than when I was a kid ( I 'm 32 now ) . <p> My husband is currently working full time from home and we have 2 toddlers and an infant on the way . We want to take advantage of this time and move to a totally different place for a year . Any advice on moving to Costa Rica . Is it possible to move there for a year without a work visa ? <p> Hello , I am looking to move to Costa Rica . I have 3 children and 17 , 15 , 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island again . I have lived in Puerto Rico and loved the culture but it was very expensive and returned to the U.S. I have considered Costa Rica because I have heard it is affordable and a great place to live . I was wondering if there is an area that would be better for someone like us that are both fluent in Spanish and English to live in that is kind of in between . I want to have some contact with people that can speak English but I do not want to miss out be emerged into the Spanish community and culture . I am not concerned about my older children because they are homeschooled but my 9 year old has learning disabilities and I am wondering if submerging her into a new language might be to difficult . I am reading mixed reviews on the schooling . I agree that the American school system is not the best . I would want her in public school , I just wonder about special education ? Any suggestions ? <p> I graduated from high school in California and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Costaricans who also attended various universities in Germany.Their Bachillerato was accepted while my HSDiploma required required extra classes in math , chemistry , physics and a few other subjects.DOES THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING ? . By the way Im costaricam . <p> we too are thinking of picking up and living elsewhere . My husband is from costa rica but I am not sure that 's where I want to be . We too have 4 kids still at home between the ages of 3 and 16 . We have talked about Australia as well but when I looked it up , there are all kinds of categories we must fall into in order to live there legally . How did you do it ? <p> Hi therewe are a family of five ( 3 kids , 8 , 6 and 3 ) we would love to connect and figure out your work situationwe are thinking we might liketo go to CR for a few years .. currently in Canada .. my husb has his heart set on Tamarindo ! ! ! he is a surfer .. need i say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about retiring early and moving to a country where my dollar will go a long way . Live modestly and in a beautiful , warm country where the people are kind and the culture inviting . I hear that the medical and technological infrastructure are all top notch but I also hear many divergent opinions on living there . I understand that the logical next step is a visit but I was hoping to have some comments from you kind folks on what I can expect , what to watch out for and if the country is as amazing a place to live as some people are telling me . Thank you so much ! <p> I do recommend you to come visit , check it out and rent a place for a few months . I suggest visiting Lake Arenal area and contact the people from teamrealtycr.com . They are the only trustworthy people I know that can help you out with very valuable information . <p> I loved this review . I love your adventurousness and open mind . My husband and I are looking to live abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rica too and read they had excellent education . But , reading what you had said about the schooling for your children makes me question , what was it about the schooling that was n't appealing ? I would love to hear . Thanks so much for sharing ! <p> Being a Costa Rican I can assure you the schools here are good . In general the private schools are better than some public schools . However the Costarican education system has one of the best educational program called Colegio cientifico " I went to a public elementary school and high school , then I got in the University of Costa Rica ( UCR ) , one of the tops universities in Latin America , and finally I got my master degree from University of Virginia . My conclusion from both univeristies is that I found UCR much harder . <p> I mean , are you my twin ? ! We are going through the exact and I mean exact story at the moment . Living in Gisborne , selling and trucking the family to CR with plan b being Noosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences in CR . We 've travelled a bit of Central already but now we have two children in tow . Glad I found this ! xx <p> I understand that Costa Rica is a busy place run by expects and the prices high and its too busy with tourist but its a great place to live like you said when you are a traveler you are always a traveler . I 'm like you I have been traveling the world with my wife and my two babies for years and its hard to embrace at first foreign lands and their cultures . You know that when you get into places where the tourists dominate then its a tough place to live . I am sure you love it there . How often you see a toucan anywhere else . Very rarely and for that reason I love it and loved being there . Its a great country and I enjoyed reading your post . <p> Hi Marc ! Well , ( here ) the touristic places tends to be more expensive . Local owners are n't  dumb . They expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over-pay for " basic luxuries " . Ask to the locals for a better , more tasty and cultural place to eat , rather than a " re-known place " for tourist . If you 're on a budget , know this : To give " tips " here , is not a " social-obligatory-stigma " . The payment of the salary of the restaurants waitress , covers all the working-legal obligations . Is " culturally aceptable " just saying thanks to the waitress for their service . To give a " tip " is only up to you ! <p> I just moved to escazu Costa Rica with my husband and 2 kids .. so far we are loving it , it was a last minute decision and so far all has worked out except the schooling for our kids , we are from Canada and here we are looking at lighthouse private school , we went there and got all the information about the schooling and they want my 7 year old to start second grade all over again as they are saying that he is behind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade knows .. I 'm not happy about this and was wondering if anything similar to this happen to other parents . <p> I would worry about that . It happened to me when my parents divorced and I had to start off at a lower level . If you go back to Canada say at high school level they will have to write a test to see what level they are functioning at My own daughters went from french school to english school and a school board test had to be given . Education is education where ever its from . It all catches up in university ! What made you choose the area where you are living . I 'm vacationing to Cost Rica with my daughter April 9th we are from Toronto . Regards Lynn <p> I am looking to may by move to Costa Rica , but I am unsure , becours , no spanish speaking.From the USA with German background . Where do most of USA and Canadian people live in CR ? ? ? Thanks for a replayCheers Dagmar <p> Hello , I live most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I had 3 children 21 , 15 and my 12 . All speak fluent English a little Spanish . My husband was diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago know he is been diagnosed with terminal cancer but I believed in a God that he can make a miracle that 's my believing , and we thinking to move to Costa Rica we think probably will be better for my husband . He is originally from Siguatepeque Honduras a nice small town . But we will like to move to Costa Rica because has better resources and that weather and all that beautiful green an good oxygen. , any suggestions and if you think we making that right decision please all references will help thank you . <p> Ive been to Costa Rica several times for work and always added a few extra days for sightseeing . Always thought of one place I would want to live , If I could . But is it possible to retire in Costa Rica on a very modest pension of $1,600 per month ? I know that housing is a huge problem there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like me . When i visited CR few months back . I was astonished with its beauty and was really thinking to stay there . Your post again have make up my mind and will surely try to fulfill my dream in my lifetime . <p> Hi there , my husband and I are thinking about moving to Costa Rica in 5 years and I was researching the education system and what I read said that it was the best in Latin America . So I 'm curious what you did n't  like about it ? ? I would love your opinion as you would have first hand knowledge of it = thank you ! <p> Could you explain more please on how you managed to move so freely between all those countries and how you were then able to move to Australia ? That would be much appreciated . Did it take a while and cost a lot of money to apply for work Visas or do you naturally have rights to work in NZ and Oz etc due to family ? <p> Ok you guys can you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa Rica l am on an aged pension about $400 a week I have a defacto wife from Cambodia . We both love wild life you have their . We have no wish to live in a city we are country green people who love rainforest and want a simple life . Any info please . Yours faithfully . Richard and Then . <p> Looking to move to Grecia or Atenas . I have two sons ages 10 &amp; 11yo . Having a hard time finding an English school or mostly English . Our Spanish is not were it needs to be ( yet ) . Any suggestion ? I 'm willing to look at other regions to find the right school for now and move later after we all become a bit more fluent in Spanish . Thanks ! <p> I love Costa Rica . I was surprised to see how polite were the people in 2006 . I do not know if this paradise changed.I loved San Jose . And the nature around with parks and waterfalls . The colors . The people . Everything was amazing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Jose " me encanta " because the peoples positive attitude . <p> if you people do n't  like my country feel free never to come back what you all do n't  understand is the fact that we do n't  like getting infected with your natzy ideas we like who we are and since lots of you have been moving here the crime , drugs and everything related to it have move in to are land not even counting the fact that you people have been kicking all are people out of the states for the past 20 years treating us like shit , , , i lived there for a long time so I know get the fuck out <p> Hi !

Being the Sunday of a long weekend , and knowing how popular Aussie beaches get , we wanted to get their early to secure a parking spot and to beat the midday heat . <p> But what we 've discovered , and now love about the south coast beaches , is that they are n't  heavily populated like Sydney and north coast beaches , and they are n't  surrounded by over development . <p> Hyams Beach is a quiet beachside town ( population of just 290 ) with no monstrous apartment blocks shading the beach by midday like at Surfers Paradise .

Experience sunrise in the bush , " Sundowners " ( South Africas version of Happy Hour ) in wine country or at the beach and no shortage of over-the-top luxury hotels and restaurants . <p> The hard part is choosing where to go in South Africa for your honeymoon ! <p> I recommend spending the bulk of your honeymoon in and around Cape Town as well as including a trip to Kruger Park for a safari . <p> I have 7 reasons that will ensure that wedded bliss ensues on your South African honeymoon . <h> 1 . The Cape Peninsula <p> Cape Town is one of the countrys most beautiful cities . Its unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflowing with natural beauty and wildlife . <p> Spend a day taking in Cape Towns stunning landscapes in and around Table Mountain National Park . <p> Hike to the top of Table Mountain and admire the sweeping views ( or take a cable car to save time and energy ) , explore the Cape of Good Hope , soak in the panoramic views at Cape Point and even check out an African penguin colony at Boulders Beach . <p> African Penguins at Boulders Beach <h> 2 . The Garden Route <p> Knysna image via Shutterstock.com <p> Take your first road trip as a couple along The Garden Route , a stretch of road along South Africas southeastern coast . <p> The drive takes at least a few days but there are excellent stops along the way in some amazing towns and nature reserves . <p> You 'll find secluded bays , stunning flora and fauna and tons of wildlife along the way . Keep your eyes peeled for humpback whales and dolphins that often swim close to shore near Plettenberg Bay . <p> Oenophiles will also rejoice at Bramon Wine Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eat Your Heart Out <p> Whether you 're in the bush or in one of the countrys major cities like Cape Town , there is a flourishing foodie revolution and an impressive level of culinary sophistication . <p> Be sure to try South African specialties like biltong and a braai ( a unique style of barbecue ) and other local delicacies like Cape Malay cuisine . <p> I highly recommend taking a cooking class together in Bo-Kaap ( famous for all the rainbow-colored buildings ) . Do a class with Faldela Tolker , who invites you into her home and teaches you not just how to cook , but also about the countrys history . <p> These skills are an excellent souvenir you 'll enjoy for years to come . ( Cooking with Love 072 483 4040 or email protected ) <p> Once you 've mastered the art of cooking , make some reservations at the hot restaurants in Cape Town . At the top of my list is a visit to Pot Luck Club , a unique tapas-style restaurant located in the Biscuit Mill . You 'll experience expansive views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trendy small plates . <p> Pot Luck Club <p> The city 's most exclusive restaurant , The Test Kitchen is nearly impossible to snag a reservation so reserve a table as far in advance as you can . Trust me , you want to experience its thoughtfully prepared tasting menu expertly paired with amazing South African wine . <h> 4 . Get to know South Africas story <p> No trip to South Africa is complete without learning about its people and understanding the history . <p> Take a trip to Robben Island to see where Nelson Mandela was held as a political prisoner for nearly 20 years . You 'll learn about the experience first hand from guides who are former inmates . <p> If you want to learn more I highly recommend signing up for a tour with Coffee Beans Routes . This local company offers a tour called the Revolution Route where you can learn about the lesser-known players in the South African revolution . <p> Many couples also want to visit the Townships ( the living areas created for non-whites during the apartheid ) . Many tours leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into someones home . <p> To avoid a situation like this , I recommend booking with Uthando South Africa , which promotes responsible tourism . <p> Uthando introduces visitors to residents who work on community development projects .

The Cape Winelands <p> Incredible View from Delaire Graff <p> The Cape Winelands are only about an hour away from Cape Town . I highly recommend that honeymooners take at least a few days to unwind and relax in this stunning part of the country . <p> There are several gorgeous regions filled with many of the worlds most beautiful hotels . I recommend visiting both Franshhoek a quaint region with lots of family-owned vineyards and French influences , and also Stellenbosch the most popular and lively region . <p> I highly recommend a visit to M+reson , La Petite Ferme , and Haute Cabri+re vineyards .

If you have more modern tastes , you 'll enjoy Delaire Graff Hotel . <p> La Residence <p> The Cape Winelands are also home to some of the citys most amazing restaurants ! <p> If you 're looking though to unwind and relax just the two of you , you must go to Hout Bay , which is a sleepy , romantic getaway minutes from Cape Town . <p> Tintswalo Atlantic just might be the most romantic hotel Ive ever stayed in deep soaking tubs , waterfront rooms and a romantic restaurant to boot ! <h> 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even the least outdoorsy person will feel in touch with nature in Africa . <p> There is nothing more romantic than driving through the bush and witnessing African wildlife in its natural habitat at dawn .

Sabi Sand , Thornybush , and Manyeleti are some of the best . <p> You 'll usually experience closer encounters with the animals in private reserves since drivers ( as long as they 're being respectful ) have a little more leeway to go off the beaten path . <p> Planning to travel soon ?

It 's a 17-hectare botanic garden displaying one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 300 species of palm , many rare and threatened , and includes most Australian palms . <p> I only visited Palmetum briefly on the Military Tour. - I loved the tranquility and jungle feel of the park and especially the memorial to the victims of the Black Hawk Tragedy that happened in Townsville in 1996 . <h> Kissing Point <p> The Kissing Point Fort has been turned into a lovely area for the community to enjoy with walking tracks and views out over Magnetic Island and Cleveland Bay . There are plenty of old gun replacement bunkers and tunnels here for the military history buffs . A new boardwalk that runs around to nearby Rowes Bay is now open . <h> Billabong Wildlife Sanctuary <p> If you 're looking for an interactive wildlife experience with Australian animals then head out to the Billabong Wildlife Sanctuary about 20 minutes outside of Townsville . It 's a tranquil tropical bush setting by the billabong . <p> There are interactive wildlife shows all day and bring your camera as you can watch turtle races , pat a dingo , see some croc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Magnetic Island <p> It 's well worth taking the short 25-minute ferry across to a small island full of wildlife , stunning beaches , hiking tracks and the chance to pause time for awhile and just kick back and relax . You can read all about our time on Maggie here . <h> Texas Longhorns <p> Only a two-hour drive from Townsville is the Texas Longhorns experience just outside of Charters Towers . We found it fascinating and we loved the hosts Mick and Lynda . They were so hospitable and fun and are truly passionate about their cattle and showcasing it and the stories with their guests . <h> Places to eat in Townsville <h> Longboard Bar &amp; Grill <p> A must-visit bar for views , beers , mojitos and awesome finger food is Longboards on The Strand . Very American in flavour , Longboards is a place we hope to return to . We have n't had buffalo wings as good since we lived in the States . ( They were much cheaper back there too ! ) <h> Juliettes <p> Our local friend from North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an institution for gelato and coffee . The ice cream comes in many weird and wonderful flavours . There 's a cafe and a smaller kiosk along the Strand . <h> Cbar <p> Great water views and good coffee to be had at Cbar . We did n't  stop here for lunch , but we enjoyed the raisin toast with our cuppa . <h> The Brewery <p> If there 's a brewery in town you 'll typically find us there , and The Townsville Brewery did n't  disappoint . The building itself is impressive and full of character , its in the old post office , and whilst we did n't  eat here we dropped in for a beer and really enjoyed our couple of pints of local craft beer . <h> City Lane <p> City Lane is a newly opened laneway in the city centre , and Townsvilles first creative precinct with funky bars and eateries , including my favourite , the Paleo Cafe . <h> That place on Sturt <p> That place on Sturt was just up the road from our apartment in Townsville and right next to the cinema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sneak a couple of raw , healthy chocolate bliss balls every time I ducked in there . <h> Tips from our Facebook community <p> Chelsea Sutherland <p> The Balcony restaurant in Flinders St is really , really good for breakfast/brunch/lunch <p> The new area up the other end of The Strand Jezzine has just opened and is a gorgeous new public space with parklands , interpretive signage and info about the history of the site and a boardwalk that connects The Strand around to Rowes Bay . <p> Jackie Sullivan <p> I lived there for 10 years so have a few suggestions to where the locals go , which includes the Mingela Pub on a Sunday , Alligator Creek , crystal creek , yongala wreck ( if you scuba dive ) , tea rooms at Harvey range road ( sorry ca n't remember the name ) , mingala rodeo if its on , fishing , military museum at Jezzine barracks , good pub lunch or dinner at centenary hotel in pimlico . And if at all possible , a romantic dinner for two at Wayne &amp; Adeles garden of eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , great pub right on the river plus massive pools , all free , pool not pub ! Paluma for a day trip , ride down to Pallerenda for a unique view of maggy and Townsville . The Australia hotel across the bridge , great pub ! <h> Places to stay in Townsville <p> We stayed in two separate Townsville properties during our visit . The first couple of nights was at the Grand Hotel and the location was very central , right on Palmer Street surrounded by several good cafes and restaurants and an easy walk to the CBD . <p> Then we stayed at first ever Airbnb property , in the centre of the city and easy to walk to shops and restaurants and being right near the cinema was a bonus with two children . The bus stopped right across the road which made it very easy to get to the Strand although its also walking distance . <p> For more places to stay in Townsville , check out our partner , Booking.com- <h> The Facts <p> Townsville is a two-hour flight from Brisbane and a four-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tourism Queensland .

You should be proud of your girls they behaved so well on the day of the tour you have yourself a wonderful tomorrow and every day there after <p> We run a B&amp;B at Alligator Creek and it always amazes me that people have such a poor view of Townsville I had no expectations that I would be remotely interested in Townsville which , as you found is TOTALLY unjustified . SO often we get people booking with us for one night having decided that there is nothing to do then they leave feeling so upset that they had n't  allowed for a longer stay . I think that one problem is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as you discovered we really live in a very underestimated and totally gorgeous area . <p> Wednesday evening , Twilight Sail from the Townsville Yacht Club in Plume St . Chance your arm , come down about 5 pm , put your name on the whiteboard and hopefully you will get placed on a boat for a pleasant course race with music and beer ( byo ) and a chance to mix with the locals . If you do n't  get aboard you can always stop for a beer etc and the food is great with the best eating view in town ( in my opinion ) . Enjoy our town ! <p> Wow ! Must say you had an amazing family vacation at Townville . It is always great to know experience of visiting a new destination . You planned your trip very well , enjoying a mix of all from wildlife to army side visit . Thanks for sharing it !

Keen to do a return trip to the Gold Coast soon though , lots of new rides to check out ! <p> Its always difficult choosing a theme park to visit , but this post is a great round up giving some useful ideas and information . Ill be coming back to this one when we head over to the Gold Coast again . <p> This is a popular topic of debate with the Candy family ! Mr. Candy loves the water parks but I find it hard to choose .

My kids are really active and they played and played and played there my fave were the polar bears , amazing to watch underwater . 
@@21820823 @1820823/ <p> Another great thing about visiting DC is that all of the Smithsonian Institution museums ( including the zoo ) are free ! <h> Best Neighbourhood to Explore in Washington DC <p> A great area many tourists miss is Georgetown , because there 's no metro access . But this historic neighborhood is the most posh in the city , with stunning homes , great restaurants and the best shopping in town . <h> Getting Around DC <p> The metro is great for getting around town quickly and easily . I personally think its easy to understand , but I 'm biased . <p> Parts of DC are walkable , but not all of course . The main tourist area around the National Mall is easy to navigate , but can be grueling on a hot summers day . <h> Where to Eat in DC <p> After years of suffering , DC is finally becoming a foodie town ! Some of my favorite lower cost restaurants include ; Good Stuff Eatery , We The Pizza , Bens Chili Bowl and Moby Dick House of Kabob . <p> On the higher end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Little Washington , Minibar , Vidalia and Bistro Bis . <h> Where to Drink in DC <p> For the best beer selection in town RFD Washington in Chinatown has everyone beat ; they feature thousands of breweries from around the world . <h> Best Place to Drink with the Locals in Washington D.C. <p> Since DC is a political town , there 's no shortage of watering holes .

It inspired me to get back to DC . I live less than three hours away , but havnt been there for a few years . My tip would be to use public transportation , like the MARC train , to get into the city . During the the summer , especially on weekends , traffic can be horrible . <p> My boyfriend and I moved to DC in July 2010 after we graduated . It truly is a great city with tons of free attractions/shows etc . The Kennedy center has free shows every day of the year at 6pm usually these are music based performances but just a little while ago they had a circus themed week . Also the Topaz Hotel by Dupont Circle has a free comedy show every Thursday at 8pm they let newbies perform along with more established comedians its a great show ! <p> I just love Washington D.C.

We stayed in Adams Morgan the first time , just outside of Georgetown the second time , and in Arlington the third time . We took the Metro every time and it is SUPER easy to figure out ! We visited museums , Arlington cemetery , did a ride along with the Metro Police , etc . It was just a blast every time we went ! Another great side trip is walking around Alexandria , VA . Beautiful city and beautiful old homes ! DC is definitely underrated as a vacation spot ! <p> Great guide to DC , even two years later !

Simply outside the Smithsonian there are a portion of the loveliest regions in the city . The U.S. Botanic Garden is a short distance from the historical centers. 
@@21820824 @1820824/ <h> Help ! Asians Keep Stealing My Baby <h> If you are travelling to Thailand with a baby you are going to get a lot of attention . <p> If your baby has blond hair and blue eyes , and to the local Asian population , looks like an angel , you will be swamped . <p> I say Asians , and not just Thai , as Japanese , Chinese and Koreans also took a liking to our children . <p> So much , that they kept stealing them . <p> Stealing them to look and stare and take photos . Craig and I found it bizarre and hilarious at the same time . Kalyra thought they were plain weird . <p> " Imagine if you were walking down the street in Australia and someone suddenly picked up your child for a cuddle , or blatantly took a photo without permission . Fists would be flying and someone would be arrested with accusations of pedophilia . " <p> There was nothing sinister about the Asians stealing our babies . They were just purely enamored with my little angels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened and suspicious . <p> I thought it was wonderful the girls received so much love and attention . <p> I was talking with my Mum and Dad before going to Thailand about how teachers in Australia wo n't cuddle children , not because they do n't  want to , but the " rules " say not to . <h> Its not safe in our paranoid , scary world . <p> I 've always hated this expectation . A lot of children need a cuddle and to know someone cares about them . I believe the damage that can be caused by withholding this can be potentially huge . <p> If only we put in better preventive measures to keep monsters away then creating a whole society 's behaviour based upon a very small minority of creeps . <p> Anyway , back to the adoration of my girls . Everywhere I turned heads were stuck inside Savannahs pram pointing and smiling at how beautiful she was . ( I know ! ) <p> " We take picture " <p> The camera was out and ready . <p> The paparazzi gathering would circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at over how cute Savannah was walking along the path holding a balloon . <p> Theyd pluck her from my arms for a cuddle and conversations with broad grins . Savannah would stare right back before stretching her arms out to me to be rescued . <p> Kalyra would look at me with questioning eyes , <p> " What are these people doing ? " <p> I 'd nod to let her know it was okay , she neednt be scared . Strange but okay . <p> We 'd laugh and talk with gestures , trying to withhold the ingrained fear that tells me I should be suspicious , and allow my children to develop the concept that strangers are n't  all scary and you can have friendly , safe encounters . <p> I do n't  think Asians see this as strange behaviour because their society is very much based on the values of the Village Raises the child . <h> They are always looking out for each other , especially when it comes to children . <p> They would stop and help Savannah walk up the stairs , carry her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could eat my meal . <p> They 'd chase after her if she was running the wrong direction towards danger and they 'd patiently wait while she walked like a snail down the path instead of walking past , or mowing her down , like many Western people did . <p> One European lady , walking up the wrong side of the stairs ( it 's the left in Thailand ) refused to move for Savannah , who was coming down ( on the LEFT ) holding onto the railing for support . She waited until Savannah let go of the railing and moved around her . This is not a village raising the child mentality ! My inner voice had a special word reserved for her . Sure glad she was n't stealing my baby ! <p> It was truly wonderful to watch how the local people honoured my children . I was more than happy to let them steal them for a momentary cuddle and a light up from their insides out . <p> They sure light mine up . <p> Want help with planning a travel experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate and free access to the toolkit . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> A place where you can trust people to hold your child is a very different world than where I live here in the US . Here , it would make me nervous . In Thailand , I think it would just feel normal . Western culture isolates people from each other , and I think that the lack of support given in this kind of isolated system is hurting us and hurting our children . Back to the " village " model <p> We went to bali last year and we went into have dinner . the staff were great they looked after our kids and made it so enjoyable . Also one of the staff who works in the kids club at the bali dynasty wanted to keep my son hehe she 's looked after him and his sister on our two visits to the resort there . <p> I did n't  realise that this does n't  happen to everyone until I was at the zoo with a girlfriend in sydney and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction rather than the lizard and snake out for patting ! She had never seen such a phenomenon and asked how often it happens . I realised I hardly noticed it because I m do used to taking photos for Asian tourists with my strawberry blonde , blue eyed babies ! ! <p> Oh Charlie is so gorgeous I want to pick him up and cuddle him all the time too ! IT was funny because there were a few Russians who were quite friendly to the girls on the beach and I became quite tense and anxious . I had to give myself a little talking to ease up , if I thought it was okay for the Asians it should n't be a worry if a white skinned person did it . What awful conditioning ! ! <p> Memories = I travelled around South-East Asia with my oldest daughter when she was 4 ( she 's now 24 ) , and everywhere she was fawned over , kissed , cheeks pinched and included in heaps of family photos with strangers . Part of the charm of that area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bit painful after the 10th time or so ) <p> The cheek pinching is not great for any age ! ! I think it is part of the charm and it makes everyone feel good . Craig and I were delighted and loved to see how delighted the Asians were with my girls . I thought I was the only one that charmed ! <p> We live in Vietnam and our two-year-old experiences the same thing . He spent his first 18 months in the US though , so he does not like random people touching him . Now when people approach hell make a nasty " ahh ! " noise or try to hit their hands away . <p> I do n't  mind people taking photos but I do n't  like when they pinch his cheeks or kiss him on the face ! <p> Overall though , most Vietnamese people are very helpful and do keep an eye on him or help if the stroller gets stuck . We do n't  even need to ask for help ; if someone sees us struggling with him , theyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one for the pinching of the cheeks either . As long as the kisses are dry ones I do n't  mind as much ! ! ! I love knowing that help is always close by when you struggle with the kids . They are honoured so much in the East <p> ( btw ignore my last reply about where you are nowI read this comment after the last one = I hope you love living in Vietnam ! ) <p> I 've often seen this happen and it is very common in Asia . You summed it up perfectly with the village mentality and looking out for children . Wanting to look after your child for a while is a common gesture and certainly safer than in our paranoid Western world . <p> As for that European lady on the stairs , if she did n't  have a medical condition then she was extremely rude . <p> Yea , she was extremely rude , she was walking up the stairs just fine . It was such a relief for us to have the locals take our girls for a cuddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are so wonderful to the children <p> Great post ! When my girls were little , and we were travelin in Europesame thing . In Asia , even as big girls they got a lot of attention . I think we are missing out on a lot of happiness by not accepting this type of behavior in our home countries . <p> We just returned from Cambodia . I was delighted to see your post arrive in my email while we were there as we were experiencing just the same thing with our 3 year old . He received so much attention , but being quite shy , he found it very upsetting . I tried to explain to him that not very many little Canadian boys visit Cambodia so people are very curious , and though it may seem strange , there was nothing to be afraid of . I think if we were traveling there longer , he would get used to the attention , but with only a two week holiday , he did n't  have a chance to warm up to it . Cambodians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another opportunity to interact with locals . <p> It is a beautiful experience but can be so daunting for our kids . They need lots of reassuring , but as you say they probably need a few weeks before they get warmed up . If only we could make it longer ! <p> I have n't been to Asia yet , but years ago when our eldest two were little my husband made the comment that he did n't  realize what celebrities his children would be seeing that they were redheads ! Growing up as one , I was familiar with the comments , but he was unused to it and it made him uncomfortable . When wed take the kids to someplace with world travelers ( such as Disneyland ) we 'd have ( usually young and female ) Asians want to take pictures with our babies . Now that they are older , the comments are fewer , but then a family with three red-headed children still draws attention from time to time ! In the U.K. we found that many thought we were locals because " we looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in other countries / cultures hugging a kid and taking photos would look strange and disturbing . I heard for cases where even photos of your own kid can make you problems ! In computer shop , technician received computer for small repair and virus cleaning , and during backup he had found folder with photos of a kid bathing and playing in water , he immediately stopped work on computer and called police to report " evidence " . Imagine further problems of parents and suspicious looks pointed to them while explaining that in their country is perfectly normal to take photos of own kids . They probably could sue that tech guy because of snooping on their computer and not doing his overcharged job . <p> We are live in SE asia , and travel quite a bit to countries over here I cant think of any harm , but it definitely worries me ! The cheek pinching and kissing on the cheek , picking my kids up . It is so strange to me . As an American it definitely sets off little red flags in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuptural norms are different here , this is not the US ! <p> Its because the kids are blonde and/or fair skinned ! We have lived in several countries in Asia , with many years in Thailand raising our 2 girls . They always got lots of attention when they were small and blonde shop assistants would take them , staff in restaurants etc . The dilemma for parents is putting up with it and encouraging the children to grin and bear it and also wanting your children to know about stranger danger and be aware of what is appropriate . I have to say that over the years we progressed from laughing acceptance to grudging compliance for photos to outright refusal . As the children got older they also became less tolerant . I was never comfortable with kissing or cheek pinching ( I remember wanting to punch old ladies in Korea for waking my sleeping child by pinching their cheeks ! ) . And I found that Thais particularly would get the kids very revved up and were very teasing . I loved how the children were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always so comfortable with the touching and familiarity . <p> Lucky you , they gave my two year old strawberry blonde , blue eyed girl herpes . Since a trip to a theme park where she was literally chased by hordes of women she developed the infection a few days later ( no kid in nursery has it ) . Shes been screaming non stop for six days and not slept , had a high temp for three , her mouth has over 20 ulcers , her lips are swollen like a bad dose of botox , her gums are so inflammed you can barely see her teeth , she has n't  eaten for five days and now everything has started bleeding . If it continues she will be admitted to hospital for IV fluids . So next time random people want to hug and kiss my child , I will be beating them off with a big stick and teaching her to scream at them . Sorry , people I do n't  know never get to touch my child again . 
@@21820825 @1820825/ <h> 10 Principles to Make Your Travels Memorable Our Travel Manifesto <p> Not struggled for something to say , but struggled with too many things to say . Sometimes too much sage advice can overwhelm and paralyze . <p> I decided to pare my travel wisdom back to 10 principles . <h> Our Travel Manifesto <p> The following 10 principles taken from my manifesto will help you stay on track to overcome challenges and create those memorable travel experiences you are hoping for . <p> These 10 principles will affect your life positively , both in the moment of travel and for many years after . <h> 10 Principles to Make Travel Memorable <h> 1 . Open Your Mind <p> Be open to new cultures and different ( sometimes better ) ways of thinking . Your life has the potential to grow in unlimited ways just by being open to learning new things . <p> If you find something confronting , or you do n't  agree with , instead of being judgmental and hurtful simply say , " Its not better or worse , just different . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then open your mind to understand . <p> Try something new every day to expand your horizons and get out of your comfort zone . <p> Head to nature and sleep under the stars ; try exotic and strange foods ; attend a religious ceremony ; throw tomatoes at festivals ; teach English in the middle of Borneo ; do something that scares you ; and talk to strangers . <h> 3 . Interact . Engage . Listen . Embrace <p> Our most important discoveries and memorable experiences come from those we meet on the travel road . <p> Interact with the local people and other travelers . Ask questions to dig deep into cultures and beliefs . Listen attentively . You have two ears and one mouth . Make it your mission to learn as much as you can and engage with those around you . Share your own culture as well . <p> Help bring the world closer together and show how similar we really all are . You are an ambassador for your home country ; represent it in the BEST light . Expand your horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You are an ambassador for your home country ; represent it in the BEST light . Expand your horizons and embrace those who are completely different to you . <h> 4 . Travel with Awe , Wonder and Gratitude <p> The only luck I believe in is the one which determines where you were born . If you are traveling the world , you are privileged . Be grateful for this and use that as a means to wander the world with the eyes of a child . <p> How lucky are you to witness it ? Take time to think about how the planet works and what your place in it all is . Use that awe as inspiration to create your best life , which in turn helps to create a better world . It all starts with gratitude and awe . <h> 5 . Take Moments and Memories Over Possessions <p> Possessions wither away and die . Moments shape our character and the memories stay with us forever . <p> In 20 years time , that Gucci handbag will not have made a difference to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spent in a tent guarded by a Masai warrior while lions roamed outside , however , wont ever be forgotten . <p> Experience life instead of experiencing things . <h> 6 . Be Present and Passionate <p> There is no past and future ; life only exists now . Be present and experience every moment . <p> Step away from the computer and the lens and allow your five senses to soak up the world . Get excited and live every moment with passion . Remember how lucky you arerejoice in that ! You planned and saved hard for this adventure , you do n't  want to miss it by living in the la la land of your mind or other peoples business . ( You know what that stalkbook does ? ) <p> Be attentive in your conversations and aware of everything that is happening around you . You want to stay safe on your travels ? Being present is the best way to do it . It prepares your body to know what to do . <h> 7 . Sloooow it Down <p> It does not matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how deep your footprint was . <p> Have you really travelled to a place if you raced through and did n't  get the time to appreciate and understand it ? The best way to travel is slowly . Stay longer in fewer places . It costs less , you 'll see more , you 'll learn more , you 'll grow more , and you 'll form amazing friendships. <h> 8 . Swing in Hammocks at Sunset Often <p> Enjoy the simple things . It does n't  always have to be about the Must See sights , the adventure and the bucket lists . <h> 9 . Love That it is Not Like Home <p> Why go away if you want everything to be like home ? You are simply wasting your money and it wont be long before you find yourself on the next place home . <p> Sameness is boring . Different cultures , traditions , languages , money , and beliefs makes the world a vibrantly , exciting place . What would there be for us to learn if everything was the same ? <p> LOVE the diversity of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back and Share What You Have Learned <p> Give back to the local businesses and communities as you travel . Buy their local products , volunteer , help a stranger on the street . Sit with them in restaurants and homes and chat . Banter and play when you barter . <p> Travel will teach you so much about the world and yourself . Do n't  keep those memories and lessons locked away . Share them to keep them alive and to inspire and help others do the same . <p> How can you take this travel privilege of yours and use it to make the world a better place ? You should now have a much better idea of what that looks like . Do as Gandi said , " Be the change .

This piece will have a special spot on our 5th wheel ( trailer ) wall ! <p> This is great advice for anyone setting off on an adventure ! I agree with you about slowing down and being present and open to different experiences . Before I 'd done a lot of travelling I wanted to race around the world and " do " every country and city on the map , but I now realise that I much prefer exploring smaller areas and fewer places in greater detail and there 's nowhere Ive visited yet that I feel like I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day ! <p> I love travel planning , and the sense of personal accomplishment and the dream-like moments when plans become real , but many of my most vivid memories ( and character building ! ) travel experiences have been those times when I 've been wandering around aimlessly and hopelessly lost , or talking to people on the train , or facing the most stressful and ghastly situations . <p> Point number one I definitely agree with , but Ive seen people take it to extremes and become so enamoured by a particular place or culture that they see everything there through rose-tinted glasses and kind of lose their grounding and sense of reality for a while ! <p> I love these principles . Thanks for posting them . Everywhere I visit , I try to put many of these into practice ; I do n't  often have a specific phrase or name for them . I think stretching your boundaries and challenging yourself to experience something new is very important . <p> My partner and my mantra as we leave for holiday is " be kind to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning and excitement we forget to consider our travel companions , remember to respect each others wishes and dreams . <p> I love this post . It so truly sums up what I also believe is the best way to travel . To me , travel is not about racing from one place to the next to tick all of the attractions off the list . Travel is about so much more than that ! Taking the time to learn about , experience and live in another culture/way of life . Eating the food , and enjoying it because it is so different from home . It is not about just looking at a place and moving on , it is about engaging all the senses , interacting with the people , and embracing the differences compared to what you are used to . Oh , this makes me so excited to head off on my next trip ! <p> An excellent list ! Also , make sure you give it time .

Again , thanks for the list . <p> I love this list of travel principles , in particular No. 6 . Too many travellers skim over the highlights of a destination and do n't  really take the time to immerse themselves in the culture or even dare to get off the beaten track . <p> Great idea !

I could n't imagine how excited a foreigner would be to step on our shores and sight our beloved mascot . <p> They are not as commonly found as you think . I think the first time I saw one in the wild was on Pebbly Beach in NSW when I was 19 . At Pebbly Beach they graze on the grass like herds of sheep . <p> Could you imagine anything more iconic Australian ? <p> Kangaroos on the beach . <p> They are wild , yet so used to humans they allow you to come close without so much as an eye raise . <p> Over the three days we spent in the Murramarang National Park , Craig and I had many conversations about how we thought all tourists to Australia should now bypass Taronga Zoo in Sydney and just head a few hours south . <p> You 'll see kangaroos in the hundreds , wild and free . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murramarang National park , we came across a paddock in the middle of town near Merry Beach with so many kangaroos that we thought it must have been a kangaroo farm . <p> They were in people 's gardens , roaming the streets , lazing around on the side of bush walking trails , and hopping around the front of our cabin in Pretty Beach . <p> I was keen on camping at Pebbly Beach on this trip for my birthday . I felt a special connection when I first visited nearly 20 years ago with my family and wanted to return . We ended up in a cabin at Pretty Beach , a little north from Pebbly . <p> It turned out to be just as special , maybe a little more so . The roos loved to chill outside our front porch . <p> Every mumma had a baby just about , all snug in their pouches . They stood around clapping and watching as the girls and Craig played Frisbee .

Pure magic . <p> We enjoyed our two nights in our cabin . We were shut off from the world with no internet service . So we played , went for walks around the headlands to nearby beaches , and for drives on gravel roads through the National Parks to discover more rugged , wild , untouched beaches . <h> Murramarang National Park is a special place <p> There are also plenty of walking trails , including rainforest trails , and hikes up nearby Mt Durras . And it 's one of the only places in Australia where spotted gums grow right down to the beaches . <p> There 's hardly another soul around , so you 'll have Australian natural beauty at its best for you to soak up . <p> If you want to see wild kangaroos in Australia , Murramarang National Park and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging with the kangaroos below : <h> Getting to Pebbly Beach <p> Located on the NSW south coast only a few hours drive ( 250km ) south from Sydney , Murramarang National Park spans 44km of coastline and has easily been the best place we have ever seen kangaroos in the wild . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> Wow ! i 'm somewhat speechless , i 'm from Denmark and to be honest Kangaroos have always been one of those cartoon figures that did n't  exists in real life , i knew they did however its almost unreal to see them like this , i had no idea ! <p> I 'm without doubt gon na make my travel route go through Australia at some point ! i must experience those Kangaroos . <p> I had no idea that they where such a wild animal as well , and you can get that close , its amazing ! <p> Wow ! i 'm somewhat speechless , i 'm from Denmark and to be honest Kangaroos have always been one of those cartoon figures that did n't  exists in real life , i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , i had no idea ! <p> I 'm without doubt gon na make my travel route go through Australia at some point ! i must experience those Kangaroos . <p> I had no idea that they where such a wild animal as well , and you can get that close , its amazing ! <p> ( hope i 'm not double posting , did n't  want to post the comment the first time i tryed ) <p> Its amazing how tame the wild ones can be .

Except , most people place the idea of them doing it in the too hard basket , or the basket that is only there for the really wealthy or lucky . <p> I mean really , how could it be possible for someone with average , or less than average incomes , to travel for weeks , months or even years at a time ? <p> It can be done . <p> I left home at the age of 21 , with my 3 day old teaching degree , a backpack , and only a few thousand dollars . ( If I can be honest with you , that money was n't even mine , it came from the bank I do n't  recommend you do this btw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have created a life of travel for myself . This does not mean I have endlessly been moving from one country to the next . I often stop for work breathers , a place to stock up again before moving on . <p> The pauses can be acts of discovery , exploration and fun synonymous with travel as well . <p> I am often asked how to live a life of travel ; its not surprising people are curious . <p> Youll be shocked to know that I am not wealthy far from it . <p> A life of constant travel is not as difficult as you may think .

If we have disappointed you , I 'm sorry , you are probably reading the wrong post and were hoping I was going to say we were rich , because then youd have a good excuse to not follow your heart . <p> We all have to work and we need money to travel . Why not work and travel at the same time ? <p> here 's why we love it : <p> you do n't  have to save as much initially . <p> you 'll be earning local currency . <p> every day is exciting as it is new . <p> you experience a culture deeply . <p> weekends and days off become adventures . <p> you may get perks such as free accommodation , meals or flights . <p> The best way to do this is to live and work in expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own money for other adventures . I never could have travelled the UK and Europe on the Aussie dollar , so I lived in London and earned pounds to travel on instead . <p> Craig and I have followed the working holiday through 5 countries since 97 . Some of our richest travel memories come from the experiences we had living in another culture . It is by far the best strategy to have a life of travel and a good on at that . <h> Travel long-term in affordable places <p> Choose the countries that are cheap to travel to for the long-term . Our long-term trips have taken us through South East Asia and Africa countries where the budget conscious could get by on $30-$50 a day or even less . <p> Your experiences become richer when you are not worrying about budgets and having to deny yourself . <p> Travel in cheaper countries means you can do more and travel for longer . <p> Click here to receive special access to our best travel tips . <h> Make smart spending decisions <p> Its all about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation really worth it , especially if you are out exploring from sunrise to twinkling stars ? Can you go the comfy 3 star and have a little extra cash for the fun stuff ? <p> Do you need to eat in a restaurant for three meals a day or can you cook your own breakfast and settle for a picnic lunch ? <p> What about that city tour , could n't you do a self-guided one ? <p> Prioritize . Work out what you are willing to sacrifice and what you are n't  and craft your travel experiences around that . <h> Create a lifestyle around travel <p> Digital nomads and those creating their own travel lifestyles are becoming more common . If you want a life of travel , discover how you can make it happen . <p> How are other people doing it ? <p> Could you do the same ? <p> What special skills and talents do you have ? <p> What jobs could you work that involve travel ? <p> How can you create your own business that gives you the freedom to say where and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel and live abroad ? Try this . <p> Craig and I created this travel blog because we wanted travel to be our lifestyle . Our working holiday visa options were up ( due to age ) so we had to discover a new path . Our life of travel now continues with our two children because of our online business . <p> Trust us . We had no idea how to create this lifestyle . We had no special talents and definitely no money ( Read I want to know your secret to discover the truth ) . <p> All we had was a very clear dream of what our ideal travel lifestyle looked like , then we became 200% committed to it , and we took small steps each day with passion and conviction . <p> And look what the Universe delivered to us a result . <h> Make travel your focus <p> Many people want a life of travel , but they do n't  make it their focus . <p> You do n't  always have to travel far and wide . There are plenty of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I like to say make it your magnificent obsession . That means it fills your day dreams and night dreams . Every decision you make from now on is directed towards making that life of travel a reality . <p> Once you start focusing on something , you start planning , and then usually the Universe helps you by bringing what you need to make it happen . <p> The small steps start to grow bigger and before you know it you are living the life of travel you thought was only possible for the lucky ones . <h> Have a strong enough why <p> Constant travel is tough . I often want to quit , but I never will because I have this huge whya gigantic urge that only travel can fill . <p> I 'm happy to ride on the back of a pick up , or sleep in a van , and eat two minute noodles for weeks , if it means I can continue to explore and experience newness every day . <p> There 's no other life that makes sense for me so I continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of travel would suck ! Different strokes for different folks . You have to decide WHY you are traveling . What burning need are you trying to fulfill ? How will this life of travel make a difference and why is this important to you ? <p> Work that out all your paths will fall into place . <h> What is your path ? <p> Is it constant travel from one country to the next you yearn for ? Or is it a slower form , with frequent pauses for a sampling of the " settled " life before travel calls you back on the road ? <p> Or do you want to just have more travel , even if it is only an extra 2-3 weeks a year ? <p> That life of travel you desire can be yours .

There are so many different ways to make it happen . You have to be a little creative but you can do it . <p> Emigration ! I live in Sydney and have done full time since 1998 and off and on since 1987 . Its such a different life to where I grew up in Scotland that there 's always an element of travel even though family life here in the burbs can be mundane . <p> My fave is to live in other countries and work done in Italy , Pakistand , here in Oz and even England ! I have a yen to live overseas again and am sure we will as a family one day . Meanwhile , the wee trips are SO mentally stimulating . <p> Pakistan would have been an amazing experience . I really do n't  think you can beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of both worlds . Every day is exciting and new and feels like a holiday . I love it . <p> I found your blog last night on Pinterest and I am obsessed with it . I can relate so much to you Chaz . I am 21 graduating with my teaching credential and will be moving from California to Sydney in September for a year to be an au pair making Australia my 8th country , small in the big picture . I definitely have the travel bug and would love to follow in your footsteps . Love all your tips ! ! ! <p> How Awesome Ryen and you can call me Chaz if you like ! ! LOL I 'm so excited that you are coming to beautiful Sydney ! You will love living here . September is a great time to arrive . You have such an amazing travel life ahead of you . I think it is so awesome that you are embracing it <p> I may just have to show this to all of the travel naysayers I come across ! Right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years . I 've also switched jobs/careers with those moves , &amp; spending like a backpacker even while at home has allowed me to always take a longer trip in between jobs . Now I 'm trying to immerse myself in the travel world online and meet like-minded people . Its so much easier to forge a path when you see that its totally feasible with enough effort . <p> Yes show it to them Megan ! The naysayers will always find a way to steal your dreams , that is why it is so important who you choose to hang around and share your dreams with . I think it is totally doable , but as you said it does involve effort , but if it is what lies at your heart centre then it is worth it <p> This post pretty much mirrors I have managed to travel the world indefinitely . I am fortunate to have found employment in impossible places to go to otherwise ( Antarctica ! ) Or in places where I would have otherwise probably not bothered with ( currently Abu Dhabi ) . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I have been able to bank a lot of money while working and then take lots of time off to travel focusing on places where my money will last longer . <p> Loved how work got you to Antarctica Will ! ! Its amazing how you can travel when you think a little outside the box and come up with strategies to make it a reality . The money you can save when costs like accommodation has been removed is amazingand you get paid as well . We worked on a pearl farm in Broome WA for 4 months . All of our food and accommodation was covered and we lived in a remote area so had nothing to spend our money on , after a 5 week swing we walked out with $10,000 in the savings account . Three times doing that meant we had a stack of money to travel on again . Too easy ! <p> Ive been trying to figure out what travel I want in my life recently . I think I 'd like a weekend away once a month and 2-3 trips overseas per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one trip overseas a year ! ) <p> I think that sounds perfect Vanessa ! I think if you are getting away as much as you can , even if it is just for a weekend , your happiness and sense of peace improves dramatically . IT just helps you to feel you are doing something for yourself to enjoy your life . <p> This is the way to do it ! I left about seven months after graduating for the working holiday visa in Australia . I prefer traveling like that more than any other way possible ! I guess technically I am still traveling , I 'm not in my home country , but I stop in places for very long , so I think its just my lifestyle now and hopefully forever ! <p> Sadly , this is not possible for someone who has citizenship that requires long complicated most often rejected visa process to enter another country . But I 'm thinking once you put your mind to it , be determined to make it so .. Thanks for the inspiration ! <p> Ah yes this can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places you can go to , and of course your own country . Travel can be anywhere and it is always great to discover more about your own country or even region . Once you do make a commitment you start to discover ways you can make it a reality . Nothing is ever so black and white . <p> I just returned home from 4.5 months of traveling South America , and now I 'm looking for ways to go back indefinitely ! Your post is great , and it reaffirms what I learned first hand which is that long term travel is absolutely possible with very little money . I highly recommend WWOOF , which is an organization that hooks you up with farms . You work on a farm in exchange for housing and food . Also , Couchsurfing , where you can stay with locals for free . <p> These are all great tips and suggestions . I know people love to travel and I always look forward to that next trip . However , I feel like there is something missing in these tips that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think more needs to be said . <p> You do n't  need to travel far to live a life of travel . <p> I believe in exploring close to home . It can be in your own neighborhood , a town over , or an hour away . Take a day trip . Go hiking . Be a tourist in your own town . So many places youve think you 've been but have never really gone . Seeing places close to home with a different perspective will change the way you travel . Travel is a mindset not a destination . <p> I 've taken spontaneous trips near home . I spent this weekend taking over 200 photos of a place close to home ( I 'll write more about that later ) . People will be surprised at how much they can enjoy travel without spending a lot of money or going far . <p> I linked to my spontaneous trip post below . I 'm going to spend more time encouraging people to travel closer to home . I really believe in this . People do n't  need to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For most people , the best travel experiences are the people and stories they have to tell , not just the destination . <p> Oh yes we definitely agree with this . It is one of the tips in our video series people get when they sign up to our newsletter . Travel is a mindset and we love encouraging people to start by exploring their own backyard . Get off the couch and see what is in the next suburb , you 'll be amazed . <p> I would love to make a living out of travel , but I realize that is not as easy so I daydream and plan ahead a lot of my travels and try to take short trips as much as we can . I would love to live in Europe ( I lived in London for almost a year 10 years ago ) , but I know its not an overnight process , so I continue on planning and daydreaming . And I am lucky that my family shares the same feeling about travel , so I can safely say that travel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And I 'm with you when you say that because you travela lot it does n't  mean your wealthy same happens with me and a lot of people still think I am swimming on a sea of money , LOL . <p> You are right it is not easy and some people definitely have more challenges than others . Starting with short trips is the perfect way to start living that life of travel , you can still do it even if those short trips are only an hour from your home . <p> We only started our lifestyle of travel 14 months ago , but it has been the most exciting time in our lives ! We have created various income streams that we can earn as we go and are looking forward to this for the rest of our lives . We work very hard on our projects but it is all worth it to be able to travel . <p> Fortunately I was able to take a years leave without pay from my job ( been there 15 years ) and my partner and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my partners dream to to do this . Without their determination and passion to travel , I would still be at home in my 9-5 job . I do n't  think I would have been able to make myself resign from my good job to do this trip , so I am very grateful to my boss . We have rented out the house and are on our way ! So , we have n't given up everything to travel long-term so far , but maybe this experience will give us the confidence to do so . <p> Hi there Thanks for your blog its an amazing source of info ! Quick question for you I am currently planning a travel across SEA and to Australia sometime next year . I currently live in London but I 'm originally from France . I realised that , should I decided to go and wander for a few month before maybe settling for a year in OZ , I would need to carry with me a fair part of my possessions . I am planning in getting rid of the non-essential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without , and pack a bag to take off east-bound . What 's your recommendation in terms of packing for the great departure ? Should I consider buying cheap summer clothes while traveling in South East Asia ? Would one suit/dress be enough for job interviews when I get back to my serious job/serious life ? Or should I not care about it until the time comes to buy new clothes ? Should I plan to get some of my stuff sent to me wherever I decide to pause and settle for a bit ? Any experience/tips would be very welcomed = <p> Great question Marion . There are a couple of options . You really want to carry as little as you can . So you could decide on what you need for Australia and send it over by sea mail . I did this all the time when relocating . IF you only focus on taking the essentials it shouldnt cost too much , but will be worth it to save you the hassle and weight in carrying it around SEA . You can definitely consider buying cheap clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap and the clothes are awesome . Bangkok is a great place for shopping . One suit or dress would be enough for interviews . You could even buy this stuff in SEA as well . I would try to have clothes for Oz for when you come here . Perhaps either sent over by sea mail or bought in SEA , as Australia is expensive . You can get bargains here though , but if you can do it another way it would be better . <p> Lots of great tips . When I was in my 20s , I taught English in Europe and used that work to travel a lot , not just around Europe but also in the country where I was living ( the Czech Republic ) . Now that its a little harder to travel overseas often , I focus on traveling in California as much as I can and visit family in other destinations , which helps with accommodation costs . <p> Smart spending decisions is a biggie I think , as are all the other points . Its one thing to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discipline to extend your travels long-term . I know I give in to temptation and splurge more than I should on my travels and end up paying for it later in the form of less travels ! <p> Absolutely ! And many people cant take the sacrifices which is why they never get the travel . Its really hard and you have to stay so focused on the ultimate dream and reward yourself with small wins so you keep going <p> Great tips , I especially liked keeping to a lower budget and saving the extra income instead of increasing spending . <p> My husband and I moved back in with parents about 1 year ago to save for our Australian WHV ( 17 weeks to go ! ) and its meant we could afford some other little trips in the meantime too ( Corfu , Amsterdam &amp; shortly The Isle of Barra , Scotland ) <p> Focus is definitely the key &amp; having the patience to scour the internet for the best deals/special offers . Our life of travel is just beginning and its looking good . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it then we can too ! You can always find a way and moving in with your parents is probably not what you really want to do but its a small sacrifice and look at what it will bring as result . <p> I think you are in my head ! We may have the opportunity to move to Switzerland for work and if it happens , we are at a crossroads . We will miss our family dearly , and they will miss my daughter the most ! But as you said , its a great way to see and travel more . It helps if you like the job too ! <p> Yes . It is difficult to move away from family , but you have to always follow your own path . If you do n't  you only end up with regrets followed by resentment . The world is so small now that communication across the seas is much easier . <p> I can relate to traveling even when you 're not traveling . You can still use the tools and skills travel has taught you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the other side of the world . I also love it that you took away the T from " cant " and added it to " try " . " Can try " is much more empowering , and what you did with this post can be done with any big dream somebody has . Break it down to steps , then break it down to even more steps , and keep putting one foot in front of the other . <p> Yes ! I used to always do the can try with my students and now with my daughters . Of course they give you a weird look but I think it sinks in for some of them ! Small steps is always the way to achieve anything <p> Great read ! People always asked me before I left , " well what if you do n't  like it ? " I always said , " so what ? It will end up being a long vacation if worse comes to worse . " As long as you have some money ( and I agree , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just try it ! <p> For me , I was supposed to be gone MAX 1 year . Uhm , 2.5 years later and counting . haha . I think this is the usual story for us crazy nomads . That one year ALWAYS turn out longer . We just cant help ourselves .. hehe <p> My husband are from Europe and our work let 's work from anywhere . So we travel everywhere . Since the average stay in Europe is 3 months how did you manage to stay longer and work ? Was it with visas and work permits ? <p> Thank you for your response . = I like reading on how people do things like with you and the traveling . I have always thought myself lucky being from Europe because I can pretty much go anyway in the EU and stay not have to worry about visas and such . We are branching out though . We are hoping to get to Australia within the year . <p> I 'm not really sure of the pros and cons to being legally married . I guess it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , but other than that I Ca n't imagine it would impact things too much . <p> post can help you choose .

@@21820828 @1820828/ <h> What to Do in Phnom Penh , Cambodia <p> As part of our city guides series , we interviewed Tammy Lowe- who has lived in Phnom Penh for 9 months with her husband who both- came as volunteers to work in the international development sector for 6 months , but loved it so much that they decided to- stay a little longer . <p> Tammy shares with us her insider travel tips on what to do in Phnom Penh- for those looking for the best places to see , eat , stay , drink , and explore . <p> Take it away Tammy <h> Why visit Phnom Penh ? <p> Phnom Penh is often only a whistle stop for many travelers who just stop by on their way to Angkor- Wat in Siem Reap . In my opinion it should n't be overseen though as it has so much to offer . <p> Phnom- Penh today is almost unrecognizable to the Phnom Penh of 10 years ago , when people still lived in- traditional wooden houses , rice paddies lined the river , and UN vehicles roamed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 years of conflict . <p> Today there are decent roads , modern bars and- restaurants , shopping malls , a numerous amount of high-rise buildings , and many historical sights. - Phnom Penh is a city on the up . <p> For me it is not just the sights though . For me Phnom Penh is all about the people , the atmosphere and- pace of life . Unlike other Asian cities , such as Bangkok , Phnom Penh is the perfect sized city and much- more relaxing . <p> If you visit Cambodia come and explore Phnom Penh for at least a few days . Slow- down , take walks , get lost and explore the jewel of South East Asia . <h> What to Do in Phnom Penh <p> To really understand Cambodia as a country , its culture and people I really recommend learning a bit- about Cambodia 's tragic past and the genocide during the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 70s . <p> The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh , a former school , used to be one of- the most brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed and- tortured . Most prisoners were then bought to the Killing Fields just outside of Phnom Penh . <p> Both sights are heartbreaking and a lot of visitors ca n't take it , as the brutality of the regime is- portrayed in so much detail . But I think it is important to remind people about what happened- here to make sure that these things will never happen again . <p> Tuol Sleng prison cells <p> A more cheerful sight is the Royal Palace , which is a stark contrast to Phnom Penh 's dusty- streets with its manicured gardens and golden buildings . It is a beautiful complex with lots- of impressive Khmer architecture to explore . Cover your shoulders and knees though , as you- ca n't get in otherwise . <p> Royal palace <p> There are also a number of beautiful temples ( or wats ) scattered around Phnom Penh , which- are all worth seeing . You wo n't find many tourists visiting these temples , so most of the- time you will have them all to yourself . The most famous one is Wat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Other temples really worth seeing for their architectural- delights are Wat Lanka , Wat Ounalom , and Wat Botum . If you visit any temples make sure to take off your shoes before you enter , cover your shoulders and knees and never point your- foot soles at anyone , especially not the Buddha statues . <p> Wat Phnom <h> Best Neighborhoods to Explore in- Phnom Penh <p> My favourite neighbourhood for exploring is the riverfront , which is lovely for a stroll , but also great- to grab a bite to eat , enjoy a cold drink and visit some local markets , such as the old market in the old- French quarter . <p> It is always busy with locals and tourists alike and if you fancy getting active you can even join one of the outdoor aerobic sessions with the locals for $0.25 . <p> The riverside is lined with temples and bars and a perfectspot for people watching <h> Where to Eat in Phnom Penh <p> Khmer food is not very well known outside of Cambodia , but it is definitely worth trying. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as vendors have mobile kitchens- attached to their motorbikes and so are able to prepare food anywhere they stop . It is delicious- and really cheap where a meal often only costs $1 . <p> If you are thirsty make sure to try delicious- Khmer ice coffee , fresh sugarcane juice with lime or fresh coconut juice , all available from- mobile drink carts for roughly $0.50 . <p> A mobile coffee cart <p> If you are a vegetarian I highly recommend K'nyay Restaurant , which offers vegan and- vegetarian cuisine and unusual local specialties , such as jackfruit or banana curries . <p> My favourite restaurant has got to be Samaky Restaurant though . Samaky is a social- enterprise that trains street children in the catering business and teaches them English . I have- never seen more friendly staff in any other restaurant and by eating there you support a really- good cause as well . <p> I recommend the national dish Fish Amok , and sweet and sticky rice with- mangoes . <p> the best sticky rice in town <h> Where to Drink in Phnom Penh <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bars scattered around Phnom Penh. - Most of them have happy hours where a glass of ice-cold Angkor beer will usually cost you $0.75 , and- a cocktail $2 . Most bars are down the riverfront , on street 278 or 51 . You will be spoiled for choice . <p> If- you prefer drinking with the locals you can try out one of the plentiful Khmer beer gardens , where a- pitcher of beer will cost you around $1.5 . Be repared for some karaoke though . <p> beer tower <h> Best Place for a Night on the Town in- Phnom Penh <p> No visit to Phnom Penh is completed without a visit to the famous Foreign Correspondence Club- ( FCC ) . The FCC is a very historic building , as it was here where the war correspondents filed their- breaking stories in the early days of the Khmer Rouge regime , until they were all forced to leave the- country . <p> Its rooftop bar offers beautiful views over the riverside . The food is delicious , but a bit more- on the pricy side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to see some traditional Cambodian dancing I recommend the Chaktomuk Theatre on- Sisowath Quay where you can see the Apsara Dance and some very elaborate costumes . <p> Apsara traditional dance <p> If you want to party in a private space you can rent one of the many boats along the river which can- host up to 50 people . Costs are around $20 for a 2-hour cruise and you can bring your own drinks and- food . The boat takes you down both the Mekong river and the Tonle Sap very relaxing way to spend your night . <p> boats for river cruise <h> Where to Stay in Phnom Penh <p> There are a lot of cheap guesthouses on the Golden Mile on street 278 , called golden mile- because most guesthouses have the word golden in their name . <p> I stayed in the New- Golden Bridge Guest House- when I first arrived and was very happy with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff- and the clean rooms . <p> A mid-range hotel I can really recommend is the Hotel 252 . It has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of sightseeing . The food is Khmer and Swiss and very- delicious . <p> Pool at Hotel 252 <p> If you are into more upmarket hotels then I can recommend the Raffles Hotel , which is- simply beautiful in architecture , luxurious , offers delicious high noon teas and also has a great- swimming pool . <p> For more places to stay in Phnom Penh choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com . You get free cancellation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Markets and Shopping in- Phnom Penh <p> There are three markets where you can buy souvenirs . <p> The biggest is the Russian Market on Street 163 , which sells everything from souvenirs , to- engine parts , antiques or fresh food . <p> The Central Market on Street 128 is a beautiful art deco building , but sells similar products to- the Russian market , but is a bit smaller . <p> central market <p> The Night Market on the riverfront at the corner of Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great place to sample some street food and to buy souvenirs . <p> Haggling is a must on all three markets to get the best deal . If you are into art and handicrafts in- particular I recommend a visit to Street 178 where galleries and workshops line the street opposite the- University of Arts . <p> night market <h> Events and Festivals in- Phnom Penh <p> The biggest event each year is the Water Festival in October . The 3-day festival is of great significance- as it celebrates the end of the rainy season , the start of the fishing season , and also the unique natural- phenomenon the flow of the Tonle Sap river changing direction ! <p> Many villagers throughout the- country spend almost a full year preparing their villages boat for the famous boat races . These are- elaborately and brightly decorated dug out canoes with large eyes on the prows to ward off evil spirits . <p> Another big event is the Royal Ploughing Ceremony , which marks the beginning of the rainy and- rice growing season . The Royal family is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds of the National Museum , Buddhist rituals , marching bands and the actual ploughing- ceremony where two royal oxens plough the ground and are then offered a varierty of foods and spirits. - Depending on what the oxen chooses to eat is a sign for a good or bad harvest . <p> royal ploughing ceremony <h> Get around- Phnom Penh <p> Phnom Penh has n't got the luxury of public buses or an underground system that other Asian- metropolises have . So to get round you can either take a tuk tuk or a moto taxi . There are plenty of- those around and you wo n't be able to walk a meter without being offered a ride . Motos are a bit- cheaper , but do n't expect the driver have a helmet for you . <p> I prefer tuk tuks . They are safe and you- get to relax on the comfy seats whilst being able to take in the surrounding sights . Negotiate a price in- advance and expect to pay between $2-$4 , depending on how far you go . <p> tuk tuk <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cafes have free wifi these days . The internet connection is also fairly fast , - so you wo n't have a problem getting in touch with your loved ones back home . <h> Best time to visit- Phnom Penh <p> There are three seasons in Cambodia . The hot season ( November to January ) , the very hot season- ( February to May ) and the rainy season ( June to October ) . <p> The average temperature during the hot season is around 32 degrees Celsius , so this is a nice- time to visit . <p> The very hot season is almost unbearable when it gets as high as 39-42 degrees . <p> The rainy season is quite a nice time to visit as well , as the rice paddies are very green and- lush and the afternoon rainfalls cool the high temperatures down a little bit . <h> Favorite side trip from- Phnom Penh <p> I would really recommend a visit to Tonle Bati and its nearby Angkorian temple ruin Ta Prom. - Tonle Bati is a lake where locals often come for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a boat ride or a dip in the cool water . <p> Whilst I would n't recommend swimming in the lake- for health reasons , the picnic areas by the lake are the perfect spot to relax in a hammock and- eat snacks provided by the various street vendors or restaurants . <p> Tonle bati <p> A few minutes away from the lake is the Ta Prohm ruin , which dates back to the late 12th- century . Whilst you get bigger ruins in the Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap , you- will have this ruin all to yourself for a true Tomb Raider experience . <p> You can get there by- booking private cars via tour operators or negotiate a deal with any tuk tuk driver in town. - It takes about 1 hour in a car and 1.5 hours in a tuk tuk . Expect to pay about around $30 for- either mode of transport . <p> Ta Prohm <h> Getting There and Away <p> Unfortunately , there are no direct flights from Europe , the US or Australia to Phnom , so you either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I recommend Air Asia as it is very cheap and reliable . <p> Buses are much cheaper , but take a lot longer as well. - If you come from Vietnam you can take a bus or boat from Ho Chi Minh City . The bus trip- takes about 6 hours , and is very comfortable . The boat ride takes about 4 hours and is really- picturesque as it takes you through the Mekong Delta . <p> There are also buses available from Bangkok , but they take a whole day with various changes- involved. - A bus from Pakse/Laos is about 15 hours . <h> Best insider tip for travellers to Phnom Penh <p> As most people only stay for a few days in Phnom Penh they often do n't get the chance to experience- the surrounding countryside and its sights . I have already mentioned Tonle Bati above , but there is- also another place that is easily reachable for a half-day trip , which is Oudong . <p> Oudong has been- Cambodia 's former capital until Phnom Penh became the new capital in 1866 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred of Buddhas bones possessed by Cambodia . The bones are in a temple- on top of a mountain . <p> After a 10 to 20 minute climb from the base of the mountain you will be able to- witness a wonderful view down to the surrounding Wats , rice fields and floodplains . You can get there- via tuk tuk or booking a tour with a tour operator for roughly $30 . <h> I love Phnom Penh because <p> It is home to the most amazing and friendly people I have ever met . They- do n't rip you off and locals will always greet you with the biggest smiles you can imagine . I love- Phnom Penh because I feel home here . <h> Plan Your Trip to Phnom Penh 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation in- Phnom Penh <p> Booking.com has 450 properties in Phnom Penh including hotels , apartments , and guesthouses .

Well definitely have to check out the Ta Prohm ruins and go on a boat cruise . Well actually be living in the Oudong district for a few months . I echo your recommendation for people to visit the temple on the mountain there . The views are stunning , and there are rarely many other people there which makes it a unique experience . You can actually explore around the grounds on top of the mountain for hours ! If you 'll still be in PP in October , we 'd love to meet up ! Thanks for a great article = <p> Thank you Jen ! Glad I could help . Would be great to meet up . We will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a month , and then come back to PP on 9th November . If you are around in the first week of October or early November let me know . <p> I am going to Cambodia on September this year . Besides Cambodia , Thailand and Vietnam are also listed to be visited . But still I have a question about a hotel you might have seen during your visit in Siem Reap if you have been there . I booked the following hotel : Tara Angkor Hotel . You know if it is a good hotel ? I heard good stories about it . What are the best attractions to visit in Siem Reap and in the surrounding ? <p> Hello Emma , I read your message and wanted to help you , because I have been in Siem Reap a lot of times . The Tara Angkor hotel is a beautiful hotel and is ideally and conveniently located , Tara Angkor Hotel is situated only 6 km from the Angkor Wat Temples , 15 min drive from the Siem Reap International Airport , a few minutes stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city town center with an array of Cambodian souvenirs , shopping and culture . They have a few promotions that you can make use of if you have n't booked already : Last minute bookings , summer sales , early bird promotion or Angkor temptations . Of course there are a lot more , but have a look at their website . It is not that far to the Angkor temples that I would advise you to see for sure . I would say , grab yourself a 3 day pass and find yourself a decent tuk tuk driver to take you to the farther ruins and for a drive in some of the outlying villages . If you 're up for it consider renting a bike and checking out Angkor Wat on your own . There 's a lot to see and do so a lot depends on your time and budget . A few temples I would strongly suggest you check out besides Angkor Wat itself are Bayon Temple , Angkor Thom and of course Ta Prohm just to see the amazing tree . The Banteay Srei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different feel than a lot of the others . If you want to do something else as well , you can visit the day and night market . I can really recommend these attractions . If you need to know more , let me know . <p> Wildlife Alliance ( WA ) , as you may already know , is a non-profit organization dedicated to environmental conservation . WA is now creating a close-encounter wildlife tour of Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center ( PTWRC ) , one of the WA projects located 40km south of Phnom Penh . <p> PTWRC is home to over 1200 animals , most of which have been rescued from the illegal wildlife trade by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team ( WRRT ) , a patrol team created by WA . Animals rescued are released back into the wild whenever possible or they are given a home at PTWRC for as long as needed . <p> My brother is travelling to Phnom Penh soon . I wanted to see what genuine travelers are talking about this city and found this post . Thanks so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go with him . That night market is just my style of eating . I love it ! <p> Wow great summary of Phnom Penh . We were in Cambodia for 2 months not long ago . You are so right ! They are amazing people ! We only spent a couple of nights in PP but did enjoy our time . The S-21 Museum and The Killing Feilds are a must . They are very sad and heart breaking , but unfortunately it is a part of history and should be learnt about . It just blows my mind how happy the Khmer people are . They definietly are showing the world that they are the bigger people and that they want to move forward . The river cruise would have been great . Pity we missed out , next time . Thanks for sharing guys . <p> Just so your readers are aware , those lovely little bars you recommended are where children and trafficked for sex each night . Supporting those places is supporting human slavery . Not what I hope people choose to do on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . <p> We did n't  write this article , it was written by a guest writer so I 'm actually not familiar with these establishments in Phnom Penh . Exactly which bars are you referring to in the article and of course I will remove the relevant links immediately . We would never knowingly promote or support anything like that . And I 'm sure our guest writer would not either and was not aware of anything like that going on at the time of their visit and publishing this post . <p> Greetings from Singapore ! I chanced upon this on Pintrest great insight ! I will be coming to Phnom Penh end of next month and this would be my first ever solo trip ! ! ! I was wondering if you 'd be free for dinner ?

We new we had to seize the opportunity to live , rent free , in a gorgeous L.A. neighbourhood . <p> That first one worked out quite serendipitously , as I had just mentioned we would be in LA in an email and she asked us to house-sit . <h> However , the next one came after sending off quite a few applications on Housecarers . <p> We had been planning a road trip up through California and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our path that summer . We were accepted for one in Tucson , Arizona and spent a month there caring for a fantastic dog . <p> Having fun exploring Arizona during our Tucson house-sit <p> Almost three years later , Dani and I have had 12 house-sits across four continents , including our own experience house and cat sitting at our own romantic Bed and Breakfast in Tuscany in 2011 , just like that dream housesit mentioned in the Guardian article . <p> It felt like everything had come full circle from the first time we had heard about house-sitting on that cold London morning . <p> House-sitting is a perfect option for anyone interested in long term travel , but can also work well for travelers looking to just spend a week or two away . <p> You live rent free in exchange for keeping someones home and pets safe , but more importantly , house-sitting allows you to have authentic travel experiences in ways that more traditional accommodation such as hotels and hostels just cant provide . <h> Although more and more people start housesitting every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this is such an amazing way to see the world , save money and have the kind of real , authentic travel experiences that so many of us are looking for . <p> Dani and Jess house-sitting in Italy <h> Getting Started House-sitting <p> If house-sitting sounds like it is right up your alley , signing up to a couple of housesitting websites is easy enough for anyone . <p> Just because you pay the membership fee ( usually around $50 or less per year ) , does n't  mean you are guaranteed a housesit . <p> Things that hold some people back from being successful with house-sitting are : <p> lack of experience <p> poorly written applications <p> and applying too late <h> Our advice is to start by telling friends and relatives of your interest in housesitting . <p> Agreeing to care for your aunts house , or dog-sit for a friend of a friend while they go away for the weekend is not only a great way to lock down a credible housesitting / pet-sitting references , but also to find out if it is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own circle of personal contacts might be something you have success with , but looking for housesits online opens up the possibility of housesitting in another city or even another country , possibly on the other side of the world . <h> Where to Find Housesits Online <p> You can use Facebook to spread the word about your desire to housesit , and sites like Craigslist have loads of opportunities , too . <p> However , Craigslist is not popular in every country , which does limit your options and building trust through a site that is n't dedicated to housesitting is a bit more of a risk than we personally like to take when agreeing to live in someones home and be responsible for their house and pets . <p> We have found plenty of success across several of the over 20 dedicated housesitting websites and can highly recommend signing up and creating a profile on at least a few different sites , in order to catch more opportunities that might fit your schedule and your desired travel destinations . <p> A traditional Bavarian house in the German Alps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together a detailed overview of all housesitting websites and their costs on **29;1237;TOOLONG , divided by region , but for the purpose of getting started , there are three popular global websites . <h> Housecarers.com <p> Housecarers.com is one of the original sites connecting homeowners to housesitters , and has the most variety and the most global reach . Housecarers is probably the best site out there for the more exotic , remote locations and also for anyone looking to housesit in Australia . <h> TrustedHousesitters.com <p> The fastest growing housesitting community is TrustedHousesitters.com , which was founded only a couple of years ago by two Brits who are avid housesitters themselves . <p> Although the site is currently strongest for sits in Britain and Europe , homeowners from around the world are starting to sign up to this site in droves and the company is looking to make a push toward growing the movement in South America in the coming year , and we actually found our current housesit " looking after two adorable Scottie dogs for seven weeks in a luxurious condo inSantiago de Chile " on TrustedHousesitters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular housesitting websites . This is an easy to use site with homeowners around the globe advertising their homes here , and we have successfully scored housesitting gigs in Germany , Malaysia and Italy on this site . <p> There are loads of housesits in Europe , but also great opportunities in the rest of the world , in places like Costa Rica , Canada or Argentina . <h> Before You Even Apply <p> Seeing a month long housesit in Fiji , or a summer in the French countryside might make you squeal with delight , but there are a few things to consider before you take the time to apply . <h> What is the weather like ? <p> Is it hurricane or typhoon season where you would be living ? Even if the weather is fine , is it low season ? <p> Staying in a tourist destination like on a Costa Rican beach might seem like a dream , but if it is right in the middle of low season , there may not be many people around , even locals . Are you comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> we had our own private beach for 2 months in Mexico <h> Next , consider visa regulations ? <p> How long do you have on a tourist visa to that country ? For Europeans / Australians / Kiwis traveling to the U.S. and Americans to any of those areas , a tourist visa is 90 days within any 180 day period , meaning you would not be able to accept a housesit longer than 3 months . <p> In Mexico , tourists can get up to a six-month tourist visa , and Central America and South East Asia have easy options for border runs , meaning you can leave the country and return the next day on a brand new visa . Check this out online to have a rough idea before you apply . <h> Check out the cost of airfare or transportation during the month of the housesit . <p> Flights to Fiji might be affordable if you will be coming from Australia or New Zealand , but if you live in Denver and would be traveling in high season , does paying the price of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <h> Apply strong , Apply early <p> After you sign up and create a profile , you will need to keep tabs on new housesitting opportunities in order to be one of the first to apply . <p> Select which regions or countries you would like to housesit in and opt to get email alerts to be notified when a homeowner creates an ad for those regions . <p> Homeowners receive anywhere from five to over 100 applications depending on the location of the sit and the level of responsibility involved , so the earlier you apply , the more chance you have to make a lasting impression and preferably be chosen to do the housesit . <p> Even if you have previous housesitting experience , there are still always more available housesitters than housesits , which means you might have to apply for several housesits before being chosen for one that works for both you and the homeowners . <p> One of the amazing sunsets we had every day during our six-week housesit in Canada <h> This Is Not About You <p> You can find out everything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Break Free : The Ultimate Guide to Housesitting ( available for Kindle on Amazon.com now ) but if there were one tip to give you to help you be chosen , it is this : <p> your application , even your profile , should not be about you . <p> When you apply for a housesit , make sure to read that homeowners advert carefully and then address how your experience and skills matches the needs and responsibilities for a housesit . <p> Of course you will be providing personal information , homeowners need to be sure that they can trust their house and their pets essentially their entire life with you while they are gone . <p> Showing them why you are a good fit for their needs is going to put you one giant leap ahead of the competition . <h> Get Personal <p> Having experience is not necessarily what makes you get chosen . <p> Unlike job applications , house-sitting is extremely personal . Homeowners are likely to go more with their gut feeling about an application , so making a personal connection using information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housesits around the world , we highlighted two first-time housesitters who were able to score dream housesits in Thailand and in Costa Rica right out of the gate . <p> If you have a family , do n't be discouraged .

Fantastic fun and well worth doing . <p> From the e-mail alerts I 'd say there is a couple of new house sits per week for Perth and they can range from a few days up to months , some as long as six months .

BAZAAR at QT Hotel <p> I try to avoid buffets these days as I ca n't help myself from over-eating , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas and particularly the Paris Hotel Buffet . <p> But BAZAAR at the funky QT Hotel in Surfers Paradise is not just any buffet . It has a market place concept with- literally something for everyone with fresh produce in endless quantities . <p> My fave is the seafood station , and I also love how the Asian chef steams up dumplings to order . There 's also a BBQ guy , wood-fired pizza , pasta , and a great salad bar . <p> There 's only one problem at Bazaar holding your kids back , and yourself , from the AMAZING dessert bar with all these miniature cakes and slices staring you in the face . Just when you thought you were getting out of there relatively healthy <h> 2 . Paleo Cafe , Burleigh Heads <p> This was the third Paleo Cafe we 've eaten at around Australia . The first time was at the original cafe in Cairns , and the other time was in Albury , NSW . One reason we go here is because the Paleo diet is 100% gluten free , and Caz has a gluten intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order a coffee with almond or coconut milk . And we agree with their tag line : Its about eat clean . Live clean . The Paleo philosophy is a lifestyle , not a diet . <h> 3 . Raw Energy , Coolangatta <p> We like to think that Raw Energy is completely healthy , and for the most part it is . There are plenty of healthy options that taste great . Its a cut above most cafes in that regard so- we continue to go back . <p> We like the food , the smoothies , and the funky environment . You cant beat the beach location and they have a little kids play area which is always a bonus . <h> 4 . Cafe dbar <p> This is where you should end up for breakfast or lunch after doing the walk from Coolangatta to Point Dangar which we highly recommend . At Cafe dbar you 're almost back across the boarder in NSW . <p> Cafe dbar came recommended to us by some locals , and were glad we kept walking up the hill from Snapper Rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual but modern setting appealed to us . <p> We did n't  have full meals but the food we had was fresh and tasty . Put this place on your southern Gold Coast list . <h> 5 . Currumbin Surf Club <p> If there 's one thing Queensland does really well on the casual food front its their Surf Clubs . <p> Being fully licensed and offering breakfast , lunch and dinner right on the beach we always seek them out as they make for a great family dining option . Good food at reasonable prices . <p> Currumbin Surf Club is a locals fave and just look at these views . We ate here on a weekend and it was crowded ( its not the biggest of clubs ) but that also shows its popularity and the food servings were large and tasty . <h> 6 . Rainbow Bay Surf Club <p> The Surf Club at Rainbow Bay sits on iconic Snapper Rocks which is a famous surf break and holds the annual Quiksilver Pro Surfing event . You 'll notice famous surfing memorabilia throughout the club . <p> Besides being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals throughout the week ) the balcony provides one of the best sunset views on the Gold Coast all the way over to Surfers Paradise . <p> Not hungry ? At least come here for a sunset drink ! <h> 7 . Burleigh Kiosk <p> We love Burleigh Heads and were staying in the caravan park just up the road from the Surf Club . If you 're looking for a casual spot right on the beach for breakfast or lunch , grab a seat at the Kiosk downstairs . The veggie burger was impressive . And forget about the food for a second , check out the view . <h> 8 . Southport Surf Club <p> Southport Surf Club or Surf Club Main Beach its now called has a great location right on Main Beach and the big deck allows you to make the most of the views . Possibly the best food out of the surf clubs mentioned ( my clam chowder was to die for ) and its an easy stroll from Surfers Paradise if you 're staying in this end of town . <h> 9 . Vie Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date night with compliments of the Vie Bar + Restaurant . It had been a long time since Caz and I had been on a date night , and thanks to my parents being in town they had the kids sleep over at their apartment so we could wine and dine at the one and only Versace Hotel . <p> We started with a sunset drink over the broadwater followed by dinner in the chic Vie Restaurant . We had a 3 course meal deal for $59p/p which we thought was good value for a restaurant that has been Awarded one chef hat by Gourmet Traveller Magazine Australia . <p> Of course it was stylish and contemporary . If you dine here , make sure it is a nice night so you can sit outside and appreciate the water frontage , and maybe consider lunch so you can appreciate the views better . <h> 10 . Seaduction <p> This was date night number two thanks to Gold Coast Tourism . This time Cazs parents were in town to watch over the kids , and so off we went to Seaduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surfers Paradise . <p> And this was a dinner with a difference , a special degustation menu . The idea is that you taste several dishes on a smaller scale and each course is paired with a matching wine . <p> We had 5 courses including smoked salmon , seared scallops , roasted quail , and velvet chocolate , and it was some of the most delicious food we 've ever eaten . The wine was a good match too . <p> If you go here request a window table for uninterrupted views over the ocean . <h> 11 . Black Coffee Lyrics <p> We did n't  go here seeking a meal , but a drink , as we had just left the previous mentioned Seaduction . <p> But we have eaten at Black Coffee Lyrics before and they do great pizzas and tapas . Black Coffee Lyrics was first- recommended- by you guys as a great place for coffee in Surfers . <p> So we went , and we keep coming back . Apparently the breakfasts are amazing and we like how it evolves from a cafe in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach for a BBQ or Picnic <p> The Gold Coast really looks after its public spaces and provides free BBQs , great kids playgrounds and nice grass areas at most of its beaches .

It is a relaxing place to stay for a visit , but Craig was pretty adamant it could not be a life long home . <p> Just waiting around <p> " I still need the vibrancy of a city . I do n't  want to be spending the final parts of my life going to the same restaurant and walking down the same village street . If you are near the city you still have all the choices of things to do . I think it helps keep you young and alive . Otherwise , I 'd just be sitting on my porch waiting around to die .

And before you know it the kids are now gone living their dreams , or choosing to do it sometime in the future , and you are sitting on your front porch with a lukewarm tea and the Sunday paper just waiting around to die . <p> Craig and I have been pretty good about doing what we want to do now , but every now and then something will pop up and well say " Well do that when " <p> That is when we need to be aware that the when will never come and if it is something we really want to do we have to do it now . <p> We knew having another baby was not really the right time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never gong to be a right time .

You might as well throw those plans out the window and say <p> " You know what . The perfect time is now . What am I waiting for ? This is my life and I am dying every single minute I live it .

" I 'll do that when " is so easy to hang all your dreams on and they usually just stay there . <p> I honestly got caught up in this myself and I 'm still trying to she 'd the hold of complacency . It helps to be aware of it , it helps to read posts like this to spark the necessary motivation . <p> I agree with your point : if you keep postponing things you will never accomplish them . What I can really relate to is your intro . I 'm always torn about whether to leave NYC , because I love the excitement of living in a major city . Its hard to tear yourself away = <p> I think once you fall in love with the excitement of the city it is so hard to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and now we are home and are bored beyond belief , even though we have beautiful beaches in walking distance . We cant even get a coffee after 5pm ! ! <p> You guys are as right as always with this post . Sometimes I cant even fall asleep at night because I keep thinking that life is ticking away and I begin questioning whether or not I am doing everything I want to be doing . Just the thought of sitting on that porch with lukewarm tea and counting regrets one by one motivates me to ensure that day never comes . <p> Congratulations on the changes to your site ! Clean and bold , my kind of style as well = <p> I 'm the same way Earl . I enjoy sleep a little more now I am a mum , but I never used to want to sleep as I always had so much I wanted to do- it was such a waste of time .

Although , I could see myself retiring somewhere quiet and I would n't feel like I 'm waiting around to die . I 've never enjoyed big cities too much . My idea of a good time is surfing twice a day and having a few beers and good food . Sounds simple , but sometimes simple is good . = <p> This is a brilliant post , and so encouraging ! At my vast age I can say that I 've had times when I 've gone for it , and others when I 've put things off or put things away for a " rainy day " and the latter way is totally wrong ! You find that you begin to stagnate and lose focus after a while . The times when I 've gone for it " now " have been the good ones , whatever it was in my life , and scared or inexperienced or unprepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times which were the best and I remember now . The stuff I waited for , mostly , did n't  happen . <p> In recent years I 've spent too much time even fretting and sulking about being stuck on an island , and not being able to travel for whatever reason , and that was time wasted too . Once I opened my eyes and mind to what was around me I began to discover things I never knew before . Being an island within easy reach of Europe with a fantastic climate a lot of people come here to retire , and do exactly what you describe ! And.well , these are my peers .. and overall I cant stand their company , but that 's a whole other story ! <p> I agree with Christy that you do n't  need to be in a city .

There 's no working relationship by way of payment . Its volunteering . I 've used services/agents like this before to get paid work overseas . It was always my responsibility to sort out the visas . If I did n't  then I would pay the consequence . IT did n't  make the company or service that was provided illegal . <p> Generally a tourist visa would suffice BUT , its up to each person to research the visa requirements of any country they visit to be sure . This stands for whether you are visiting , volunteering , or working . <p> Worldpackers is a pretty awesome concept I 'd think ! However I 'd agree with Bebas point . While there is n't money changing hands , theoretically you are working on a tourist visa . I 'd guess the passport you hold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be using this . Just hope folks do n't  misuse this and we continue to have this service up ! = <p> But , as mentioned , its up to each person to sort out their own visas . As it is with any job you may arrange with any company in any country . It does n't  make Worldpackers illegal , just like any company who offers a service like this is n't . Visas is an individual travellers responsibility . I 've worked with multiple companies around the world that offer similar services and all have said , " its up to you to get the required visas . Some have helped with that process , others have n't . Worldpackers states the same on their website sort out your visas . <p> Hi Caz , Thanks for this post . I 've never heard of Worldpackers but it sounds amazing . This past year we 've used Helpx and Workaway and really enjoyed the latter . Well have to check this one out as well . THe other two you have to pay just to start playing around and contacting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this have no idea how amazing work exchanges are . <p> Have you guys ever done a work exchange while on the road ? Or even contacted to try to do so ? When we have children we want to homeschool and backpacking for months at a time , leaving our dream hotel during rainy season in the Philippines . Maybe just throw it up on worldpackers = <p> So glad to keep seeing all these hidden treasure posts full of great info . Will keep snooping to see what else we can find . Thanks for always adding value to us readers . 
@@21820840 @1820840/ <h> Why you shouldnt be afraid of Eastern Europe <p> For many years Europe has been popular amongst the travel crowd and backpacker circuit , but the assumption is always travel in the West . <p> Is it because of pop culture and plenty of media coverage ; or simply ease of getting around , communicating in English , and a common currency ? Many have no ambition to travel to the East ; when really , why not ? <h> So where exactly is Eastern Europe ? <p> Its in the East , right ? But where do you draw the line exactly ? <p> Back in the Cold War days , defining the borders of Eastern Europe was easy ; it was made up of all the communist countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain . Nowadays , it depends where you get your information . For me , Eastern Europe is everywhere east of the Adriatic Sea and west of Asia-Minor ( the West side of Istanbul ) . <p> Just having the geographical North , East , South , and West makes life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hungary , Moldova , Poland , Romania , Russia , Slovakia , and Ukraine as Eastern Europe . So where does that leave Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Cyprus , Hungary , Serbia , and Slovenia ? You get the idea ; let 's just say Eastern Europe is in the East . <p> Eastern Europe is not as unsafe as you might think . The people are genuine and friendly , things cost less , its easy enough to get around , there 's plenty of history and geographic diversity . <p> However , for the first-time traveller , travel there requires a little more flexibility ( and perhaps planning ) than Western Europe ; but overall it makes it an excellent region for travel . <p> I travelled Eastern Europe ( mostly ) solo , and did n't  have any trouble at all . In fact , it was North Africa and Western Europe where I had troubles with scammers and thieves . <p> If you are really concerned , there are several well-known travel techniques to keeping yourself safe . If its your first time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau , not because its unsafe , but because its quite different to the travel you 're used to . <h> Culture &amp; History <p> Eastern Europe has the geography , weather , and history you 'd want to experience when travelling . <p> Bulgaria has the Cyrillic alphabet , and the Black Sea coast . I can recommend Plovdiv , Sofia , and Veliko Tarnovo . <p> Croatia has the beautiful blue oceans , the cliffs , and islands ; as well as Roman ruins . Zadar is magical , and Vis will always hold a special place in my heart . Split , Dubrovnik , and Hvar are touristy , but definitely worth a visit . <p> Czech Republic is the beer drinking capital . But it also has beautiful historical centres like Cesky Krumlov . <p> Hungary has Budapest ( and the Roman Baths ) , is completely land-locked , and has the Hungarian Sea ( Lake Balaton ) . I spent a summer on the lake ( CouchSurfing with a Grandmother ) during an annual wine festival , and had one of the best summers of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still curious about foreigners . Its not uncommon to be invited into someones home for a meal . I 've met many backpackers and hitch hikers with stories of genuine hospitality and concern for their welfare . <p> Each country has unique cultural traditions , influences , and historical experiences . <p> Further Reading : The Day I held the Iron Curtain in my Hand via @insidetravellab <h> Challenging <p> Perhaps the greatest challenges you will face in your travels are the language barriers . I managed to get lost in Hungary when the clerk at the train station put me on the wrong train . <p> Miscommunication is somewhat common practice , but makes for great travel tales later . The fact that many places are off the backpacker circuit means that hundreds of thousands of tourists havent been there before you . It just means that all those little things like catching the bus , buying a meal , meeting locals , and navigating your way around become more of an adventure . <h> Less Tourists <p> One of the biggest draw cards to Eastern European travel would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places you can move around freely without hearing English chatter , except for the hostels and bars obviously . <p> Its a great " off the beaten path " feeling when you have to try and communicate with broken English or the local language . However , there are still a few well-trodden tourist places like Split and Dubrovnik in Croatia , Krakow in Poland , and Istanbul in Turkey . <h> Getting Around <p> Flying into Eastern Europe is fairly straightforward , with budget airlines servicing major cities . Once there , train travel is a great low-cost option ; although not everywhere supports the high speed Eurail network so check before using Eurail passes . But , local trains are many and very cheap . You can check Eastern Europe train schedules on the German Train site DB Bahn . <h> Budget <p> If you are a student , or if you have a student I 'd , many museums and other attractions in Eastern Europe offer a student discount when an I 'd is presented . <p> Remember , Eastern European countries are n't  on the Euro ( except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency exchanges . Be sure to protect yourself and your finances by going to official exchanges , but avoid using airports and hotels ( they charge a higher exchange rate ) . <p> Do your research first , and establish the rates &amp; all costs before handing over your cash . Either spend all your cash , or exchange it before leaving the country . <p> Most of Eastern Europe is still relatively cheap to travel through compared to the West . <h> The Global Village <p> The number one reason to get to Eastern Europe now , is that the world is shrinking at a phenomenal rate . Its not westernized yet , but who knows in a few years from now ? Cities in the East are growing , and rural areas are becoming urbanized . <p> You 'll find Internet cafes common-place , McDonalds here-and-there , but for the most part you can still find great off-the-beaten-track destinations . <p> I remember walking down the street in Hvar , I approached people asking for rooms to rent , and pretty soon found a great 3 bedroom place overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dorm bed in the West ) . Approaching locals for accommodation is not so common place in Western Europe , with the abundance of hostels and campsites . <p> Bio : Ian is a 20-something year old guy who gave up his career and mortgage for solo long-term travel . He travelled extensively across Europe for a year before heading onward to North Africa . Catch him onFacebook and his travel blog Eager Existence . <p> Poland being my native country , I can tell you tat many people in Central Europe will not identify themselves as Eastern European . It has a lot to do with the former Eastern Blocks complicated history , national feelings etc . So looking at some of the countries mentioned in this post , I feel like the title should be Central and Eastern Europe . <p> Yes , Slovakia is on the Europe and I think its pretty unfortunate for them in some ways . They used to be much cheaper and would get e.g. people from Poland crossing the border to shop there . Things have reversed . <p> I absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and explore more of Eastern Europe , particularly outside of the cities . But , seriously , I 'd go back just to eat more Hungarian goulash . <p> Yes yes yes ! I travelled to the Czech Republic , Poland and Lithuania in January/February and loved it . If you get away from Krakow , there are n't  that many tourists anywhere in Poland Gdansk and Poznan are fantastic . Even in Prague , if you just get out of the city centre a bit , you 'll find places that are n't  touristy at all . <p> Wonderful countries and they 're the only three eastern European countries Ive explored ! Romania and Hungary are high on my list . <p> Thanks for this ! ! I 'm a HUGE fan of East European travel and I 've been to most of the countries there . Make sure to mention the beauty of the sea in Bulgaria , the painted monasteries of Romania , and the Mediterranean food and archeological ruins in Albania ! ! All extremely interesting . <p> I 've seen a lot of travel posts on Eastern Europe lately and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself ! Yes , it seems a lot of people avoid traveling there compared to Western Europe , but that just means there 's so many more off the beaten path places to go that are n't  overwhelmed with tourists ! I think the real issue is that people are lazyjust like in the post I read over at Nomadic Matt on why people think travel is n't affordable LONG ... Theyd rather travel to places theyd be more comfortable with rather than a place where they might not speak English . <p> Is that laziness ? Or comfort-zone people fear what they do n't  know . I know I hard a VERY hard time in a few places trying to do something as simple as buy lunch . But they make the best memories , because usually both the shopkeeper &amp; I realised we could n't communicate , and had a laugh about it . <p> I have n't spent too much time in Eastern Europe but would love too ! It would be great exploring the Czech Republic , more of Hungary and Croatia but I think the lesser known countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not high on my bucket list , your post is very tempting to give Eastern Europe a shot . Its only a short flight from where I am , and I keep reading how marvelous it is . The locals sound fantastic , and from your post it appears that connecting with them was part of the experience , which definitely eases the concern of not knowing the languages . <p> Thanks Tibor . Ill have to contact the photographer on Flickr who has it listed as Prague . Thanks for popping out to let us know . Great to meet you . What did you find useful or inspiring about the article ? Its always good to just say the positives as well <p> I 'm glad this region is finally on more travelers list . As for safety issues , if we look at both central and Eastern Europe , the region is diverse . Many of the countries have been very westernized and you wo n't feel any different that you would in Western Europe . = <p> I have n't been to eastern Europe but would like to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Septembers.I think the language barrier will be the biggest problem but I 've done it before and will communicate with mime , smiles and a drawing . <p> Hi Ian ! I like what you sait : " I think it 's a fear of the unknown that has the majority of people avoiding travel in the region . " Yes , it is definitely true . At least speaking up for Slovakia . It is safe country to live and travel Tom <p> Niether Prague , nor Budapest are in Eastern Europe . Czech republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Poland and Slovenia are CIVILIZED central european countries . If you want to insult us , call us eastern europeans . After all , why do you think , that fourty years of communist oppression is able to erase previous thousand years long history . And for more than thousand years , we have been part of western civilization . Today , cold war is for more than twenty years over . It-s time to stop throwing us on the same pile with Ukraine , Belarus , Moldova and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  think this post was written with the intention to insult anyone . I think its time to bring peace into our world and move forward . IT does not matter so much as to what your label is but as to how you are spending your days trying to make your life better and therefore the greater world . I understand there may be a lot of hurt and frustration for you with previous history etc , but I do n't  think insulting other nations is the best way to make a difference and create positive change . We really welcome peoples opinions here , and of course we love for facts to be correct , we however do not welcome insults . <p> Mr. Czech . Have you ever been to Belarus ? Or is it rather your illiteracy and prejudice makes you say it ? And you think the Baltic countries of Lithuana , Latvia , Estonia are not up to your standards ? Well , let me disappoint you , they are in the same level as Czecho , Portugal , Greece or Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no hurt or frustration for me with previous history . I did not experienced it . When communism fell , I was 4 years old . All my anger arise from the fact , that Czechs don-t consider themselves to be alien to western culture . Actually , they do not separate themselves from westerners . Czechs are westerners ! We share same values , same institutions , same international organizations ( NATO and EU ) . But what is the most important , we have been part of western civilization for thousand years before communist takeover . After 1989 , we simply reverted our true identity . The same can be told about Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , Slovenia and Croatia . And , of course , about Eastern Germany ( I hope , you don-t pretend , that border between PEastern and PWestern Europe is situated in the middle of Germany ) . If you have some basic historic knowledges , you must confirm my statements . Today , cold war is more than twenty years over . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our countries from western word . <p> Well , I am not troll . If I were , than every normal Czech considering himself to be central European and not easterner should be troll . And I can confirm you that virtually no Czech consider himself to be easterner . Do you really think that Czech republic has more common with Ukraine than with Austria ? And this is the reason why I am angry . You implicitly claim that fourty years of oppression could overshadow previous thousand years history . Why ? ? ! <p> Hi , I loved reading your post about Eastern Europe . I 'm going to Europe in about 5 weeks time and i 'm really looking forward to checking out some less touristy places with some great culture . I 've already done a lot of Western Europe . I 'm a female and ill be travelling solo for the most part and was just wondering how safe it is to be travelling on my own as a first timer in Eastern and Southern Europe ? I know basic common sence plays a big part , but like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a little hesitant towards these places . Linds <p> The picture that you have captioned " Prague " is actually Bratislava , Slovakia . Slovakia is a beautiful country that is definitely worth visiting . They have the most castles per capita in the world ! It is also much cheaper than , say , Prague . As far as language is concerned- English is spoken especially in larger cities , so knowledge of the local language is n't necessary . Although if you do learn some Czech , Slovak , or Polish is could be helpful as " survival " words/ phrases in these languages are the same ( with slight variations ) in all three . <p> Great article ! I have travelled extensively in Czech Republic , Slovakia , Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and lived in Hungary . My favourite places have to be Prague , Budapest and Sarajevo ( I 'm more of a city person ! ) . Whilst I think that the offended Czech person has taken this article in the wrong sense , I do agree in regards to their comment about putting the Czech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel that the Czech Republic ( Prague in particular ) is no different at all on a development level than many western places , it seems to me more advanced , modern and safe than many places I 've been to in Spain , France , Germany and the UK . On the other hand I think calling Ukraine etc dirty backwards countries is totally uncalled for . This poster seems to have the untrue view of these backwards countries that English , French , Spanish etc people have of the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Hungary . So its a little bit hypocritical I think . <p> Easternized countries ( with freedom of travel ) are so much more attractive to me than the westernized ones . = Soul of place is very strong . I really loved the feel of Kiev , Ukraine in the early 1980s . <p> Interesting post I must say I got pretty upset by the title = I hate that people think its not safe , but I assume its cause all the Hollywood movies or shows where there 's mafia , drugs whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree is like anywhere else , is not a like we are stuck in time like Cuba . Just one thing about the language barrier well we do speak many other languages , the problem is that British , Aussies or Americans commonly do n't  speak any other then English so its their fault not ours = <p> Although its not technically an Eastern European country , Romania is also an attractive travel destination , especially when on a budget . The landscapes are beautiful , the cities have an interesting mix of " old " and " modern " elements and the local culture is really interesting . Eastern Europe in general is appealing because there are not that many tourists , at least not yet , and you can have some interesting experiences while travelling . <p> Hi . Sorry for coming up with a remark , but there is some sensitivity in this topic ; Estonia officially belongs to the Northern part of Europe . After all what this country have done to preserve its identity , the little recognition would be appreciated . Regards <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eastern Europe " , but the text does n't  reflect this . As travellers and especially travel bloggers we should be more considerate about geographic descriptions , as some of the comments here show . Even the CIA considers Poland , Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary to be Central European . I have put together 9 points which for me define Central Europe . One big hint : the geographic center of Europe is a few hundred miles northeast of Warsaw . LONG ... <p> Wonderful post , Ian ! Eastern Europe is indeed safe and such an amazing place to visit . I see Slovenia is n't included and it actually is one of the jewels of Eastern Europe ( plus , nearly everyone speaks English there ) . Croatia is incredibly beautiful and Bulgaria is also picking up quite fast .

You can be sure that no matter where you are walking around the Harbour that beautiful bridge will be popping up to greet you for an amazing photo opportunity . <h> Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb <p> Views from high above on the Bridge climb <p> This is something we have not yet done ( but is on the list ) . I can only imagine the different sorts of photos you could get of the Harbour bridge from climbing it . Here you could really focus in its unique architectural design . <p> If you do n't  want to climb it you could definitely walk across it for alternative photos .

Where have you taken your best photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge ? <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> Aha ! Great point there Kieron . You would n't be able to take your camera on the climb . That does suck . Maybe stick to the Bridge Pylon then and save yourself the money . It seems like you can get some good photos from there . <p> Observatory Hill is a really pretty place to hang out . There are some gorgeous old oak trees there you can take some good photos of and as you can see the views are pretty good . Mrs Maquaries chair is probably the best spot <p> Love the views from the ferries the first time I went to Manly , I could n't stop taking pictures of the bridge on the way out and the Opera House on the way back . I have n't been to Mrs. Macquaries Chair yet but after this post , its top of my list for the next time I have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I love the Harbor just because it reminds me of where I am ( that is when I 'm actually there ! ) One of my favorites spots is that corner near the Hyatt with the grass and trees and another is the Botanical Garden . I guess I like to see the city framed in green ! <p> Ca n't wait to get back and get some more fab views like these ! The bridge climb is definitely on the list for me too , although I 'll have to go it alone since the BF is scared of heights ! ! <p> Pretty great shots and summary of the area . I 've seen people climb the bridge on TV , but I did n't  know anyone could climb it . Pretty cool ! I can see why Mrs Macquaries Chair is a popular spot . You have the view of two great icons one next to the other ! <p> My favorite spot to photograph the bridge in Sydney is on a ferry sailing right underneath it ! One of my favorite photos from OZ was taken from under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful . <p> I struggled with whether or not to do the bridge climb . Its a Sydney icon and after all so I did push through with it even for the last minute . My boyfriends passion is photography so he scheduled a trip by Experienceoz.com.au and got a package . Its a nice experience . <p> Sydney is such a gorgeous city ! My husband and I enjoyed the view from Mrs Macquaries Chair while we were there for our first anniversary . There are also some great views of the Harbour Bridge from the other side of the harbour as well ! Check out the views from Luna Park , or go out to Bradleys Head for some really nice views too ! 
@@21820852 @1820852/ <h> What to Do in Beijing , China <p> As part of our city guides- series , we interviewed Stephen Whale who has lived in Beijing for two years . <p> Stephen shares with us his insider Beijing travel tips and knowledge on things to do- in Beijing for those looking for the best places to see , eat , stay , drink , and explore . <p> Stick to the left or right paths through the Forbidden Palace to avoid the crowds <h> Why visit Beijing ? <p> Beijing is the capital of the most populous nation on earth and home to some of the most iconic tourist attractions . <p> It 's also a city undergoing tremendous change , so it 's worth visiting soon before the last of the traditional streets and hutongs are bulldozed in the name of progress . <p> Birds nest Olympic Stadium <h> What to do in Beijing <p> The big three things to do in Beijing are Tian'an'men Square , the Forbidden Palace , and Temple of Heaven . <p> These are all reasonably close and can be visited in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market to sample the unusual foods on a stick , such as seahorses and scorpions . <p> Other Beijing attractions are the ornate but busy Lama ( YongHe ) Temple or the nearby Confucius Temple that is generally much more serene . <p> 798 Art District is an artist 's haven created in a Bauhaus-designed ex-military factory . It 's peppered with some fine works of art , but its worth noting that up and coming artists are rapidly being ousted by rent increases , leaving it mostly inhabited by artists that are more established . <p> Cheaper and more adventurous art is still being created in Ai Weiweis Caochangdi Art District or Songzhuan Artists Village . <p> In the north of Beijing city is the National Stadium , or Birds Nest . Used in the 2008 Olympics this stadium is best visited at dusk , just before the stadium and nearby Water Cube are colourfully illuminated at night . <p> The adjacent Olympic Forest Park is a good place to catch a break from the crowds and traffic . <p> For a break from the crowds head west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a- holiday home for the imperial family ) , Fragrant Hills walking trails and the Beijing Botanical Gardens . <p> Keep an eye out for the CCTV Tower an angular arch sometimes called The Underpants ' you 'll know it when you see it ! <p> Temple of Heaven <p> A couple of warnings : avoid Beijing Zoo " it 's one of the few places in northern China to see Giant Pandas , but the living conditions are terrible . Take the time to travel to Chengdu and visit the Panda Conservation Base instead . It 's still a bit questionable , but they 're at least helping the species . <p> Finally , spend any time in Tian'an'men or Wangfujing and it 's inevitable that some friendly students will approach you looking to practice their English . Chat to them by all means , but do n't accept their invitation for a drink as it turns into an expensive scam . <p> Likewise , ignore anyone who offers to show you some cut-price works by art students . <p> Insects at DongHuaMen Night Market <h> Where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food outlets in Beijing are often the cheapest and busiest . The high turnover ensures that it 's fresh and usually made to order . <p> Any street will have bun or dumpling shops where a filling meal can be had for 4-8rmb . For more upmarket soupy dumplings look for the Taiwanese Ding Tai Fung chain . <p> In the morning keep an eye out for carts selling my favourite , a Jian Bing Chinese pancake . <p> Half a Peking Duck the strip on the right is considered the best piece and is reserved for guests . In this picture it <p> Of course , nearly everyone will want to try Peking Duck . The most hyped is DaDong , famed for its crispy skin " it 's excellent duck but the side dishes are n't up to the same standards given the high price . Most tour groups will visit a brand of Quanjude , but as with DaDong you might notice a distinct lack of Beijingers eating there . A good compromise is Bianyifan , which has been serving duck since 1416 and is a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also home to some of the best examples of regional Chinese cuisines . If you 're not travelling further in China take the opportunity to try spicy yet delicate Sichuan hotpot , rich in flavour Yunnan dishes or rustic Xinjiang lamb kebabs . For a special meal look for Imperial food , as served to the Emperors , but be prepared to pay handsomely . The Beijinger website has a useful directory of English-friendly restaurants . <p> If you 've somehow tired of Chinese food , then Sanlitun is home to the majority of foreign restaurants . The South East Asian food is of particularly high quality , whilst the Italian and American dishes might leave a lot to be desired , and cost many times the price of a Chinese meal . <h> Where to drink in Beijing <p> There are two main areas " Sanlitun and the hutongs around HouHai Lake . In warm weather it 's hard to beat sitting by the lake with a drink , accompanied by the sounds of local musicians . <p> If it 's a little cooler head to Sanlitun where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stylish private clubs . <h> Best places for a night on the town in Beijing <p> The most popular evening shows are the Peking Opera , athletic or Kung Fu Shows , or chilling out to live music in HouHai and Nanluoguxiang . <p> For non-aficionados , the Peking Opera can be a bit much to endure and many people leave at the first interval , so visit Prince Gongs Mansion near HouHai for a tour of the gardens and a 15-minute opera performance . <h> Where to stay in Beijing <p> For sightseers , the area east of the Forbidden City is full of cheap accommodation . <p> For a budget hotel , friends have enjoyed the modern Hotel Kapok , again right next to the Forbidden , City . <p> A couple of blocks east you come to Wangfujing where the high-end hotels are clustered . <p> The Mandarin Oriental is a personal favourite , and towers over DongHuaMen night market ( due to reopen n 2016 ) . Alternatively , look for a family-run traditional courtyard hotel in the same area . <p> If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be more convenient to be over by Sanlitun , where you 'll find most of the expats and backpackers hanging out in Bar Street . <p> For more places to stay in Beijing choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com. - <h> Markets and Shopping in Beijing <p> For luxury brands , Wangfujing is the premier shopping street , closely followed by Sanlitun Soho , although be aware there 's a 50% luxury tax on many items so you 're unlikely to find a bargain . <p> For less authentic goods , try the Pearl Market or Silk Market . Haggling is essential here , but well-made fake clothes , bags , watches and jewellery can be bought very cheaply . The hiking gear looks good , but I would n't want to be wearing it in an emergency . <p> Cheaper but less English-language friendly is the Zoo Market , opposite Beijing Zoo . <p> YuYuanTan Cherry Blossoms <h> Festivals and events in Beijing <p> The absolute highlight is Chinese New Year when the city is a cacophony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a week of sleepless nights <h> Getting around Beijing <p> Avoid the pedicabs in Beijing . <p> The cheapest way to get around Beijing is by subway " the price is fixed at 2rmb ( US$0.31 ) no matter how far you go . It 's best avoided at rush hour . Many stations have maps in English but it 's worth carrying a subway map round anyway . <p> The easiest way to get around Beijing is by taxi . Prices start at 10rmb and increase with time and distance , but it 's hard to ever spend over 50rmb . Note that there 's a 3rmb surcharge after 2km that wont appear on the meter , so be prepared to pay the extra , but there 's no expectation of tipping . A taxi in from the airport will cost 80-90rmb . <p> Make sure you have your destination written down in Chinese " hotels can assist with this . To hail a taxi , do n't  point extend your hand with the palm downwards and waggle your fingers . <p> Whilst the taxis are generally helpful , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the meter goes up evenly , and your change is real . Stay away from the three-wheeled pedicabs . They 're dangerous and will almost always try to scam passengers , even Chinese . <p> Walking is an option around the major tourist sites such as Qianmen hutongs , Tian'an'men Square or Wangfujing . Most streets run North-South or East-West , so map reading is straightforward . <p> Beijing city is very flat but spread out , so if you travel much farther afield you 'll need to find transport " many hostels also offer a bicycle hire service . In the hutongs , you can give your feet a break by hiring a rickshaw but negotiate a price before getting in . <h> Finding WiFi in Beijing <p> It 's very easy to find WiFi , but you should be aware that the government censors many social media web sites such as Facebook and Twitter . Google works most of the time but is a little slow . <p> Wikipedia is often blocked , but Wikitravel is generally OK . Internet addicts may wish to invest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks in China . <p> If you want to access these while you 're in China , you 'll need to purchase a VPN. - You can try a VPN from NordVPN here , which comes highly recommended . ( affiliate link ) <p> To find free Wifi you can go to international chains such as Starbucks , McDonalds , etc , or any local coffee shop Maan is particularly fast . Some of these require a local telephone number to get free access . <p> There are plans to provide a WiFi cloud over Beijing , but it 's still in development . <h> Favourite side trip from Beijing <p> The most famous must be the Great Wall of China . For those with only half a day , Badaling is very close to the city , but can be extremely busy . For a different experience , it 's also possible to camp overnight there , on top of the Wall . <p> Slightly further away is Mutianyu " it 's a full day trip and a bit more climbing but you get to see unrestored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Wild Wall ' sections to enjoy hiking trails , but be careful as they can be poorly maintained and the emergency services wo n't come and find you in the event of an injury . <p> If there 's time , take a trip to Cuandixia . Its a village that has barely changed for 600 years . Stay overnight to experience the slower pace of rural village life , coal-heated beds and fresh and delicious locally grown food . <h> Best time of year to visit Beijing <p> Definitely the autumn . The winter brings the cold winds from Siberia and the spring breeze carries the dust from the Gobi Desert . <p> Summer can be very hot , whilst autumn is a much more comfortable temperature and the gentle breeze keeps the pollution at bay . <p> Avoid travelling during the Chun Yun migration , when half of the cities 20 million inhabitants go home to the countryside for their annual holiday . Tourist sites are packed , whilst public transport and restaurants are understaffed . <h> Getting there and away <p> From Europe , the cheapest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra and use Lufthansa for more comfort and a working entertainment system . Travelling to the US , American Airlines or Delta are cheapest , but I prefer Air China for the on-board dim sum . <p> If heading south to New Zealand or Australia , domestic flights in China can be very cheap , so it 's sometimes an option to fly via Shenzhen or Guangzhou and continue from there on an international ticket . <p> The next best option is trains . They 're very cheap , but the distances involved can take multiple days to cover . This is improving rapidly as China introduces high-speed rail services across the country . <p> View over the Forbidden City from JingShan Park . There <h> Best Beijing insiders tip <p> For the adventurous , try XiFengKou , some way north of Beijing , where it 's possible to dive down to where the wall has been submerged in a reservoir . <p> Head to parks early to see people practicing Tai-Chi , or late to see them ballroom dancing . Feel free to join in ! <p> Many toilets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a try , or you can find western style toilets in the lobbies of large hotels or international chains such as McDonalds and Starbucks ( but not KFC ! ) . Look for the stall marked Disabled , Old Man or even Maimed/Crippled . <p> My favourite tip is n't that obscure , but after visiting the Forbidden City head to JingShan Park across the road . As one of the only hills in the city , it gives an uninterrupted 360-degree panorama . <p> After all this walking around , try a foot massage . US$10 will get you two hours of pampering , including healthy snacks and fruit juices . <h> I love Beijing because <p> There 's a lot not to love " the pollution can be terrible , the crowds overwhelming and the traffic deadly , but once you cut through all of that and get on the streets the variety is amazing . <p> Everywhere you look you can find the blurring of borders between East &amp; West , new &amp; old , traditional and contemporary . Walk through the quieter areas and every corner has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange going on . <p> There are n't enough capital cities where you do n't bat an eyelid when you see someone in their pyjamas singing opera and walking backwards with their pet bird to an alfresco tea dance . <h> Plan Your Trip to Beijing 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation in Beijing <p> Booking.com has 1,000+ properties in Beijing including hotels , apartments , and guesthouses .

They are some of the wisest animal species on our planet . <p> For many , - the thought of traveling to Africa is enough to send them scurrying under their bed with fear . If you follow our Africa travel safety tips- you 'll soon see there is nothing to fear . <p> Budget travel in Africa is possible as Africa in general is incredibly cheap . The cost of day to day living , transport , and accommodation helps to make Africa a budget destination . <p> What gets expensive are the cost of safaris , wildlife viewing , and other adventure activities . <p> Getting around East and South Africa- for your wildlife viewing does come at a price , but there are many transportation options to suit each travelers budget , desired experiences and comfort levels . <p> There are numerous safari game parks in Africa . But I recommend you select only those you most want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are present , and the season in which you are traveling . <p> Here are four safari game parks that we personally visited : <h> Masai Mara Game Park , Kenya <p> motherly love <p> This was the first safari game park we visited and so has the " first love " attachment for me . <p> The memory of riding through the savannah in an open topped van is still strong in my mind . <p> Experiencing the plains dotted far and wide with zebra and wildebeest ; giraffes loping by in the distance , stopping for lunch under the shade of an acacia ; watching cheetahs on the hunt and seeing my first ever lion kill of a- wildebeest- in front of us will never leave me . <p> And then at night , we camped around the fire talking to a Masai warrior as he shared tales with us of life as a fierce nomadic warrior who fight lions and leopards with their bare hands . <h> How to get there : <p> The Masai Mara is approximately 280 kms west from Nairobi City . Driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , Namibia <p> water hole at sunset <p> Etosha , meaning " Great White Place " is dominated by a massive dry salt pan which fills only if the rains are heavy and even then only holds water for a short time . <p> This temporary water in the Etosha Pan attracts impressive flocks of flamingos and the perennial springs along the edges of the Etosha Pan draw large concentrations of wildlife and birds . <p> Etosha is one of those parks known for night time animal viewing around the waterholes . <p> We unfortunately went during the wrong season , the rainy season , with the best time being from May to September . <p> We did n't  see much as the animals had ample watering holes elsewhere in the park so did n't  need to come to the floodlit ones near our camp . <p> We did , however , see a lot of animals during the day . <p> As a visitor to Etosha you can expect to see many buck species , elephant , giraffe , rhino and lions . And there is a network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various waterholes . <p> you see many Zebra Hello Mr Ostrich some buckpeek-a-boo on the great salt pan Rain storm and wildebeast <h> How to get there : <p> Etosha is approximately 6 hours drive from Windhoek . The road is good tarmac and can easily be driven in one day . <h> Kruger National Park , South Africa <p> It boasts the most diverse game viewing experience in Africa . In terms of facilities and the range of accommodation offered , no national park anywhere in the world can match what Kruger National Park has to offer . <p> Kruger is abundant in wildlife , has an extensive and developed road system , and has many camp grounds and lodging options . From affordable Self-Catering family bungalows to luxury Private Game Lodges with all the trimmings " it 's all here . <p> After several months of trying to find the elusive leopard , we finally saw one sleeping in a tree and another stalking off into the bushes . <p> Be warned that the park is massive . You will have to choose carefully as to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  try to see to much . Stick to one pocket and use that as a base to explore . <p> Our favorite area of Kruger was around the Lower Sabie Rest Camp- on the banks of the Sabie River , which draws a wide variety of animals all year round . <p> Also , make sure you leave room in your budget for a night time drive and a guided safari walk . <p> Exhilarating as you stand up wind from rhinos grazing and miss lions by minutes , experiencing instead the lingering trace of their pungent smell . <p> Addo is a sanctuary to over 550 elephants , lions , buffalo , black rhino , spotted hyena , leopard , a variety of antelope and zebra species , as well as the unique Addo flightless dung beetle , found almost exclusively in Addo . <p> follow meall inthe big and the not so **35;1327;TOOLONG <h> How to get there : <p> Fly : The nearest domestic airport is in Port Elizabeth , 75km from the park . A number of hire car agencies have depots at the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Park by vehicle is approximately 9 hours . <h> Tips for the Best Wildlife Encounters <h> - Plan in Advance : <p> Decide what animals you want to see , as some animals are only found in certain parks . <p> Going to many different parks all over the continent will cost you . So prioritize and go for the game parks that will allow you to see the greatest variety of wildlife . <h> Which Season is Best ? <p> In the dry season the grass is short making it easier to spot wildlife . Also , choice of drinking water holes for the- animals will be fewer so they are moving around more in search of water so your chances of watching them socialise at waterholes is greater . <p> So find yourself a water hole and chances are you will have some company . <p> In the wet season the grass is long making viewing more difficult and they have many options for water holes so do n't  need to roam as much . <h> Animal Viewing : <p> Animals are most active at dusk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , so during the day the animals are usually hibernating in the shade . <p> Be sure to do the same thing yourself . If your excitement is too hard to contain and you go out during the day , the only result will be that you chew up your fuel budget , and an eventual visit to the chiropractor for neck strain . <p> Get up real early to catch the animals at play , rest during the day , - and then go out again just before sundown . <p> HOT TIP : <p> Lions like to sleep on the road at night to soak up the day 's heat trapped in the tar . If you 're up early enough you can usually run into one on the road . There were several times we turned a corner to find a lioness resting on the warm tar . <h> Take a Guided Night Drive : <p> In Kruger Park you can only go on night drives organized at your accommodation . All gates to accommodations close by nightfall and you better be locked safe and sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an open topped vehicle with a huge spot light and a guide to tell you more about what you see as you drive around the park , hearing the sounds and seeing the sites of nighttime Africa . <h> Go on a Guided Walking Safari : <p> You can do this in Kruger Park also . Getting on the- ground with these magnificent beasts in their territory will get your heart pumping . <p> We did n't have as much action as anticipated , but we did get close to rhinos ( downwind ) and we smelled the fear of the lions running away from us in the distance . <h> Photography : <p> Be patient . Spotting your favorite animals can take time . <p> Spend the money to buy a good lens , at the very minimum a 300mm zoom but preferably a 600mm zoom lens . Animals are scared of you , they wo n't come close for a portrait , and you wo n't sneak up closer to them ( I hope ) . <p> You 've spent all the money , time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these wild animals , you want to have something to take away from it and keep with you for memories and reflection . <h> Safety : <p> Never ever ever , and I mean ever get out of your car , unless in a safe designated area , or with an armed ranger present . <p> This is the wild , do n't mess with it . I know this sounds a bit like a No shit Sherlock ' kind of statement , but you will be surprised at how many people get eaten by lions trying to get that perfect shot . <p> Keep a safe distance when you encounter a wild animal and when in your vehicle keep your windows rolled up . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Amazing photos !

In my opinion , the more remote , the better . In South Africa , I stayed at Mala Mala which is adjacent to Kruger . The big advantage is that the land is privately owned so the rangers can take you off road which gives you a far better chance to see wildlife . <p> My last safari was in Selous in Tanzania which was incredible . We hardly saw another person all day . Lovely photos ! ! <p> My walking safari in Botswana was really one of the high points of my life ; I am anxious to see Kruger and the others as well . I love to read about a place before I go there , and this novel about South Africa has totally captured my imaginationwhich will have to hold me for awhile . <p> Thanks for this post- Im heading to Kenya and Tanzania in a couple of months and this information is incredibly helpful .

We stayed at the Serena Safari Lodge , and the location and service was absolutely phenomenal . Take a look here : LONG ... <p> I am in the process of selecting an African safari park destination(s) for a 2013 journey along with my family and a couple of other families as well . Our objective is to see the Big 5 and personally I want to use my camera . From your experience , can you help answer the following questions ? <p> 1 . Please list the top three ( ranked ) safari park destinations in Africa ? 2 . What is the best way to see the parks ? Independently or with a tour company ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / best tour company ? Do you have any recommendations ? 3 . The best time of the year to visit the parks , though the time that may best work for us given our schedule will be between May and August . <p> Hi Aunupam , It is difficult to answer these questions but will do my best . <p> 1 . It all depends on who is ranking them . Each park is noted for different things and as there are so many park destinations in Africa , you really need to narrow it down to a particular region or country . Some of the most well known ones , and for good reason are Serengetti , Masai Mara , Kruger National Park , Okavanga Delta , and ETosha . I would also say Addo is great for viewing elephants . <p> 2 . It all depends on how much money and time you have . Its great to have your own vehicle and camp within the parks . I prefer this way of doing it and then doing tours once inside the parks such as a guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Massai as it was more practical and would have worked out cheaper taking into consideration time and distance . Its best to organize tours from the towns nearby to the parks . Do some research online before you go to get an idea of what tour companies are in the area . <p> 3 . You will have to research this online . It all depends on what countries you are going to as they all have different best times . You want to go in the drier seasons as you will see more animals . <p> You are very lucky . Do you discover this beautiful places . I have to visit , I love to explore new places .

Thanks so much . <p> I always think it is hard to beat South Africa . I loved Uganda , although you wo n't get scuba diving there ! NAmibia is a fantastic country . Etosha is one of Africas best parks , just be sure you are there during the dry season or it is difficult to see the animals . Also Kenya is great and should be safe enough .

@@21820857 @1820857/ <h> What makes a place livable ? <p> After being a nomad for so many years , it 's hard to visit a place without evaluating it in terms of whether it is livable . <p> On our travels around the world , Craig and I have caught ourselves saying so many times " I could live here " . I 'm sure you 've said it too . But living in a place , and visiting a place , are two very different things ! <p> Before I started traveling , I thought the perfect place was Australia near the beach . Then for the next 10 years , I lived far from the beach in metropolitan areas . My definition of what makes a place livable changed , and if there is a beach or not , rarely gets factored in . <p> For some , they 'd base it on job opportunities , which is understandable , but it 's something that has never really factored into my equation . Most people can find a job in any place if you believe you can . <p> I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really make my heart sing the most . <h> What makes a place livable ? <h> Climate <p> Climate is a major factor in what makes a place livable . I used to think it was about being hot all the time , so Thailand came up trumps . <p> But , I lived in Raleigh , North Carolina where it sometimes snowed and I loved it . What makes a place livable is more about a balanced and consistent climate . <p> I can handle cold winters , if I know they just last x number of months each year and the lifestyle caters to the cold . Most of Australia is really slipping in my list because of this . <p> This may seem crazy to most , as Australia has this image of hot and sunny weather . The north of Australia is HOT , although it has a wet season so it 's not always dry . But , for the past 3 years I 've found the weather in Australia to be so inconsistent , it 's driving me crazy . And a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I first started drafting this post in December , I was wearing my UGG boots and freezing . - At least in Raleigh , I knew in October it would start to get cold and then in April it would get warm again . Without fail . <h> Location <p> The place we eventually settle down in has to be in a location that is accessible and close to a vibrant city , I 'm thinking 1 hour maximum and day trips . <p> Bright , Victoria is one of my favourite places in Australia and is one I could definitely live in , except its too far away from a big city . If only it was an hour away from Melbourne instead of three . <p> I do n't  think we could live in Perth , because it is the remotest city in the world and would cost us a fortune if we wanted to go to a lot of places we love , internationally and domestically . <h> Vibrancy <p> I need to live in a place that has a little bit of action and lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biking trails . Even if I am not going out to enjoy the nightlife , I love it if the option is there for everyone else in the town . <p> I also need live concerts and festivals , and sporting matches and fun new places to visit . <p> We felt we were slowly dying in our hometown you could n't get a coffee after 4:00pm . We 've also previously lived on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland , a beautiful part of the world , but a little quiet for us at the time , and were not huge fans of Brisbane , 1 hour to the south . Maybe the Gold Coast , being bigger , would suit us more . <h> Open Spaces <p> Tokyo would not be for me . I like the vibrancy of a big city , but I do n't like them so big and crazy that I feel squashed and unable to process the frenetic energy . <p> We absolutely loved our 6 months living in Bangkok , but it used to get a little too much for me with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a place to chill out . ( Although these- 6 places work ! ) <p> London , although big and populated , always seemed so spacious- except for when you rode the tube . And Raleigh , was like the perfect sized city . Enough vibrancy , but plenty of space and clean air . <p> Melbourne is currently doing a GREAT JOB of checking off vibrancy + open spaces . <h> Nature <p> I got ta have nature , any way you can dish it out . I need beaches , lakes or rivers and nearby mountains and forests . Do n't just give me a concrete jungle . <p> Mentally and energetically , I 'd go insane if I lived in a place that did not allow me to connect to nature . <h> Outdoor living <p> I need the focus to be on the outdoors . It 's the biggest reason why we left Dublin . Stuck inside 2/3 of the year due to the incessant drizzle . Hell NO ! I want to be out walking and exercising and exploring nature . <p> I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's like peak hour , people are up power walking , jogging , kayaking , swimming , letting loose their energy and gathering more for the day ahead . <h> Good transport system / walkable <p> Aha , this is one that Raleigh failed on , but London came up trumps ! Dublin also won on the most walkable city to live . Melbourne has a ton of great transport options from cycle ways to trams to trains to walking . <p> I do n't  ' like driving much . I 'd much prefer to walk or cycle from point A to B , or if not to easily jump on some form of public transport . <p> And it MUST have an international airport close by . <h> Cost of living <p> I 've always wanted to live in Sydney , but have n't its probably because of this reason . Although there are some great free things in Sydney as a visitor . <p> Let 's face it , at the end of the day , we might find the most livable place in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  matter . <h> Job opportunities <p> We 're so fortunate we have our own digital business , so we really do n't  have to worry about this . I know many do . You might find your paradise , but if there is no work , then it has to stay just a dream . <p> When we lived in Raleigh , my teaching job was a 40 minute drive away , so I guess you can say there were no job opportunities in Raleigh . But because it was so livable , we decided to live in Raleigh , and I 'd just commute each day . <p> If you have n't worked it out already , you can see why Raleigh is probably the most livable place for us at the moment . It really did check off the majority of our lists . <p> Melbourne comes close , except the weather is a major issue for me , and as mentioned the Gold Coast in Queensland is also attractive . <p> Let 's see if we can find another possible candidate on our #yTravelOz road trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a great list of what makes a place liveable ! I like big cities , but I also like being outdoors , so that has to play a factor I think I 'll consult this list when it comes down to decision time ! There 's so many places in the world to choose from . <p> Honestly I 'm coming to the conclusion that nowhere is " livable " as EVERYWHERE gets boring after a few months . I want to do different hikes , not the same X number hikes within an hour of a destination etc . <p> I love this post . And relate entirely . I think you 've done a superlative job in deciding what makes a place right for you . When we visit a town , city , region , I always do the same think , " Could I live in this place ? " I think one thing that always comes up trumps is the emotional aspect . Without sounding all Woo Woo , there 's just something about some places that says , " Hi , you 're home , welcome home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish list . <p> Oh gosh yes ! That is probably the best and only way to decide . Gut instinct always is right . As soon as I landed in Raleigh and drove past the pine trees , I had a huge welcome home . It was unreal how this place I knew nothing about suddenly spoke to my spirit about being home . It was such a surreal moment . <p> Our family is constantly looking for the perfect place to live . Oxford , UK was perfect pre-kids , then Christchurch , NZ pre-earthquake . Currently Canberra is home and ticks all our boxes although I am still keeping an eye out for other possibilities . <p> That is a great reflective post . Also interesting to see you open up with a picture of Flinders Street Station in recent years Melbourne has been getting voted as the most livable city in the world . <p> I often think of myself of being someone who prefers the quiet village life and rural , peaceful settings . Yet when I visit cities like Melbourne and Toronto I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did live in Melbourne , unfortunately the relocation fell through at the last minute . <p> I agree open spaces and climate are two very important factors for a picking a city to live . Lots of options for recreation is also good . I guess , keeping the cost of living aside , Australia is pretty livable . <p> I would add Cultural Affinity ! ! I 've lived in Paris and although it checks all the boxes for livable I just did n't  like the culture . Alternatively , you can live in a dump in Bangkok but if you love the culture , language , and food , all of those extra boxes can go unnoticed ! ! <p> It depends , if I have kids then I rather choose a small town over the city . They need room , playgrounds to play in , fields to play soccer . And you do n't  have that in a big city . Maybe a nice , quite suburb will do . <p> I was raised in a small town , so I am not really a city person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing . <p> I have to say that If I have to choose a city in Australia where I wan na live , then that would be Melbourne . <p> It is laidback , it has sunshine and rain , beaches , nice parks , very artistic and alternative and the people are nice . <p> I have n't made a checklist like yours , but you 're right , like every time I visited a place which I like , usually a laid back city , like in Bukittinggi or Ubud , I would say that I need to stay or even live here longer Although we know that visiting and living in a city is a two different thing . <p> But I should try to make a check list like yours soon , and try to live longer in a place and see = <p> I love this post Caz , youve really hit on some great criteria . I think climate is pretty high on my list as well , I say to my husband frequently " I want to live where is is 25-35 all year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I could live in a place that had a nice balancing act of all four seasons .

I have wanted to spend a week exploring between Savannah and Charleston for the longest time and have it on the calender for next spring . Ill bookmark this post for the future . <p> We love Savannah , could live there for awhile . it is a really different part of America . We did about a 9 week road trip to cover these areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout our stay in Raleigh <p> Caz great write-up ! It had a really nice balance between the descriptions and pictures . <p> My wife , Chris , was in Savannah last year and she really liked it more so than Charleston . I have not been there , but I found it interesting , since Charleston gets more historical fame than Savannah , and everyone talks about the southern houses there . Most of my east coast experience has been in Florida and Virginia to New Jersey ( because we use to live in DC and Philly ) . <p> How was the Australian Bakery Cafe and how did it stack up against what you are used to ? By the way , how would you characterize Aussie food ? I guessing seafood , since your large cities are coastal , but I do n't  really know . <p> Chris and I also lived at separate times a combined 11 years in and around New Orleans ( or if you are a local , its Nawlins ) . Like the song says , " Do you know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and I love the music and food there ! I probably would n't be used to enduring the the heat and humidity now . If you have done enough US traveling , its easy to say that all the regions are different , but New Orleans is truly the only city in the US that is truly unique , in my opinion they do n't  follow any music trends or food trends of the rest of the US its kind of insulated from all the come-and-go trends of the rest of the US , so they just kind of do things their own way with their own culture . Chris is in a Mardi Gras Krewe , so we go there every other year to do that ( and party ) . You are right about Bourbon St you have to do it once , but none of the locals go there elsewhere in the Quarter or Uptown is better . I hope you found Pat OBriens for a super tall hurricane . Also , if you are ever back there , you can take a riverboat plantation home tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , and they also have an Oak Alley plantation . Laissez les bon temps rouler ! <p> I really love the Savannah cemetery picture with the tree in bloom and spanish moss hanging off it very nice . <p> Thank you for your enthusiastic reply and recommendations . I can tell how much you love this area . Craig and I always debate over whether we like Charleston or Savannah more . I think after our last visit we chose Savannah . I loved the squares and the riverfront and nearby Tybee Island . Seemed a bit more relaxed and friendly . The Australian Bakery Cafe was awesome and after two years without a meat pie they tasted great . It is hard to categorize Aussie food , we do n't  really have much that is unique to us . Seafood is big , and then we have meat pies and sausage rolls and lots of different cakes and pastries which you can get at the Aussie bakery cafe . I think New Orleans is definitely Americas most unique city . We talked about that when we were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to do the riverboat plantation home tour . And we did n't  find the hurricanes at Pat O Briens . We just grabbed one from the street . Because we had Kalyra with us , no drinking establishments would let us inside.Two more things to add to the list when we return . <p> What a great post ! I 've done some travelling in Virginia . Totally recommend Colonial Williamsburg , and DC of course , its a wonderful city with so many sights , the Smithsonians , etc ! Virginia also has some nice beaches , but my Virginian friends always go to the Outer Banks in the summer . <p> Looks and sounds like you guys had an awesome road trip . This guide is really extensive and informative and I will be sure to take it with me the next time I road trip down south . I would add Shoneys ! The greatest most artery clogging buffet in the world . Also , JBs fish camp in Daytona beach FL . Cheap and delicious seafood right on the lagoon . You can even get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my car and get going . Seriously , thanks for the inspiration to plan a southeast road trip . <p> Anyone taking this tripbe sure to have some North Carolina BBQ . I also like to have grits when I 'm in the south , but I realize its not for everyone . Okra is another regional food , usually fried , that you might find interesting . <p> Caz I agree about the beer . Its one of the reasons I traveled inland to Asheville , North Carolina . Definitely worth the trip just for the beer and food . The pristine mountains and the Biltmore are icing on the cake . <p> The plantation homes are really fascinating . I 've always been intrigued by it as well . Charleston and Savannah are the best places to get a sense of how life was back then and the homes are just gorgeous . <p> I love this post . I was born in and grew up in Durham , NC . My parents now live in Wilmington . We just got back from almost 3 weeks of vacationing there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast . My mom in Beaufort , and my Dad in Morehead . We had a blast ! We usually make the trek to Ft Fisher for the beach . I like Wrightsville , but not crazy about how you have to pay to park ( a long time ago it was free ) wow I sound really old .. lol . We also went to Beaufort and saw family , did the Maritime musuem on front street with the kids , and I got to visit my grandparents graves . I miss them a lot . Thanks so much for the post . NC is awesome . <p> = This was nice to see the photos from the south . I 'm from SC and miss those giant live oaks and spanish moss . I miss NC , too . I once lived in a tent off of the Blue Ridge Pkwy near the Appalachian Trail for a few months . Near Graveyard FIelds and mile marker 420 , cliche I know ; ) - Thanks for sharing ! <p> This is a great summary ! Im inspired because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NC and Ive yet to visit a couple of these places ! Ill have to put them on my list for this summer ! Another notable mention in Florida is Caladisi Island which is not far outside of Tampa . It was also rated Americas Best Beach in 2008 . Virginia is quite beautiful and we recently rode the Virginia Creeper Trail ( 17 mile downhill bike ride ) . It was an easy ride and there are plenty of places to stop and rest ! If you 're still looking I 'd be happy to offer suggestions , too ! Thank you for sharing this Caz = <p> Hi my hubby &amp; I have a 5 night stay paid for at Clearwater to take in May . We want to take a road trip from Carolina to end there so would really appreciate some suggestions on best route &amp; stopovers for a trip I have never been to states before but he did in his distant youth ! <h> Trackbacks <p> and well being on this trail but these can also serve as good reminders for any hiking that you do.East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an east coast road trip , Caz and Craig do put <p> quite a few suggestions for places to stop at from Caz &amp; Craig of yTravelBlog who shared their East Coast Road Tripping Highlights with us , we would love tips on what to see and what veggie-friendly foods to eat on our stops ,

Just taking a swim , a walk or celebrating one of the magic sunsets with a cold drink is enough to cast that spell over you that many ca n't escape from . <p> I 'm not a surfer but I love the beaches in Byron and can see and feel the excitement of the guys and gals who get up at the crack of dawn to hit the waves . <p> For me , I appreciate that they 're clean , sheltered , family friendly and not overdeveloped with high-rises . And ranging in temperature from 18-C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my kind of beach that you can enjoy all year round . <h> The Byron Bay Beaches <h> 1 . Main Beach Byron Bay <p> They do n't  call it Main Beach for nothing . Its where it all happens in Byron Bay well , most of it . <p> Its the closest beach to town and the most popular . If you 've ever seen a postcard of Byron I bet it was of Main Beach . <p> With a north-facing curve comes a popular surf break , soft white sand , turquoise water , a surf patrol for the kids and INCREDIBLE sunsets . <p> Main Beach is the quintessential Aussie beach . <p> Not to mention it has the iconic Byron Lighthouse keeping watch from the distant headland , which you must walk up to , and the legendary pub across the road , the Beach Hotel which is great for a Sunday session . <p> What else do you want in your Byron Bay Beach town ? <p> We walked it daily , jumped in the waves , sat on the rocks , built sandcastles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeaway fish &amp; chips from Mongers , burgers from BayGer , or $5 pizzas from Dominos and sat on the grass as the sun went down and watched the fire dancers great free entertainment for the kids ( they perform for tips ) . <h> 2 . Clarkes Beach <p> Around the bay to the east is Clarkes . This is where we stayed in our camper trailer at Clarkes Beach Holiday Park and stumbled onto the sand every morning . What an awesome spot to sleep . <p> Its only a 10-minute walk to Byron Bay town from Clarkes Beach and another friendly place to swim with your kids , and less people than Main Beach . There 's some rocky areas for snorkeling and do n't  miss the breakfast views from the Byron Beach Cafe . <p> Byron Beach Cafe <h> 3 . The Pass <p> At the end of the bay further east from Clarkes Beach is The Pass . <p> We climbed up the Fishermans Lookout which is a set of stairs with a viewing platform and watched the early morning surfers carve up the waves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired me to grab a board and have a lesson . The surfing looked awesome with long smooth waves which seemed like they went all the way into Clarkes Beach . <h> 4 . Wategos Beach <p> It was love at first site for Caz and I when we first set eyes on Wategos Beach twelve years ago , and its still on our list of best beaches in Australia and one that we tell everyone about ( sorry locals ) . <p> What a beach . <p> Crystal clear water , rocks dotted along the sand , gentle rolling waves perfect for the long-boarders doing their thing , and its sheltered and safe for the kiddies . We never visit Byron Bay without going to Wategos Beach . <p> If you do n't  ride a long-board at least dive in the water and then make use of the free BBQs or the cafe on site and enjoy paradise . <p> A little further round over the path from Wategos is Little Wategos . Go here if you 're looking for a lovely sheltered spot for snorkeling , sunbathing or swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've only looked down upon Tallows Beach from the Lighthouse walk we did , which is an awesome view by the way , and Tallows is a long stretch of beach all the way to the south . <p> Apparently Tallows Beach is a good spot for some beach fishing , whilst Cosy Corner which is tucked just below Cape Byron has a good surf break in favourable conditions . <p> But be warned , we actually saw a surfer being rescued who was getting swept out to sea in the strong current around Cape Byron whilst we were up at the Lighthouse . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I fell in love with Byron Bay the moment I stepped foot on Tallows Beach . It was actually raining a little , it was about this time of year , end of May-ish , so not the hottest . Yet there was something just so special about the place . Ive been meaning to go back every since <p> Being a Gold Coast girl I love to day trip to Byron for its laid back lifestyle and gorgeous beaches . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunning . However Broken Head about 20 minutes south of Byron is my absolute favorite beach to really getaway . <p> Byron Bay is one place I have n't been to yet in Australia . I 've done the coastal road trip from Melbourne to Sydney but no further . Next one must be from Sydney up to Northern Queensland . Tallows Beach looks amazing . http ; **29;1392;TOOLONG <p> I am lucky enough to spend every UK winter in Byron Bay . Its now my second home and just adore it , despite the humidity ! Top tip : you can now fly straight into Ballina . Nearer and no time zone changes . Will be doing a blog on my favourite places there soon .

@@21820862 @1820862/ <h> 9 Places to See Before You Die <p> There are many great places to travel in the world and witness with your own eyes , but there are some which are almost required to see firsthand . <p> These are places which almost everyone has seen in the history books , along with various television shows . Most often they are featured as locations for the plots of many a popular story , television show or movie . <p> Travel is becoming more affordable as the number of cheap international flights increase , making it easier than ever to get out and see the world . <p> It will be hard to choose only nine places to see before you die , since which ones are a better sight is a matter of opinion . However , we will give it a try and start out with nine . <h> Top 9 Places to See Before You die <h> 9 . The Grand Canyon <p> Photo : krandolph <p> While you might think this would be mostly for those in the United States , the Grand Canyon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyon carved over the tens of thousands of years by the Colorado River . <p> Pictures do not truly do justice to the sheer size of the Grand Canyon . Being able to stand near the edge and see the huge rock walls which span for well over 200 miles . <h> 8 . The Great Wall of China <p> The Great Wall of China is first structure ever constructed by man to be visible from space , so this is certainly a must see . When you stand on the Great Wall , looking down towards the horizon and seeing that it stretches beyond , it can be hard to imagine that this was built by human hands . <p> Being over 5,000 miles long , this truly is a marvel to behold . It is hard to imagine just how much labor went into the construction , and if you plan the proper tour , you will even see some of the many statues contained inside . <p> Each of these terracotta statues are life-sized , and individually numbered . It is estimated that inside the Great Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the name Terracotta Army . <h> 7 . Easter Island <p> This small island in the Pacific is n't very interesting by itself . The ancient culture used up all the trees before vanishing , possibly to aid in the construction of the many 13 foot tall statues that line the island . <p> Not much is known about why or who created them , and while we have seen pictures they just do n't  convey the sheer size of these 10-14 ton behemoths . <p> It has been speculated that the peoples responsible for these statues left when the island was running out of resources . They have been a focus of study for quite a long time , and have inspired some truly unique stories . <h> 6 . Venice <p> The canal streets of Venice Italy are truly unique in the world , and to see firsthand just how people go about their daily lives is an interesting experience . <p> The city was built on over 100 small islands , which made travel by boat a necessity . With such easy access to sea trade routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became known as an industrial center . <p> Taking a guided tour down the many canal streets is a truly unique experience which can not be replicated . Every faucet of modern living as we know it will be different when your roads are canals . <h> 5 . The Taj Mahal <p> Photo : sprague7 <p> This huge mausoleum was built in the 1600s at a time when most people would not have thought it possible to create such a magnificent place . While many people might think that this is one huge building , it is actually made up of many smaller structures , which all add up to make the place truly beautiful when viewed by the naked eye . <p> The large white dome is a world renowned landmark and although people have tried to replicate the look , it just is n't the same . Even from afar this is truly a sight to behold , but what is even more spectacular are the decorations on the buildings themselves . <p> Calligraphy carved into the side and many small adornments that were painstakingly handcrafted have held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's standards considered very impressive . <p> To this day much effort is put into maintaining , both the Taj Mahal itself , and the grounds surrounding the area so that you are surely to not be disappointed . <h> 4 . Angkor Wat <p> The name of this place means " city temple " and this exactly what it is . Located in Cambodia , Angkor Wat is an example of what truly marvelous structures can be created without the aid of technology . <p> The large statues carved inside the structure itself is what most people think of when hearing the name , but seeing the great temple from afar truly is impressive . <p> For anyone wanting to see great examples of architecture , Angkor Wat has to be high on their list . As there is so much to take in , you would be wise to schedule a guided tour so that you are sure not to miss out on the more interesting aspects of the city temples design . <h> 3 . The Great Barrier Reef <p> The Great Barrier Reef is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of many smaller reefs which span for over 1600 miles . <p> The large abundance of colorful sea life make this a real hotspot for divers worldwide . If you are lucky enough to view this spectacle from the air you will see just how large this reef really is . <p> Reefs are composed of millions of tiny creatures , so one of this size would take untold ages to be able to form as it has . <h> 2 . Petra , Jordan <p> No one really knows just who built this great city in the mountain walls . <p> The very large entry ways which can be over 14 feet tall have inspired many tales of a city inhabited by giants . It is estimated that the city itself is well over 3,000 years old , and served many purposes over its ancient history . <p> It has been reported to be a capital , caravan trading post , as well as a temple of sorts and has been ruled by several different cultures . <p> The hardness of the stone must have made construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 1 . Great Pyramid of Giza <p> The Great Pyramid of Giza has been chosen for number one as it is one of the most widely known ancient structures in existence . <p> It was built precisely to match the geographic directions of the compass , proving that mankind could indeed manipulate numbers back in ancient times to create great marvels of engineering . <p> While all of the other pyramids have a recorded history , and are proven to serve as a tomb , the Great Pyramids reason for being built is largely unknown . <p> The top of the pyramid is missing though many believe from ancient writings that it was a huge piece of gold that would shine from the horizon . <p> When looking at pictures , you have to envision that many centuries of erosion and vandalism have changed the way this site looks . The outer walls were made of highly polished stone , which make some scientists believe that it would shine bright enough at parts of the day to have been visible from orbit around the Earth itself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to behold is based on personal preference , but this does not mean that these are not must see places before you die . <p> The many photographs available truly do not let you behold and feel the presence of these unique places around the world . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Nicely listed ! I 've got at least one more to add : Macchu Picchu . I 've seen many beautiful places , and this old Inca settlement in Peru one is high on my amazing things Ive seen list . A magical place . <p> thanks for your comments Sarah Wu , am with you , i have not seen any of these myself . Though my writing team has visited all of them and hence it was possible to compile the list . <p> Taj Mahal is on top of my list to visit , because it is also the closest . Would like to see " Angkor Wat " soon , always wanted to , due to the temples . I love those rock carvings anyway , so Petra is always on my list . Among other places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a ride on the gondolas , it would be amazing . <p> It is hard to choose , i just hope in time , i make a visit to all of those . <p> Usually when it comes to these lists of places you should see before you die , they always pick places I 've never gone to . Surprisingly Ive been to three ( Grand Canyon , Venice and The Louvre ) . Of course a lot of people might argue there 's a lot more out there than this . But this is certainly a good start . <p> Not a good way to begin the weekend depressed because I have only been to two of these places . Just let me get a coffee , then I 'll reread and instead of being depressed will be inspired and determined to see the rest ! <p> @islandmomma , thanks for your comment , do n't  be too depressed , sooner or later you will get to visit them all . I have covered almost all of India , yet the only place from India that i put on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to visit . <p> I remember when i wrote the ten top beaches article on my blog , i was deeply depressed because i wanted to visit them right away . <p> When I was in India I intended visiting the Taj Mahal but I met up with a young man who was horrified that I wanted to see a place built by cruelty and blood he explained that the craftsmen who built it had their hands cut off so they could n't replicate the work . Put me right off , something so beautiful stands as monument to the suffering of those poor people . <p> @Vicki Edmunds , thanks for your comment , unfortunately , it is true . And it is , after all , the grave of Mumtaz Mahal . But all things agreed , it is still one of the most beautiful structures available in the present day earth . <p> With regards to the top of the Great Pyramid missing that 's inaccurate . In my most recent trip to Egypt ( 2009 ) , the top of the pyramid was actually displayed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris . <p> Petra seems so hot right now ! I keep hearing about it . I 'd love to check it out . Ive been to some of the places on this list , including Angkor Wat , the GBR and the Grand Canyon , and agree they are amazing destinations . <p> Petra was a marvelous experience and I am so glad we made it there before we have to turn in our traveling shoes . Keep in mind that Petra is limestone . Its weather beaten and getting worse . It will no doubt be gone by natural causes within 50-100 years . ( If i 'm wrong , somebody please corret this . ) Go before its too late . <p> Wow ! Excellent list ! Now I have to start saving a million dollars and start a nomad trip to these places . My favorites are The Great Barrier Reef and The Louvre . I have a great fascination with art . and Ive always been in love with the beach and the sea . <p> Nice job . Its hard to pick just 10 places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have seen 9 of them ( still missing Easter Island ) . I agree that Macchu Picchu would be a great addition , but otherwise I 'd be hard pressed to come up with a better list . <p> thanks Bob Riel for your comment , am glad you found this list good . Yeah , there can be a few more additions to it , the one that you mention was on my mind too , but it is hard to remove any that are already on the list . Next time i just need to make a longer list . <p> I have been lucky enough to have traveled to 2 of those places ( Louvre and Venice ) . I am sad I have not yet been to the Grand Canyon because I live in the USA and right next door . One day I will get there . Living in California I think that The Sierras are a wonderful destination . I love camping and if anyone travels here , you should head to Yosemite , Sequoia , Kings Canyon , Mammoth .. any of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muir Trail ( JMT ) or the Pacific Crest Trail ( PCT ) . I hope to be able to do those trips in my lifetime . Maybe not a Top 10 but up there . <p> Last Year I read a book called " Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed " by Jared Diamond . He has done extensive research on Easter Island and the statues there . He explains how and why the statues were built and what happened to the people . If anyone is interested in it I suggest you read the book . It is very good . <p> @Lisa Rosas , thanks for your comments . It is a good idea to leave the close destinations for the later travel , they can be easily covered when ever you want but the far ones need more planning , so good to know that you have already traveled the distance and visited 2 of the 10 mentioned on the list . <p> Also , thanks for recommending the book on Easter Islands , will try to get it from the library if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate article on mountains , actually if you notice , there are no beaches mentioned as well because mountains/beaches etc. falls in a separate category . It is hard to make these lists because ten is a very small number when you try to cover the entire world . <p> However , Nepal is a great place to visit , next time will make a longer list and include all the recommendations on it . <p> wooowwhat a beautiful world . Sri Lanka.A land Like no other . Set in the Indian Ocean in South Asia , the tropical island nation of Sri Lanka has a history dating back to the birth of time . It is a place where the original soul of Buddhism still flourishes and where nature 's beauty remains abundant and unspoilt . <p> Few places in the world can offer the traveller such a remarkable combination of stunning landscapes , pristine beaches , captivating cultural heritage and unique experiences within such a compact location . Within a mere area of 65,610 kilometres lie 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites , 1,330 kilometres of coastline much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wildlife , nearly 500,000 acres of lush tea estates , 250 acres of botanical gardens , 350 waterfalls , 25,000 water bodies , to a culture that extends back to over 2,500 years . <p> I am more into nature , rather than building : ) . Ive been to Venice more than 10 times and Ive seen the Pyramids as well . My visit to the Pyramids lasted 1h or so and it was a huge dissapoiment . Not much to see honestly and many people around you just asking for money . I 'd take that down from the list honestly . I agree with Venice . I would add either Galapagos ( I did n't  see it ) or Socotra Island ( I have visited it ) . <p> The Great Wall and the Terracotta Warriors are two completely different sites . The Great Wall is nice but the Warriors are truly a sight to behold . Especially if you know a little of their history first . <p> Wow ! ! ! I 've actually been to 7 out of these 9 places and am planning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ! ! ! So that leaves me with only one left that I have n't seen yet Easter Islsnd ! ! ! And that will be when I get to visit my #1 destination islands in Paradise : Tahiti and Bora Bora in the South Pacific Hopefully some time soon ! ! ! <p> I saw 1-6 , hope to see the Easter Island , not sure about China and the Grand Canyon . Some other favourites of mine : Uluru/Australia , Prague/Czech Republic , Siena ( Tuscany/Italy ) and Sulawesi/Indonesia = <p> There many worthwhile places in the Americas as well . Most people seem to put a great emphasis on places similar to this , however . Mexico for example has many archeological sites whose history rival the Egyptian sites . Same goes for Bolivia , Peru , various places in Central America . <p> ytravelblog.comPetra is another destination that encourages you to continue learning in your twenties . You can learn all about their rock-cut architecture before you 're old enough to worry about the architecture in your own home .

Nomadic Matt mentioned how much he disliked it when Americans put Canadian flags on their backpacks , trying to deny their nationality . Im shocked by the reality of this and it does nothing to dispel the myth that Americans are horrible people to be avoided at all costs . <p> Is there an American hiding under there ? <h> Why are some Americans pretending to be Canadians ? <p> What is the world meant to think when their own people are trying to pretend they are not from the USA ? As much as we would like to deny it , Americans do not have the most favorable reputation around the world , which I think , or hope , is changing .

They were very ashamed of some of the decisions their government had made , and the bad opinion that gave Americans around the world . <p> But at the same time , they loved their country and the ideals they knew America actually stood for . They chose to present their country in an admirable light by being the best they could be , instead of hiding behind a maple leaf . <p> I must admit , I once believed the myths out there that paint a picture of Americans as ignorant , world dominators .

It 's just a cultural difference . With the help of the increasing US travelers out exploring the world right now , this might change . It 's up to you to help this happen by speaking up for your country and being a great example of what 's honourable about it . <h> The Australia New Zealand rivalry <p> It 's commonly known that Australians and New Zealanders have what I like to think of a fierce , albeit friendly , rivalry .

Focus on this instead . Appreciate what is great about your own culture while at the same time appreciate what is also great about others . <p> The purpose of travel is to share ; to share your culture with others on your journey , and to share other 's cultures with your own on your return .

Sometimes I 'm just testing the waters , seeing if I get a different reaction than if I say I 'm American . I lived in Morocco when Bush was president , and I was just sick of having the same conversation with every taxi driver about how evil he is and how America does bad things in the Muslim world . It can be trying to have those same conversations ( when the other person is mostly just venting their frustrations ) day in and day out . <p> One of my husbands college professors lived in Pakistan , where I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor was in the center of the city . A man came at his car to start beating him because he was American , and another random man on the street said something like " He s not American ! He s French ! " This ended up saving him for a beating , and possibly saving his life . <p> Now in Pakistan most people we interacted with were very welcoming of us when we told them we were Americans . The majority told us that they love the American people but do n't  like the American government . But we also had rocks thrown at our car in North West Frontier Province by locals who are n't  so fond of foreigners , particularly Americans . <p> Yes I want to be an ambassador for my country and help people see that Americans are n't  necessarily what they think , but at the same time , my personal safety is more important than that . <p> I never thought about it like this before . Thank you Heather for bringing this to my attention and I absolutely agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to covering up who you were through shame . I think its equally sad that our world continues to operate like this , seeing only governments and cultures on peoples outer frame instead of looking deep into the core of us all . The truth is that regardless of where we come from , we are all the same . All we can do is keep our eyes forward and focused on a peaceful , loving world one day being a reality . <p> Very true . Most people , even in countries where Americas policy is disliked , can differentiate between American people and the American government and not lump them into one thing . Of course Bush did n't  help this naive way of looking at things by reinforcing the us vs them mentality and talking about how they ( terrorists ) " hate our way of life " and " hate our freedom . " <p> The truth is , most people dislike American policies and some also dislike the Hollywood culture which is being proliferated in their own countries . I can see why people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the only way to work against the stereotypes is to say that they ARE Americans . I personally would n't say otherwise unless its a matter of safety . <p> In 1995 we met an Canadian backpacker in Scotland who had a maple leaf on his backpack and made a point of saying he was Canadian , not American ( as we know many foreigners cant differentiate between the accents ) . He said it got him along far easier than if he was American especially when he was hitchhiking . This was only a few years after George Bush Snr went to Iraq the first time around . I can imagine that many Americans would find more racism now after what has happened in recent years . Its unfortunate that an idiot President can have that effect on his people . However , again in Scotland , rather than get into a heated debate with an old , staunch Scot ( in whose B&amp;B we had spent the night and with whom we were about to share breakfast ) I did not admit to being British born as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stealing the lions heads off the nearby castle something or other and taking them across the border , never to been seen again ! I cant remember the name of the Inverness castle . I 've lived in Australia for over 28 of my 40 years so did I really NEED to piss him off by defending my homeland ? I think sometimes you have to chose your moments . I agree with Heather though that safety is paramount and if I had to pretend I hailed from elsewhere to save my skin ( and that of my family ) I would n't hesitate . <p> I 'm American , and this makes me so mad ! One of the things that I have found as I 've lived and traveled abroad is that I feel more American when I 'm living out of America than when I 'm living in it . I think this is pretty commonwhen you 're constantly surrounded by difference , you realize how many of your own opinions , attitudes , and behaviors have been created by the culture you grew up in . <p> I think that Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserting that . The problem is that we are also members of this culture that is everywhere : in movies , on tv , in pop songs , and in governmental actions . Everyone has an opinion about Americans . So when you say , " I 'm American , " people are immediately prejudiced based on the millions of images they have already seen about your culture , none of which may actually be representative . In some cases , being an American is a great thingI know that if I find myself in trouble in the country where I 'm traveling or living , the US government will come and help me out . In other cases , being American makes you a target for everything from violence ( like Heather said ) or tirades about your government and your way of life . Not that this makes me any less proud to be American or to say that I am American , but its a nationality that always provokes a response of some sort . I would never hide behind the Canadian flag in normal circumstances , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , it would take truly extraordinary circumstances for me to hide behind a Canadian flag . Barack Obama has made it so much easier to be an American abroad , but its never absolute . <p> Just a quick thought- I 've heard this rumor before but in 6 years of backpacking I have never met an American pretending to be Canadian , or even someone who knew someone who knew someone who did that . I think we can discount this by now- its basically an urban legend . <p> Thanks for sharing your experience Kristi . I am so glad to hear it . I think Americans are starting to become more comfortable with being proud of here they are . We did n't  encounter it too much but I certainly met a lot of Americans who would apologize right after saying they were from Americathose were the Bush years . <p> Its not an urban legend , it does happen . I am Canadian and when I was travelling through Australia , I met a few Americans that sewed Canadian flags on their backpacks . They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when I was at a winery the one sales lady was somewhat ignorant to me until I said I was from Canada and it was like night to day on how she reacted towards me . I 'm sorry but when I travel I make sure that people know that I am Canadian and not mistaken for an American . <p> I have noticed Canadians making sure that people knew they werent American . I have known Americans who *joked* about putting a Canadian flag on their packs to avoid arguments with total strangers . I have yet to meet a US American pretending to be a Canadian . On meeting people in other countries , initially at least , I tend to keep quiet about my nationality ( US ) unless directly asked . I get tired of the immediate assumptions people make about me , without any further information than that one bit of information . When I do say where I 'm from , people almost always express shock , apparently because I have manners , can listen to opposing views , and while I am very proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , disagree with various aspects of my government on a fairly regular basis , ( Which I can do . Because I 'm a US citizen . Which is something I value very highly . ) That said , there have been a couple of times when I was mistaken for a Canadian or Australian and just let it go , because given the anti-American tenor of the conversation , it felt safer . <p> I 'm Canadian , and I have two very good friends from the U.S.A. that have traveled abroad and have done the Canadian flag thing . Once traveling together ( Latin America ) we encountered some other U.S. citizens being downright rude and racist and my friend turned around and told me : " This is why I 'm impersonating you , I 'm ashamed of my people " . Now that I 'm traveling through Europe when I tell people where I 'm from they certainly are nicer once it is clear I 'm not from the U.S.A. , also , it seems that the term itself American bothers a lot of people because it is the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " why do they call themselves American ? are n't  you also from that continent ? " my answer " I do n't  know ! " It comes across as just them taking over one more thing many come off as arrogant for saying theirs is the best country in the world , of course we are all proud of our homelands , but when you are in a different one it might not be a good idea . Anyway , it would be nice to show the world that not all of them are a*holes . <p> Its a fact most of the world do n't  like America . I say , America rather than Americans , as most of the world is smart enough to judge an individual not an individual as their country . But let 's look at the facts . The country is the people . The government is the people . The foreign policies and decisions are made by the government who are the people and voted by the people . Hating a government and wanting them to change has never proven to solve anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day it is in there control to change there country and are the people who are or will one day make those policies . I will not judge an individual personally , but I think the fact more and more Americans are being ashamed to admit they are Americans , is a good thing . As they should be . And hopefully it will slowly change how the American Government and future politicians deal with the world as a whole , before the US is viewed in history as the next Germany . I also think the U.S ignorance and arrogance fuels a lot of hate around the world . Simple things . From simple things like referring to themselves as " the greatest nation on earth " to stating the world will never be the same after 911 . Only 3000 people died . Yet its still a big deal when most Americans do n't  even know about the Khmer Rouge in the 70s in Cambodia or blink a eye when thousands die from other reasons in other countries every year . Many Americans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invade them , as US media is there only connection with the world . ( Also the reason Bush got re-elected , the ignorant Americans outnumber the ones with common sense ) . So I do think , individuals do need to change there thinking before the government/country as a whole does . <p> Some great food for thought here and I do understand a lot of what you are saying . As you say , you cant judge them individually but some things do need to change and its up to the people to do this . We 've an idiot leader in power in Australia at the moment who 's ruining our countrys reputation . I want to find a way to get him out . <h> Trackbacks <p> Americans pretend to be Canadian while traveling abroad ? Why are Americans Disguising themselves as Canadians ? American abroad ?

The disruption whilst annoying do n't  sound like near disasters . It sounds like the accomodation and cruise was booked just a little difficult to find your booking . My experience with cruise lines is you log in to your cruise personalizer and complete all necessary information prior to travel . No travel agent we have used has ever done that for us . This also allows you to prebook shore tours .

I will be staying near MBK .. how far is it from that area ? I was planning to spend maybe 1-2 hours there then off to Chatuchak .. what do you thinkove to hear from you <p> Hi Angie , It should be about 30-45 mins away , depending on traffic . go early in the morning . You could fit in Chatuchak in the one day although you will be exhausted at the end of the day . If you have enough time I 'd do them on separate days . <p> Thanks so much for the info Craighopefully will be able to do it all in a day .. will be bringing kids along and I 'm also 5 months pregnant .. heheheanyway .. thanks again n luv your blog .. very detailed infowill maybe try absolutely fantastic holidays tour guide you suggestedhow did you book them ? do you think booking them online is secure enough ? <p> Hi , Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do u think we can just arrange our own schedule and hire them as our tour guide instead of following their brokers . If you do n't  mind , may I ask you one question how much does it cost to go to the floating market with that tour company ? Thank a lot for sharing . Looking forward to hear back from you . <p> It depends on how many in your group but for 2 people it is about 1700 baht per person . For 4 people its 950 baht per person . You could follow your own schedule and hire them , but it would cost slightly more . <p> Hi there . Thanks for the great posting . I 'd like to take the tour with Absolutely Fantastic , but I only have a short window of time . Do you think its possible to do it before a 3:45p flight out ? In other words , would we be back to the hotel in time ( 1:00ish ) to grab our bags and start the journey to the airport ? By the way , the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay . I would make sure you arrive early so you can get back . Maybe not do the tour out to the village as that can take up a fair amount of time , or consider taking your luggage with you so you can go straight to the airport . Its always hard to judge with Bangkok traffic , but Sunday will be better than any other day . <p> Hello ! I came across your blog and found it really inspiring ! I am planning a 3 week trip to HK and maybe Thailand in October . I will attempt to blog my journey and looking for blogs to follow as well as increasing my number of followers so feel free to explore and please join my site while you are at it ! <p> I think you 'll be really pushing it for time .

I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time . <p> Fantastic report ! Thank you ! My husband &amp; I will be in Bangkok in January &amp; well try to go to this market . Do you think its easy enough to get there &amp; navigate the market by ourselves ? Do you still think we can do the tour to the village without a guide ? <p> Hi , I would love to go to Klong Lat Mayom . We arrive in Bangkok DMK at 8:45am , how far is this floating market from the airport via car , or alternatively the quickest way route to it . We are only there for the day , as our return flight is the same day at 9pm . I would love to see Klong Lat Mayom over the Talin Chan floating market , which one do you think would be more convenient for the short time that we are there . Thank you .

And it did n't disappoint when we finally made the walk to The Lookout , and then onto the beach itself , last week . <p> We started our walk early , at 5.30am , as we wanted to reach The Lookout for sunrise , and to beat the anticipated crowds . <p> From the car park to The Lookout is approximately a 45 minute walk . A steady uphill climb , but a well-made path and whilst we did n't have the kids with us this time ( nanny and poppy were visiting ) we did witness many others hiking with kids so it 's not beyond a family outing . <p> Once you reach The Lookout your reward is a spectacular view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our magical sunrise the sky was completely covered in dark clouds by arriving early we were fortunate to have the moment all to ourselves . <p> We had time to sit and take it all in , enjoy a light pre-packed breakfast , with nothing but the sounds of the surrounding bush and uninterrupted views <p> From The Lookout , the walk down onto the beach itself is steep but a short one of 20 minutes . <p> By the time we had finished our bite to eat and made the walk onto the sand , to our joy the clouds had started to lift and the suns rays brought to life what we had witnessed many times before in photos . <p> I could n't believe we were all alone on famous Wineglass Bay . <p> We had the whole beach to ourselves rewarded for starting the day early .

@@21820875 @1820875/ <h> Everyone Visits the Grand Palace in Bangkok <p> Tim , our local guide , was explaining to us on the ride over that the Grand Palace is at the top of the list for first time visitors to Bangkok . <p> Its true , and I had already known and experienced this on my own first visit ten years ago . But today was different . We were repeat visitors , and not travelling as a couple , but as parents with Kalyra and Savannah on their first visit to Bangkok . <p> The moment you arrive outside the palace walls and enter the gates you are quickly struck by the sheer size and popularity of what is Thailands most sacred site and complex of temples , throne halls and Government residences . <p> As we enter the complex its crowded , its hot , and tour groups are justling left and right excited to enter the official residence of the Kings of Thailand since construction began under King Rama+ way back in 1782 . <p> Yes , it took us about five seconds to be reminded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thailand and would be a REAL introduction to Thai history and life for our kids . <p> Heading towards the main gate <p> The Grand Palace complex is situated on the banks of the Chao Phraya River and is surrounded by four walls with a combined area of 218,400 square metres . <p> Its divided into four main courts , separated by numerous walls and gates : the Outer Court , the Middle Court , the Inner Court and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha . <p> Caz ready to enterone of the many gates <p> As we wandered the complex jostling with what seemed like the whole population of Bangkok trying to take photographs , Kalyra kept asking <p> When do I get to meet the Buddha ? <p> " Soon darling . Let 's just take our time and take it all in . I know its hot and crowded but please be patient and stay close to Mummy and Daddy . " <p> Kalyra is great traveller , and has been fortunate to experience many things in her five years , but sometimes struggles in big crowds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking it all in from the comfort of her stroller . <p> Everywhere you turn , in every courtyard and at every bend , the beauty of the place amazes and takes your breath away . I remember being very impressed on that first visit in 2002 and this second visit was no less mesmirizing . <p> I even captured this shot of a monk looking mesmirized . <h> The statues and buildings are huge . <h> Kalyra is just dwarfed by this entry way <h> Along with the sheer size comes the details and craftmanship <p> We 'd been exploring the complex for maybe an hour or so and the question of " when do I get to see the Buddha " continued and Kalyra became increasingly restlessless , which was totally understandable given the trying conditions . <p> Soon it came time to witness the worshipers lighting candles and sticks of incense in a ritual which they raise to their head while bowing . <p> Of course a tired and independent kalyra was having none of the help suggested by mummy and daddy and totally lost it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual by herself and she needed to step aside and respect the locals . <p> Nothing like having your five year old lose it at the most sacred temple in Thailand <p> But we all regained our composure , after a five minute time out , and carried on with the rest of the proceedings , including a visit with the Buddha . <p> Press play to see the Grand Palace in Bangkok .

Make sure the driver turns on the meter this is the law in Bangkok .

My desire is to travel by road as much as possible so as to see countryside and meet people . <p> Coroico is an interesting choice . Living just a few hours away its a personal favourite of mine . Other good destinations are Sorata , Isla del Sol , Potosi , Sucre , Tarija and Samaipata to name a few . Plenty of good trekking and climbing for those who are interested too . <p> I love Bolivia , it really is a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Paz has a great nightlife and is a Wonder City . My top favs are Copacabana and the saltflats . Ill be going back sometime soon . <p> Bolivia has deffinitely some stunning places to visit . ( By the way La Paz is not the capital city is just the seat of government , the capital city is Sucre , a beautiful and quiet city itself , and they make delicious chocolate too ) . But I would also add some places in Santa Cruz to the must visit list . I leave you this video that might help ilustrate my point : https : //youtu.be/UNaXqrggSU The city is beautiful and cheerful and you will find really nice people there , and just a few hours by car you will find amazing places as Samaipata city , the Valle de Tucabaca , the Misiones Jesu+ticas , Codo de los Andes or the Ambor+ National Park , even have places where you can make extreme sports as trekking , rappel , rafting or canopy . If you have the chance to get there , don-t miss it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to leave this comment to add the condors valley ( valle de los condores ) in Tarija . Its one the best memories I have from my 3 months in south america . An superb hidden spot , really authentic . <p> Nice blog but these are the places that EVERYONE visits , its like going to Australia and saying you know the place when you have only been to the East Coast . I am waiting for a blogger who gets off the boring gringo trail and visits destinations which rival these places and more . <p> Thanks Nick . Feel free to send us a guest post with these suggestions ! we love to share the must see places and the off the path as they are both valuable for different reasons . Send me an email if you wanted to write it and I 'll send you our guidelines email protected <p> The Pampas is not better than the Bolivian Amazon ( Madidi National Park ) for seeing animals ! ! People only write this because they book the cheapest Jungle tours then complain that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madidi National Park i saw a Jagaur , missed 2 more , Giant Otters , Tapir , 3 species of Deer , 5 species of Monkeys , Tapirs , Caiman , Capybara , 2 species of Peccares and more ! ! I saw this because you get what you pay for and i went deeper into the Amazon away from hunters and cheap backpacker lodges . <p> The Pampas is over touristic and a example of cheap backpacker tourism . <p> If you really want to see wildlife then explore Kaa Iya National Park , Beni Wetlands , San Miguelito Jaguar Reserve or go deeper into Madidi National Park . I promise you will see a lot more ! ! ! <p> and more famous landmarks . However , if you travel to Bolivia , you will discover a land that offers so much more than meets the eye , boasting a wide range of different climates that bring with them all kinds of natural <p> and North America . I finished up working in Buenos Aires , and am traveling Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , Per+ , Costa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momma and get some good home <p> Carlos Erik Malpica Flores : El Cafetal Hostel-CoroicoCoroico- is a very nice place if you like jungle , but there is a little deal with this part and it is that is not easy to reach . You would need to go there with a bus if you are taking a big package which you would likely take to this country . In fact , you would rather go with other people that could help you if you have any trouble on the road because it is not an easy place to get to , but if you do , satisfaction is guaranteed . As you see , - Coroico is definitely for adventure lovers and for those ones who are willing to get into the deeps of Bolivia 's jungles .

Its truly awe inspiring . <h> North Rim Grand Canyon <p> We first arrived at the North Rim and saw our first sunset which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors with the light is an unforgettable experience . <p> Our lodging of choice was to camp at the North Rim campground within the park . We love camping and the facilities were more than adequate . <p> North Rim <p> Besides camping , the Grand Canyon Lodge is the only other lodging inside the national park on the North Rim . As well as camping , lodging is also booked well in advance so try to plan ahead as early as possible . <h> Our first hike <p> Our first morning we were up at the crack of dawn to begin our 9 mile hike down into the canyon . <p> It was easy going down and we passed through all the layers starting with the alpine forests down through the red rock , limestone , and sandstone . <p> The fact that it was early and that it was the North Rim there were very few people on the trail , making it even more enjoyable . <p> We stopped at rising springs which is the water supply for the North and South rims and then we began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was an awesome hike , albeit strenuous on the way out . It was n't too bad until the last hour when it got steeper and the heat of the sun started to take its toll . <p> But it was great to experience the quiet stillness and grandeur of the inner canyon . <p> I highly recommend you experience the wild and remote feeling of the North Rim . Solitude can be found hiking the trails whilst enjoying the awe-inspiring views . <p> For those less physically fit consider a mule trip , which are offered from mid May to mid October . North Rim mule trips do not go to the river . And half day inner canyon trips are usually available on a daily basis . <p> mule trek on north rim <h> Our reward <p> We had a beautiful lunch in the restaurant right on the North Rim which has amazing uninterrupted views over the canyon . Our meal of choice was a delicious salmon burger washed down with a few cold beers . <p> We then took a drive to various viewpoints with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Rim Grand Canyon <p> Next up we did the long drive to the South Rim . Its only 10 miles as the raven flies but 210 miles by road . <p> When we arrived at our first viewpoint our views were obstructed by a haze which we later discovered was due to the southern California fires going on at the time . <p> The weather and pollution from down there impacts the Grand Canyon a lot and clouds it in a hazy fog . <p> view from south rim side <p> However it was an incredibly beautiful view . Even more spectacular than the North Rim . We also had views of the Colorado River snaking through the canyon . <p> We spent the afternoon walking along the South Rim . In the evening we took the shuttle to some other viewpoints and listened to a ranger talk about the formation of the canyon which was fascinating . <p> At days end we watched to sunset over the canyon . It was stunning . A pink and red sky . And a perfect way to end the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canyon . It was n't as hard as the North Rim hike as it was flat in a lot of areas and not as steep . <p> hiking down from south rim side <p> Although it was much hotter as it was a lot more open than the North side with not as much shade which made it tiring and challenging . <p> Once again we started our hike very early in the morning just as the sun was rising , casting a soft light over the canyon . <p> We hiked down to Plateau Point where you get fantastic views of the inner gorge and the Colorado river . It was well worth the effort . <p> Plateau Point <p> On our return hike with the sun higher in the sky it got hotter and hotter . Some cramping started to set in , and it got quite exhausting . Luckily we were wearing hats and light clothing . <p> We made our way back to the top of the rim just before lunch time . And we could n't believe the amount of people just starting their hike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort to get up early and on the trail at sun up to beat the heat . Do n't  make things any more challenging and dangerous than they need to be . <h> Grand Canyon Lodging <p> We camped on both sides of the rim within the National Park . You can reserve a site for two of the campgrounds within Grand Canyon National Park , one on each rim . <h> Grand Canyon Facts : <p> The Grand Canyon is in the northwest corner of Arizona , close to the borders of Utah and Nevada . <p> The Grand Canyon is 277 miles ( 446 km ) long , up to 18 miles ( 29 km ) wide , and attains a depth of over a mile ( 6,000 feet / 1,800 metres ) <p> It is largely contained within the Grand Canyon National Park , which became a national park in 1919 <p> The Grand Canyon National Park is a World Heritage Site and encompasses 1,218,375 acres . <p> Scenery , climate and vegetation vary between north and south rims because of different elevations . Forests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a series of desert basins . <p> Grand Canyon National Park attracts about five million visitors per year . <p> vegetation near plateau point <h> Grand Canyon Tips : <p> In the summer get up early . Start hiking to beat the heat . People have gotten disorientated and died from heat stroke . <p> Wear appropriate clothing for the time of year , including hats and raincoats where necessary . <p> Wear footwear that is comfortable and sturdy with good grip . <p> Do n't  hike alone . Know what your destination will be and how to get there . <p> Know where water is available . Carry enough of your own water and food for energy . <p> Get the weather forecast . <p> Choose an appropriate hike . Know your abilities . Know your limits . <p> Stay on the trail and never shortcut switchbacks . <h> Grand Canyon Directions : <p> The South Rim of the Grand Canyon is open all year and receives 90% of the parks visitation . The South Rim has an airport and rail service and is close to Interstate 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is only open from mid-May through mid-October.There is no airport or rail service so the North Rim village may only be reached by road .

It is beyond comparison " beyond description ; absolutely unparalleled throughout the wide worldLet this great wonder of nature remain as it now is . Do nothing to mar its grandeur , sublimity and loveliness . You can not improve on it .

I just hope to make it over there soon someday and see it for myself ! <p> Four days at the Grand Canyon is impressive most people do n't  get nearly that long . I spent two days at the North Rim and definitely agree with the warning to not hike in the canyon during the hottest hours of the day . We hiked halfway down and it was rough coming back out . But I think I lost a lot of weight that weekend ! <p> We actually heard a statistic when we were there , that most people who die or get seriously i 'll and injured are young , fit , healthy males . They have this super power awareness about them and go charging into the canyon thinking they are unstoppable . Well nature certainly shows them who is boss . I remember watching two young men running down into the canyon with just a small bottle of water and I felt worried for what was going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was almost crawling out at the end of our South Rim hike , it was just so hot . And this was at a time when the majority of people were only starting to come in . <p> Interesting read ! I 'd really love to visit Grand canyon . Lots and lots of places in the Sates are fascinating and this is certainly one of them . 4-days ! I 'll keep that in mind .. Thanks for the through post ! <p> We visited the Grand Canyon a few years ago . Unfortunately we did it as a day trip from Vegas and did n't  get to spend anywhere near enough time there . It was better than nothing though ! We hope to go back one day and explore more fully . We also love Bryce Canyon which we also visited from Vegas . Just spectacular ! <p> We did the same thing .. After visiting GC South Rim , we regretted our visit to Vegas and wished we had gone to GC instead .. At least for more days . We couldve visited Vegas for 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least we did experience the grandeur ! <p> I find it ridiculous that I have lived in the US for 29 years , and I have only seen the Grand Canyon for 15 minutes . I was in Arizona my senior year of college to watch The Ohio State University win the national college football championship . We decided to take a road trip , since we were only hours away . We got there just before sunset , had our 15 minutes of awe , and then drove several hours back home . <p> Totally worth it for that 15 minutes , but I can not wait to go and spend more time like you guys did . <p> I think anyway you see it is going to be awe inspiring , but you will definitely appreciate it so much more when you spend time exploring it . There is so much more to it then what you see from the quick tourist angle . You will love it ! <p> Awesome images .. ! I would like to see this places immediately because the location looks beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to stay near mountain view . Refer : " Peter Macro " <p> This is such a great post ! We are just planning a trip to the Grand Canyon for next May . This is so helpful . Tentatively , we are planning just the South Rim , but the North Rim looks so beautiful too . My concern is that well have our 2 young kids with us , so I 'm not sure how far or how long we can hike with them . At least one will be too young for a mule trek , although that seems like a great way to get further into the canyon . We also will be there at least 4 days ( were planning a week vacation , but at least 2 days will be driving there and back ) . <p> Seriously , you guys have inspired me . My husband and I claim we love travel , but then we do n't  because we lack the money , and we have 2 young boys .. but there are so many great places that we can drive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new places , rather than wait for some day when we can afford airfare for 4 to jet off to an exotic place . I 've wanted to see the Grand Canyon for years , so its a great start . = <p> It is a great start Carla . A lot of people do n't  realize that travel does not have to involve long distance flights , it can start in your own backyard . Your country is so beautiful , there are so many great things to see . <p> We would love to hike the canyon again with our children , but I also do n't  know how possible it would be . You would have to start really early and go in the cooler months , otherwise I think it could just get too hot for them . <p> It is really hard to choose between the North and South rim , both are equally as beautiful . I think there are easy hiking trails in the north and more shade . Plus it is quieter . It is a shame that it is such a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to just choose one over the other . <p> What a wonderful looking trip ! It looks like you guys got to see a ton of beauty up close and personal on the various hikes you took . Did you ever consider taking a helicopter or airplane tour of the Canyon ? Maybe next time , a helicopter tour would be right up your alley ! <p> Great recount of your experience &amp; beautiful pics . Wondering if you would you take the kids there in the summer , and if so , what itinerary would you suggest ? I noticed the temp on the North Rim is 10 degrees cooler in summer . We can only travel during late June , July , and early August because of school schedules with our 10 year old . Thanks ! <p> Yes . I 'd still take them . I 'd just make sure we visited real early in the morning before it got too hot . If the north rim is 10 degrees cooler than that might be a better option . Just consider the activities you do and what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a great post on really delving into a GC visit ! I was lucky enough to travel all 225 miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon and it was one of the most inspiring trips of my life . Its true that the silence and the grandeur of the canyon is found below the rim . Thanks for inspiring others to travel deeper ! <p> I will be heading out there in two weeks . Thanks for stating the obvious about the North being cooler than the south . Its all about the way the sun hits the canyon . I have been there twice before but never noticed the difference . Will be hiking with my nephews so it may help them enjoy the hikes more in cooler temps . <p> Going to the Grand Canyon in about 2 weeks.We are taking the " sissy " way out.Staying at El Tovar lodge.This was a gift from my husband. #1 on my bucket list for many years ! !

I am glad that you shared your Grand Canyon experience with us . <p> I am going to the canyon in a few weeks and am excited to hike . Thank you for the read on your experience . I am planning on taking hikes similar to yours . Will I be okay to wear regular tennis shoes or do advise to purchase shoes for hiking ? <p> We are lying into Phoenix on Monday and driving to Sedona to spend one night with plans to drive on to south rim on Tuesday afternoon . was hoping we could enjoy time there and still drive to North rim possibly friday and tour there through Saturday . we leave out on sunday for home do you feel this us realistic plan ? <p> The Grand Canyon is really amazon to see !

If you get a chance I think it is a great opportunity to get up close and personal with nature as well as a great company to go with . <p> Never visited the Grand Canyon . Struggling with where to stay &amp; what to do ? ? ? We only use our room to sleep , not spend the day indoor , looking for a rustic cabins , even seriously thinking of camping for the night . We 'd like to see the North &amp; South like you did , Definitely stay away form the large crowds , Do n't  mid them for a short time , We are just looking to enjoy the Canyon not the commercials . <p> I 'm in the beginning stages of planning a trip to the GC this summer with my husband and three girls ( 12 , 10 and 8 . ) Were a pretty active family and I would love to experience both the north and south rims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newly diagnosed respiratory condition , that I would n't make it out !

@@21820883 @1820883/ <h> How to Choose a Spanish School in Guatemala <p> During my three short weeks in Guatemala , I spent most of my time learning Spanish in both Antigua and Quetzaltenango ( Xela ) . It can be hard choosing a Spanish school in Guatemala- there are so many of them , so Ive put together some tips to help you narrow it down . <h> Decide where you want to study <p> There are Spanish schools in pretty much every town in Guatemala , so the first thing to figure out is where you want to study . <h> Antigua <p> The most popular option , Antigua , is about an hour from Guatemala . Its a UNESCO world heritage listed town and appropriately pretty , atmospheric and clean . <p> The entire centre of town is geared towards tourists and Spanish students there are all sorts of safe , clean restaurants selling things like bagels , pizza , and fondue , the bar scene is insane and almost the entire town is wired with internet . <p> Personally , I found it a little too sanitised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it less likely that you need to use your Spanish for everyday transactions . <h> Xela <p> Those who are a little more serious about travel and a little more serious about learning Spanish head to the highland town of Quetzaltenango ( Xela ) . <p> About four hours north of Antigua , its very much a Guatemalan city and much grittier than Antigua , and for me , that was the attraction . <p> There are still plenty of vibey cafes and restaurants frequented by ( mostly American ) Spanish students , although things are a little cheaper in Xela . <p> Not many locals speak English , so basically every transaction or interaction will have you speaking Spanish . There are also loads of hiking opportunities in the nearby hills , and plenty of projects to volunteer with . <h> Lago de Atitlan <p> I did n't  study here , but Lago de Atitlan , partway between Antigua and Xela , is quickly becoming a popular location to learn Spanish in Guatemala . The wifi is incredibly fast and the food available rivals Antigua for variety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturesque setting makes for a pretty chilled lifestyle . <h> Talk to people whove done it <p> I chose my Spanish schools in Antigua and Xela based solely on recommendations from other travellers . <p> I talked with travel bloggers and read posts on Lonely Planets Thorn Tree forums and this helped me make an educated decision . Feel free to ask me questions in the comments below . <h> Ask about the Spanish teachers <p> At both my schools , the Spanish teachers were hugely experienced . Both had more than 10 years of teaching Spanish behind them and it showed . Their English was enough to ensure I understood everything we were discussing when necessary . <p> Most Spanish schools will organise extracurricular activities that are often free or very cheap such as salsa classes , lectures , film screenings or guided walks . <p> Many also run projects that are funded by your school fees . I chose my school in Xela based on its philosophy and the fact that almost all of its profits go back into their clinic , stove building project and daycare centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you were studying for one week or one month . <h> Look at the accommodation options on offer <p> Home stay Particularly popular in Xela , your school can usually place you with a local family for a nominal extra cost . Most families have extensive experience housing foreign students and will cook you three meals a day and you get your own room . I heard some even have wifi . This gives you the chance to totally immerse yourself in the language . <p> Had I stayed in Xela for two weeks , I would have spent my second week with a local family . <p> Student house <p> Not all schools offer this . I stayed in a student house in Antigua and loved it . I made instant friends and it was more comfortable and homey than staying in a hostel , and more flexible and relaxed than a home stay . We were provided with three meals a day . In all honesty , the food was n't great , but a lot of the food in Guatemala is n't brilliant . <p> Hostel , guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own accommodation and stay in a nearby guesthouse , which was what I did in Xela . <p> You can look for accommodation for Xela , Antigua and Lago de Atitlan- through our Booking.com , or accommodation partner . <h> Price of a Spanish School in Guatemala <p> Price may or may not be an issue for you , but I would suggest going with the best Spanish school rather than going with the cheapest . <p> In Antigua , I paid $250 a week , which was on the expensive side and included 4 hours of private lessons a day , a registration fee and my accommodation and meals in the student house . <p> In Xela , I paid $145 for 5 hours of private lessons a day . The school waived the registration fee and had I chose to stay with a local family it would have cost an extra $40 . <h> Go with your gut instinct <p> Because it will rarely get you wrong . <p> Bio : In 2010 , Megan quit her job and left Sydney , Australia to travel solo through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lover of food , yoga and photography , she 's now traveling through Latin America . Get inspired by her adventures at OnMyWayRTW.com , follow her on Twitter @meganrtw or catch up with her on Facebook. 69799 @qwx269799 <p> A couple of years ago I had the dream of learning spanish . At the same time I always wanted to go to Cuba , so it made sense I 'll kill two birds with one stone . For me it was the best decision I had ever made and a truly life changing experience . It was n't hard to pick a school as in Havana there are n't  too many . I ended up going to Sprachcaffe in Havana ( link to the school : LONG ... ) . <p> I enrolled for 6 weeks online and ended up extending it to 8 weeks . A little secret is though to perhaps only book a week or two then extend once you 're there . It will work out way cheaper . They also offer salsa classes for the afternoon . Again book that once you 're already there . You miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing about the salsa classes is every friday they head to a salsa club and your profesor/a will go along and make sure you dance . We all know nerves can get the better of us so with a teacher there forcing you up , it gets easier and easier.especially after a few mojitos too . = Heres a video of me dancing away in the school : LONG ... I HAD A BALL ! ! ! ! ! <p> Like all schools around the world accommodation provided is either a home stay style where you live with a family , a hotel room or an apartment in a hotel . I went with the apartment due to my party habits and I did n't  want to bother a family by getting home late at night . I cant remember the prices I paid but again always book just an initial week or two the extend once there . <p> Now the last thing I have to say is that when you go to a spanish school , do n't  hold back . After class go into the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid of getting things wrong . People in general will always help you along the way and correct you as you speak . I have a good vocabulary and bad grammar but that does n't  bother me . Ill chew someones ear off at times and others I see with better skills than me not talk at all in the streets . Remember nobody will laugh at you , theyll only respect you more for trying ! <p> Wow Marc I never considered Cuba as a place to study Spanish ! Sounds amazing . I agree that you really shouldnt be shy to try it out I 've learned so much more just by speaking to people here in Central America outside of classes , everyone even kids are happy to help . <p> Thanks for this post , it is n't a topic Ive seen covered much on other blogs and is definitely something wed like to do on our RTW trip . We are n't  planning on visiting Central America and I had planned to fit this into South America at some point , do you have any experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend Guatemala as a great place to learn Spanish ! Its quite cheap and you 'll quickly realise how necessary it is throughout Central America and I assume South America , but I have n't made it there yet . <p> Thank you ! ! ! ! We are planning to travel long-term and our first stop is Central or South America to learn Spanish . Guatamela was actually our #1 choice for Spanish Language School . This couldnt have come at a better time . <p> This is a very informative post . The list of things to consider is comprehensive and thorough . Its actually quite interesting because what you 've outlined for methods of choosing a language school are not all that entirely different from the procedure I use to decide teaching ESL at a particular institute . <p> You had my exact same teacher at Pop Wuj Megan ! Wish I would have known , I would have had you say hi = Glad it worked out so well for you and some great tips here for others planning a trip to Guatemala ! <p> I studied in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly different , experience in each . I have even written what I think is a useful article , " Tips for Choosing a Spanish School " http : **33;1423;TOOLONG <p> I wrote it after only having studied in Antigua ( I later returned to Guatemala and studied in Xela and San Pedro ) . In it I do mention that I chose Escuela de Espa+ol " Cooperaci+n " in Antigua . For the record , I also chose ICA in Xela and the Cooperativa in San Pedro . All excellent choices . <p> Great post . Guatemala is indeed a great place to study Spanish . Whether in Xela , Antigua or a number of other locations , there is something for everyone . This past May we studied at a new school in Antigua , Antigua Plaza http : //www.antiguaplaza.com . It is run by Ana who is extremely helpful and she has some great teachers working for her . We def recommend Ana and her school is worth looking into if you want to study in Antigua . <p> Earlier this year I studied at Cambio Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a nonprofit school so I felt my money was going to a good cause , and the teachers and the price were first rate . I stayed in a guesthouse , but felt taken care of all the way . So definitely my tip in a highly competitive language school market . Suerte ! <p> I studied at Spanish School Sol Latino in Quetzaltenango in Guatemala . Great school and place to learn Spanish fast . All their classes are one-on-one but are very affordable . http : **33;1458;TOOLONG <p> I recommend San Pedro Spanish School , which is based in A small town in Lake Atitlan . <p> The school is very well and professionally organised , with after class activities to further practice your Spanish . The schools setting is beautiful and although San Pedro does get more English speakers than other pueblos , in general very few speak English here . There is not loads to do so its tranquilty helps you immerse yourself in the language . <p> I stayed with a family at the edge of the town , about 10 min walk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vikki &amp; Rafael , who also run a shop called Tienda Jacqueline ) enough . The food they cooked me was amazing and they were very hospitales at all times . They also have a young daughter who always wants to chat . Perfecto no ? ! <p> Thanks for a great post . It was really useful when I research Spanish schools for my travels . I eventualy settled on going to San Pedro Spanish school , in San Pedro town on Lake Atitlan . My 2 weeks easily turned into 6 , and I had a fabulous time there ! I made so many friends , learnt what feels like a lot of Spanish ( and forgot some too ) lived with a fantastic host family , and learnt so much about the culture and the history of Guatemala and San Pedro too . I definitely recommend the school . I 've posted about it on my blog , and included a link to this page as it was so useful to me ! <p> I am a 63 year old female . I am eager to study Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can only do so for a time period consisting of one to one and a half weeks . I have a basic reading knowledge of Spanish but have trouble communicating orally . I would love some suggestions regarding appropriate schools . Thank you . <p> Hey Megan , thanks so much for the post , its given my friend and I ( were also from Sydney ) a lot of clarity . We seem to share your philosophy on travel , and the school you stayed at in Xela sounds ideal . Could you send us a link so we can find it ? Thanks a lot ! Andrew <p> Great post ! I totally agree with you regarding Antigua , however we had a wonderful time there as we took our Spanish lessons from a local who was from Ciudad Vieja and he took us to the surrounding villages rather that spending too much time in Antigua itself . There are alot of real cultural experiences to be had around Antigua . We had traditional lunch in his home and visited tons of unique spots that were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcos from http : **30;1493;TOOLONG . I highly recommend this type of Spanish lessons if you want a more cultural experience in Antigua . <p> I have just spent a few great weeks at Kie Balam Spanish School in Xela . I would definitely recommend this city since its more genuine , local with lower prices and better environment to practice Spanish ! <p> This is a small school run by a local family and the school facility is located conveniently close to the city . There are only four permanent teachers so normally there are only four students at the same time , however they bring in more teachers if necessary . All of them are really good from what I heard from the others and I was definitely happy with mine ! <p> If you 're after a school that arrange parties and big activities , this is probably not the place for you . However they can offer a brilliant opportunity to learn Spanish and about the Guatemalan culture ! <p> The daily activities are good and more personal since there as many students as teachers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinator who takes all the students on the trip , here you go with your teacher . <p> There is a nice sunny and leafy courtyard if you prefer to study outside . If not , there is plenty of space per student inside without having to disturb one another . There is also a space with pool table and table tennis to hang out after class or in breaks . I found this better than the other bigger school I joined and in the break they always offered a snack like fresh fruits or cakes , something the big schools do n't  offer . <p> The only slightly disturbance is between 8-9 in the morning when the aerobic class in the next building is on . However it is possible to start at 9 instead if you want to avoid this . <p> Many people do n't  dare to try this school since its so small but I found Kie Balam to be a better option for me compared to Sol Latino where I first studied . Both schools have good teachers but Kie Balam is not only cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The home stay that was arranged was miles better and they have the flexibility to personalise the activities for you which the big commercial schools cant do . <p> Selecting the right Spanish school can be a big challenge . There are dozens of schools in Antigua . Think about how you learn ; you must choose a school that best suits your learning style . Not everyone studies in the same way . For example , my wife and I study in two different schools because we do not have the same learning styles and because we have different ways of achieving our academic goals . No school is right for everyone . Different schools have different educational philosophies . Some schools are highly structured with formal lessons and fixed textbooks that they use ; they tend to give you homework . People who love this type of structure will love this kind of school . This approach often utilizes tests for assessment purposes . This is ideal for those who plan to study Spanish for several months and wish to take a final exam that will certify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adapt the instruction to the student with a dedicated program of study . Some people would have only a week or two to study and want to study specific aspects of a language , for example basic vocabulary for travel , medicine , law , or other specialty . The teacher will focus on what is important for the student and facilitate conversation around certain topics as a result . These courses will be less formal and more fun . Students learn at their own pace ; the teacher adapts to the knowledge and desires of the student . All the schools in Antigua offer one-to-one instruction ; this is a huge advantage in terms of efficiency ! The teacher can easily keep track of student progress in this way , and guide the student to more challenging material when the time is right to move on . Personally , I prefer the second approach . I wanted to improve my conversational skills . I did not want to spend two weeks studying the difference between por and para . For me , I made the right choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying grammar , verb conjugation , and vocabulary . The final two hours , after lunch , was spent just making conversation , pronunciation practice , reading , and playing games like Scrabble . I loved my class and I thought that my teacher had done a fantastic job . The choice of the city is also important . I fell in love with Antigua the first time I studied there ; it is a wonderful , colonial city with romantic ruins and cobblestone streets . I felt as if I was living in a museum when I was there ; the whole town exudes a very romantic and peaceful ambience . There are many churches to see , and it is a great town in which to walk . It is a safe place as well , and security is good as there are especially trained Tourist Police to keep visitors safe . Antigua is called the Land of Eternal Spring because of its moderate climate ; it is never too hot there , nor is it too cold , even at night . The homestay is very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student guests , where the family shared some of their time practicing Spanish with the students who were their house guests . I specifically said that I did not just want a simple guest house with meals , but rather a place where I could interact with a family . It was more expensive , but it was worth the extra money and I was not disappointed . I lived in a traditional colonial house where I had a bedroom with a private bathroom , cable TV in the room , wi-fi . It was very comfortably furnished . I discovered that watching Guatemalan TV is an excellent and enjoyable way to improve my listening skills in Spanish . My family always ate with me and always spoke Spanish during the meal ; we had some very interesting conversations . Most students elect to study for four to six hours per day , which is a perfect amount of time to study . If you study only in the morning , you are finished by lunch time and have time in the afternoon to relax , volunteer , shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips in the afternoon , or dancing or cooking lessons . Local excursions might include a visit to a local village craft market or a coffee plantation . Some schools offer to place you as a volunteer with a local charity ; the best schools will offer this service for free . Beware of the schools that want to charge you to help you find a place to volunteer . There are many good schools in Antigua . My favorite school is Don Pedro Spanish School.http : **31;1525;TOOLONG <p> This year , during my travels in Central America I 've decided to take a longer break and study Spanish somewhere . Guatemala seemed to be a good place to learn and I was about to cross the country anyway I started to browse the internet , check out the guide books and ask fellow travelers about their experienceAntigua , Quetzaltenango ( Xela ) and Lake Atitlan came up the most frequentone girl though mentioned a recently opened school in Livingston which I 've never heard before ( neither the town nor the school ) I like experimenting with new things so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a hidden gem . I had a blast during my two weeks at Casa Iguana Spanish School . The school offers accommodation in two places : one is right by the Caribbean in a stunning location , 15 minutes walk from the town center , the other is in Casa de la Iguana hostel which is the only hostel in town so most of the young backpackers are staying there . The teachers are really good and flexible , they come to the location where you 're staying at and speaking English as well ( it was really important for me since I 'm a beginner so I needed further explanations in grammar details etc ) . They offer various types of activates , my favorite was the shopping tour when we went out on market day with my teacher , bought the stuff and then cooked it together . In just couple of hours you learn so much about the language , the country , the culture etc. in such an engaging way . Moreover they offer online lessons as well so once you get back home you can continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you started with . I think that 's a really innovative approach teaching languages . So people out there who are trying to find a really good Spanish school and like to go on the hidden path take Casa Iguana Spanish School in consideration as well.http : **30;1558;TOOLONG <p> After choosing a Spanish school in a town on Lake Atitlan ( the town was Panajachel ) I found that my Spanish teacher was both a good teacher and a terrific person who would share candid information giving me an insight into indigenous Mayan life . When I returned to Pana this past Spring , I took private Spanish lessons with her which were cheaper than any school could offer . I will give her contact info to anyone who contacts me . But as a second option , if you can find cafes that cater to tourists , you might ask for tutor references , by-passing the formal school programs . Although you would think that schools offer a chance for interaction with other students , basically they offer one on one tutorials . <p> Thanks for sharing . I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) just starting my travels in central and south america and i 'm really considering taking spanish class to make my travels here easier . i plan at least 2 weeks of spanish lessons ( 5 days a week , for a total 10 days ) . i 'm wondering base on your experience if that is enough . i completely understand if people say 1 year is n't enough . but i do n't  have time to spend 1 month learning spanish . my spanish proficiency is at a beginners level despite having took 2 semesters of spanish in high school . <p> I studied in this school for two weeks with my husband ; we had studied before in Mexico in a group lesson , but the one teacher to one student ratio at Don Pedro Spanish School is definitely more quick and effective when learning the language . The atmosphere at the school is wonderful , with the lessons being given in a lush , green garden setting where tables were provided for the individualized coursework . There are many activities for students that are offered throughout the week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on Thursday night there is a dinner fiesta which includes music , dancing , and drinks , including La Cuba Libre , the local name for rum and coke . These meals provided a great social time to get to know the other students and teachers in the school . We were also given the opportunity to take salsa dancing lessons during these parties , and that was great fun ! <p> During the first week , my husband and I studied for six hours . We studied for four hours each morning with one teacher , then in the afternoon after lunch we studied with a second teacher for two additional hours . During the second week , we chose to study only five hours per day so that we had time in the afternoon to volunteer with the charitable project that is sponsored by the school ; it is called the Tikal Association . A group of around 15 poor children from a small local village come to the school each afternoon to eat their lunch and to do their homework with a dedicated teacher . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are English classes for them that are taught by the volunteers , and sometimes we go swimming with them or play football outside . We had a lot of fun with the kids , and the experience also provided us with an opportunity to practice our Spanish . <p> Our teachers and also our host family were excellent ; all were very professional , and we became very friendly with them . We chose this school because we had read very good reviews beforehand in the Tripadvisor forum and on the Facebook page of Don Pedro de Alvarado Spanish School . The reviews were accurate ; we had an excellent time at the school in all regards . If you decide to study at the school , we recommend that you stay with our host family , Irma . Both Maria and Rosy are great teachers . You wont be disappointed . <p> I am 50 years old and a beginner to spanish . Where would you suggest that I go so that I fit in with other beginners that are not part of a party scene . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am very young at heart , but I do n't  want a party or bar scene . Also , will two or three weeks be sufficient to get a good base for learning more when I return to Canada ? <h> Trackbacks <p> Guatemala is a cheap place to learn Spanish , and as many of the locals use Spanish as a second language ( many use a local Mayan language at home ) they tend to speak it slowly , and clearly , which is pretty essential for learning Spanish . Be warned though , Latin American Spanish is different to Spain Spanish , in both the pronunciation and some of the words used . It also varies a bit country to country , particularly the accent and the speed at which it is spoken . Guatemala has countless Spanish schools in many different locations , so its worth having a browse and reading recommendations , although generally you can just turn up at a school , look around , and see if its for you . There 's also loads of helpful websites that compare Spanish schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advice on how to choose one , such as this great post on ytravel blog . <p> Comments on TripAdvisor forums- and the Lonely Planet forums- can be really helpful , as can reading travel blogs on the subject and the blog comments .

This was our second day of trying . We only had a few days left before our visas expired and we would become illegal . <p> A space opened up on the flight , business class .

I looked up and bursting through the door was my little angel followed by a beaming Craig . <p> I squealed with delight and wrapped my arms around her , kissing her all over . <p> " I 'm so happy to see you .

And when I fly with my partner I always make sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little prayer to the angels who watch over us . For the most part , a small bit of turbulence , when I 'm sleeping on flights , can feel like a car rumbling over bumps in the road and that 's what I try to imagine if I get scared . Surprisingly , the smaller the plane , the more comfortable I am . I love getting into small planes-my theory is that I have a better chance of surviving a small plane disaster because we are not so high up in the air ! <p> I used to always hold Craigs hand in take off , now I have to hold Kalyras I think Craig would be grateful . Its funny how your mind thinks about what your survival chances are in different planes . I gave up listening to the safety drill years ago as Im convinced it would n't make much of a difference anyway = <p> I think as long as you can do it anyway then you are controlling that fear to a certain extent .

I freak out when I fly , I freak out when DH flys and I 'm not flying . There is NOTHING about flying I like . And the more places we travel the smaller the planes become . Everytime I conquer it whether its a Balloon ride in Capadoccia , the Air Baltic flight between Latvia and Lithuania where the plane was so old and small that the windows had no blinds , there was ashtrays and they asked our weight and the ticket agents says to us .. it is mandatory you are honest and of course you could n't bring a carryon on the plane because there was nowhere to put it that it would fit . Or our upcomig trip to Easter Island where there is NO LAND to land on if something goes wrong . I continually tell myself over and over I can do it and then I make it a point to reward myself with a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! = = = = <p> I thought I was the only one that probably freaked out when my husband flew alone . I know he is safe in Auckland so I can breathe a bit now until he is due to fly home again . Funny how I am not worried about him driving on those winding roads in a campervan at all = I 'd be freaking about Easter Island . Just think of the Hudson River landing in New YOrk and it might make you feel better . <p> What a really great article . I think I could have a fear of flying , but I just refuse to think about it . My husband regularly flies 20+ hour flights , and I 'm just beside myself until I hear from him . I would have to say that my travel fear is my luggage getting lost . Its kind of lame , but its such a pain in the butt . <p> Luggage getting lost is a pain . It has only ever happened to us in the States and twice . Lucky we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential fear . I often give myself lectures trying to do that but it does n't  work <p> I totally empathise . I never used to be afraid of flying but the more I fly the more frightened I get , I figure that statistically I am more likely to be in an accident the more I fly . I know that it is the safest form of travel and as I have been in 3 car crashes I should be far more afraid of getting in a car but I cant shake that horrible uneasy feeling that descends every time I get on a plane . I find that the bigger planes are better for me as they do n't  jump around so much when they are in the air . <p> I never thought of the statistics side of things . Geez now I will stress more = I must admit that every time I hear of a plane crash I recognize a certain kind of relief in me as I think that means the chances for me are better . Pretty horrible right ? <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cars and we really should <p> Yes ! I am TERRIFIED of flying ! I 'm normally ok once I 'm up in the air , but I usually spend the entire take-off freaking out and squealing to myself . I thought it might improve the more I fly , but apparently not if you 've been on over 100 flights and are still scared = <p> Thanks for sharing your fear ! No matter how often I fly , I do feel some apprehension before take-off and until a few minutes after were in the air especially if taking off over water ! When it gets turbulent , I close my eyes which seems to help = Like you , I 'd never let this fear stand in the way of travel ! <p> Caz , thanks for sharing your fears ! I think most people assume if we travel a lot , we do n't  give it a second thought . But frankly , I 'm right there with you . I 'm absolutely terrified of turbulence . I know the plane wont fall out of the sky or so Ive been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , I 'm a mess . <p> I definitely have a fear of flying as well . For me , its the fact that plane crashes are just so intense and destructive . I realize that air travel is technically more safe than driving , but that 's only because planes crash less frequently . <p> The problem is that when they DO crash , there 's such a high chance of it being fatal . There are no fender-benders when it comes to 747s , so I 'm pretty convinced that if there 's ever a problem on a plane , chances are Im going to die . So I just hope all the planes I 'm on never have any issues ! <p> I know exactly how you feel ! I have the exact same fear that 's why I always , always make sure Jeremy and I fly together no matter what and on the days that we are separated , I too am a mess ! I make sure we fly on bigger planes ( I just feel more secure in larger planes with more engines ! ) and would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family do n't  believe me when I say I have this fear because they see us travel on hundreds of flights . Yes , I am terrified but I do n't  let it get in the way of travel itself . <p> I think the important thing is to not let it stop you doing what you want to do . I know it is irrational and I can control it as best I can . It has gotten better over the years , but sometimes I do think how nice it would be to never catch a plane again so I do n't  have to feel so anxious . But then I think of travel and I could never give it up <p> I admire you for sharing this fear on your blog . Youve inspired me to share mine . Believe it or not , my fear is of being in an accident while travelingspecifically a bus accident . I tend to worry about it more while I 'm home , before a trip , but sometimes during one , too . I think some of it has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a friend of mine was in an awful bus accident . Several people died and her leg was smashed up so badly that she had to return to Canada . <p> I know the buses are poorly maintained and that there are more accidents of this sort in the developing world , which is where I tend to go . Despite my fear , which is fortunately sporadic only , I do take buses , some of them of dubious quality . Like you , though , I wont let fear get in my way . I travel regardless of it . <p> I understand that fear of bus accidents . A good friend of ours was killed in Africa in a bus accident . It is a very real fear for most travellers . I like to get the overnight buses now so I can sleep and not see anything . Its all part of the travel experiences- feeling the fear and doing it anyway . <p> We can totally relate to this we both used to love to fly , but the older we get and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands &amp; heart racing at take-off , and panic again when we land . We were on a flight with severe turbulence a few years ago and I think that triggered our panic of flying . <p> Flying does n't  thrill me , but the only time I really freak is when there is intense turbulence . Then I pray and I focus on deep breathing . I actually like the take off part and enjoy the views . You 're brave to share and to keep making those flights for your love of travel . <p> This is easy , losing my Passport in a Third World country . And after all these years , it finally happened and even worse at the last moment when leaving Costa Rica . Broke into a cold sweat , I knew it was in the airport " somewhere " so there I go backtracking through the Airport , backpack on and laptop in hand . Luckily , after soaked in nervous sweat , I found at the money exchange booth as the Tica was waving me down . Once on the plane that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig , this might sound pathetic but my secret travel fear is that I almost always feel like I 'm leaving something behind in my guest house , bus , train , plane , etc . Its a constant nagging thought I have in my head what did I forget this time = <p> Not pathetic at all . We always do the triple checks but are always convinced something will be left behind . Luckily it is usually just shampoo or something replaceable . In April I left two jumpers behind on the Gold Coast , and one of them was my fave Tar Heel hoodie . Spewing <p> Thanks to my mother being an airline employee I have flown all my life and never had a fear of it at all , I actually use to enjoy turbulence and then I watched that stupid movie " Final Destination " . In the film they board the plane and the little nob that holds the seat tray locked comes off which starts a whole sequence of events that lead to the plane blowing up after take off . Now because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after we are high in the air and I almost freak out if someone else does . Lord knows what will happen to me if one day I witness one of those nobs come off in someones hand haha <p> I have not seen that movie and probably best that I did n't  = Sounds almost Jawsy- never been able to swim in the beach without fear since . Ill be watching those tray nobs now and thinking of you on every flight I take and saying , " Its all Cailins fault I 'm freaking out right now " = <p> I used to be a nervous flyer and got air sick as a kid . Now I tend to say a little prayer during take-off and landing ! Its a somewhat spiritual experience being up in the skiesbut as you fly more you get less nervous . Cailin I agree on that one , I try not to touch the tray table before the plane takes off ! ! ! <p> We have a really good friend who is a pilot . He is always telling us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has witnessed ) . We told him about our flight to Kauai last year where the plane shook so bad that I thought it would break apart . It was horrible . He shrugged it off and said " Do n't  worry about that stuff . The only thing you need to really worry about is fire . And that 's extremely rare . " I found that comforting in a strange way . <p> Mine is of getting arrested abroad . Even for something benign . I know its fairly well founded , but it has definitely discouraged me from doing a few adventurous things just because of the added " what if " . The thing is , its not only in 3rd world countries with dreadful prison systems . Its everywhere outside the US . <p> Being a mom does crazy things I already told you about the woman on my last media trip that said she became afraid of heights and flying when she had children . <p> My secret : I 'm afraid of everything except flying ! I worry about getting around once I land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo traveling . And I hate eating alone . Not the same fear , but still an anxiety I deal with on a regular basis . <p> Being a mum sure does change the way you view things . I cant even handle getting within 10 feet of a high rooftop wall now . I think my babies are going to fall over the top . Ridiculous . Its good to know that everyone has irrational fears though- just another exciting thing about life = <p> I have never had a fear of flying but I do have a fear of something is going to happen when I am not with my family for the day . Sounds silly because nothing is ever going to happen . But I have this fear in the pit of my tummy that something is going to happen because I am not with them , or near them , or cant see them . If I am away for a few days , or the weekend or even overnight I have to distract my crazy sayings in my head , and repeat over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to happen " ! So I can understand your fear , and I feel for you . <p> I actually love flying and enjoy being able to watch films and read and relaxing ! it makes want to help others when they say they cant go to places because they have a fear and cant enjoy the things they want do fully like because they miss out so much more they could get out of the experience ! . I 've met some who find it difficult to enjoy activities with their kids and family e.g. because they have a fear of heights or being under water and others who take their family to the same place every year because they 're claustrophobic and cant stand planes but new experiences is what I live for . I guess its why I do NLP Coaching to enhance travel experiences so I can share the great experiences of traveling with others . It only takes a few sessions on the phone or on Skype with someone to eradicate fears and give confidence to people with anxieties , phobias or self-doubts so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I just love the great feeling it gives both of us achieving that ! <p> I do love the watching of the films and the experience of flying , but I just hate the thought of it and the taking off part . Once it settles into flight mode I settle down a lot , unless we hit rough turbulence . I think the point you raised is important and some people definitely need help in overcoming their fears . I think the most important thing with your fears is to acknowledge them and then swallow them . Do n't  let them get in the way of doing those things that can enrich your life <p> I 've done my fair share of flying , but I do still get a little nervous whenever I see the safety card in the seat pocket . Now that I 'm married with kids its a bit worse . I hate when CrashHubby has to fly somewhere for work . Its a horrible nagging fear until he gets home safely . <p> On a brighter note , welcome to Melbourne and maybe well meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , however , my fear only surfaces after we hit a spot of turbulence . If its a smooth flight , if I 'm in Business on Emirates ( we use our points a lot to upgrade ) with a glass of bubbly in hand and lots of movies to watch , I 'm just fine . But once we hit a bump , I just freak out . And , yes , its worse when I 'm alone . I 've got the long flight from Sydney to Perth to do on Tuesday to be with my Mum who is having some serious surgery and not looking forward to it at all . Ill be thinking of you ! <p> Agggh Caz , you wrote down my fears exactly ! Whenever my bf flies alone , and he has a few times in the past year or so ( Germany , Beijing , Hong Kong , from the UK to Korea ) , I always freak out . Ill have the flight tracker loaded on the airlines site , and I 'm only able to relax again once I know he s landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm exhausted and can just slump in the seat and watch a movie . I detest take-off and always imagine the plane just coming straight back down . When the fasten seatbelt sign is off then I 'm OK , but turbulence.nuh uh . I 've learned to calm myself down and tell myself that if the flight attendants are walking around , then everything is OK . Still , I do n't  like it and would rather take a bus , boat or train if at all possible ! <p> Wow , I never knew you had this fear ! Was just reading your 17 tips for flying with children and landed here on this link . We are planning an overseas holiday next year ( the boys will be 6 , 9 and 10 ) theyve only been on one interstate flight in their life and we have n't flown much either , a lot of it having to do with my fear of flying . Taking the plunge and telling myself all those positive things about flying ! ! <p> Haha its funny how most people say they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle in while cruising . For me its the opposite ! I love the fast thrill of take off , but as soon as we are in cruising altitude I start to get nervous and cant sit still . I think for me is that I can physically feel/see the plane moving during take off and landing but when I think about cruising altitude its like if something does happen I wont be prepared for it , because you do n't  really notice the plane moving and when you look out the window it looks like you 're moving really slowly so i will just be sitting there and mindlessly watching a movie or eating and then boom it will explode or something that is my biggest fear . As soon as we are banking and descending i start to relax again and think the worst is over and we will be at our destination soon but i wont be completely happy until we land and the plane slows down and the engines are off . Excuse my poor grammar as i am typing this on my phone haha ; P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look so much like jodie sweetin from the show full house it is uncanny lol ! <p> Even though your afraid of flying , I 'm glad it has n't  prevented you from traveling too much ! I just wrote about some of my fears while traveling , they 're a little more odd ball , and out there , but I think making it funny helps = Check it out and let me know what you think . LONG ... 
@@21820886 @1820886/ <h> 25 National Parks in Australia to set foot in <p> As we travel around Australia , were making an effort to visit as many of the best national parks as possible . <p> Being the outdoorsy nature lovers that we are , show us a good national park and well happily get lost exploring it for days . <p> We just love everything about them . The walks , waterfalls , gorges , swimming holes , forests , rivers , wildlife and camping . Except the flies and mosquitoes can somebody please remove those and getting bogged in Kakadu , which is funny now , but at the time not so much . <p> There are some amazing National Parks in Australia , over 500 in total , and whilst we have n't even scratched the surface yet , below is a list of some of our favourites weve recently visited . <h> 1 . Freycinet National Park Tasmania <p> Freycinet National Park is our favourite destination in Tasmania , and one of our top three national parks in Australia . With plenty of lovely walks , stunning beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's best , what more could you ask ? All you need is great weather like we had and you 'll be singing its praises like us ! <h> 2 . Cradle Mountain National Park Tasmania <p> Located 165km north west of Hobart this National Park attracts walkers from all over the world and is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area . We did n't  do a lot of the walks here as we had limited time , but when the kids are older wed love to go back and do the famous Overland Track . <h> 3 . Wild Rivers National Park Tasmania <p> Not as many people visit the west coast of Tassie , but its worth it . Running through the heart of the Tasmanian wilderness much of this park is remote and rugged with dramatic mountain peaks , spectacular gorges and world-famous rivers . Our cruise down the Gordon River was a highlight of our month long visit to Tasmania . <h> 4 . Wilsons Promontory National Park Victoria <p> Victorians have kept Wilsons Prom , or The Proma secret for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant believe its not promoted more in other Australian states . You must book way ahead as its hugely popular with bush walkers and campers . Just picture stunning vistas of pink granite boulder mountains , turquoise water , and squeaky-white sand and you 'll know why . <h> 5 . Grampians National Park Victoria <p> Commonly referred to as The Grampians , its a rugged mountain range located in Western Victoria and is renowned for its breathtaking rocky views , rich culture , stunning wildflower displays , bush walks and rock climbing . One of our favourite moments we conquered the summit of the 4km Pinnacle 's walk with our two young kiddies , they did so well . <h> 6 . Great Otway National Park Victoria <p> Triplet Falls <p> Also called The Otways , this park is one of the popular stops along the Great Ocean Road . Immerse yourself in an ancient land and walk among tall trees and giant tree ferns , and discover beautiful waterfalls . <h> 7 . Port Campbell National Park Victoria <p> If you only have time to visit one area along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is where you 'll see the best of the GOR and you could spend a whole day just here . Amazing natural formations over the rugged coastline with cliff top tracks , gorges , beach walks and stories of shipwrecks to discover . <h> 8 . Kosciuszko National Park NSW <p> If you 're looking to climb Australias highest peak , you 'll find it here . Just do n't  do what we did and attempt part of this walk with young kids in dress clothes and ill prepared for the freezing windy weather , lol . Apparently visiting Kosciuszko in the summer is amazing as the wildflowers are in bloom . Plus the mountain biking is awesome . And whilst you 're here , why not explore The Snowy Mountains region . <h> 9 . Jervis Bay National Park NSW <p> Jervis Bay is stunning . Normally we 'd head to the north coast of NSW from Sydney but on our current trip around Australia we headed to the south coast for the first time and spent five days in the Jervis Bay region . The beaches and coastal walks around here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Booderee National Park NSW <p> Just when you think Jervis Bay is beautiful , around the corner from Jervis is this gem of a park called Booderee . Very popular with the locals because of its- unspoiled beaches and great camping , but I 'm suspecting not well known around the country , we 'd certainly never heard of it previously . This region of NSW blew us away . <h> 11 . Murramarang National Park NSW <p> Murramarang is 200km south of Sydney and famous for seeing wild kangaroos hopping about on the beaches . They even hang out in front of your cabins and tent sites like well trained pets , which was a thrill for our kids . Great swimming , surfing and bush walks here , plus the cliffs and headland walks are a must . <h> 12 . Blue Mountains National Park NSW <p> credit : Shutterstock.com <p> Youve probably heard of the Three Sisters ? But the Blue Mountains has a depth greater than the infamous Three Sisters and being close to Sydney is one of the most popular national parks in Australia . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adventure and rejuvenation , unbelievably good local produce , world class cafes , cosy pubs , and restaurants . It 's a nature lovers and foodie 's paradise . <h> 13 . Royal National Park NSW <p> Did you know that the Royal National Park is Australias oldest NP and the second oldest in the world behind Yellowstone ? We did n't  either until a few years ago . Situated just one hour south of Sydney , the park 's diversity is seen in its coastal cliffs , sandy beaches , mountainous sandstone ridges and deep river valleys . <h> 14 . Burleigh Head National Park Queensland <p> Burleigh Heads is one of our favourtie spots on the Gold Coast , but we 'd never ventured into the national park until recently . Its a small park but a popular place for hiking , walkers and joggers because it provides great views . The coastal walk combined with part of the rainforest circuit is about 2.5 km all up . Its not difficult as both of our young kids walked most of the way . <p> See and do : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Echo Beach <p> Tallebudgera Creek . <p> Tumgun Lookout <h> 15 . Noosa National Park Queensland <p> The town of Noosa is a popular high-end travel destination on the Sunshine Coast 1.5 hours north of Brisbane with a lively calendar of events and beautiful people , but for us the beauty lies in the National Park that hugs the headland . Its another one of the most popular parks in the country with lovely walks and several stunning beaches . <p> See and do : <p> The coastal walk from town to Sunshine Beach <p> Walk up Noosa Hill <p> The track to Hells Gate <h> 16 . Great Sandy National Park Queensland <p> This park is divided into two sections . The Cooloola section between Noosa Heads in the south and Rainbow Beach in the north . And then there 's the incredible Fraser Island section . Fraser is the worlds largest sand island and one of Queenslands natural icons . If 4wd is your thing , you 'll love Fraser ! <p> See and do : <p> 75 Mile Beach <p> Lake Mackenzie <p> Eli Creek <p> The Pinnacles <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Queensland <p> At 110 million years old the The Daintree Rainforest pre-dates the Amazon and the dinosaurs . The Daintree and Cape Tribulation " a headland located within the national park looks anything but tattered and old . In 1988 it became a World Heritage Site and its the only place in the world where two World Heritage areas meet Daintree Rainforest meets the World Heritage Listed Great Barrier Reef . <h> 18 . Great Barrier Reef Queensland <p> Craig with a big thumbs up ! <p> Its called a Marine Park but the Great Barrier Reef is one of Australias natural icons and World Heritage listed so I 'm adding it to my list of must visit parks . Stretching 2,300km long with over 900 islands we finally got to tick the Reef off our Australia bucket list this year . Cairns is the main gateway but there are many access points along the Queensland coast from Port Douglas in the north down to Lady Elliott Island in the south . <h> 19 . Boodjamulla National Park Queensland <p> We think this park is Queenslands best kept secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way Drive in Outback North Queensland and one of the last places to visit before you hit the Northern Territory . It 's an emerald green oasis in a semi-arid land with a beautiful gorge , walks and camping . <p> See and do : <p> The Upper Gorge lookout walk <p> Indarri Falls walk <p> Canoeing on the lower and upper gorge <p> Camp at Boodjamulla National Park ( book ahead ) <p> Adels Grove <h> 20 . Undara Volcanic National Park Queensland <p> Undara was one of the most fascinating places we visited on our road trip through Queensland . I did n't  even know Australia had much volcanic history until visiting Undara Lava Tubes . This park is located along the Savannah Way drive heading west from Cairns in North Queensland . <h> 21 . Whitsunday Islands National Park Queensland <p> Looking for paradise ? Then head to this park with 74 islands called The Whitsunday Islands . These islands are boarded by the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea mid-way along the Queensland coast . If you love stunning beaches with soft white sand , island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! <h> 22 . Nitmiluk National Park Northern Territory <p> Previously named Katherine Gorge , Nitmiluk is about a 5 hour drive from Darwin . Katherine Gorge is made up of thirteen gorges carved through ancient sandstone by the Katherine River which have great ceremonial significance to the local Jawoyn people , who are custodians of Nitmiluk National Park . <h> 23 . Kakadu National Park Northern Territory <p> Ahh , the wonders of Kakadu National Park . From wetlands , to sandstone escarpments , waterfalls , swimming holes , billabongs , rivers , and wwildlife it teems with abundance and an ancient mysticism urging you to explore its changing landscapes . Kakadu would sit in my top three national parks in Australia so far . <h> 24 . Litchfield National Park Northern Territory <p> Litchfield is just over an hours drive from Darwin making it a great getaway from the city and easily accessible once you 're in the Top End . The highlight of this park is its many beautiful waterfalls and swimming holes . There 's some nice walking tracks and 4wd to be had for those equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buley Rockhole <p> Wangi Falls <p> Walker Creek <p> Magnetic Termite Mounds <h> 25 . Karijini National Park Western Australia <p> So our last recommended park on this list is our most recently visited . We left Karijini just last week after five AMAZING days and its probably our favourite national park in Australia at the moment and will be hard to beat as we continue to travel around Oz . Incredible walks , gorges and swimming holes . Put it on your MUST VISIT list for Western Australia . <p> See and do : <p> Dales Gorge <p> Kalamina Gorge <p> Weano Gorge <p> Knox Gorge <p> Hamersley Gorge <p> and do all the walks within each gorge <h> To be continued <h> Plan Your Trip in Australia 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 <p> Booking.com has over 11,000 properties in Australia including hotels , apartments , and hostels .

I had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a massive outdoors &amp; national parks lover like you guys . I also try to explore as many as I can in every country I visit . <p> To date , I have spent a total of &gt; 1 year in Australia , on 3 separate trips , and have explored the eastern half of the country by caravan , bicycle , share rides , lifts from friends and flights . I 'm happy to report that I 've visited 10 of the parks you 've listed here plus a few more you have n't covered yet in the Red Center . <p> Thanks for taking me back down memory lane by having me think about which Aussie parks Ive been to . They are really awesome ones ! <p> Hi Craig , What a great list , you and Caz are such great photographers i love reading your blogs . Have either of you ever heard or been to Carnarvon gorge in Carnarvon National Park- central Queensland ? I 've never been but it seems amazing and i 'd love to see what you guys think about it . From what Ive read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love your style of writing and that you give honest opinions of the places you visit . Thank you for all your posts = <p> Hi guys , what a great post , and an even better blog . This truly has inspired me to get up and work towards taking my young family away and show the , how beautiful our country really is ( outside Umina : ) ) <p> Owning a Branding and Marketing Agency , I see a lot of blogs and sites , this one is spot on . The UX &amp; UI is perfect , content is really informative and the photos are stunning , you guys have nailed it . <p> Hey Mick ! ! So cool to see you after all these years . Your design biz looks awesome . Our designer , Jenny from http : //NeverNorth.com helped us nail this site it took us ages to get it right . There 's so many more Australian gems other than Umina ! ! <p> Autralia too got this snorkeling activities , these parks , reef dives , beaches , and all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry you got a lot of tourist spots right there ! This is really nice . Thanks for introducing Australia to me . I am from Philippines . If you have time you can check out our country too . <p> Im surprised how many of them I know and have been to , although some of my favorites are missing , not only in Western Australia , which is underrepresented in your list . Also Washpool ( near Grafton ) in NSW , and Carnavon George ( near Roma ) in Queensland both nice parks and fairly quiet . And is n't this a bit of a contradiction : " We were blown away by this park and ca n't believe it 's not promoted more in other Australian states . You must book way ahead as it 's hugely popular " Where was the editor ? LOL <p> Its actually not a contradiction Jeurgen . Its not promoted in OTHER Australian states as we said . It is hugely popular in Victoria , and there are minimal campsites which is why you have to book ahead . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state for two months as is mentioned in the introduction , " and whilst we have n't even scratched the surface yet , below is a list of some of our favourites weve recently visited . " <p> My favourite memories of my Australian travels are from Kakadu and Litchfield . So many beautiful parks in the country . Ive been to just a few of these , but the rest are on my to-do list ! Thanks for sharing ! <p> We have long had diving the Great Barrier Reef on our Bucket List but the diversity of Australia always amazes me . Youve gathered quite a lot of interesting national parks here . I 'm looking forward to your next post for the continuation . <p> The US National Parks System has created a " passport " booklet that allows visitors to collect cancellation stamps from visitor centers at the national parks and monuments as they visit them . It makes a nice memento . Do you have anything like that in Oz ? <p> Ive been lucky enough to have visited almost 20 of the above parks and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nambung National Park The Pinnacles in Western Australia and the Purnululu National Park The Bungle Bungles also in Western Australia need to be added to the list without doubt ! ! ! ! <p> Thanks so much for sharing this post ! I 'm from Sydney and had no idea that the Royal National Park is classified as the second oldest in the world now that is some truly awesome trivia ! If you have a spare moment I think you may also enjoy some of my posts of travel tips/itineraries/stories for both Australian and international destinations at http : **29;1590;TOOLONG . <p> Weve been to 13/25 listed here . Disappointed that there is nothing listed between sydney and qld border . There are some outstanding places to explore here . Oxley wild rivers being one of them with excellent facilities and very accessible for young familes . Great post though ! <p> Have looked every where re entrance fee to the national parcs . We are for sure visiting Uluru and maybe others . What are the rates and is it better to buy a pass . which parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling together in Feb 2017 
@@21820887 @1820887/ <h> OMG ! You mean you 're taking your child out of school ? <h> What about school ? <p> I was asked- it a lot before we even knew we were going to travel around Australia for a year . Now its the number one question asked . <p> I 'm surprised people are so worried about the education issue . They are probably surprised when I act nonplussed about it in return . <p> " I can take care of Kalyras education . Shell learn more on the road than at school anyway . " <p> It is very easy for me to make that decision as I am a primary school teacher with 15 years experience in 5 countries around the world ( including Australia ) . I feel confident I can give her the education she needs and follow the required curriculum the law expects . <p> I do n't  think- missing the first few- years of traditional- school will make much of a difference . <p> I 've seen what goes on in classrooms around the world . There is very little teacher-child on-one-one ratio and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , often to frightening levels . <p> I do n't  believe it is where children get their best education. - I think they get it first from their parents and second from their life experiences- or maybe they both- are of equal importance . <p> My daughters will learn far more travelling the world with us and there will be far less issues . <p> I 'm not going to go into a post that bags school . Many families love it and it suits their lifestyles . I think that is great . Everyone has to do what best suits them . <p> I 'm not a great player of societys rules and a person to- do things just because that 's the way theyve always been done . I have to do it because I know it is right for me. - I question everything . Is this the best scenario for me or is it for those who want it to be ? <p> Kalrya just turned 6 and is half way through Kindergarten . She has confidence that took me 25 years to develop , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with-and she has a wild and creative imagination . <p> This is not me using this as an opportunity to brag about my child , simply to say what I believe the benefits of travel have already given her . <p> I also know school interrupts our precious family time together travelling the world . <p> Selfish yes I know . But is it really ? <p> Is it really selfish to want to have your children with you every day exploring the world ? <h> What I was worried about in taking Kalyra out of school ? <p> I do think about my decisions a lot . I take time to evaluate the pros and cons , I gather all the facts I need to help me make the decision and then I sit with them and allow my gut to speak . <p> In making this decision to travel Australia and take Kalyra out of school I worried about a couple of things . <h> 1 . Kalyra loves school <p> Well secretly admit that we loved hearing Kalyra start to have a few whingey comments about school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love school and learning . Although I am sure the loving school thing will soon start to change and from some of her comments it is . ( Some of her other comments freak me out a little when I hear- what she is- picking up from other kids . I worry about the influence of peers ! ) <p> I had to think about what Kalyra loves most about school . Its learning . She was born with her arms and legs flailing , indicative of the drive she has to be moving forward . <p> Taking her out of school wont hurt her . Her classroom is going to get so much bigger and there will be no interruptions constantly eating away at her motivation . Trust me , those kids who love learning get frustrated in a classroom by those who do n't and get in their way . <h> 2 . Kalyra loves her friends <p> Okay this is the killer . Mothers guilt goes into overdrive . Are we going to destroy our childs social skills and ability to make friends ? I worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road trip , wed be moving , probably to Queensland , so wed be taking her out of that school anyway and shed have- to make new friends . <p> I can barely remember who was in my Kindergarten class , let alone still friends with them . <p> I have n't maintained friendships with many people from school at all . <p> Some of my strongest friendships come from those I 've shared amazing experiences with on the travel road , even if it were only for a few short days . <p> Kalyra is really great at making friends with anyone . We went to the park the other day and she made friends with two girls in just an hour . She babbles away and plays like they have been friends for years . When it comes time to leave she happily let 's the friendship go . No social skills affected , she has no problem forming connections and she is happy . <p> I know that when we travel , she will be meeting so many different people : adults and children and having those connections that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy Mum and Dad and an adoring sister . <p> Kalyra loves reading to Savannah <p> Craig and I spoke about all these concerns and we felt they were easily overcome and our choice to travel Australia was still the better one . <p> So with those worries sorted it was down to , what do I do about schooling now ? What are the laws ? <h> Home-schooling <p> We had decided that I would- home-school , or unschool Kalyra . We 'd loosely follow the curriculum , but it would mostly be about learning from the environment and our experiences and then spending a couple of hours a day building those vital reading , writing and maths skills . <p> It would be flexible , fun and I 'd be in control . <p> All I had to do was register . <p> Roadblock . <p> You ca n't register for home schooling unless you are a permanent resident of the state . Hmmm , road tripping around Oz does not fit that criteria . <h> Distance Education <p> That meant we had to enroll her in distance education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control was going and it felt more rigid . There were actual lessons with work that needed to be completed and sent back to her teacher . I need to give a detailed itinerary of where well be so lessons can be mailed out each fortnight . <p> What ? ? ? <p> This does not adhere to my life of freedom on the road . I was annoyed I could not have greater control over my childs education . Why couldnt I teach her while we travelled ? If that is how we want to live our life than that is what we should be able to do . <p> I investigated a little more and I found a distance education school based in Surry Hills , Sydney . I think they say about 4 hours a day of education and for those travelling they encourage learning from the outside world and want you to incorporate that into their lessons . <p> I do n't  think Kalyra will need 4 hours a day . I think she could move through the work pretty fast . <h> This is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kalyra loves school and learning so maybe this little bit of structure will be good for her . <p> It will save me oodles of time having to prepare stuff myself . And with our business , I do n't have oodles of time . <p> This way I can ensure she wont fall behind ( just in case ) because I 'd hate that . <p> It will give her more independence ( which she loves ) . <p> She can do the lessons via computer . <p> While she is working independently , we can be working on our business . It will work better . <p> Savannah will love watching and helping her and I 'm sure shell learn too . <p> They will supply lessons for things like craft and music , which I am crap at , and because of my lack of interest will probably not give 100% . That is not really fair to her . I do n't  want to rob her of opportunities to develop in ways I 'm not aware of . <p> It holds Craig and I more accountable . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited her new school in Surry Hills ( its just offices ) and met her teacher . <p> Kalyra was so excited and really liked her teacher . We took home a bag of art and craft supplies and maths equipment . She felt like the luckiest girl and was bursting . She even pleaded with me to give her her handwriting book on the way home , so she could do a few pages . <p> I was also happy and impressed with how the system is set up . If only every child could go to a distance ed school , theyd have units of work , more tailored to their levels ; theyd be more independent learners ; thered be no teacher time taken up managing classroom behaviour ( usually 80% of the time ) ; and parents would be more accountable in helping their child learn . <p> Were excited about our new schooling adventure and are not sure if we ever want to go back to the brick and mortar stuff . <p> P.S It turns out Kalyras new distance education school used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where he grew up in Surry Hills ! Too cool for school ! <p> UPDATE : We are now travelling full time again overseas . This time we have chosen to homeschool rather than do distance education . I share why , plus my homeschooling strategy , routine , and resources in this post . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I 'm so pleased you 've found an option that seems like its going to work out . It is funny that there are so many rules that are based on being resident in one and only one place ! This post made me think about my all time favorite school activity when I was age 5-6 which was a bag full of clippings of pictures from newspapers and magazines . You had to pull something out of the bag and write a story about whatever you got . It was awesome ! <p> Sounds like you have it all figured out . I am planning on homeschooling my son . He is only 4 now but we have started preschool . I think the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she will benefit so much from traveling . <p> I 'm so pleased you found something that 's going to work for all of you . I think education is really important but , like you say , so much of the time in primary school classes gets taken up with trying to make disruptive children behave and the ones who actually want to learn miss out . <p> I honestly think you guys are doing a great job and love that you 're not doing what everyone else does just because its " the norm " . <p> I think if a few more parents were a bit more open-minded when it comes to education ( ie. to include travel and different activities that do n't  involve sitting in a classroom ) we 'd have a lot more " well-rounded " kids in the future . <p> Totally agree . And I think parents need to be more involved with their learning . You see that gap quite a lot as a teacher . I felt teaching because I felt like I was n't really achieving much by way of teaching and inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was homeschooled for periods of time and we moved around a lot . So its not something I 'm interested in for my kids . I felt like it set me up as an outsider for life , but that might have been the case anyway ! And I think it was mostly a personality thing . Piper and Riley are so outgoing I doubt it would impact them in the same way it did me <p> Thanks Zoey . I think it is really important to think about the nature of your children before making the decision , otherwise it can have really negative consequences . Heres hoping we picked it right for Kalyra ! <p> I remember asking you guys about this and expecting you to say you were going to be homeschooling ! Would have loved to talk to you about it more . I was homeschooled while we travelled and ended up skipping 2 grades and I remember reading novels when I was about 6 or 7 . <p> Just goes to show the benefits of teaching kids outside of a classroom . Individualized instruction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of 30 kids , that ai n't  going to happen much ! Although Kalyras teacher at school has been wonderful . <p> I think it is great what you are doing for your children . My best friend is Australian and she is one of the most brilliant people one could ever meet . Her parents took her and her brother out of school to travel around when they were around 10 . She now travels the world , is highly educated and is well known over there . I have contemplated doing this with my son . I say , good for you . <p> Hubby and I both taught at Sydney Distance Education Primary School ( when it was still in Stanmore ) and majority of kids were off on amazing adventures . The experiences they were having were phenomenal and added so much more to their formal education <p> I became a huge fan of distance ed after working in it and plan on doing it when we eventually travel with our kidlets in a few years time . <p> As a teacher for 31 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other things . Learning on the road , so to speak is an invaluable lesson that can not be replicated in a classroom . How do these children re integrate back into traditional schooling , very easily actually . They seem to gain a great independence and the skills of getting along with others is enhanced . As for distance ed . I can not speak highly enough of their services . You do make an invaluable bond with the teachers and the curriculum is second to none . I was at an academically selective school and we had students away for travel , sports , music you name it . They all did exceptionally well at the hsc . Your children will benefit from not just the travel but also distance ed . You are doing the right thing . Enjoy and appease your conscious . <p> Youll be an awesome teacher , Caz and between you and Craig Im sure the girls will do just fine no better than fine theyll excel and be happy . Our kids went to 9 different schools and I home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence to start out on their peripatetic journey . <p> When I moved back to the Hawkesbury from Sydney city I decided to go back to uni and study to be a primary school teacher . I wanted a job that I could do close to home , I loved kids and I had strong personal beliefs about kids needing to learn through play and hands-on investigation ( which uni taught me is what they call inquiry-based learning that follows a student-centred pedagogy , taking into consideration each childs natural strengths and interests ) . Then it came time to teach and put these ideals into practice . I was studying at the University of Western Sydney so , for my practicums I was placed in some of the poorest suburbs of Sydney , where I saw a child in a kindergarten class hold a book upside down " he had n't  been read to at home and did n't  know how to hold a book the right way up by looking at the words and pictures . Although I 'm a qualified primary teacher , in the end I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caz , the amount of time a classroom teacher spends on behaviour management disrupts the education of the children in the room who want to listen . Although the principles behind student-centred learning are a huge step towards developing individuals rather than robots , these principles are currently ideals , they 're not reality . Until the number of students per teacher is halved " at the very least " student-centred learning will continue to be an ideal . I 'd never heard of distance education for young children , but after reading your post it sounds like a solution to the problem ! All the best , I 'm looking forward to keeping up to date with your travels ! <p> I felt the same when I sat with the distance ed teacher and went through the materials . Its a perfect model . I 'm so glad I am not teaching anymore as I felt so ineffective and frustrated each day ! It will be nice to now teach and actually feel like I 'm making a difference = <p> Congratulations on making the bold move to take Kalyra out of school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to go with the Distance Education program , I hope it has put your minds at rest . <p> On a number of occasions over the past ten years we took our boys out of school for 8 weeks at a time to travel around Europe . Although our friends and family in Europe were amazed that the school system would allow us to do this ( you 're lucky to have one extra day away from school over there unless you are sick ! ) , we had no trouble at all taking our kids out of school . In fact , the teachers were extremely supportive most , like us , are of the opinion that kids learn so much through travel , that what they miss of the three Rs in those couple of months , they more than make up for in other ways . <p> Our boys learnt the importance of planning and budgeting , experienced new foods , languages and currencies and were introduced to cultures and architecture that theyd never seen before and all of this recorded in their journals . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many new things and expanding her outlook on life in a very positive way . She will thank you for it one day . <p> Hi , I am wondering how you were able to take your kids out of school as I am wanting to take my child out of school for 6 months possibly to travel and not sure of the legalities . Hoping that you might be able to help me please <p> It all depends on where you come from and what the regulations are . Its best to talk to the principal of your school , who can let you know your best options . Or just contact the state education board and ask them your options . There are different routes you can take , but you can take them out of school as long as you are continuing their education . <p> This was a great artical , i might be in that situation one day , and now at least i know a few more options and how to deal with it , so nice you guys found the " right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We took out kids out of a highly sought after charter school to go on a 4 years sailing/backpacking adventure . People thought we were crazy leaving such a good school . I could n't believe they thought that was better than the adventure of living on a sailboat and traveling through South America . Crazy ! Because we were out of the US , they had no jurisdiction over our homeschooling , so that left us open to tailoring it to our needs . At first I bought the entire homeschool curriculum for 1st grade ( my daughter ) and 5th grade ( my son ) . There was a lot to it , and the first month of two I noticed we were spending more time on the schoolwork than we were exploring outside our back door . So the next year and the years following , we covered the courses they would have had back at the school , but I put in a mix of lesson plans from various places . We did follow a standard math curriculum , and science , but the rest we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught himself chemistry . Of course we also spent a a big part of our time learning the history and culture of all the countries we visited ( over 30 ! ) . The experience itself will be the best education . The time together as a family ( for us 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , 365 days a year , 4 1/2 years , was PRICELESS ) You can never get that time back . The only problem they may have when they return to school is boredom . Good luck ! <p> What an awesome experience Carla ! ! Thank you for sharing your story . Its made me so excited by the possibilities ahead with travel and education . I do worry about the boredom upon return to school too . <p> We do n't  have kids yet and do n't  plan on having them soon , but this issue is really interesting , I think . <p> I remember feeling incredibly bored and unmotivated in school . And I even went to a great school , one of the best in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , I think . <p> When we have kids unschooling will be the way well educate our children . There 's no doubt about that , and I think that Kalyra and Savannah are lucky to have parents like you who are going to give them such a great education ! Good luck , cant wait to follow your adventure ! <p> I love your reasoning for **25;1621;TOOLONG . My husband and I are in the planning stages of conceiving and we are already planning to roadschool . Ive been a teacher and tutor and find even if our lifestyle did n't  require this form of education ( we travel for his work ) that I would want to homeschool , since I do n't  agree with the student-teacher ratio , politics , or overall agenda of both public and private schools ( I 've worked in both ) . I am actually working on creating my blog RoadschoolParenting.com to detail my parenting journey/tips and help families who want to homeschool/roadschool . I love reading about families that have the courage to focus on family and not worry about " traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and it was a good fit for me ( an even better fit for some of my siblings ) . I have seen many , many advantages to homeschooling , especially when the parents have education experience like yours . I think ( for what its worth ) that you 're making a great experience and , given all the rules you 're working around , distance learning will be perfect for Kalyra . I look forward to hearing more about how it works for you ! <p> Wow I am just impressed of what you do , i mean everything . My hubs and i want to do something similar and it encourages us a LOT to see that its possible = now we only need to find something to pay the bills hehe Thank you so much for inspiring us &lt;3 best wishes and good vibes ! <p> I think Distance Ed is fantastic option if you are travelling at the right with that I mean you have to travel within semesters . <p> My sister took her daughter out of school for 6 months April- September however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience would out weigh a class room they offered work books etc. my niece was 12 at the time and returned still one of the top students in her class <p> its so interesting I was just thinking of this . I am not even close to having children or a family for that matter but If i do I want this . I have horrible experiences of being trapped in school for 8-10 hours a day with no motivation or even worst with teachers that did not like to teach . I was homeschool through kinder because we traveled with dad ( he is a truck driver-long haul ) but when i had to go to primary school i was in hell . I hated not learning first hand . I think that was the reason i felt into depressions starting 5 grade because people that like to learn do n't  want to learn from people we want to experience it ! i applaud you and hope one day to be able to do this with my children ! <p> If university students can go on-line to fulfill degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their parents and be home or whatever is required for schooling plus learn from their experiences and over computer too . They will undoubtedly be better off than not experiencing the joys of extended travel . <p> We pulled our third-grade son from school and moved to Japan . His school allowed it , and I home-schooled him for a few months , at three hours a day . We spent the rest of the day exploring our town of Kumamoto . My son also accompanied me on my author tour of Japan , and we toured ancient sites and studied Japanese history together . We followed up this trip to one in England , following King Arthurs trail . Finally , we pulled my son from high school and enrolled him at online Keystone High School in PA . That allowed him to attend a creative arts school for music half day . He is now a college senior and a successful touring musician . He takes some college courses in the classroom and others online while touring . <p> If you happen to find some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you enrolled your daughter in . Even if it is just a link , it would be greatly appreciated . Thank you for posting this piece . You have calmed one dads worries . <p> Hi Caz , Love your blog by the way . I just stumbled across this old post of yours on facebook re Distance Education . We are looking at doing this with our 8 and 6 year old boys . Now that you have finished your trip , I 'd love to know what you thought of the whole programme , how your girls settled into school life now , and were they ahead or behind in certain areas of schooling , are they bored in school after travelling etc . <p> Yes ! stay tuned on the blog . I will be writing a post really soon . Its quite involved so I wont go into it too much here . But , just quickly distance ed was a great way to do it and Kalyra has settled back into class well and is thriving . Shes quite in front in her class .

In one weekend I got to experience both extremes . But there is a funny twist to experiencing its high crime rate <p> After volunteering for a week at Maya Pedal in San Andres Itzapa , Guatemala , it was time to head to Honduras . <p> Riding a bike blending machine while volunteering at Maya Pedal <p> But along the way , why not visit the capital ? I had heard how dangerous it was , but after visiting 49 countries and never really having a bad experience , what was the worst that could happen ? <h> Confusing Arrival In Guatemala City <p> The chicken bus I took to Guatemala City dropped me off in the middle of nowhere . Using my awesome ( its not awesome ) Spanish , I asked a guy who got off the bus with me where the city center was . <p> The truth was , I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't  written back to me with where to meet . But I figured the city center is usually a good place to meet . <p> The local guy , Pedro , explained where I had to go to take a bus to the city center . I did n't  understand what he was saying , but I watched his hands and I planned to walk down the street as instructed , turn right , and then ask someone else since the sign language became less clear after that . <p> TransMetro <p> Pedro realized I had no idea where to go . I also had a gigantic backpack that screamed tourist as loudly as a flashing light and siren- scream police car . He asked me if I wanted him to accompany me to where I needed to go . I did n't  think it was too far away , so I agreed . <p> 15 minutes later we arrived at the TransBus station ! Along the way , he told me how dangerous the city was . He used to live in New York and he said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . <p> We even climbed up a highway overpass . I did n't  hear that part during his explanation or I might have just grabbed a taxi from the start . Instead , my glutes got a serious workout courtesy of said gigantic backpack . <p> When we got to the bus station , he walked with me to the gate and , as I 've experienced in many other countries , this was the time where the local help expected to be rewarded . <p> So I reached into my pocket and pulled out enough money for a small meal . But he flat out refused . I was so thankful I even asked for a picture so I could remember the nicest guy in Guatemala City . <p> Me and the nicest guy in Guatemala in the TransMetro station <p> He reluctantly agreed . I then tried to give him the money again , and he refused . He gave me 30 minutes of his day and pleasant conversation and expected nothing in return . <p> What a great way to start at trip in this supposedly danger-filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbery With A Magic Weapon <p> I spent my last night in Guatemala City with someone I met via Couchsurfing . We were meeting for the first time and I was really exited to meet Connie . She is a journalist and I looked forward to talking about the media , her work , and publicity in general . <p> Connie picked me up in front of the Palacio Nacional in the center of the city . She spent the weekend near the beach and was not dressed for the cool nights of Guatemala City . We went back to her place so she could change . <p> Door where robbery occurred <p> We talked as she inserted the key into the door of her building . All of a sudden a motorcycle pulled up next to us about 7ft/2m away . He said " buenes noches " or " good night " in a friendly way . I assumed he was a friend of Connies and completely switched gears into Practice Spanish Mode . <p> In Practice Spanish Mode I never interrupt since that would be rude . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decode what they are saying . If I cant understand anything , I invent my own ridiculous subtitles to stave off boredom and make myself feel better about still being so bad at Spanish . <p> With Practice Spanish Mode in full swing , I stared at the motorcyclist as if it were a staring contest . He spoke extremely fast and with a very low volume . I could n't understand anything he said . <p> Street where robbery took place <p> My attention span was approaching funny subtitle territory , when all of a sudden I saw a second motorcycle go by and I heard Connie scream . She was a good 30ft/10m away and running like an Olympian . <p> The motorcyclist in front of me was no longer a friend of Connies , nor motorcyclist . He was a robber ! And the second motorcycle was obviously part of his team . <p> It was kind of strange to have a paradigm shift like that in an instant . Not really knowing what to do , and given that my instincts proved about as useful as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran after Connie without looking back . <p> Connie ran into a restaurant diagonally across the street . When I got there , the owners were already running to close the gigantic metallic gate to protect us ( and them ) . <p> Connie was shaking and close to hyperventilating . At this point , I still really did n't  know what happened . They called the police and they surprisingly showed up in less than five minutes . <p> Connie explained that she heard him say , immediately after he said buenes noches , " Dame tus chivas . " Well , to me Chivas is a brand of Scotch and a Mexican soccer/football team . <p> Apparently , in Guatemalan slang chivas is the same as cosas , or things . So he was telling me to give him my things . But it does n't  matter . I did n't  hear him say this anyway . <p> It was nice to know , however , that Connie bolted immediately and literally left me in the dust the whole rest of the time ! <p> Looking back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had cajones made of steel given the unafraid and unflinching stare I gave him , or was paralyzed by shock . <p> I prefer to think option two prevailed in his mind . In reality , my bad Spanish saved me from handing over my backpack ( which had my computer , Kindle , passport , and other important stuff ) . <p> Connie apologized for the lopsidedness of her fight or flight response . We think my lack of action disrupted the timing of the teamed robbery . Connie running away and screaming probably did n't  help either <p> Had the robber had a weapon , obviously I would have known immediately what was going on and I would n't enjoy telling this story . <p> We still went out and had a nice time that evening . We chose to forget what happened , which was n't too difficult for me since it was n't at all traumatic for me during the incident ! <p> In the end , I had a great time in Guatemala and I would go back in a heartbeat .

We saw some in Sarawak and really enjoyed watching them interact with each other and swinging around . <p> Hello : I 'm looking into volunteering at a sanctuary for orangutans at the moment .. I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about your trip : such as where you stayed , rough prices for you flight and accommodation per week ? I 'd really appreciate it ! Thanks ( email protected ) <p> I visited this place earlier this year , pretty amazing . And sad at the same time . Sad that a place like that has to exist . I also saw wild orangutans during a river cruise , they were far away but you could see them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more amazing , even though it was hard to see them . But they were completely out in the wild and I think that was so awesome ! Apparently its rare to see them so close to the Kinabatangan river . <p> Did you visit the Turtle sanctuary at Selingan Island ? If not , I can recommend that for your next trip to Borneo . <p> Hello ! Loved what you wrote ! My boyfriend and I are planing a trip to Kota Kinabalu and I would love to go and see the orangutans . Were on a budget and I cant see anywhere if we can go to the sanctuary without having to stay at the resort because it seems out of our budget . Any info you have would be much appreciated .

Behind him lay his lady on the couch under a crocheted blanket , her words grunting something to the effect of , " What do they want ? " <p> I opened my mouth and let out the spiel . It was the bargain of the week a- coupon booklet for Dominos pizza . It 's only 20 Euro a month and look at all you get . " <p> I 'm not sure if they slammed the door in my face I was getting kinda used to it but I walked away with my head slumped , dragging my feet . What the hell was I doing walking the streets of the housing commission in North Dublin trying to sell Dominos pizza deals ? <p> The week before that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping that the next door would help give me my measly $9 commission . <p> Later that evening , my team leader tried to pep me up with a sellers chant . " Everyone has the money , you just need to show them the value . " <p> I argued back . " We 've just been in the housing commission . Have you seen how they live ? They do n't  have the money for membership deals to pizza . " <p> Yes they do . Everyone has the money . " <p> I knew at that moment , I would n't be showing up to work the next day . I just couldnt sell something so unnecessary to people who had little options just so I could make a commission . <p> The truth is not everyone has the money . For many , money is a struggle and they certainly ca n't " and should n't -find a few extra dimes a week for- a pizza . <p> You might feel like that when you read our blog , or see another Instagram picture of someone enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have the money to make it a reality for me <p> I understand how you might not have the money to travel more . We offer so many tips and strategies on the blog to help you find more money . <p> But what if you 've exhausted all options and you just do n't  have the money ? What if everywhere you turn you just do n't  see any hope of ever finding it ? <p> All the money talk on this site never comes from a place of us having a lot of money . Its never been the case . The door knocking catastrophe is just an example of the lengths I had to go to try and get some money coming in. <h> 1 . Do n't  ignore your power to create it <p> Many times we say we do n't have the money because what were asking to spend our money on is not really a priority , or were frightened that we cant make it work . <p> But , a lot of the time when we say we do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  . <p> However , what you are ignoring is your ability to create the money . <p> You are far more powerful than you give yourself credit for . <p> Youve got to activate that power within you that can create the money . No more talk about what you cant do you know that already- you have to step up and say I 'm going to make it my mission to find ways to create the money I need for the dream ( or perhaps just to pay the bills to start with . ) <p> Belief is key to any movement forward . <h> 2 . Know you are not alone <p> There are obviously many cases where some people really have no one else to turn to . But , I think for most of us , there is someone we can turn to for support . <p> We have family and friends who can help , or if you are in a country as wonderful as ours the government . I know the shame and sadness that courses through your veins when you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitting you 're a complete loser ( you 're not really , you 're just too hard on yourself ) <p> Youve got to do what youve got to do . Know that your money struggle is only temporary . Understand were all to help each other , and commit to doing everything you possibly can to turn it around . <p> We 've had friends help us out with work , family help us get back on our feet , and we 've taken government assistance . I use those destitute feelings as motivation to never be in that position again . <h> 3 . Do n't  focus on how poor you are <p> This is the worst thing you can do , but the absolute hardest . When you do n't  have the money , its almost impossible to not focus on the fact , that you do n't  have the money . But , its vital that you do everything you possibly can to keep your emotions high . You have to use strategies and tips to trick your mind into thinking the money is on the way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest ways for me to do this is to get out in nature . Leave the bills and worry behind and go for a walk in the forest or on the beach . Clear your mind and focus on just how beautiful and abundant nature is . Make it a daily habit to feel good . Schedule in happy movies , singing in the kitchen while you cook , dancing with your children or lover , and going for a run . <p> You must discipline yourself to pivot from the pain and negativity to positive joy . <p> I always believe in faking it till you make it . <h> 4 . Let 's just try and see <p> A lot of the time we look at an opportunity , but immediately shut it down because we think we know why it ca n't work . I did n't  think I could teach in Dublin because I could not speak Gaelic , hence the door-knocking sales job . <p> But , I was so bummed and down about that ( and the telephone sales job trying to sell envelopes before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I visited the department of education and discovered I could teach , but only in a casual position . Then an ad appeared in the paper looking for a permanent position teaching English as a foreign language . <p> Why do n't  I just try it ? <p> I surprisingly got a phone call from the principal , John . He was n't meant to hire me , but invited me to Christmas drinks for a " chat " anyway . He spoke to me the entire time about Gaelic football and then told me I had the job . <p> He said not to worry about the non-Gaelic thing , hed find a way to work around it . <h> 5 . Learn new skills <p> I 've always been afraid of not having a job or money . I think it comes back to when I was young , I associated work with freedom . I was head strong and determined to get what I wanted , but without a job I was at the mercy of my parents rules . <p> I knew if I armed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job and pay my own way . I 'd work many jobs at a time just so I could have enough money to travel and do what I wanted . We had no idea what we were doing travel blogging , but we learned so many things along the way that eventually helped us to create our own income in these different ways . <p> If you 're struggling for money , what new skills can you learn to increase your income or give you more opportunities ? <h> 6 . Get rid of debt <p> When we returned from the US broke and jobless , our first priority after getting income coming in -was to pay off our debt . <p> Debt puts the fear of God into me and I know how crippling it is to your sense of self worth and your freedom . <p> Its vital to come up with a plan that will help you eliminate your debt , it will give you more money to do what you really love . ( Just make sure you follow this plan to spend your money on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if that means you have to try and sell crappy pizza deals then just do it . Just choose better neighbourhoods ! ! <p> What I really mean is get out on the streets and find the money . No not by picking up loose coins , but by asking for jobs . When I arrived in Dublin ( the first time I lived there in 99 , not during the 02 sales job ) I had 72 pounds to my name and I knew no one . I had to find a job quick . <p> I went to the main tourist district , The Temple Bar , and walked into the pubs . By the third one , I had a job starting that evening . Thanks to the tips , I walked out with wads of cash every evening . <p> We had to knock on many doors with our travel blog and still do . It 's terrifying and we 're frightened of failure and rejection , but we know if we do n't do it , we 'll be stuck forever in a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step over those fears and knock anyway . <p> Repeat this mantra : <p> And another of my favourites <h> 8 . Who do you know ? <p> Do n't be afraid to call on people you know for help . <p> I reached out to my brother 's old boss in Dublin to score some lunch-time shifts at a pub and make more money . My brother helped us get work on a pearl farm in 04 when we arrived home from Africa broke . Five months later we had $20,000 in savings ready to move to the US . We 've had friends help us out with work back home when we 've been stuck . <p> We 've had many income opportunities open through our blog because of people we know , so start building relationships with some new people . If you want to earn more money , start hanging around people who earn more than you . Their thinking and star power will start to rub off on you . <p> Who do you know that can help you get more work ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-employed friend need help organizing their books or managing a few admin tasks ? <p> If you do n't ask the answer is always no. <h> 9 . Pretend you have the travel dream <p> One of the biggest things we did returning home almost bankrupt from America was to pretend we had the travel dream . We knew feeling good about travel would help us create more of it . So we became a traveller in our home town . It did n't really cost us any extra money at all . <p> It helped us to appreciate what our home region offered , and it got us in a much higher vibration of discovery , fun and joy " vital emotions needed to attract more of the same into your life . <p> So pack a picnic and go for a bushwalk on a trail you 've never been on before . Visit the neighbouring beach or attend a local festival or markets . Get out and embrace life " just because your finances are in transition does not mean you ca n't enjoy living . <h> 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported in the past <p> Money is just an energy exchange and we block it for many reasons " mostly unknown to us . <p> Lack of money can put you in a space where you feel you are not supported and nothing ever goes your way . Unfortunately , you will continue to create what you feel . So if you feel hopeless and desperate , you 're going to create more situations to help you feel that way . <p> I tell you , I created a shit storm , when I lived from this space . All the other times , I 've been able to turn my broke status around to money flowing in , - has been when I 've believed that I could and I 've just taking action . <p> A good way to snap yourself out of your funk is to think about all the ways you 've been supported in the past . <p> Write a list . It might be that you lost your job , but then two days later another one miraculously appeared . Or , you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed that morning for fuel . <p> Write a list of how powerful you 've been in the past as well . What incredible things have you created or achieved ? <p> You 've got to start believing in yourself and trusting that the Universe has got you covered .

Its the confidence boost I needed tonight ! <p> This is what i have been practising the last 4 months . i think of something , imagine it as a reality and then learn to trust that the universe will conspire to make it happen . And i have been so lucky , blessed , and things are really working out . <p> Before trying this i found i was in the habit of looking at the bad things , and focusing on what was not going great now i focus on the positive and the good and it creates more positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive so much harder than it sounds , but if you can train yourself to pivot out of the negative stuff it can only help to create a better future . Keep up the manifesting ! <p> Fun story : young Steve Jobs wanted to tinker with electronics . HPs headquarter was just around the block from his house . So Jobs picked up the phone and gave HP a call . Introduced himself , and asked if they had any spare parts he could pick up . The guy who answered his call was HPs president , who invited Steve over and took on a tour of the factory . <p> Of course , Jobs got his spare parts . <p> The lesson : if never hurts to ask . <p> Caz , your post his this home . I cant highlight point #7 enough . If you do n't  ask , you 'll never know what the answer was ! <p> Good read ! I remember when I moved from Brazil to New Zealand and not even one month into it my money was almost completely gone . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Good news was that I started asking everyone for opportunities . Not long later I found myself working in a web development agency . I went from washing cars and speaking very little English to a fancy office in Parnell , Auckland and dealing with clients over the phone . <p> Asking is powerful indeed . And the experiences it can create are fun and challenging . <p> Let 's rock it Dan ! Isn ; t it amazing the stories you have to tell when you just step outside of the comfort zone ? I cant imagine a much bigger way to do it then to work in a country where you do n't  speak the language well ! Awesome ! <p> This is such a great post , very inspiring and encouraging . I love that you were doing door to door sales in Dublin ! I did electricity sales , and a short stint as a milk person in Australia ! I have a post ready to go on the experience ! I 'm just back home from years of travel and all I want is to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever to scrape together the money to travel . Right now I have to worry about having clothes for work !

Cool idea ! <h> City Line Bangkok Airport Rail Link <p> If you want to save a little more money and you have a bit more time then take the City Line to Bangkok airport .

Be aware that if you take one within Bangkok you will have to deal with added costs due to traffic delays . <p> All taxis are now metered and air-conditioned : the hailing fee is 35 baht and most trips within downtown cost less than 100 baht .

Tuk Tuk drivers will always try to overcharge the tourists . Offer the price you are willing to pay and see what they say . If they say no , walk way .

How do I deal with travel photography on the road ? <p> I do n't market myself as a professional travel photographer by any means , Instagrammer maybe , but that being said , I do try and improve my photos where I can and I like to try new things . <p> And I like putting myself in my shots occasionally : selfie , portrait , or just point of reference , it varies . So without a partner to help me , how do I manage to take travel photos as a solo traveler ? <p> I thought I 'd go ahead and share some of my travel photography tips and secrets over the years about getting shots on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid to talk to strangers <p> Personally , I 've found that as a solo female traveler , people find me non-threatening and approachable , which is so awesome and works both ways . <p> If there are people around , usually I just go up to someone and ask if they would n't mind taking my picture . <p> I do it in the friendliest , nicest way possible , and sometimes if they are a couple or with someone else , or solo too , I first offer to take their photo for them before asking for reciprocation . And , obviously , I give them the sneaky once-over and mentally weigh out the chances that they will run away with my camera and/or if I can outrun them to get it back . <p> Also , the majority of people might not know how to operate your camera , so I carefully explain to them how to use it and personally fling the strap over their neck so they wo n't drop it . <p> I use a big SLR camera which can be intimidating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zoom in the right place before handing it over . <p> Depending on how friendly and open they are , I might tell them how I would like the shot composed , but I do n't like to push my luck . <h> 2 . Use a Tripod for epic travel photos <p> I also like to compose some artful , complicated shots , imagine me staring off in the distance standing on a rock or something , which is just easier to do with a tripod and maybe even a remote timer . <p> For point and shoots or smaller cameras , you definitely do n't need to invest in a big fancy tripod for these , you can use a small , tough Gorilla Pod that you can set anywhere or hang on anything . Super handy to have . <p> In Wanaka , New Zealand <h> 3 . Use a Selfie stick for your solo travel photos <p> I feel like I risk internet banishment by publicly admitting to owning a selfie stick , but I live by a 100% honesty policy and I would hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent investment for solo travelers if you want easy travel pictures of yourself . You can get one that has an attachment for your iphone , which full disclosure , you risk looking ridiculous if you use in front of other people , but are great for when no one else is around . <p> I use my selfie stick mostly with my GoPro , which is great for any sort of adventure activity , underwater selfies , animal photobombs and cool fisheye selfies while traveling . <p> Fox Glacier , New Zealand <h> 4 . Group activities <p> Even though I mostly travel by myself , it does n't mean I am usually alone . I tend to sign up for group day trips and tours , pub crawls , cooking classes and activities as a way to meet people on the road . <p> Solo travelers tend to congregate on these kinds of trips and it becomes super easy to ask people to take travel photos for you , or even with you . <p> In fact , many adventure activities usually have a guide taking travel photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get shots you might want . <h> 5 . Be careful with your travel camera gear <p> And finally , I thought I would go ahead and give a little mention of how I manage to travel around the world with all my camera gear without having problems . <p> Many people will have more valuable camera equipment than me while many do n't . It varies . <p> For me , the most important factor is not flaunting the fact that I carry expensive travel gear . <p> This means I use camera bags that do n't look like camera bags , and I do n't generally walk around with my camera slung around my neck unless I am actually shooting at that moment . And just in case I have really good property insurance . <h> About Liz Carlson <p> Liz Carlson 's blog Young Adventuress is about experiential travel and storytelling . She love 's to share narratives , funny anecdotes and things she 's learned while living abroad and traveling the world . For her , travel is dynamic , it 's always changing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to share her thoughts and life lessons she 's taken away in the hope that it might inspire other people to try something different and get out of their comfort zones too . You can follow her adventures on Instagram , Facebook and Twitter . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> The part of the Selfie stick cracked me up . I do n't  have one but I do n't  dare laughing who uses them . I know the pain of not having someone to take your picture ! I 'm working on my shyness and I have at least one picture of me in the city where I have been ! Baby steps ! <p> Except for the selfie-stick part I can relate to everything that Liz has mentioned here . I also travel solo most of the time and I do the same things when it comes to clicking my own pictures . Sometimes its hard to tell a stranger how to compose a shot , though ! <p> I recently got a selfie stick for my GoPro and its awesome . I do n't  mind asking someone to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess up the shot . Its definitely embarrassing to use it in public but I just tell myself I do n't  know these people and will likely never see them again = <p> Pretty great tips that I always forget to do . Well , my main one is bring a trippod , which holds me back from creating awesome timelapses or recording myself while traveling . I need to invest before my trip to India in a lightweight one . And a new selfie-stick because I use them for really unique shots . Thanks Liz ! <p> It can be hard for someone like myself who- although not as shy as I once was- still get the crazy shyness attacks sometimes . I am really wanting to get myself a selfie-stick for this reason , and also because I will more than likely be travelling solo from now on ( recently separated ) . <p> Your message is not optimized for mobile phones . Big gray blocks cover the text , as do some of your headers making it impossible to readthought you would want to know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelersit was just to difficult , I gave up . <p> What device are you using ? Our site is mobile responsive so should n't be doing this . I 'd like to follow this up with our designer so if you can let me know what device you are using that would be helpful <p> Thanks for taking time to share your tips for getting photos of yourself in your travels when you 're solo . <p> Ive been traveling solo since 1998 . Like you , I simply ask people around me if theyll take my photo . Almost everyone is happy to help out . But , I do find that a lot of people do not know how to compose a photo well . lol . So sometimes I end up with pretty crappy pics of myself in famous places . Not good if you want to use them in a pro . blog. : ) 0 <p> So I 'd add to your tip that , whenever possible , try to find someone who looks like they know how to take pictures . Perhaps they have a flash camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other indications that they have some basic expertise . People who are flashing away quickly with phone cameras might not take the best pics. : 0 <p> Another thing I 've found works really well is to use the 10-second timer on my camera . It takes some careful placement of the camera in most cases . I might have to place it on a pole , a rock , a pile of clothes , and then twist &amp; wiggle the camera into the best position . But its a lot of fun as its a mini project to do while on my own . <p> I understand the purpose of the selfie stick and I do n't  hate it , I just personally do n't  like the end result when it appears on the photos . I 'd rather ask someone to take a picture or put the camera somewhere and use the timer = <p> Great post Liz ! Offering to take other peoples photo first is something I had n't  thought about . I 'm also quite shy and would probably resort to a tripod most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tips you have shared for solo travelers are indeed very effective and practical in nature . Yes hesitation is one of the main problem for solo travelers . Group travelling is a very good option if you are planning for fitness holidays . <p> Hi Liz , Thanks so much posting this ! I am about to begin a solo traveling experience myself ( I 'm going to New Zealand for a year ) . I know you said you 're not a professional photographer , but I was wondering if you had any recommendations on specific cameras or brands that you like ? I 'm doing research trying to find the best option for me and would appreciate any suggestions you might have . <p> You would be surprised how shy people are to ask others to take a photo of them . I know that I am . <p> Funny enough , I think I have automatically used the tactic you mentioned on this post . I look around for anyone struggling to take a photo and then offer to take it for them .. it does open up the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know specifically looks for anyone who looks Japanese ( because the Japanese are all great at taking photos , right ? = ) .. bear in mind , this does not always result in amazing photos , although in general the come out great ! <p> Before you travel , our everyone wanner record what we experience . Therefore the camera seems to be more important . Gopro is a nice choice . And more accessories make the pictures amazing ! I like Gopro Camera . And I has been using smatree accessories for a long time . You can have a try . http : //www.smatree.com <p> I love Liz by the way . great blog . My question is about focusing the camera on you when you are standing in the middle of no where . What settings , or how do you get the camera to focus on you and not something else ? 
@@21820903 @1820903/ <h> Things to Do in Christchurch , New Zealand <p> As part of our city guides series , we interviewed Bethaney Davies- who has- lived in Christchurch on and off for the past 18 years . <p> Bethaney shares with us her insider tips on things to do in Christchurch- for those looking for the best places to see , eat , stay , drink , and explore . <h> Why Visit Christchurch ? <p> Christchurch is never going to make anyones bucket list but travellers should definitely visit . It is the gateway to New Zealands South Island which has the most spectacular scenery in the country . <h> Best Things to Do in Christchurch <p> Punting on the Avon River . Christchurch was modelled after the garden cities of England , like Oxford and Cambridge . <p> Despite losing almost every heritage building in the recent earthquakes , punting along the Avon still gives you a feel for this quaint English vibe . <p> Stretch your legs and get some fresh air after a long flight with a walk around Hagley Park and the Botanic Gardens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with Hagley Park being its centre . <p> Even in Winter , there 's plenty of greenery . A jogging and bike path runs around the length of the park . <p> If you 're travelling with kids , head to Willowbank Wildlife Reserve . You can view birds native to New Zealand , including the Kiwi . You can even enjoy a Maori cultural performance and hangi ( a traditional dinner cooked underground ) . <h> Where to Eat in Christchurch <p> Christchurch is a great destination for food and coffee . Here are some of my top picks : <p> If you 're looking for an upmarket restaurant to celebrate a special occasion , you cant go past Pescatore at The George Hotel . <p> Serving up innovative and experimental dishes , its not cheap but all the little extras in between courses certainly make it more of an experience than a meal . You wo n't get out of here without spending at least NZ$100 per person . <h> Where to Drink in Christchurch <p> If you 're after a swish cocktail and delicious yakitori and tapas , head to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city bar as you 'll get these days . <p> They 're also open for coffee and lunch during the day . Prices are pretty reasonable . You 'll spend about $12 on a cocktail and $6-12 for a tapas plate . <h> Where to Stay in Christchurch <p> Many of the citys high-rise hotels bit the dust as a consequence of the February earthquake . There 's a real shortage of accommodation in the city . <p> For more places to stay in Christchurch choose from the largest range of hotels , apartments , and guesthouses with our partner Booking.com . You get free cancelation on most rooms , and in most cases you only pay when you stay . <h> Best Time to Visit Christchurch <p> Christchurch is spectacular in Winter . <p> It does n't  snow ( often ) instead we get fabulously crisp , clear Winters days . Nights may dip below zero but daytime temperatures are around 10 degrees Celsius. - Winter provides the most spectacular sunsets over the city and mountains . Get up into the hills for the best view ! <p> Spring is lovely Christchurch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are daffodils blooming everywhere . <p> Summer temperatures get warm but not overly hot and are often accompanied by blustery NorWester winds . <p> Autumn can be a bit damp but its certainly no reason to avoid the city . In short , you can visit Christchurch anytime of the year . <h> Favorite side trip from Christchurch <p> Locals love to spend a day or weekend out of the city to rest and recharge . <p> Akaroa is a wonderful little settlement on the Banks Peninsula offering up beautiful harbour views , wineries and restaurants . <p> Alternatively , head to Hanmer Springs for hiking and a soak in thermal mineral baths . <h> Getting There and Away <p> Christchurch is the best hub for travel in the South Island of New Zealand . Many travellers choose to start their South Island roadtrip by picking up a car or motorhome in Christchurch . Look into Apex and Jucy rentals for the best deals . <p> You 'll find direct international flights into Christchurch from Melbourne , Sydney , Brisbane and the Gold Coast in Australia , Nadi in Fiji and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll need to transfer through Auckland luckily that 's pretty easy . <h> Plan Your Trip to Christchurch 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation in Christchurch <p> Booking.com has 206 properties in Christchurch including hotels , apartments and hostels .

You can also find her on Twitter and Facebook. 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Thanks , Bethaney , for your tips on Christchurch , and for C&amp;C for hosting her post ! I 'd like to add a few pointers from my visit there 7 weeks ago . <p> * Dimitris Souvlaki in the Re:START mall has some of the longest queues at lunch or on the weekend , particularly if its sunny out . This in fact is a good thing , and you 'll understand why once you dig into one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there twice in four days <p> * One might check the motels on Colombo Street north of the CBD , between Peterborough and Beasley , but there are a number of motels along that stretch of Beasley , too . From here , the walk into the CBD is between 15 and 30 minutes . <p> Our National OFfice is located in Christchurch and we 've been rocking and rolling along with the rest of the city for two years now ( we just passed our two year anniversary from the first earthquake that took us all by surprise . ) <p> We def have some fave things to do in Christchurch . We love Addington Coffee Co-op on Lincoln road for your histper cup of coffee and we love the beaches ! Christchurch is lucky that we have great beaches for sun , surf and fun . There are so many restaurants , libraries , markets to attend . Christchurch should be on everyones New Zealand bucket list ! <p> Weve been celebrating all things post-earthquake Christchurch for a while now . <p> There are many great restaurants in Christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pescatore . I think you just chose the most expensivelol . Other fine dining options would be St Germain , Rotherams or Saggio Di Vino . For more reasonable prices and amazing food try Cookai Japanese Restaurant in Riccarton or Kinji on Greers Road . Also surprised at Monday Room recommendation as experiencing Christchurch is about sitting outside in the sun enjoying a cool beer and listening to music with mates , not looking at a concrete wall after paying overly expensive prices for spirits . Try Dux Dine in Riccarton . <p> Christchurch is the main pick-up point for those embarking on a South Island Campervan adventure . It is the Islands biggest city and centrally located . In just a short drive from the city , you will find some of the scenery that this bottom half of New Zealand is famous for . The Port Hills are spectacular , and lie between the city and its port of Lyttleton . <p> Nice post I want to go very soon . Really , I am so interested . I heard ; the largest wildlife reserve in New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences , permitting visitors to see them up close and feed the gentler species . Wow I want to go <p> Yes , the reserve is called the Willowbank Wildlife reserve and it has my favorite bird , The Kiwi . I am a bird watcher/lover and the Kiwi fascinates me . It is a flightless bird that gets along fine in the jungles of New Zealand and Australia . There are other birds there like the Kea and Takahe , and many parrots , but the Kiwi is my favorite . <p> Thanks for the update . I think I might have seen one in an Australian zoo , and that 's why I thought they were native to Australia . Then of course , I live in South Florida and there are Kangaroos in zoos down here , but of course are not native to the region . Hopefully I will be able to travel to New Zealand one day to see all the native wildlife there . Thanks again . 
@@21820905 @1820905/ <h> My Experiences Teaching Overseas <p> " If you could do it all over again Caz , would you still become a primary school teacher ? " <p> I was out to lunch with some of my oldest friends and we had just been sharing horror stories of teaching in Australia mine , those of some other teachers there , and those that had been heard through the hallways at the local schools . <p> I had to pause for a moment to think about my answer ; an answer that would either show a life filled with regret or one with gratitude for the experiences I had been served . <p> There are plenty of things I wish I did choose instead . Things that I were more passionate about and perhaps more highly skilled in . <p> I enrolled into teaching because I did n't  know what else to do , nor did I know what I was good at . I had no sense of myself and what I was hoping to achieve with my life . I just chose something for the sake of choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes when your path is not clear to you , it is clear to some other unseen force who guides you until you get it . <p> " You know , if- it was n't for teaching , I probably would n't have travelled as much as I did . It was the teaching that got me around the world and allowed me to live in certain countries and travel . So , for that reason alone , I would probably choose it again . <p> I am so grateful for it being the portal to so much joy and wealth of living . " <p> As I work now to extract myself from a career I was never passionate about , I write this post in celebration for what it did give to my life . <p> I hope those who are thinking of teaching overseas embrace it for the amazing experience it will give , in becoming , not just a better teacher , but a better person . Most of all embrace it for the travel it can gift you . <p> Everywhere in the world needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being thrown in the deep end . <p> I had my interview with a teaching agency in the UK before I finished Uni . I was accepted and so when I arrived in London in 1997 on my UK working holiday visa , I was ready to start my teaching career in Hackney , East London , an area I was soon to discover to be one of Londons most challenging . <p> I was n't quite ready to settle into a full time job as I had travel on my horizon , so I went straight for the supply ( casual , substitute ) - teaching . This meant I was running all over the East End going to different schools every day . It was a great way for me to get to know the city , and lose a whole lot of weight . <p> It was also a fantastic way for me to learn how to be an adaptable teacher different students , different classes every day . <p> My Bangladeshi students <p> There is nothing like stopping students from throwing chairs at each other ; teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a 7 year old boy you just meet scream at you " You fucking bitch " before compassion hits you as you realize he was the boy whose mother you saw getting arrested in the school foyer that morning for dealing drugs ; and learning how to manage a Somalian refugee with severe autism . <p> Yep . That is real learning right there . <p> In the midst of this I did have a couple of permanent days at some schools throughout my one and half years of supply teaching . <p> For the last six months I decided to find a more permanent position , - and had a year 5 class at a pretty good school . A highlight of that was the Class Space play we created and performed for the whole school . A little nerve wracking , but lots of fun . <p> Pay : About 100 pounds a day . <h> Sydney ( 2000-02 ) <p> After my very educational London teaching experience , I returned home and managed to secure a position teaching year 4 at a very nice school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The principal hired me because she had spent a couple of years in her youth traveling and knew just how much it made you grow as a person and what it could teach you about life . <p> She took a chance on me where other principals werent so willing . In their eyes my jet-set lifestyle was n't as professionally appealing . <p> Wahroonga is a very wealthy suburb and I found myself teaching the children of some pretty influential people , like the head of Australia Sony Music and AMP , our biggest insurance provider . <p> I also had a student in my class who performed in Les Miserables for the Aussie Broadway version , and a member of the Qantas choir . <p> After the challenges of London , this was a total dream teaching experience for me . <h> Bangkok ( 02 ) <p> Foreign teacher with blond hair and blue eyes walks up on stage , grabs the microphone to address 500 high school boys in a language barely any of them could understand . <p> Yet they nodded to me like they understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months I taught every class from year 7 to year 12 , each having numbers that ranged from 15 42 students . <p> I had some boys who could barely say hello and some that I could hold conversations with , making it almost impossible to teach . <p> I had to learn how to aim for the middle and do my best to differentiate with the non-existent resources I had . I became very good at getting my message across using non-verbal forms of communications . The boys loved my ridiculous mimes , charades and games . <p> As my school was attached to one of the oldest and most respected temples in Thailand , Wat Saket , I was able to attend many important ceremonies during my time there . <p> Wat Saket ceremony <p> I also helped to organize a two-day English camp at a beach not far from Bangkok . Many of these students had never seen the ocean before and it was one of my teaching highlights to be able to gift them that opportunity and have a really fun time together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught them . <p> I also taught at a private language school for six hours on a Saturday . For this one day , I received half my monthly wage at my high school . The school was connected to Chulalongkorn University and had amazing resources and small ability based classes . <p> Pay : Wat Saket- $500USD per month . <p> Lodging in an old converted office on the third floor was also given as a benefit . <p> Go- Inter Language School $250 for 6 hours teaching <h> Dublin ( 03 ) <p> I spoke of my experience teaching in Dublin on our working holiday stories podcast . <p> It was one of my favourite teaching experiences to date . <p> I was not allowed to teach a class of my own as all teachers have to be able to speak Gaelic in order to teach . I started off supply teaching as this was allowed . I found a job advertised in the paper for a Language Resource Teacher , and applied . <p> The Principal of the school , John , phoned and suggested I meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pub . I responded with delight and over red wine , we discussed all things Aussie Rules and Gaelic football , to which he was a major fan . School was not talked about only to say <p> " Youre hired ! " <p> My farewell with my work mates <p> For six months , my job alternated between teaching small groups of newly arrived immigrants English , and the " Pikies " who are the Irish minority people . <p> If you have seen the movie Snatch then you know what I am talking about . It was a real eye opening cultural experience for me . The job was brilliant and I just loved the people I worked with . It was too easy , the only way the Irish know how to do things . <p> While in Dublin , I did a 100 hour TEFL course which gave me the opportunity to teach English to Italian high school students during the summer at a language school . <p> Apart from the teaching , I also took them on tours around Dublin to famous landmarks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140 euros a day . <h> USA ( 04-06 , 08-10 ) <p> Teaching in the US was a fantastic cultural experience for me as well as really helping me to grow in strength as a teacher . Not only that but it gave Craig and I a way to live in the States like we had always wanted . We loved it . <p> My class in North Carolina , USA <p> I taught grade 5 for my four years there at two different schools . And my last year , I had half the day re-mediating small groups of students , which I loved , and the other half teaching Year 5 Science and Social Studies . <p> VIF was the cultural exchange teaching program who hired and placed me . <p> It was founded by two brothers from Chapel Hill who had spent years studying overseas and traveling . They understood the need and benefits to American children being exposed to those from other countries , and so built a large organization who recruits teachers from around the world . <p> I have gone through their program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to meet fellow international teachers , and a support system to assimilate into teaching in the US , which was incredibly different to what I had previously been used to . <p> I miss my US school family and the feeling that I was doing something important . Not only helping students to have an education , but bringing the world to many who would never get a chance to travel <p> Ever year I did an Australian exhibition where the students would display information they learned about a certain aspect of Australia and its culture , as well as having food to try , games to play and other interactive exhibits . It was fun and the students gained so much from it . <p> My final year I ran a five minute morning broadcast show on Australia , which was a ton of fun . I loved being wacky singing Australian songs , making animal noises and other crazy things . <p> Do n't  forget to research what sort of tax you will be liable to pay and if you are entitled to receive any back. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could be due- tax- back- if you worked abroad or were taxed incorrectly or perhaps did n't work for the full year. - TaxBack.com- can check out your details and tell you for free what you 're owed .

Such a great opportunity to work abroadall of your experiences were such great chances to really work and live abroadbut not quite my path = <p> Teaching is not a great path really . It has been great for the travel experiences but other than that it gives me little joy and mostly stress . Definitely not a path to walk if you are not interested . There are plenty of other ways to travel the world <p> I can completely , 100% relate . The single greatest decision I ever made was to quit my dull job in retail back in 2007 and take the scariest plunge of my life and go to South Korea . <p> 2.5 years , a string of relationships , one amazing relationship , and a lot of travel later I 'm a vastly different person than the shy country boy I was in 2007 . <p> I 've fallen in love with new cultures , new experiences , and sharing them as a result of that one snap decision . While I do n't  think teaching is a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current happiness to my teaching . <p> It has been interesting ! ! Its a shame that when I returned to my home country , they did n't  see any value in this and reduced my teaching experience level down and the Catholic system now wont allow me to teach . They changed the rules for required years of study while I was gone and apparently that extra year of study would have taught me way more than all this teaching experience around the world ! ! Ahh Beaurocracy at its finest/ <p> I always wanted to travel O/S as a teacher but instead have settled with working in different states across different sectors , Child Care , Preschool , Primary , Special Education and University and can very much relate to your fantastic article teaching can totally do your head in but at the same time it can totally open your world to things you might otherwise not have imagined or dreamt you could experience . I also understand your statement about rule changes and beaucracy have taught interstate for the last few years and have just recently returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in rules that happened just in the 3 years away very frustrating ! Love your blog it is what I have been looking for in the way of blogs looking forward to reading about your journey ahead and what you decide to do next . <p> I could see myself teaching for a little while while traveling , but it has never been a passion of mine . That 's great that it has given you so many opportunities to travel while still making an income , but I can see why it would also get old after a while . = <p> What a wealth of amazing experiences . I have an old teaching degree but left it behind years ago then again , if they are still paying those kinds of bonuses in North Carolina , perhaps I should go down there for a few years and save up some travel money ! <p> I 'm working on my masters in TESOL right now , other than doing my student teaching in Rio de Janeiro Ive never really taught . Although I know its what I was meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel like you . Was it hard getting visas to work in all those countries or did the teaching companies provide them ? Ive added VIF to my list of resources and would love any others that you would be willing to share @ ( ) @ <p> The teaching companies provided the visas for Bangkok and the US which made it easy . I organized it for UK and Dublin which was easy as it was a working holiday visa . VIF is the only company I went through that is still in operation . The others are n't  . But if you check out this page https : **39;1648;TOOLONG we have some resources listed under there . <p> great post Caz , and nice that your very honest in admitting why you chose to go down the teaching road . I 've just done the same thing . I am signed up to start teaching in China in the next couple of months . I am admittedly nervous , mostly because I have never been a teacher before ! But also because as you mentioned . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to the challenge , and the thought of being able to use it as a great way to continue my adventures further down the road ! = <p> Its such a great way Sam . And you will do fine . It takes some getting used to but just be relaxed and friendly to your students at the same time as setting those boundaries . Enjoy it as much as you can <p> I 've taught in South Korea and Taiwan and absolutely loved it best experiences of my life . I met so many people , learned about myself ( my limits and my strengths ) , and opened myself up to new cultures and experiences . I enjoyed hearing about the different countries you taught gave me some ideas for my next adventure . = Thanks . <p> Pleasure Julie ! I 'm glad its given you fuel to keep on going . I think the best part to teaching overseas is learning just how strong you really are . It is pretty challenging and you learn so much . Makes you pretty confident to try scary things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving to Raleigh from Melbourne for my husbands work . We are in the process of locating a school for our daughters Grades 1 &amp; 4 . We are grappling with public vs private . What are your thoughts ? <p> Oh Emma ! ! I am beyond excited for you , yet completely jealous . I have been missing Raleigh so much lately . <p> North Carolina is known to be one of the best states for education . There are more residents with PHDs then any other state . ( That 's what I 've been told anyway ) I think , depending on where you live , you will find a public school that is really great . I honestly do n't  think you 'd need to go to the extra expense of a private school . But , I have n't had much experience with the private schools so I cant comment too much on why one would be better than the other . <p> I am sure they still have to abide by the ridiculous No Child Left Behind rules , which puts a lot of focus on testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools who do n't  let this impact real and proper education . <p> Do you know where in Raleigh you will be living ? I might be able to suggest some schools in the area or give you some insight . Magnet schools are known to be really great schools , so if you have one in your area it would be great to try and get into that . With public schooling in the States you have to go to the school you are zoned for . Many Americans base where they live on this . Its a big deal . <p> Thank you so much for your response Caz ! You are very generous . We are planning to live in North Raleigh or Carey and are now thinking we would really prefer to go with public schooling . Any advice you have on schools in these areas would be amazing . Thank you again , Emma . <p> The schools in Carey will be great . It is a bit more of an affluent area . Great facilities in Cary , it is a good area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area you move to . There 's a few pockets that are n't  ideal but on the whole it is a good spot . Lots of new housing estates . I do n't  know any specific schools in any of these places though . <p> Hi Caz , thank you very much for sharing such a nice and inspiring experience ! Congratulations for your amazing blog . I 'm a 28 years old Italian bboy ( breakdancer ) and teacher . I do n't  have a degree in teaching , but I 've worked in Italy as a tutor in projects funded by the government . I was also a freelance journalist for a local newspaper and a breakdance teacher . I always loved what I 've done but it was never enough to be indipendent ( in Italy things are gone sour ) . Feeling so frustrated , in 2011 I just decide to move to London , where I stayed for two years , working as a Barista . It was enough to understand that I love travelling , so I bought a online TEFL course and I 'm still working on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I would like to use my other talent , even if sometimes I think its too late because of my age . <p> Do you think a 120h online TEFL is enough to find a job ? If not , shall I go back to London and study something else ? Do you have any advice about the chance of using my dance skills in order to travel abroad ? <p> Hi Caz , I 've signed for vif and I already had the phone interview , I will have the personal interview . What cocerns me is the fact that they never say nothing about the salary . I just want to know if its gon na be worth enough to save some and bring back to my country . Could you give me a salary range please ? <p> It really depends on where you are placed and your degree . And it has probably changed since I was there last . I do n't  want to say a number that might concern you as you could get something very different . I was on about $38,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . I taught in a region that had lower salaries though so yours could be much better . <p> Reading your blog through the interest of wishing to teach in the US myself . I contacted VIF recently , however they are no longer recruiting from Australia . Do you know of any other similar programs , as google searches are n't  giving me the answers that I need . Thanks for your time . <p> Really enjoyed this and can totally relate to the challenges of teaching in the UK ! I 've just finished my teaching training year in Sheffield where both my placement schools were equally stressful and challenging . At the same time , this year has definitely made me realise that I want to fulfil my travel dreams before getting a full-time teaching job which all my peers will be doing from September except me . Instead , I 'm hoping to start a travel blog and head off traveling from end of October . Fingers crossed , plenty of time for teaching ! <p> Reading this gave me more inspiration to teach English overseas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year I have been debating on double majoring in English ( especially after seeing an ad for Oxford Seminars ) . I would love to be able to help people in that way . I am an English tutor at the college I go to and I love it . I like helping fellow students form better essays and I never realized how patient I was until working there in January . I like English and would like the opportunity to travel , learn about other cultures and grow as a person . What else can I do to get started ? Any other tips ? Are you going to continue to teach abroad in the years to come ? 
@@21820907 @1820907/ <h> Using Pre-paid Travel Money Cards <p> My brother first told me about prepaid travel money cards a couple of years ago . <p> He and his wife used a cash passport for their year long trip through South America and raved about how easy and convenient it was . <p> We all want ease and convenience when travelling , especially when it comes to money . <p> We also want to reduce our bank and transaction fees as much as possible . <p> Travellers cheques are too restrictive , and then there are fees and inconsistent low exchange rates to consider . <p> International transaction fees can be hefty when using credit cards . I know because in our business our expenses often alternate between US and Australian dollars . The conversion fees quickly add up . <p> If you are travelling and using your credit card for purchases , you 'll be shocked to discover how much you handed back to the bank . You 'll also be enraged at the amount you will pay in ATM withdrawal fees . It can be as much as $15 per withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you are letting go an extra night or two in your favourite destination . <h> Choosing the Right Prepaid Travel Money Card <p> For our recent trip to Thailand we decided to use a prepaid travel money card for the first time . We did our research online to find the best prepaid travel money card in Australia . <p> You have to be really careful of hidden fees and high charges . We spoke to the Commonwealth Bank about their prepaid travel money card and were happy with what they offered . <h> But , I did not want to take the banks word for it , I need to research myself . <p> Based on what I discovered the Commonwealth Bankand ANZ prepaid travel money cards were the best options for travellers and both fairly comparable . <p> We recently discovered the Travel Money Oz cash passport at Sydneys Travel Expo which has no ATM fees , but , after talking with a rep I discovered the currency conversion fee is 6% . ( This is not listed in any promotional materials or website ) . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do thorough research . <p> We chose the Commonwealth Bank card because they had no currency conversion fees , whereas ANZ did on Australia currency only . They are also our primary bank so we found it easier to stay with them . <h> Advantages of Prepaid Travel Money Cards <p> Use them wherever you see a Visa/Mastercard sign . <p> Load different currencies on them before you leave home . <p> Its prepaid , so if you budget right you know what you are spending . <p> A safe way to carry money protected by pin and signature and can easily be cancelled . <p> Can access you money via multiple currencies ( great for round the world trips ) . <p> You can cross convert between currencies . <p> The ability to lock in an exchange rate . I had a friend who did this when the USD exchange rate was really good ! An excellent strategy for securing more money for nothing . <p> Convenience . <p> Monitor your balance and transactions online . <h> What to Look for in Prepaid Travel Money Cards <p> Sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reload fee : Usually a commission or flat fee . <p> Currency conversion fees . Be careful as some may only charge this if you convert your AUD currency stored on the card . If it is another currency they wo n't . <p> ATM withdrawal fees . <p> Card cancellation fees . <p> Monthly fees to keep the card open <p> How many days required before reloading money is cleared . ( we got caught out with this in Thailand . Needed extra money urgently , BUT , had a three day transfer process , ouch ) . <p> What currencies can be loaded onto the card <p> Can you lock in the exchange rate ? <p> How many cards you can get . ( Great to have an extra card for back up ) <p> Tip : It might be a great idea to talk with your own bank first as you may get some extra perks for being a regular customer . Due to our relationship with Commonwealth Bank , they waived the $15 purchasing fee for the prepaid travel money card . YES ! ! That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBA Prepaid Money Card <p> Worked out our budget for our trip to Thailand and put that amount on the card . <p> Decided how much cash we felt comfortable carrying around with us and left the rest in our room safe . We made that lump sum withdrawal twice in two weeks . It is so important to do this . You do n't  want to withdraw daily as those fees will add up , even though they are only $3.50 at a time . The less you give to the bank , the more you have . <p> Being in Thailand we did not have much opportunity to use the credit card side to it . This might be a consideration for you as to whether it is worth getting the prepaid travel card or not . We went ahead because we wanted to save on the ATM withdrawal fee . It all adds up ! Plus as we were using the same bank the conversion rate would be the same . <p> We got caught out when we had to pay a deposit for our accommodation booked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepaid travel money card , so we had to use our credit card and suffer the transaction fee . <h> Tips <p> Put more cash on the card than you think you 'll need on your trip , just to be sure you wont need to wait the three day period to top it up . When you return to Australia , use any remaining balance the same way as you did on the road . Use it as a credit card or as cash at EFTPOS machines . Avoid taking money out at the ATM so you do n't  pay any fees . <p> Be aware of fees you ATM withdrawal fees you will be charged by the bank of the countrys ATM you are withdrawing the money from #doublewhammy <p> Always have a back up source to access money in case things go wrong . <p> Place a budget buffer on the card i.e. for when you go over budget , because you will . <h> - What I Did n't  Like about the Prepaid Money Card <p> Two major fails I found with the Commonwealth Bank prepaid travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netbank ) you needed to have a code sent via SMS . I never put data roaming on my phone overseas as the charges are ridiculous . The other option was to reload via phone bank . Again , unless you have Skype set up , expensive overseas calls will add up , as will the inconvenience of finding a phone and being put on hold ! ! <p> To reload your card via Bpay takes 3 working days . In the world of instant banking I find this insanely STUPID . I certainly was not happy when we unexpectedly had to add more money ( which can happen when travelling ) . We were left stranded on a weekend with no money in Thailand . NOT HAPPY . ( Apparently this is a BPay thing rather than a Commonwealth Bank thing ) . <p> Because loading Thai baht onto the card before we left Australia was not an option , the exchange rate given to us by the Thai bank when withdrawing was not as good . As Thailand is such a popular destination for Australians , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ANZ prepaid travel money card does have Thai Baht as a currency loading option . <h> Final Thoughts <p> For a trip that involves multiple destinations , I think prepaid travel money cards are a great option . <p> For shorter trips , in countries such as Thailand , where the credit card facility options are less , you might want to consider other ways to access money overseas . It still might end up being a better way to save on bank fees , but you will need to research carefully . <p> Lastly , by using your travel money card and not your credit card for purchases you are missing out on amassing frequent flyer points if you have a CC attached to a points program . Something to think about . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Hi Caz ! Have you heard about the Schwab Checking Account ? Its an online banking system that has unlimited reimbursement of any ATM usage . No minimums , no fees . I 'm trying to do some more research on it , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think ? <p> Just to throw a couple of other names into the mix ( albeit frm a UK/GBP point of view ) I used the FairFX Anywhere Card when travelling- reloads took less than a couple of hours via online banking and u can use as a debit card also in the currency of whatever country you 're in . Another card i used ( for Euros ) was from CaxtonFX who also have dollar and anywhere cards . Worth adding these to the list when doing your research ! Customer service was great from both these guys too and withdrawal fees one of the lowest per withdrawal . Was back in 2010/11 however so might want to check their fees have n't gone up ! ! = <p> I currently use the CaxtonFX Global Traveller anywhere card . They do n't  charge to withdraw money or to use the card in a transaction , any charges that do occur come from the owners of the machine you 're using . <p> The only thing I 'm not too keen on is the exchange rate which is set to 2.75% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topping the card up online but the money usually transfers within a couple of hours . <p> I signed up on the website and had it delivered to my address here in the UK . I top the card up in pounds sterling ( there are n't  any other currency options ) and the current exchange rate is worked out every time I use the card . This does mean that if the value of the pound drops while I 'm on the road I lose out . I just find it handy when budgeting so I only transfer what I need for that/those week(s) <p> I should point out that you ARE charged for both transactions and withdrawals if you use the card in your home country ( In my case the UK ) . <p> Great ! Thanks so much Lee . Really helpful info for others reading this post . <p> Troy Vella <p> 4 years ago <p> Hey Caz , We are currently using Citibank Visa debit card . It is an Australian based account that has no ATM fees and no currency conversion fees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner you are withdrawing from which is nearly impossible to escape . We found while travelling South East Asia , in most capital cities there is a Citibank ATM , so we can withdraw money in the local currency without paying any fees at all . As the card is a Visa debit card we have not had any problems withdrawing cash from any cities we have visited . The number one reason we went for this card/account was that we were using our own money and could limit the amount we have in the account at any one time . Maybe you might want to look into it for your next trip . <p> You can cancel a prepaid card straight away as well . They are also protected with a pin so it can not be used at an ATM . I understand your concerns and I think these are great steps to put in place to protect yourself . <p> What happens if a magnetic reader placed on an ATM ( reading the PIN ) has been used to drain the entire value of your prepaid card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice on the web . ) What protection have you then ? <p> Again , with a credit card your loss may be limited to USD $50.00 or whatever . <p> I do not know how to answer that question ! ! ! I would ask the provider of which ever one you choose to go with , maybe they have some sort of protection in place . I do n't  know but definitely something to think about . Thanks for bringing it to my attention . <p> Thanks , Caz ! There is an alternative for residents of Canada and the U.S. and perhaps elsewhere , which does not require either good credit or a credit history . <p> We can obtain a " guaranteed " credit card that has a credit limit equal to the amount in a linked savings account . For example , a person with CAD $800 in the account would have an $800 credit limit on the card . <p> This card enjoys the same limited liability for fraudulent use as a regular card . At least one bank Capital One offers this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a travel card or similar to be used throughout South America ? The banks only seem to do cards for the main currencies . Given each country in South America has their own currency and we will be travelling to most , I am wondering what our best options are for getting money out . Cheers <p> Hi Caz I 'm about to look at getting a card for myself ! I 'm pointing toward the commonwealth banks travel card as I really like what you have listed ! and i 'm currently a member there anyway although I 'm doing the full trip of asia and do n't  understand what the best currency to upload is should I just stick with AUS dollars on it ? ? or should I upload some of the places ill be in currencies and how does it work ? thanks = <p> We are using the Commbank Travel card through America and also in a fashion in Chile ( although cant seem to withdraw Chilean Pesos at the moment , might try another bank ) . <p> We reload via BPay and it only takes about an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick to transfer from a commbank account . I have a commbank account that I use for savings and I transferred straight from this account to the travel and card and hey presto US cash available in about an hour . <p> Great site . Thanks for the insight , very helpful . I am looking into getting a prepaid card just for cash withdrawals . I have a great credit card for overseas transactions but it carries hefty fees and interest rates for cash withdrawals . as does my debit card . <p> I have found a few that claim to be free to withdraw cash but as I 'm travelling to SE Asia will I be allowed to withdraw dollars or will it only allow me to withdraw local currencies . In which case will I be charged ? <p> Do not know where this comment fits but my experience with a cash card was not very good.I loaded 500,000 Yen onto a NAB Card to use in Japan only . Withdrew 150,000 Yen in cash and paid various bills at restaurants and store purchases . On last day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this against hotel bill . Rejected . Contacted Cardservices told to pay 258,000 Yen . This worked and told balance 1018 Yen . Seems money is disappearing as on my calculatrion there should have been 10,000 Yen remaining .. Rang on my return to Australia next day . Over the next 4 days 21,468 Yen appeared on my card . Apparently all my purchases had somehow been converted into US dollars then back to YEN . Now I have 21,468 Yen I do not want . Where did the didcrepancies come from ? And I can tell you it has nothing to do with the Merchant . Note that various banks offer cash cards as to onther financial institutions but in the end they are all managed by MasterCard . So my problem must be applicable to all cards . It would seem if you use the card for purchases it is impossible to use all your money . I feel I got my money back because I complained . Cardservices claim it would correct itself but may take up to 7 days . Thus to use all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases less than 7 days before leaving that country . Seems like the banks and MasterCard are making a little sugar by making us take money home we then have to convert back to our default or home currency . So if any of you out there think you have had the same problem please comment .. <p> I thought that the Commonwealth travel card was a good deal until I looked closer . If you are trying to use another currency ( e.g. I have AUD on my card but need to with draw ZAR ) the commonwealth bank does not charge a conversion fee HOWEVER THE BANK IN SOUTH AFRICA is free to charge you whatever their rate is , which is highly variable between banks . None of their paperwork states this and it is incredibly misleading . <p> Yes , you have to do your research . IT does n't  matter what card you use in another country they are free to charge you what they like to use their ATM to withdraw money . Unfortunately you cant avoid this . <p> If you book your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number to book the room and you can pay cash when you arrive , you can also cancel up to the day before the booking starts . I have used them for 10-12 years and never had problems . <p> You can top it up just by normal online banking transfer now like you would your day to day accounts . Only with commonwealth though I believe . And its only a recent thing . Question , will the card automatically withdraw from the local currency if you have multiple currencies on there ? <p> The master card cash passport is a disaster if you lose it . I asked for a replacement and got an auto response saying the card would be sent in 24 to 48 hours . 14 days later i got an email saying there was a problem with replacement cards , it had not been sent , and they did not know when it would be . I phoned them and had a one and a half hour conversation and still do not know when the card will be sent . Grossly incompetent , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor customer

Im impressed though how did you possibly find time to read all of these ? <p> I must echo your praise for the 4-Hour Work Week though ! I 'm not sure I 'd ever actually want to only work 4 hours a week , but that book turned my ideas about making a living upside down , and for that reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the 4 hour a week a reality . four hour a day I can though ! I 'm really loving it . <p> The biggest thing that has helped me get through these books is to read for 15- 20 mins every night before bed . It makes a huge difference . In my down moments- waiting on queues , driving ( as a passenger ) etc , I read the books on my phone rather than wasting time on social media . <p> For the courses I usually dedicate 1-2 hours a week to get them done . I think if you commit and schedule tmie you can make it work . Youd be surprised <p> Had my eye on the School for the Modern Mystic for sometime now . Totally signing up in September but would love to get your review and more thoughts about it . Also , I think I am going to get Jab , Jab , Jab , Right Hook . Finally , after seeing everyone say I should read it . <p> Great list ! Ive been wanting to read Thrive by Huffington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your books and they have all truly helped me in all aspects of life . I love Marie Forleo and B-school is the best online course for business . TBS is a great resourse as well ! I 've also been wanting to read the 4 hour work week . This list has so many books I want to read , just have to make time for them-thank you Caz ! <p> Great list , I 've got some reading to do ! I always recommend Ask and it is Given too , and I try to live by the 4 Hour Work Week . Ca n't wait to try School of the Modern Mystic , and read all the others you 've listed here .

@@21820910 @1820910/ <h> How to Deal with a Lack of Inspiration , Motivation and Writers Block <p> I have always been an advocate for the " Go hard , or go home " way of living . This has been my philosophy whether I am partying , traveling , working my passions , or exercising ( actually for this one , not as hard as usual now that I am a full time working mother with a travel blog on the side ) . <p> I do n't  like being a parked car , instead opting for a fifth gear kind of life . This philosophy works , except sometimes I 'm driving too many roads in fifth gear which later converge into an intersection of carnage . <p> I usually do n't  go through one life changing event at a time . It always seems to be overloaded with a pile of other monumental tasks . When Craig and I married , we also at the same time , were planning an indefinite move overseas and world traveling adventure , leaving only 3 days after the wedding . Not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding which we were finalizing , as well as packing up and renting out our own house and organizing jobs in Thailand . Kind of stressful , but that 's usually how we play , and we cope pretty well . <p> The last two weeks for me though have been incredibly difficult , and I have found myself completely wiped out . I 'm starting to realize the go hard or go home mentality is not really serving me very well anymore . <p> We 've had a massive international relocation , and doing it with a 3 year old adds for some extra energy drain . Now we are back home , we are trying to get settled in , dealing with conflicting emotions , major readjustments , and attempting to get our life in order . On top of all the strain , I came down with a cold , other maladies , and simply felt exhausted . I 'm sadly beginning to grasp the reality that I am not 24 anymore . <p> Photo : http : **35;1689;TOOLONG <p> As a result , our travel blog , which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became something I could not even look at . Every time I forced myself to sit down and work , nothing came up for me except feelings of dread , disconnectedness , and self-doubt . There was just far too many other things going on that I had to deal with . <p> All motivation and inspiration had left me and I was left wondering just what the hell was this all for anyway . <p> But it was not the end of me , it is all just part of the process . I 'm still here and I am writing again . Today is the first day I have felt somewhat normal since we returned home . This is the first fresh post I have sat down to write in weeks , and although I have had to get up from the table and take frequent breaks , and I feel kind of jittery , I am at least writing again . My focus is returning and I can see the light . <p> There is hope . You can get overcome the lack of inspiration and motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow down . You can only do so much at one time . Your motivation will dry up and your creative writing ideas will wither away when you need to put your focus into other things for awhile . It usually is an indication that you have some unbalance somewhere that needs re-correcting . <p> Photo : http : **36;1726;TOOLONG <p> Here are my tips on how to deal with a lack of inspiration , motivation or writers block : <p> Find the underlying cause : The best way to get over the lack of motivation is to work out where the block is coming from . There you should find your solution . For me , I was exhausted physically and mentally . I needed time to rest , deal with my life changes emotionally , and settle into my new home. - I had to take care of me first . <p> Get rid of the guilt : Realize that the world will not fall apart if you miss a few days posting on your blog . I 'm the type of person if I commit to doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been posting almost daily on my blog for some time now . I know this is not necessary , but it was something I started doing in order to build my presence very quickly ( Go hard or go home ! ) Now if I miss a day , I go into a panic , and I feel as if I am not just letting myself down , but the whole world. - I 'm sure no one would even notice if I did n't  post daily . This is a personal battle I have with myself , and while the commitment is a good thing , allowing it to throw your life out of balance because of it , is not . <p> Prevention : Whenever those beautiful creative flashes of inspiration come upon you then write . Take that enthusiasm and energy and put it into good use . Write as many drafts for future blog posts as you can . These will serve you well in moments of burn out . I was so grateful to have quite a few half or almost finished blog posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the kind of tasks I could manage somewhat well during my burn out . That helped me to continue posting on my site daily and lose the guilt ( or just cover it up ) . <p> Photo : http : **32;1764;TOOLONG <p> Do n't  give up : This is the worst thing you can do . When you go through these burn out moments , doubt creeps in and you think its time for you to quit . Your mind is not shy in telling you that your ideas are ridiculous , your writing sucks , and its never going to work . This is just your exhaustion and fear talking and you cant see the forests for the trees . Ignore it . The only way you will fail is if you quit . Know that everyone goes through these emotions . To make sure I never give up , I always make sure I do something each day for my blog , no matter how bad Im feeling . The tasks I choose are really very simple , non-thinking tasks , like uploading pictures for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve my motivation . Or I may focus my efforts on Stumbleupon or something equally stress free and enjoyable , yet productive . <p> Go out and find the inspiration : Get out of the house , office , or hostel , where ever it is you work from . Take time to breathe in the fresh air and just enjoy living . You 'll start to find that inspiration will come to you from the simplest things , from a magpie cawing at the beach to your little girls squeals of joy riding in the back of your bike . We are working on making our Facebook fan page more fun , and are putting new ideas in action to for more interaction and to promote our community members work . This inspires me and keeps me focused on my bigger vision as it involves helping others and brings some socializing fun into my business . <p> Health Retreat on Lamai Beach , Koh Samaui <p> Choose the right time of the day to work : Everyone has a different optimal energy time of the day . Work out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a morning person . This is my most energetic time of the day and the time I want to be doing most of my writing as its when my mind is the freshest . For some people it may be midnight or afternoon . Plan those times for your most important work . <p> Sleep : You ca n't function without it . Your body will start shitting down other areas to cope with the lack of sleep and energy , the ability to think being one of them . Just go to bed and rest . It will still be there tomorrow . This is something I 've been doing a lot of lately and its definitely helping with my transition . <p> Stay for a week at a health retreat in Thailand : I 'm working on it and I 'm dreaming about it every day . I just know that that is what the doctor has ordered for me and for you too . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Great post about balancing your life when you are a writer . All of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sluggish . I would like to add a couple things here that might help out as well . First , writers should n't use the term , " writers block . " Everyone has sluggish days of work , and giving a name to the a writers bad day adds a stigma that make those bad days special just because you 're a writer , and that 's just baloney . EVERYONE has bad days at work , you 're not special because you 're a writer ( not you personally Caz , just anyone really ) . Its part of the process to have frustrating times , so accept it , and when it gets to be too much , just turn off the computer and walk away . <p> Second , do n't  wait for inspiration . While its true you must get out of the house ( or wherever ) to jog your brain , again it is a truth for everyone regardless of occupation . The brain requires a change in stimuli to be productive , and sitting in one place too long will make you feel like mush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creativity is simply carrying a small notebook . Moleskine makes some tiny notebooks perfect for this task , so get some if you can . Otherwise any notepad smaller then a policemans pad will do . When an idea strikes , write it down . Before you know it you will have a stockpile of potential article ideas , which will aid in overcoming that pesky inspiration bug and um " writers block . " = <p> Thanks for sharing your tips Melissa ! Yes you are right , you always have to make sure you choose your words carefully . I love the notebook idea . I have a little one that comes with me and has oodles of scribbled sentences in it . It really is a great help to inspire future articles . <p> Great post Caz . I have been going through these ups and downs for the past several months after I decided this is what I want to do . Since I 'm not bringing in any money yet , though , I have to work another job for the time being . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our trip , and trying to figure out what our future holds has had me on a roller coaster . I have always had a plan . I 'm an organized person , and I just function better when I know I have a plan . For the first time in my life , my plan seems to change on a near daily basis , and its frustrating and confusing for me . I keep thinking , " Is this really what I 'm meant to do ? Is this really something I can pull off ? Am I meant for this type of work , or should I just chuck this sometimes seemingly ridiculous idea of trying to become a travel writer and just go back to my old career ? " <p> Sometimes it just sounds so much easier to just quit and take the easy way out . But I have n't done it , do n't  plan to do it , and just need to keep plugging away and remaining patient ( not one of my top virtues ) . Reading others struggles , especially people I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for a post like this , it really is helpful to many of those out there , including myself . <p> Keep plugging away , and just have confidence that you make good decisions . That 's one thing that usually keeps me goingknowing that I have typically made good life decisions , and just haveing the confidence in myself that I am doing the right things . <p> It makes it so much harder Adam , when you have to work a job you do n't  want to be working . That is a major energy drain . Just keep focused on your end goal and you 'll get there . I 'm so glad my struggles can help others to see that it is normal and it happens to everyone . We can all work together to encourage us to keep moving forward , no matter how slowly . <p> First I must just mention that Ive been following your blog for about a week or two and find it absolutely inspirational . I 'm a blogging newby started blogging about 2/3 months ago on a local South African blogpage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason for starting was that I wanted to get the hang of it before going on a planned around the world trip which we plan to start sometime next year . Only today I posted my first post to my travelblog .. still loooooong way to go before it is remotely something independant like yours . <p> Anywaynow that the introduction is over = Ive been struggling with almost all the points you mentioned as I 'm trying to go hard at my professional job during the day , starting to train for half-marathon in October , arranging travelplans and also getting the blogs up and running BUT I absolutely luv it ! <p> Your tips are very helpful and it is great to know that I am experiencing normal growthpains at the moment . <p> Good luck with arranging the healthspa trip definitely something I will look out for amongst your posts ! <p> Hi Nadia ! Thanks for following our blog , I 'm so glad you like it . You are extremely busy right now as well . It does take a lot out of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your blog and good on you for taking the first step with it ! <p> I am totally with you on the multitude of half-finished posts . I am finally to a point where my Published Post number is bigger than the Draft Post number . While I ride my bike home on " post days " i try to come up with an idea that affected me that day or something that seemed relevant . I once ended up with an entire post on Travel Rain because I was riding home in the rain and trying to reframe the wet experience into something positive . <p> I do like your tips . Been struggling a bit lately , but thankfully with tons of draft posts . Just harder to get them finished . <p> This morning , Caz , I wrote a longer reply than the one that 's already posted , but it did n't  appear when I thought I was hitting " post comment . " <p> Caz , your post brings tears to my eyes . Annie Dillard wrote that we should write about our pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps more than ever , IMHO , you are writing in blood . Your own . <p> If you had done nothing more in this post than tell us about the pain of your return , saying exactly what you say in the first part of the post , not a word different , it would have been enough . I do n't  know enough about good writing to say whether that qualifies this post as good writing , but in my book , its good . This post , without the tips , puts me there with you . I would have wondered , how is Caz doing after her return , and I would have come back , as I certainly will come back , to see what your writing about how you 're doing . <p> Then to see you still striving to make a contribution with your tips , excellent tips , when you 've already given us the contribution of your hearts response to this move . That was a tour de force , but I tear up when I think you seemed to think you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful post . <p> Three days after your wedding , you and your groom were off to Thailand . Now you are back , after , well , you do n't  say how long . But it seems like several years . You and your husband made the friends that count for both of you as a couple there . Now you have to do some or quite a bit of that again . You made your own friends that Craig may or may not hold as dearly as you do . These are probably the women with whom you would talk about children , childrens illnesses , childrens sleep , and so on and on . The women you could call to talk about something when you needed a friends ear . Now you have to do some of that again . You either had your daughter there or went back to Thailand after her birth . I have no idea what that 's like for a young mother of a young child . And you write this mouthful that makes my heart ache , " Now we are back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with conflicting emotions , major readjustments , and attempting to get our life in order . " **What are those efforts of settling in ? **What are those conflicting emotions ? **What are those major readjustments ? **How has the move back put your life " out of order " ? <p> But I 'm not writing about getting back to writing . That will come . I 'm writing about the grief we feel when we leave a place that is so dear to us that its hard to imagine not being there any more . Thirty-six years ago at this time in August , my wife , our son , our daughter , and I were packing to leave the best position I could imagine and the best place that had ever been in . Being in Germany fulfilled the life dream I had had since my father left us in northern New Mexico to work in Saudi Arabia , saying we 'd follow in 2 y . When that did n't  happen , somewhere along the line I set a goal : Take my family to live abroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whetted my appetite to go where he had been . <p> Grief drains us , just as surely as the overstimulation of resettling does . <p> May you be blessed and upheld in this time , as you have put yourself out to bless and uphold us , your readers . Russ <p> Thank you Russell for your kind words . It really gave me a boost to read this . Your other message somehow went straight to the SPAM folder which is weird . That happens to me too sometimes . Writing about your pain certainly does help . You have to get it out otherwise it just festers into something so much worse . Onwards and upwards ! <p> Great post Caz ! I think this is the reality we all face at a certain point ( if not many ) of our blogging " career " . I too have these dreadful moments from time to time , and like you , I have the " Go big or go home " mentality . Sometimes that mentality works great , but when you 're going through those " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm glad you point these things out because there is no reason why the world should " fall appart " if we miss a post or two . Actually , even when I push to not miss my posts , if I feel like I 'm forcing myself mentally to come out with it , I rather skip it for that day and retake it the next day or as soon as I feel like it . <p> And like you said , its good to take those " ah-ha " moments and write whatever came to your mind its good to keep the juices flowing . I too have like a dozen unfinished posts waiting to be taken care of lol ( glad to see I 'm not the only one ) <p> Thanks for the advice Caz ! I 'm suffering from major post-travel and LONG ... blues . Your advice applies not just to writers block , but life blues too ! <p> I know that I need to start finding things in my life that I love like travel blogging and learning about photography and learning languages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interest me . And , of course , start planning for the next big adventure in my life ! <p> No worries Rebecca . Post travel blues are the worst . I suffer from them every day I am not traveling . You are right about putting your attention into things that inspire you . That is where the magic lives ! <p> I am seriously right there now . We just returned from our trip and I went from having no job to suddenly having two ( and I 'm not complaining , I am so grateful to finally have an income ! ) . Anyway , making the mistake of not taking my computer on our trip left me completely out of the travel blog community and I came back with that fear of being forgotten . <p> Then of course all the things I saw deserve posts and I 'm pressuring myself to make them better than they 've been . <p> I guess I just wanted to say that first I was comforted but then inspired by your post . Now I know that we are all human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest . I just hope that it does n't  last long and I can get some good content going now ! <p> I had been wondering why I had n't  seen you around for awhile . I 'm so glad my post has helped you , it is a hard thing to overcome . Just take it step by step and you 'll find your mojo again . If its any comfort to you I have not been feeling good for a month now and my turnaround is very slow . I 'm still managing to get posts up but am not doing anywhere near the amount of work I could be doing . You can still do it . <p> Hi Caz , I just came around you post and must say , thatks for the encuregement . Its true , we all sometimes need an extra dose of inspiration .. or feel totaly without any . i AM in that state right now ca n't focuse but , and that 's a littel bit frustrating as I am used to be in action constantly . Hope sunny days wil come soon .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries Alex ! Sometimes you just have to take the time out in order to help your eyes readjust so they can focus again . I 'm someone who likes to always be busy too , its hard to take a break and rest , but you have to . Go for a nice long walk , do something enjoyable , even watch some of the idiot box ! ! Hope it gets better for you <p> Wow its two years since you posted this so I 'm not sure if you are going to see this but what the heck I just wanted to thank you for this awesome post ! Sitting here in sweden a lousy evening full of work feeling my inspiration spiraling down when I misstyped on google and stumbled onto this . I mean wow , it was like sent from above = I 'm a photographer and I just feel that my pictures been missing that extra sparkle the last weeks . I 'm thinking about printing your tips and put them on my moodboard so that I never forget not to quit . <p> What a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through " writers block = <p> I liked the ways you shared here , and while I do follow most of them when I get blank sometimes , I really believe that if you enjoy blogging and it becomes your passion with time , you have less of these blocks . I guess those who put up daily posts or every alternate days might be facing this problem . <p> The key according to me lies in the fact that you should write when you are focused in your work . I do n't think your mind would turn blank then , or you would n't know what to write . But I guess it differs from person to person too . <p> Speaking of myself , I guess being a professional freelance writer and blogger " my work is to write ! And I write a lot , whether it 's my blog posts , project work , or even replying to the comments on my blog ( which are mini posts in themselves ! ) " all of that is writing . I never really get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with creative ideas that are just waiting to be penned down . However , when these is work pressure and pending projects etc. , and when there 's stress all around " I do experience writers block , though it 's rare . <h> Trackbacks <p> home brings with it its own problems .

@@21820911 @1820911/ <p> Before we had kids , a lot of our long-term travel consisted of staying in hostels as they are a great option for saving money on the road and meeting other travellers . <p> These days , we would only ever consider a hostel stay if it has private family rooms and kitchen facilities we are done with dorms ! <p> Hostels have probably changed a lot in the years since we 've had children and are n't the feral places you might be used to . <p> Many Hostels are recognising the gap in the market and are rushing in to fill it with family style accommodation and facilities . <h> Pros of Staying in Hostels <h> 1 . Location <p> They are almost always in great locations . In major cities they are generally very well located close to public transport lines and tourist sites . In coastal areas they are usually within walking distance to a beach and with views . <p> How much would it cost for a family to stay in a hotel on a beach or a major CBD ? Check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YHA . A family room here is much less than you would get for any other hotel in the area . <h> 2 . Price <p> Depending on whether you are solo , a couple , or a family , a private or family room in a hostel are almost always cheaper than hotels , and dorm rooms are cheaper again.To stay in a hotel or a resort as a family can get expensive . <h> 3 . Sociable <p> Great places for meeting fellow like-minded travelers , particularly if you are solo and need some company and support . And you do n't  need to stay in a dorm to get a good conversation going , most hostels have common rooms and notice boards . <p> For families , they provide a homely atmosphere and an opportunity for your children to mingle with people from all over the world. - <h> 5 . Communal Kitchens <p> A great way to save on food costs and meet other travelers . And if you 're a family it helps your children to learn how to respect other members of a community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up after yourself and label any food you leave in the fridge or pantry . <h> 6 . Friendly and Helpful Staff <p> In our personal experience , staff in hostels have generally been very friendly and helpful . More often than not the staff are either other travelers or a local who enjoys the interaction with the traveling community . <p> Hostel workers are usually a fantastic source of information for things to do and see in the area , especially when it comes to budget travel . They often organise tours of the area , and sometimes for free . <h> 7 . Games Rooms <p> They have hang out rooms , often filled with games , TVs , and DVD 's . Great for children so they are not confined to one small room in a hotel , and a god send for parents with older children who need time out themselves . <h> 8 . Cafes and Bars <p> We enjoy hostels that have built-in cafes and bars , as long as we are not sleeping directly above or below it . Another way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bare in mind that some hostels can be party places , and the revelers can find you wherever you are in the building , so just know what your style and tolerance level is. <h> 9 . Supporting Local People <p> We once stayed for a week in a local families guesthouse in a rural area of Laos . A very simple establishment with only three bungalows on stilts and just a bed with a mosquito net . <p> This family had actually lived inside a cave for 10 years during the Vietnam War , only coming outside in the daytime to risk their lives to tend to their crops . <p> They were amazing people . It was a great feeling to support their family business . Experiences like this give you a whole new perspective on life and really makes traveling what it is . <h> Cons of Staying in Hostels <h> 1 . Personal Space <p> If you stay in a dorm , things can get pretty cramped . Your " personal space " is pretty much limited to your bed and locker . That 's the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you 're traveling in a group of 4 or 6 , you may even get a dorm to yourselves . <h> 2 . You May Not Meet Any Locals <p> Do n't  become a " Permanent Resident " of your hostel . Some travelers literally hang there 24/7 and drink , sleep , watch TV , play pool , gossip and what not . You may as well save yourself a bunch of money on flights because that 's something you can do with your friends at home . <p> I do n't  know about you , but we love to get out and meet the locals , mix in with the day to day living that goes on in the town , and experience the culture . <h> 3 . Can Be Party Houses <p> If you are young and looking for a rock-in good time , hostels can be a blast . Weve been there done that , and whilst we still love a good time , these days we prefer a local bar/pub that 's more of a traveling experience in that town and interacting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere and character of a hostel . <h> 4 . Interrupted Sleep <p> If you 're staying in a dorm , consider the fact that people will be coming and going due to late or early flights and tours , they may be out clubbing , or they may be sleep talkers or snorers ( nothing worse ) . <p> If you have an en suite attached people showering at all hours can be quite annoying also . Just be prepared to tolerate this investing in some ear plugs and an open mind can do wanders . <h> 5 . Communal Bathrooms <p> If you sleep in a dorm , you could be sharing a bathroom with up to a dozen people , which can lead to dirtiness and long waits for showers or no hot water . Again , your personal space is compromised . <h> Points to Consider When Booking <h> 1 . Think Location <p> Being located somewhere practical is SUPER important . Make sure you have easy access to airports , public transport , attractions , and the ability to get out and walk to most things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a safe neighborhood there is nothing worse than feeling trapped inside your hostel because the area seems unsafe . <h> 2 . Reviews <p> Most sites will have reviews from previous travelers . By all means read them , and generally they will help you get a feel for a place , but in the same token some people have nothing better to do than to complain for the sake of complaining . <p> Go with your gut its usually correct . <h> 3 . Independent Hostel OR an Organization ? <p> Personally , we have mostly stayed in independently owned hostels and have really enjoyed them . <p> However , in Australia we 've mostly stayed in YHA or HI ( Hosteling International ) properties . You may have to join their annual membership , but it provides for great discounts and privileges . <h> 4 . Dorm Size <p> The larger the dorm , the more potential annoyances but the cheaper the bed . Try to stay in smaller dorms if your budget allows . <h> 5 . Are The Dorms Segregated ? <p> Some hostels only allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves separated by this rule once in Victoria Falls Zimbabwe , and another time in Santa Monica , LA . <p> As a married couple , this was quite annoying and considering we like to travel light and share things , also unpractical . So if you are a couple , just double check to see the hostels rules and regulations . <h> 6 . What Facilities ? <p> At the top of our priority list are cooking facilities . Does the hostel have an equipped kitchen to cook your own meals , and also refrigeration space to store any items you purchase at a local store . <p> Just like everything you have to do your research and ask : what type of rooms are there ? Location ? Price ? Atmosphere ? It depends on what are the priorities for you and where you want to spend your travelling dollars ! <p> I 've stayed in them before and most likely will stay with them again when my girl is a tad bit older , I also notice how some hostels and dorms have age restrictions and some would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i guess that 's a good thing to remember when booking for a family as well . <p> WiFi at dorms and hostels tend to be more accessible and faster ( and free ) compared to regular hotels , more so in business hotels where they charge an arm and a leg . <p> We always choose hostels before hotels , although do admit to choosing self catering apartments a little more often now that we are parents . Having said that , if we ever went back to The Big Island in Hawaii , it would be hostels all the way , even with kids , some of the best hostels we 've stayed in . <p> We used to stay in hostels before we had kids . Now , I find that often the family rooms at hostels cost as much as a vacation apartment rental , so we usually go with those . However , I occasionally look into them when visiting an expensive city , or if we will only be passing through for 1-2 nights . <p> Ive encountered several families in hostels as well ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardcore ! ) , but I suppose it wont always be the cheapest solution when with a family . Although , cost aside , I 've found that independent hostels tend to have loads of unique character and are actually a really nice addition to the travel experience as a whole ! <p> These days , I get a private room at a hostel every time one is available . Its cheaper than a hotel room , locations are always convenient to downtown , and you still get privacy . If you want community its there . Granted , can be tough for families but there are hostels out there that do provide for that . A private room in a hostel is still a good cheap option where you get the basics and spend less than a hotel . <p> Each hostel is different so hard to lump them all together . I would just recommend people do their research , know their budget , and find the best option that fits all their needs . Hostels definitely offer that . <p> Do n't  you get tired with throwaway friendships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other about where they have been and where they are going . And then the next they they go away and everyone forgets each other . That is why we tend to avoid hostels . <p> Our social needs have been better satisfied with hospex contacts and living like locals with locals . <p> I stayed in hostels almost completely when I backpacked through Europe many years ago . Now that I have a family we have not actually tried a hostel but I remember even then there were some family-friendly ones . Great tips and thanks for putting the bug in my ear to check this out ! <p> 1 . Personal Space this is correct ! The personal space is limited , but this may be also an opportunity in getting more comfortable with other people and not to take his self to serious . For a limited time , this is a big opportunity , I guess . <p> 2 . You May Not Meet Any Locals Absolutely , and this is a pity ! Therefore we developed GoDashBoard , to see who else will be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way , you can do whatever you want . Maybe there are cool people in the hostel , maybe a local would be better for this destination ? It always depends ! <p> 3 . Can Be Party Houses We always recommend to check this out before you book . The description will tell you which kind of hostel you are booking ! Plus , if you are a party traveler , even better to find the right spot . It always depends on the motivation to travel . <p> 4 . Interrupted Sleep Ou yes , this might happen and happened to me as well couple of times . But over the time I figured something out : Ask the trouble-shooters with a calm voice if they could be more quite as people are sleeping here . Most of the times those trouble-shooters were ashamed and left , or slowed down . <p> 5 . Communal Bathrooms This depends on the budget . If you share with 200 people , this can be really disgusting plus waiting time . Therefore we recommend to check out with how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Again , this is a great overview ! Let us know if you need any hostels and maybe you want to check out our website as well ! <p> I have never experienced staying in a hostel when traveling , especially when I am with my kids . My husband and I usually prefer hotels . Maybe if my kids are a bit grown up , we will try hostel accommodation . <p> we ( my husband , myself and 2 children ( 8 and 16 ) were traveling in SanDiego area and stayed in a variety of places including a 4 star hotel right on marina with all the amenities ( big big bucks if not for my husbands business trip ) , another nice hotel through priceline ( bigbucks ) and a hostel in 2 family rooms . one for us an one for the kids . When I asked my kids which place they liked best of our stays , they both said the hostel . Go figure . they loved the experience and to meet people from around the world . <p> That is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what kids totally love . My girls tonight were playing in the toy area of the hostel with other small children and they loved it ! Its so great for them <p> Do n't  forget checking whether its a party hostel . While most are family-friendly , there are a few out there that can get " wild " in the evenings . Great for party-goers , not so great for anyone wanting to get a good nights sleep = <p> Anyway , I recently wrote an article on what hostels are , for those of you who are less familiar with them . What is a hostel ? <h> Trackbacks <p> as a couple and , for the last few years , as a family .

What does Egypt have to offer for this or that kind of traveler ? <p> And even worse , I have heard ( or read comments of ) people talking about Egypt saying it has nothing to offer but the pyramids in Giza and other old monuments in Luxor and Aswan . <p> I would like to change this perspective . <p> As an Egyptian who is into travel myself , I know that people in general have different tastes , and each traveler is specifically looking for a different kind of thing in the places they visit ! Not everyone is a history buff that wants to see only the pyramids and Egypt is so much more . <p> So here you go , <h> Five Things Egypt Has to Offer Different Travel Tastes <h> 1 .

Egypt for the historians ' Mecca ! - With temples , monuments and buildings standing for 5,000 years , you ca n't beat that . <p> I am not by any chance a professional Egyptologist , but it does n't take that to enjoy the fact that you 're seeing the Pyramids for example .

The main reason I want to visit Egypt is because of their history and culture . But I am happy to read your post and would definitely consider your list . <p> The Red Sea Riviera is an impressive destination with a wealth of leisure activities on hand , historical sites and natural wonders within easy reach .

Mamak <p> Mamak is an institution . Get here early as the line will be out the door , filled with diners eager for a sample of their divine roti and curries .

Icebergs <p> View from Icebergs <p> Oprah had lunch at Iceburgs and Kylie Minogue books the entire restaurant out for private parties when she is in town . <p> Perched on the cliffs of South Bondi and above the famous swimming club that started this famous place , the views from Icebergs are what you come to Australia for , the dining elegant , and the Italain inspried food delicious . <p> The Orecchiette Pasta , Broccoli , Garlic , Anchovy , Hint of Chilli is one of their signature dishes . <p> Orecchiette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved this barramundi . <p> Aussie barra <p> Iceburgs is expensive though , so it is one of those spulurge places .

Speedos Cafe <p> Please leave the speedos at home <p> Please , if you come to eat here , then ditch the budgie smugglers ( banana hammocks ) . I know it might sound cute to wear speedos in the Speedos cafe but it does not look cute . <p> We came here for lunch after our Bondi surfing lesson and the food did not disappoint our hungry tummies . It has a laid back vibe and is perfect for people watching out onto the beach . <p> I highly recommend the Thai prawn salad washed down with a mango smoothie . Refreshingly yum ! <h> The CBD <h> 13 . Sea Bay Chinese Restaurant <p> This- restaurant is small and non-descript , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap . Do n't  miss the vegetarian dumplings ( seriously the best we 've had ) , the home-made noodles were soft and the flavour a mix of fish and soy , and the pancakes ! <h> 14 . Thanon Khaosan Thai Restaurant <p> Thanon Khaosan makes us feel like we are back in Bangkok . Not just because of the cheap authentic Thai food , but they actually have a tuk tuk parked inside the restaurant and a street cart at the entry . Its a popular lunch and dinner destination with a layed back atmosphere in a great central location . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I 'm very proud to say I 've eaten at 11 out of 11 of your recommendations . ( I suppose that comes from spending far too much of my youth not learning how to cook and finding excuses to go out on weeknights ! ) Great tips , though they 're all fantastic places . <p> In Paddington I love the food at the Four in Hand pub . In Surry Hills , I 'm a fan of Red Lantern ( great Asian fusion ) . In Bondi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian is delicious ! In Woollahra , you cant go past Bistro Moncur ( the cheaper one above the pub not the expensive one next to it ! ) In Darlinghurst , I 've had some of the best pizza in Sydney at Bar Reggio ( although Love Supreme in Paddington and Pizza Mario in Surry Hills are also great ! ) And my favourite sushi is Sushi Suma on Cleveland St. ( Can you tell I very rarely left the Eastern suburbs ? = ) <p> I honestly could not pick a favourite from the sublime listing above . Next time I am at Bondi I am going to see if there are any banana hammocks ( never heard of that one before ) Hope there are not any . We do not often get to Sydney , but I am bookmarking this post right NOW ! <p> When my friend said he was taking me for the best laksa in Sydney , I was excited . When he led me into a food court and told me wed be dining under fluorescent lights , I figured he was pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was one of my favourite ( and most filling ) meals . Yum . <p> Another place I loved for both the food and the vibe was the El Loco Cantina at the Excelsior Hotel . Fun , bright , quirky , and the tacos were something to write home about . Def check it out ! <p> That is funny Jenny . It does look so dodgy but once you try the food and the price you 'll be taking your own friends there .. and your dates too ! Thanks for the Mexican tip . Well put that on our list of places to check out <p> I went to the Harts pub on my very first day in Sydney , after a 24 hour flight and suffering from the 12 hour time difference . the food , as I recall , was awesome . Not quite as awesome as the entertainment , which took the form of a fellow Brit wandering in and asking for a pint of Fosters . The bar lady laughed a lot = <p> Great suggestions Henry ! I have heard great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because were vegetarian ( well we eat seafood ) and we just assumed there would not be much on the menu for us . But perhaps we should take a look . We had a mocha at the Lindt Cafe the other week but werent over the moon about it . I think we were expecting too much having heard so much about it and we had the most amazing mocha in Auckland which I think could never be beaten ! <p> Must try the German Bakery . We really have to get to Newtown to try some restaurants . I have a friend who owns a Thai restaurant there and I told him I 'd come visit . <p> Oh will have to check that one out . We do n't  eat a lot of Indian but I do enjoy it when I do . Surry Hills has the best vibe . We love it there . My parents were born and raised in Surry Hills so I have a strong connection with the area . <p> They all look so incredible ! You have me craving a good laksa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day at the beach needs a good lunch stop ! I agree cover up those speedos ! Roo pizza sounds good will have to add that to my list of places to go on my next visit ! <p> This is awesome because everytime I am in Sydney I struggle finding a good place to eat ( that 's affordable ) . Now I know where to go ! Not sure if I 'll be able to try that kangaroo pizza or crocodile yet though <p> Local Cuisine of Australia and street food is where I love to go to eat . Cafe Sydney and Stokehouse in Melbourne are two most favourite places to eat of me . Apart from Local cafes and street foods there are many cafes where you can enjoy Italian , Chinese , Thai and of course your favourite European food . Here is more about all places to eat in Australia . LONG ... <p> A few recommendations : For a cheap meal with a view of the opera house , eat on the rooftop at the glenmore in the rocks . On a Monday they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a great view of cockle bay and has a $10 steak special mon-weds . By wynard , bar 333 do great meals and cheap specials every night $10-13 . I find in china town the Sussex street food court ( up the escalators ) is better quality than Dixon st food court , in particular the Korean in the corner big bowl of noodles and a soup for $9 . Another good food court is above paddys market and on the top floor of market city . Worth a mention is the pork roll shop next to the bus stop on George street opposite scruffy Murphys , $4.50 for the best Vietnamese pork roll in Sydney . Great blog Guys .

A bag of fish cakes will set you back 20 baht ( less than a $1 ) and a noodle soup around 60 baht ( $2 ) . <h> How do you know where to eat the best street food in Bangkok ? <p> Craig and I really believe the best Thai street food is the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriving with locals " always a sign that the food rocks . <p> Know a few of your fave dishes in Thai , so you can order the right thing .

Tim is a Bangkok local and shared with us what is widely considered throughout the Bangkok community to be the <h> 5 Places to Eat Street Food in Bangkok <h> 1 . Chinatown <p> OMG , if you love authentic Thai street food you will love visiting Chinatown in Bangkok . There are hundreds of street stalls , markets , carts and restaurants . Night time is when Yaowarat , as Chinatown is also known as , will rock your taste buds . <p> We can really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jim Thompson , who took us on a walking tour of Yaowarat last year , Chinatown is the place where street food first began in Thailand over 200 years ago when Bangkok was the major trading hub of South East Asia . <p> Dumplings <p> Just look for the ad hoc stalls , the plastic tables and chairs , feast out on delicious food and wash it all down with a Singa beer . <p> We lived a short walk from the outskirts of Chinatown and loved wandering down for our evening meal of Thai noodles with gravy . At 20 baht how can you say no ? <p> oyster omellete Chinatown special <h> 2 . Silom Road , Bangkok <p> Simlom Road is the only area on the list we have not experienced recently , although we did venture to this area of Bangkok whilst living in the city in 2002 . <p> Being the central business district of Bangkok there are a lot of people , hungry people wanting a quick meal in between office hours . That means you 'll find a lot of Bangkok street food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you probably most want to go to gorge on cheap Thai food . <h> 3 . Soi Rambuttri <p> This is one of our favourite streets in Bangkok . - Soi Rambuttri is one of the few places you can escape the madness of Bangkok . <p> When we lived in Bangkok this street was known as Dog Shit Alley , because of the number of dogs that paraded up and down the rat-infested street . We loved eating Thai food and drinking here . It was cool before it was the hipster-cool it is now . It has had a major uplift and is now a pretty Bangkok oasis . <p> We were surprised Soi Rambuttri made the list as it seems such a small area , but Tim assures us the food there is known to be first class . It 's also really cheap . <p> We did n't eat there this time , except for Kalyra who gorged herself on a cheap banana pancakes with chocolate one of our fave 2am treats after a night in the Alley . <h> 4 . Banglamphu <p> When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banglamphu were both on the list as Dog Shit Alley is in Banglampoo Tim explained that the street food is a little different . <p> Banglamphu is the area around the river , near the Golden Palace that comprises the backpacking travel area of Khao San Road and So Rambutrri . <p> If you want the really great Bangkok street food , then walk to the end of Khao San Road , turn right past the police station opposite the Wat and Soi Rambuttri and lining the streets will be many many street stalls and carts . Also the streets adjacent to Khao San . <p> We can absolutely affirm that this is a great place to eat the best street food in Bangkok . This was where we ate dinner most nights when we lived in Bangkok , we loved to feast on fish cakes and noodle soup . <p> credit : amsfrank <h> 5 . Soi 38 Sukumvhit <p> We do n't feel we had the normal Soi 38 street food experience . We were excited to feast on this street as we had heard so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were only a few carts lining the street , we envisioned much more , and the selection did n't seem all that great .

Maybe because we are so used to Bangkok street food , we were n't that wowed by Soi 38 .

We have a forced one week stay in Bangkok right now and while most of our time is spent in our hotel room while I rest and recover we have been venturing out for our daily street food fix . I keep teaching myself vegetarian in Thai then forgetting so saying no meat and doing crazy hand signals at least seems to amuse the locals . One woman last night waved some lettuce at me then cackled like crazy . Lucky I ended up with amazing grilled organic mushies thatll teach her for making fun of vegos ! <p> But just jumped over to your facebook page and oh no !

Unfortunatly I 'm eating at Burger King because I know only a very few Thai dishes and can not read the menu to see if those I do know are there . Any tips on how to deal with a street menu ( when unabe to read Thai ) and place an order ? One more Whopper and that creepy " King " mascot is going have to watch his backIm not sure Im going to be responsible for my actions . <p> Point and hope for the best ! ! Start with places where falangs usually go , ( like these 5 places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one with pictures . You 'll start to get used to the dishes . If you really love a particular dish , write down the name of it and perhaps get someone to write it in Thai . Then when you go to a street cart , you can show them that and they should be able to sort that dish out for you . We got ta get you out of Burger King ! ! <p> My wife and I sorted our first street meal tonight and after three days of the " King " it was great . Three dishes came in at 160 baht so I think we copped the tourist price ( agian ) but the food was excellent and we have another eighteen days to check out other dishes . I suppose a few baht over the odds is to be expected . <p> Yeah 160 baht is pretty good for falang prices . You can definitely pick up cheaper , but now you know what to look out for you 'll find the cheaper deals . So glad you you enjoyed the experience ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thailand ( but in many other places too ) street food is where its at ! <p> I know some people are a little bit worried about eating on the street with kids , but if you 're at a busy place , its a good sign that the food is delicious , clean , and has tons of repeat customers for a reason . <p> Its also really cheap and how most locals eat on a regular basis . I have noticed though that some of the street food around touristy areas has gotten pricey , so its worth watching out for . Almost all street stalls are still in the 30-60 baht range , but I 've noticed a few places along Sukhumvit Road that are charging 180-300 baht for those same dishes on the street ! <p> This is great !

They told us the street food is dangerous in Thailand and to only eat in Chinatown and there was no street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists but they refused to offer a suggestion other than the Thai-Italian restaurant next door .

She is a very good cook . I look forward to going back to Bangkok , and some other areas of Thailand next year . <p> To be honest when it comes to local food in Thailand , or most of S E Asia , street food wins every time . Sure , many first time travellers have been told horror stories of unhygienic establishments and stomach upsets , but in my experience of visiting Bangkok sometimes there 's not much difference between a $3 meal and a $30 one ! <p> Located off the southern tip of Malay Peninsula , Singapore is one in every of the new favorites for traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty that lies to a lower place the ocean and therefore the visit to the zoos will cause you to go wild once on Singapore Tour .

Thanks for the great list . When the Kids and I were in Bangkok recently , we went to the street market near On Nut BTS which was pretty lively . I was worried Boy would get food all over himself but he behaved . Girl , quite rightly , refused to let Boy anywhere near Pizza Hut but I wish we had known about this list before .

I was diddled out of at least -100 and ended up in an hotel full of German people who were very suspicious of a solo woman traveller . <p> Thailand was great but again there are not a lot of people around willing to strike up a conversation with a solo woman over 50 in case they are landed with her for the holiday ! <p> Since setting up eatwithalocal and finding other hospitality sites such as Servas , hosptiality club , couch surfing I have transformed my holiday experience .

This will make you walk around with confidence and purpose , which makes you look less of a target . <p> It also means that you can spend your time figuring out the important stuff like getting there , rather than where to get to .

It was fabulous . I squeezed about a months worth of travel into 1 week but I just could not get over how helpful and friendly the people were . I was always guided in the direction even without understanding a word I was saying lol . I felt completely safe the whole time . My tips for fast and safe solo travelling in Japan would be <p> Always source the tourist info centre first ( where they have english speakers ) and get all the info you desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incase you need to go back . <p> Make sure you have nutritious snacks on hand at all times , noone else can grab you a quick sugar fix to keep you moving . <p> Make yourself familiar with the transportation system , study the maps as much as you can before you go . <p> My friends could n't believe I was going on my own but I was really looking forward to the challenge without speaking the language . I managed to fly into to Tokyo and get to Kyoto and Hiroshima by bullet train in a week . I also did n't  drink very much as as I have a bit of a habit of time wasting with hangovers hehe If I kept thinking like my friends , I would never get to go anywhere . Why should I miss out just because I do n't  have a partner in crime ? If by chance something bad did happen , at least I was going down having the time of my life . Not sitting at home wondering = <p> I had always traveled with my ex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . I just completed my first solo 7 month backpack trip through South East Asia and it was AMAZING . I found hostels to be the safest and best place to meet people , and I met so many awesome , inspiring , other solo female travelers at hostels . We were all having unbelievable experiences and it was so inspiring to chat and form friendships . My strongest advise Just do it . Get out there . Do n't  be afraid to travel alone . You will meet people , you will grow so much , and your life will be transformed . <p> I just found this blog and wish to thank you for your back-up . Just do it . This year I will travel with my ex-husband because I do not know anyone else to travel with at the moment . And I thougt that if I 'd decided to travel alone it would be really the end of our friendship ( which is a very good left-over from our marriage ) . But next year I really wish to go my own way throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a little extra planning for example , when you 're alone , losing your ATM card , money , credit cards , etc can be a bigger concern because you do n't  have anyone to spot you . I suggest never keeping your cards in the same place for example , keep an ATM card in your day bag , but keep an extra credit card in a hidden pocket in your luggage . You also want to make sure you make photocopies of the front and back of all of your important documents and cards and keep copies in a couple of different hidden places make sure you leave a copy with people back home if you have your stuff stolen , then call home and have your friends give you the numbers to cancel your cards . I recently travelled solo to Thailand , Cambodia , Vietnam , and Laos . The hardest place to be alone was Vietnam , but mainly b/c I was n't sure when I was getting ripped off and I was willing to pay *extra* money to stay in hotels that felt safer My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to balance having a few days doing random things followed by a couple of days with planned excursions for example , I did a 3 day scuba diving trip and also a 3 day gibbon experience those things give you a nice break from having to be vigilant every minute and are great ways to make friends and travelling buddies as well as to meet other solo travellers <p> I also started using those " pay as you go " debit / credit cards where you can refill them as you travel ( here in the US Greendot is one ) . Not only gives you spare money in case something goes wrong , but I 've found its also good to use on a day to day basis because its not your primary acct if the number gets stolen ! ! ! Limited money and limited damages they can cause . <p> Wow , great tips for solo female travelers ! I agree with each and every one of themBeing aware of the moment is a great one because listening to yourself and environment is key ! Walk with confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are less prone to getting scammed that way = Essentially , use your street smarts ! ; 0 Great post loved every word of it ! <p> I think there are a lot of potential obstacles for anyone travelling solo . While you may want to be solo for the majority of your trip , why not try some of the social networks to meet people when travelling ? I 'm obviously going to recommend my network here , http : **26;1798;TOOLONG , but there are other great ones two , CouchSurfing , TravBuddy , and so on . <p> On these site you can meet others travelling and other habitants of cities . Why get a guide when you can meet someone local ? <p> Basically by joining MySocialPassport or other travel social networks it gives you a few more options . I know I always prefer to eat and drink with company , and these sites can be great for that <p> My first solo trip was in Europe and then I went again . Finally I 'd the courage to see South America . Coming from Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these on my own as girls here do n't  dare to venture out all alone . <p> I must say girl traveler has all the help she needs and am lucky to have met many nice people in both continents . <p> @ Vickie I did a private tour guide in Thailand and Vietnam with my fiance this past year and we had an amazing experience . I think its a great way to go and a great way to get to know a new city in a foreign country . Obviously maybe our experiences might have been a little different than a woman going solo , but nonetheless a worthwhile effort and congrats for doing so . <p> The best thing to do as a solo traveler is to stay alert . Look around constantly , while keeping an air of confidence about you . Thieves look for easy prey , such as people who have had too much to drink or who seem disoriented or lost . If you notice a single person or a group of people staring at you , move away quickly , but discretely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where nearly as long as you have !

I hear all the time of bad things , and I know there are ways to stay safe . However , I think the best way would just be to bring someone along with you . <p> Boyde ! The world is so much safer than the news and other people would have you believe . Ive been travelling since 97 and have never had a problem . And I 've travelled to areas that have been deemed " unsafe " When you get there you realize that most of it is hype . The people are lovely and are often looking out for you . If you look around your own country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to step outside of your front door everyday . At the end of the day you have to do what you feel most comfortable doing . <p> What a great article and an important one at that . There needs to be confidence instilled in woman to be able to travel alone . I also traveled to Turkey alone and I had a good time but I was always aware of my surroundings and dressed modestly . It is a conservative country and I feel that there is a huge stigma against female travelers with a western charisma that people tend to see negatively towards in other parts of the world . Great advice from the comments as well thank you ! ! ! <p> So glad you enjoyed it Susan . I think confidence and being aware of your surroundings is so essential for any traveller . And yes women have to be more cautious to dress modestly , especially in certain countries . It sucks that life is like that , but that 's just the way it is so do it and keep yourself safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far afield on their own may prefer to travel in group . There are lots of tour companies organising singles holidays around the world for female travellers from all kinds of backgrounds . They group together anything from 5 to 15 single travelers from around the world who wish to go to say Japan , Cuba , Africa , South America etc. for a month or whatever under the guidance and support of a tour guide . Good way of meeting friends and having an adventure at the same time , and with most of the activities being optional you can still retain a certain amount of independence . <p> Great tips Caz , I 'm looking forward to a Solo trip one of these days ..

Knowing that all the details like transportation to and from the airport and meals were taken care of meant I could spend some time adjusting to the unique nature of solo travel , care-free . It was a great way to practice eating alone , using a hotel safe , and talking to strangers , knowing all the while that my location was secure , that my maid would look for me each morning , and that staff who spoke my language were readily available . <p> Having that under my belt made my decision to travel solo to Rome the next year SO much easier !

This will give you a better sense of self . Many of the same dangers and adventures are lurking just around the corner and you do n't  have to travel across the pond to experience solo travel . Stay in hostels , meet new people , rent a car , explore . You will find your personal travel style and then when you go to another country you wo n't feel as intimidated by the fact that you are solo and then you can enjoy yourself more .

But one of our memorable moments was grabbing a take away pizza and a bottle of wine and ending our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park , Northern Territory <p> Kakadu easily ranks as one of our favourite National Parks in Australia and the best place to see the sun go down is from up top of the rock at Ubirr with views over the Nadarb floodplains and Arnhem Land . One of the most beautiful sunsets we have seen ! <h> 5 . Twelve Apostles , Great Ocean Road , Victoria <p> The Great Ocean Road is one of the most iconic places in Australia to visit , with the Twelve Apostles being the star of the show . Best seen at sunset ( or sunrise ) as you avoid the midday congestion of the tourist buses from Melbourne . <h> 6 . Katherine Gorge , Northern Territory <p> Every evening just on sunset the hundreds of fruit bats take to the sky over Katherine Gorge providing for a unique silhouette photo against the bright orange sky . <h> 7 . Daydream Island , Queensland <p> Lovers Cove is the place to be on Daydream Island for a sunset drink with your significant other . <h> 8 . Mindil Beach , Darwin <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunset in Australia and Mindil Beach is probably the most popular location , especially during the Thursday night market when hundreds hit the beach to watch the sun sink below the horizon . <h> 9 . Cullen Bay , Darwin <p> Cullen Bay is more of an upmarket neighbourhood to stay in Darwin and the sunsets certainly do n't  disappoint . <h> 10 . Ski Club , Darwin <p> My favourite place to finish the day in Darwin is at the Ski Club with dinner and drinks . Super casual and with front row view of the famous Darwin sunset . <h> 11 . Town of 1770 , Queensland <h> 12 . Coolangatta , Gold Coast , Queensland <p> Coolangatta holds special memories for us , we got engaged on the beach here at sunset . Being at the southern end of the Gold Coast it offers distant views of the Surfers Paradise skyline which acts as a brilliant silhouette against the red sky . <h> 13 . Rainbow Bay , Gold Coast , Queensland <p> If you only go to one place on the Gold Coast for sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous Snapper Rocks surf break . Again , you have incredible views all the way up the coast to Surfers. <h> 14 . Fraser Island , Queensland <p> Fraser Island is well known as one of the best 4wd adventure destinations in the country , and for being the largest sand island in the world . The perfect way to end your day is with a sunset drink near the jetty in Kingfisher Bay . <h> 15 . Karumba , Queensland <p> Karumba up on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria is a popular fishing destination . If you 're not into fishing , grab some takeaway fish &amp; chips and sit on the beach and enjoy the night time show put on by mother nature . <h> 16 . Magnetic Island , Queensland <p> Magnetic Island or " Maggie " to the locals is a chilled out island just off the coast of Townsville . And the perfect way to slip into Maggie time is during sunset at Horseshoe Bay . <h> 17 . Uluru , Northern Territory <p> The are 9 ways to experience the magic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the sun slowly goes down the colours of the rock change and besides sunrise is the most spectacular time of the day . Head to one of the designated viewing areas , jump on a camel or sip on a few glasses of champagne with the folks from AAT Kings . <h> 18 . Kata Tjuta , Northern Territory <p> Kata Tjuta is only 50 kilometres up the road from Uluru , and whilst my sunset family photo does n't  do it justice once again the changing of the colours in the rocks as the sun sinks down is a sight to see . You can also get an excellent sunset silhouette from in town at Yulara ( main town of Uluru ) . <h> 2o . Gantheaume Point , Broome , Western Australia <h> 21 . Lake Argyle , Western Australia <p> If you only have time to do one thing at Lake Argyle like us , jump on board the sunset cruise . Even if you do n't  jump in the lake with 25,000 freshwater crocs , the sunset memories will stay with you forever ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have the most memorable time in Kalbarri but being a West Australian town the sunset sure was a highlight . <h> 23 . Cottesloe Beach , Perth , Western Australia <p> For a city beach , Cottesloe is one of the better ones . Perth knows how to put on a sunset show and Cott is the place to be with take away fish &amp; chips and a cold bevvy. <h> 24 . Anzac Hill , Alice Springs , Northern Territory <p> The best place to take in the sunset in Alice Springs is at the top of Anzac Hill , right in town . Not west coast stunning by any means , but a nice place to be on a warm evening . <h> 25 . Great Keppel Island , Queensland <p> You do n't  have to leave Great Keppel Island to appreciate the sunset , but why not take to the water for a few champers and nibbles on a sunset cruise . Its what we did , even with the kids , and we all loved it . <h> 26 . Longreach , Queensland <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was pleasantly surprised by the event that took place during our stop at Camden Park Station . Just magic . <h> 27 . Mount Isa , Queensland <p> For a mining town , Mount Isa sure did surprise us and taking in the sunset silhouette of the stacks is a nice way to finish your day in the Isa. <h> 28 . Agnes Water , Queensland <p> This laid-back coastal town in Queensland is a close neighbour to the Town of 1770 . Agnes Water is the last place heading north on the east coast where you can surf , and a picturesque sunset location for us east coasters . <h> Plan Your Trip in Australia 69808 @qwx269808 69802 @qwx269802 69803 @qwx269803 <p> Flights 69807 @qwx269807 <p> Car Rental 69806 @qwx269806 <p> I was lucky enough to spend 3 months in Broome , working with one of the camel companies &amp; seeing a different , amazing , sunset every night .

I 've seen the sun set in about 7 of the places you mentioned above and they were just stunning , especially in Byron Bay ( where I sat near a bunch of people playing bongos as the sun went down and then went and danced with them and their friends ! ) and The Twelve Apostles which was such a magical place to see the sunset . <p> Wonderful collection of sunset , its always wonderful to watch the sunset . I would love to go Twelve Apostles and Gantheaume Point , specially to watch a sunset . As Its looking quite stunning . Thanks for sharing = <p> Love that the NT takes up so many spots !

I had a job once where I had 3 weeks paid vacation and asked for one unpaid so I could go to NZ for the month . Luckily I was asking while they were giving me the job offer . It was such a big deal to them and in the end the extra week did n't  make a difference to anyone at the office . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job . I had to do that when I was renewing for my next year of teaching in the States . I said I could only stay on if I could have two weeks off as my brother was getting married in South Africa . Lucky they said yes . <p> I asked my employer for six weeks off to travel and got to do it two timesfrom the same employer . I was certain both times that I was going to be turned down , but I was surprised when they said I could . I feel very lucky that I got that flexibility from them since I 'm also American and I know that getting time off like that is near impossible . However , after my second trip they said that if I plan another one , to just quit . I thought I would try my luck with my next employer and they flat out said no . Like you said , it does n't  hurt to ask . <p> I took almost this exact approach when we went to Indonesia in 2005 . We wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't get that time off . So I asked for 3 months off instead . My boss denied 3 months but agreed to 2 months , which was exactly what we wanted anyway . Always ask for more than you really want . My wife is Indonesian so I sold it to the company as my wife needed to see her family and we always do things as a family . Of course I had great co-workers who were willing to cover for me while I was out . I also asked for the time off 5 months in advance . <p> With our current plans for taking a whole year off I am not sure if I am going to be able to persuade them to allow me to come back . This may be too much time away for them to deal with . I 'm certainly going to try . <p> I like how you asked for more time in order to get what you want- a master negotiator .

This way I got more time off = and I protected my salary history . Its amazing what you can get just by asking . <p> In Spain you have to pretty much quit your job to do that . The argument , from the company side , is that it is complicated for the company to manage the " soc-ial se-curity-- tax the employer has to pay the governemnt per employee . In other words , even if they don-t pay your salary , if you are still an employee they have to pay the governemnt the So.sec part . <p> I think it is ridiculous particularly when someone is burned out after working 5 years at the same company <p> Good advice ; Ive done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no , " and I ended up looking for another job .

In case you missed it , we are honored to be invited to The White House as one of the world 's top 100 travel influences . <p> Lots of Aussies want to head to the US at Christmas time , and lots of Aussies travel from Perth to Sydney or vice versa at this time of year . High demand equals high prices . <p> We thought we were going to be screwed with the cost of flights at this time of year , and were looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as much as we anticipated . <p> Before we go into how we worked it all out , it 's essential you have a notepad at the ready to record all your information and run through several scenarios . You will forget and if it 's not clear , you 'll be having to go back to searching again . <p> On your notes record : <p> Booking site / airline <p> Route <p> Times / date of flights <p> Costs <p> Layover times <p> Because Craig had saved up 150,000 frequent flyer points with Qantas they were our preferred carrier for the Sydney to D.C leg . And because we both had a few Virgin Australia points , they were our preferred choice between Perth and Sydney . <p> But we still had to run the numbers to make sure ! <h> Here 's how we saved money on flights to the USA <h> 1 . Got clear on our needs and purpose <p> It 's not always about getting the cheapest flight , it 's about the best value to suit your needs . <p> Were flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents , then to D.C and Raleigh , North Carolina . As it 's a long journey , were looking at 52 hours flying time there and back , we wanted to make it worthwhile and spend a bit of time in the States visiting our old home and friends in Raleigh . Since it 's so close to D.C , it was the perfect chance . <p> Craig and I still hold a dream in our heart to move back to Raleigh . This is an opportunity for us to see if it 's just a nostalgic longing or truth and how we can make it work if it is . <p> We also want to leverage our time in the US and meet with potential business partners for our blog and have a few meetings scheduled . <p> As it 's a short two-week trip and long flights we wanted to take the most direct route possible for the best price . <h> 2 . Get realistic about our plans <p> We originally hoped to add on a side-trip to New York City . Because New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan Fields from The Good Life Project in person ! He 's such an inspiration to us an such a great guy . I chatted to him recently in a phone interview and he was keen to meet in real life . <p> But , after running the numbers and evaluating our goals , we realized our NYC goal was too wild . It was going to cost us way too much ( yeah New York over the festive season ) and would drain our energy . Think running around being a tourist . This trip was n't really about us being tourists . We 've been doing that for the past 14 months . <p> Plus , we 've done New York for Christmas before , and this trip was about business and catching up with beloved friends . <h> 3 . Try multiple scenarios <p> We were going to fly straight to D.C. for the event , and then , either fly to Raleigh or our friend Hitesh was going to come pick us up form D.C. We decided to investigate possibly flying into Raleigh and then either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We had to run through each scenario taking into account price and time . <h> 4 . Try different routes <p> From Sydney , we can fly to the States on Qantas via Los Angeles or Dallas . <p> I hate LAX with a passion and wanted to avoid flying through there . At first we just ran the numbers through Dallas . But , then we thought we better check LAX . Bummer dude . It was cheaper , and by enough to warrant flying through there . <h> 5 . Be flexible on dates and times <p> Originally we thought we were locked in with dates as we were flying direct to D.C. and the summit was on the 9th . So we were looking at flights a couple of days before this . <p> But , upon noticing that flights a week earlier were cheaper , we decided we could fly straight to Raleigh for a few days first , and then either rent a car or fly from there . <p> Also be flexible over your times of flights as prices can fluctuate quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you time your layovers and connecting flights right . <h> 6 . Go direct to airlines <p> We originally priced our flights on Qantas to go direct to the States and then we used search engines to find cheap flights from Dallas to Raleigh/D.C , and LAX to Raleigh/D.C . <p> At last minute , we decided to check booking a flight direct from Sydney to Raleigh/D.C through Qantas . We were shocked to discover going direct all the way through a Qantas booking was cheaper " and less hassle ! <h> 7 . Use frequent flyer points <p> Our favourite way of getting free , or cheaper , flights . <p> We have an American Express Business credit card through the Commonwealth Bank which gives us up to 3 Qantas points for every dollar we spend . We use this card for all our business expenses and over time it accumulates nicely , plus we 've gained points from taking other reward flights over the years . <p> Do not use this strategy if you ca n't pay off your credit card balance in full each month , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Qantas and Virgin , the most with Qantas so we knew that was the carrier we wanted to fly to the States with . They are our preferred airline anyway . There 's also a chance for us to be upgraded to business with Qantas ( fingers crossed ) which made flying with them even more attractive . <p> Craigs 150,000 Qantas points is enough to get him from Sydney to D.C and back using their calculator , BUT all the seats using " just points " were booked out months ago . So he had to use points + pay . In the end he still saved $1,200 off his flight which is a big help ! <p> We are jealous of the amazing frequent flyer programs in the States . If this applies to you , you should start researching how to tap into this . <h> 8 . Get on the phone <p> We were having difficulty getting an accurate cost using our frequent flyer points , so to be sure we were n't going to mess it up we phoned Qantas and Virgin for advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and how we could best use our points . Sometimes getting on the phone can save you a lot of time and frustration . <h> 9 . Use flight search engines <p> We only have enough Virgin points for Craig and I from Perth to Sydney . So we have to pay for our two kids on that leg , and all four of us on the return Sydney to Perth flight . <p> So we checked all the search engines for those flights plus my Sydney to the US flight , plus the domestic US flights . It becomes a headache with all the combinations and timing of connections , but it can be worth it . <p> By searching Hipmunk we saved $100 over all the other search engines on our Sydney to Perth flight . Were now flying with Jetstar on this leg . And Hipmunk were cheaper than by going direct to the Virgin or Jetstar website we will be trying them on every trip from now on ! <h> 10 . Check car rental prices <p> After all that , we then had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us some great tips on their preferred car rental companies . <p> The best we found was hiring it for the two weeks was cheaper than flying to D.C. It does involve a five hour drive , but really when you add in all the time you have to spend waiting at airports now , it wo n't take us that much longer . ( As long as D.C traffic is okay , which 10 years ago it was n't ! ) <h> Our final flight plans to the USA <p> After all this we ended up with the following : <p> Perth &gt; Sydney with Virgin : $600 ( x 2 kids ) <p> As mentioned Craig and I got free flights using Virgin points and we had to pay for the girls . The red eye ( 11.30pm flight ) was the cheapest flight we could get and it saved us one nights accommodation in Sydney on our connecting flights . Flying into Sydney early in the morning meant we could get a flight out of Sydney that afternoon to the States . <p> The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAX is a freaking shocker for this , and we 've never flown through Dallas before . But as its on the one carrier I 'm hoping they know what they 're doing ! <p> Craig got over $1,200 off this flight with his frequent flyer points . As it 's a busy time of the year he could n't get a full points only flight , otherwise it would have been completely free . I used my 30,000 Qantas points + pay to save a few hundred dollars . <p> As you can see we had a lot of different scenarios and numbers to run and this took us a couple of days to get it right . <p> If you 're looking at getting the best price for your flights , you will have to do this , especially if you have a long and complicated flight path like we did .

@@21820930 @1820930/ <h> Why I love Elephants <p> Before travelling to Africa , dolphins were always my favourite animal . I loved their sense of joy and gentle , peaceful spirit that emanates from them . I still love them very much , but now I have a deep affection for elephants . This comes from spending a lot of time in their vicinity on the various safaris we went on in the game parks of- Africa . I would spend hours watching them in their family units and learning so much from them. - <p> This is why I love elephants so much and feel they are some of the wisest animal species on our planet . <h> Elephants love deeply and are passionate about life <p> Daily Travel Photo : Addo Elephant Park , South Africa <p> Elephants live in a strong family unit . The mothers are so- protective of their babies and spend all day teaching and loving them . They band together to shield their young if they feel danger is present . <p> Addo Elephant Park <p> They are highly social animals and meet every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They cry when a family member dies and they mourn their death every year on their anniversary . <p> Having a mud bath together <p> Mummy leading baby to her bath <p> Theyre playful and fun and hug trunks when meeting each other at the waterhole . <p> Greeting <h> Elephants Never Forget <p> They 'll remember you <p> I love this so much about elephants and can relate to it a lot . Never forgetting can have its really bad points , but at the same time it shows fierce loyalty . I know I never forget when someone shows the same loyalty to me . <p> A game ranger friend of ours told us a fascinating story of the family of elephants who lived in the Addo Elephant game park . Over 100 years ago the borders of the park were much bigger than what they are now ; the shrinking borders were due to the increased poaching of the elephants . As numbers in Addo are now increasing the park borders were extending out again . <p> Fierce and loyal <p> This extension of the borders now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more . As soon as this happened a herd of elephants found their way into the cemetery and smashed up every single gravestone bar one . That one gravestone was the only one that did not belong to a poacher . <p> Over 100 years later the elephants finally got their revenge- the energy of it was passed down through their DNA . They have a mystical connection to the Earth . This is what frightened me so much about them yet I loved how loyal they were and would not forget those they love . <p> Addo <p> On the anniversary of a loved one 's death they return to the exact spot of their death on the exact day to mourn which also demonstrates the- wisdom and connectedness- they have to the spirit world or world of energy . <p> How do they know this ? They do n't  have calendars or watches . They know more secrets then we do , that 's for sure . You feel it in their presence . <h> They have a commanding presence <p> Elephants command your attention , more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blase about the animals in the game parks of Africa as you see them in such abundance . But not the elephants . Every time they are around , you are sitting up straight in your car , with the gears engaged and your foot ready to put some pedal to the medal . <p> Are you quick with a gear shift ? <p> Elephants help you to become very aware of your surroundings . You ca n't help but look and watch their every move . That slow , steady gait of theirs will deceive you into thinking they are lacking in power and speed . And then one starts to run towards you in your car and you become aware of the squashing power they have . Lucky for you they skip on by gaily to meet up with their friends on the other side of the road . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> A big post Caz ! Unless we get to control poaching then we are n't  going to see many of these in years to come . In Chad and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when they have gone , the poaching criminal syndicates will move to other countries . All to fuel the demand for ivory in Asia , mainly China . Reports also suggest that poaching has increased in areas where Chinese road building is going on in Africa . <p> Elephants are absolutely wonderful creatures ! I 've always felt this strong , almost spiritual connection with them , as odd as that may sound . I once looked into volunteering at an Elephant Sanctuary in Thailand someday I hope I get to do it ! <p> Elephants seem quite human , lovable , intriguing , and dangerous . Its all the great things about an animal we can relate to but also dangerous and big enough that we are intrigued and a little in awe/frightened . <p> I hope that there will be elephants left for our children to marvel at . At the rate they are being killed by poachers it seems unlikely that the species will survive . Thanks for giving us all reasons to love them even more ! <p> To help fight the elephant slaughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conservation of Africa 's wildlife and ecosystems . <p> I love elephants ! This really made me smile . They are so special and have always been my favorite animal . Sometimes when I look at pictures of them my eyes start to tear up . I do n't  even know why . I just really love them . At a ghetto zoo i visited in college , there were 2 of them just standing in this little pen . The only thing that kept them in was a single chain . I got kicked out of that zoo because i went in and pet them . It was really special ( and i 'm sure in most books , completely stupid ) and they were happy to have some love . Of course my mother was ready to kill me when I told her what I did that day and I know it makes me sound like a crazy nut bag but it just felt right . They are such beautiful , beautiful creatures . Its like you see centuries in their eyes . <p> Yes ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all etched over their wrinkly skin as well . Theyre beautiful creatures . I used to get so upset seeing the small elephant being walked around of an evening around Kho Sahn Road . I would always stop to hug it gently and give it a kiss . Its eyes always looked so sad . <p> I also love elephants . Last year when I went to Thailand , I was able to go to one of the elephant parks . I was able to ride and feed them ( and sit in their legs with their trunks around my neck ! ! ) . It was an incredible experience . Of course you had the opportunity to see them in their natural habitat where a lot of them roam freely . <p> Beautiful photos . I get all you say about elephants . When you see into their eyes , you see something you do n't  see in other animals . <p> Ill never forget the day i saw my first elephant in the wild . Many years ago now , but still vividly etched into my memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large bull approaching the vehicle a little blurred . If they want you to move , then whose gunna argue . <p> Nice post idea ! Elephants are just such fascinating creatures ! ! You bring up some really interesting points , like how they mourn the deaths of their loved ones . I agree that they know more of the secrets than us . I cant wait to see them in the wild one day ! <p> I love elephants sense of community values , too . The way the older females group together to raise and care for the little ones , and the babies sense of playfulness , too . Thanks for the lovely pictures . There really is nothing quite like seeing elephants in the wild : something we 've done in Africa and Asia , and awe-inspiring wherever you do it . <p> I recently fell in love with elephants on a trip to Thailand . They were working elephants that werent really wild , but so intelligent , kind , magnificent and delightful . I got a big kiss from an elephant and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a vacuum hose ) . I love your post . <p> I too have come under the spell of the elephants . A few years ago in Botswana I had a solitary up close &amp; personal experience with a lone elephant . It was a magical one hour . I 've had the pleasure of seeing them in the wild in Tanzania and Namibia too but a real highlight was a trip to the elephant orphanage in Nairobi this fall . Elephants from 1 year to several years are looked after before being returned to the wild ( at least that is the goal ) . They behaved like a bunch of bad assed kids . Trainers are with them 24/7 and everything seems geared to the happiness of the elephants . There have been lots of TV programs about this place . For more info people can Google the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust . <p> Elephants to me are wonderful animals . I 've only in my lifetime , seen and fed them in the zoo but youve only got to watch the way these huge heavy creatures gracefully walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation . <p> They are such beautiful and gentle creatures . They may seem/look intimidatingdue to their sizebut they are known to be very gentle when they are not threatened by those who do n't  respect their environments . I have always had a soft spot for elephants . Not sure exactly why ? But this post does a great job at confirming they are truly magnificent animals we should focus on preserving their livelihoods.

Thanks for you time = <p> We went through an employment agency based in Broome . We had to have an interview , and pass a physical test . Unfortunately the farms are no longer operational in Broome because of the GFC . I believe there are only some now off Darwin and I am not sure how you will go about it there . Just do a bit of research online and see what you can find . <p> i 'm Colin from Ireland , i am moving to Broome in just over 2 weeks to meet a friend from home living there , we would both love to do the hard working adventure that is pearl farming , do you have any advise on how to get work for a company such as Paspaley ? we are both hard working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for finding us ! We can help point you in the right direction . As long as you have work visas you should be fine to work out on the farms , and if you are used to physically demanding work then you will have a good chance . There are lots of people wanting to get out there so you may have to wait awhile , or you could get lucky like we did and get straight out there . Most companies out there recruit through agencies which can be found in the Broome town centre . Pas are the biggest company but there are lots of smaller ones there in case you ca n't land a job there . With the global financial crisis there has been a downturn in the number of jobs out there . You will also need to make sure you let them know you are keen to work for a few months at least as there is a high turnover there . I 'm pretty sure you also need to have your first aid certificate .

Thanks for all of the lovely blogging that keeps so many of us inspired as we work toward our travel dreams ! <p> You are welcome Zoe . It is always better to arrive in Broome to find the pearling work . Those in the town always get preference over positions just because of the reliability factor . BUT , my brother was telling me the other day how badly the pearling industry has been hit by the GFC . Paspaley is now the only pearling company in operation there and they are struggling .

Not much later , he asked me to be his Driver for 3 weeks as he was hosting a " little thing " with " some friends " .

No matter who you were , he allowed you to feel equal .

@@21820932 @1820932/ <h> Visiting an Akha Hill Tribe Villiage in Chiang Rai , Thailand <p> I 'm not sure why sometimes it takes me so long to write about certain places I have been to . <p> Over a year ago I visited Baan Huay Kee Lek , an ethnic Akha village perched on the top of a mountain in the Chiang Rai province of Thailand . I knew as soon as we drove up the dusty and windy dirt track to the village we were in for a treat . <p> Isolated , authentic and free from groups of tourists ( except for our small group of writers ) . <p> Visiting hill tribe people in Thailand is a popular experience for travellers and many of the hill tribe villages are said to be losing their identity to the tourism industry . <p> We were the first tourists to visit- Huay Kee Lek . The villagers had only recently decided to welcome in the gawkers and in an effort to not lose themselves to them created a counsel to manage it as a community based tourism project . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , values and lifestyle whilst conserving the value of the individual culture and environment . Visitors can stay overnight or join the rural people in their daily lives in an effort to increase understanding and respect for each other . <p> This form of tourism allows the villagers to maintain their traditional skills , control the tourism income , pursue their normal life and preserve their cultural and natural heritage . <p> The details of my time here are quite sketchy . It was in the middle of a trip where I experienced so many amazing things . Of course , I had my notebook , where I recorded the intricate details including that of my observations and thoughts . <p> My notebook is what helps me recall most stories that I tell . Every now and then disaster strikes and no matter how many lounge cushions you upend and desk drawers you empty out , you just cant find the notebook that helps tell the story ! <p> Lucky for me , a few major things stick out in my mind still and I have some incredible photos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the authenticity of village life in Huay Kee Lek , many Akha villagers ride motorbikes into Chiang Rai during the day to work in factories , government positions and private businesses .

The traditional garments you see are reserved for special occasions , special visitors or for those who continue living in the traditional manner . <p> Village life still continues in much the same way as it has for years , except modern life is creeping in slowly . And this is fine , evolution happens everywhere . <p> We saw the mix of old and new with women weaving grass and drying beans in the sun , taxi drivers lazing about on bamboo platforms and young soldiers standing around in groups laughing and chatting . <p> Pigs and roosters ran round our feet and children played in the dirt in their backyards or under their homes built on wooden stilts . <p> Whiling away the hours <p> Drying beansJust another lazy lizard day <p> Our guide , in his broken English and with help from our Go Green Thailand guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the sacred village Akha swing , used for special celebrations . <p> Late August every year , at the peak of the rainy season , the colourful Akha people celebrate a four day festival in their villages .

Its a joyful time as they show respect and gratitude to their ancestors who bless them with abundance . <p> Its also marks the rite of passage for Akha girls passing into womanhood , who dress in the colourful traditional dress of the Akha people and let their hair down swinging wildly through the air on the rickety swing . <p> Akha swing- Would you swing on it ? <h> The People <p> Beautiful elder .

They just cooked it up and ate it amongst the stir-fry veggies ! ! <p> I thought it was amazing to see western clothes on most of the children when you have to hike for so many hours into the hills to arrive at the villages . But then our guide did say a few of the men the villages often have small motorbikes that they ride along the walking trails to nearby towns to get some supplies . <p> We too visited a hill tribe in Thailand , in the Doi Inthanon national park , and had a really lovely experience .

Infection could be a real problem with a scrape in the jungle lucky there was a medicine doctor to treat the wound = <p> I think visits to the hill tribe villages in northern Thailand can be great cultural experiences for all kinds of travellers families , solo , friends , couples , young travellers , etc . I also think they 're problematic though . <p> Sometimes they can be well-managed community based projects . Sometimes they can be more like human zoos with outside operators exploiting the situation and taking most/all the money .

( Yes , I 've visited multiple villages too ! ) It just helps to be conscientious about our impact as travellers and to tread carefully when exploring all the cultural and natural wonders that Thailand and other countries offer . <p> P.S. While I have n't been to any hill tribe villages in Mae Sruay , I have been to a Thai village there . The surroundings were absolutely beautiful gorgeous vibrant green rice paddies , wooden houses , hills in the distance . There 's also a great little restaurant on top of the Mae Sruay Dam very picturesque views . Not necessarily worth a trip on its own , but if you happen to be in the area gorgeous . <p> I know two Western guys who between them have lived in Northern Thailand for over 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill tribe children . They have told me a lot about the human zoo hill tribe villages where the people are almost prisoners and benefit very little from the tourist hordes who pay to gawk at them . I need to find a tour I can be sure is ethical before I will visit so will check out Go Green Thailand , thanks for that tip . <p> I 've visited settlements for ( mostly ) Shan people displaced from Burma to bring them rice and milk and that 's an eye opener . They live in such poverty and work in such dangerous conditions with pesticides on the plantations growing oranges . I 've also worked on a small project helping disabled people in a hill tribe village ravaged by methamphetamine and HIV . I tend to think these experiences , though not photo-friendly for tourists who want pretty pictures , are more representative of the situation for many hill tribes than most of the authentic hill tribe tours . <p> I agree I am married to a ahka woman ans have lived in her village with out tourist .

And to get there you suggested we go up the mountain on the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway , and then come back down on the Kuranda Scenic Railway . <p> You can do it the other way around , but the thinking behind this strategy was three-year-old Savannah would fall to sleep on the way down to the rocking of the old train . <p> Sounds good in theory , but she 's a stubborn one our little girl .

People-friendly <p> Rajasthan 's hospitality is its iconic trademark , but even its friendliness is so off-the-cuff . <p> I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Diwali and it was all so fervent . I received smiles , amiable gestures and support while I was taking pictures and exchanging casual pleasantries with the hawkers . People 's inherent warmth instantly melted my hesitation as a solo traveler. <h> 2. - Festive atmosphere <p> Desert in Rajasthan <p> Rajasthan is a land of festivals . There are so many held annually such as the Desert Festival , Pushkar Fair , Elephant Festival , Gangaur Festival , Marwar Festival and Nagaur Festival just to name a few . <p> Also , the atmosphere in general is very festive . When I was in Jodhpur there were traditional folk dance and music performances held at the hotel every evening . <h> 3 . Good accommodation options <p> Lake Palace Hotel <p> When you are traveling solo , good accommodation is a top concern . Rajasthan has all kinds of options to choose from " luxury hotels , guest houses , heritage resorts , budget hotels and home stays . Apart from comfort and amenities , the hotels give you great hospitality and a true Rajasthan ' experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleys <p> Although Rajasthan is a highly conservative state , the locals respect a visitor 's individuality . If a woman is rambling all alone in any city of Rajasthan , she would be respected for who she is and her background . <p> Even if she is from a different culture or follows a totally different way of life , she would n't draw attention . The locals in general know that they have to receive each guest with reverence . <h> 5. - Personal space <p> Mehrangarh Fort <p> Although people are friendly , they give you space to do your own thing . <p> I remember when I was in Jaisalmer , I found my own little corner where I sat with my laptop to catch up on work . There was another foreign girl there too , curled up with a book , while another guy was sunbathing . Thus , the feeling of being in Rajasthan is very homey. <h> 6 . Variety of things to see and do <p> Mehrangarh Fort Jodhpur <p> Every nook and cranny in the cities of Rajasthan are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments were people-watching and strolling along Lake Pichola in Udaipur , dining at Ambrai restaurant and bar with a view of the Lake Palace , catching a panoramic view of Udaipur , watching the sunset at Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur , and wandering the alleys of Jaisalmer Fort . <h> 7 . Ideal for slow travel <p> Golden Fort in Jaisalmer <p> I learned the art of slow travel in Rajasthan , as I did n't feel the need to do typically touristy things all the time . <p> I chose to skip a monument or two and happily relaxed at my hotel in Jodhpur , chatted with the staff , explored the nearby market , observed the local life , woke up before the hotel staff one morning to catch the first glimpse of sunrise and enjoyed a cup of tea with my fellow travelers. <h> 8 . Pick-up service by hotels <p> Udaipur Fatehsagar Lake <p> The best thing that happened to me in Rajasthan was to be received by one of the hotel staff at the train station . Most of the hotels in Rajasthan offer free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts you at ease to simply be escorted to your hotel , while you are solo . <h> 9 . Free WiFi <p> Who would n't care for the free internet available in your hotel room ? <p> There is free WiFi in almost all the hotels in Rajasthan . It makes things easier , especially when you are traveling solo and you need to keep in touch with people at home . I enjoyed updating my friends and family with the latest pictures and happenings on my trip . <h> 10 . Safe and inviting <p> Sunset over the Blue City in Jodhpur <p> Although I do n't like to categorize places as safe or unsafe , Rajasthan is relatively safe . <p> I traveled to the desert all on my own from Jaisalmer . Comprehending my anxiety , the chauffeur took good care of me , and even the camel riders and the desert camping staff were so caring .

I got free WiFi even in a small town like Jaisalmer ( Rajasthan ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hotel staff everywhere is very accommodating and respectful . <p> I am a photographer . I am planning to goto Rajasthan in October i am quiet scared and excited as this would be my first solo trip . Your post was rally helpful . It would really help if you could share the name of that particular Hotel in Jaisalmer in which you stayed . And if its not too much , the other hotels in the other cities too . And if they are budget hotels ? <p> This is all very true . Before moving to India I backpacked here starting off with one month in Rajashtan . I got free hotel pick up , Wi-Fi , and more personal space as well as less stares than central and south India . <p> Rajasthan is one of the places in the world that I most want to go to . I really enjoyed this article because I had previously thought it would be a challenging place to travel around , and there 's a good chance I 'll be travelling alone when I go there . <p> How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for someone like me who prefers slow travel , visiting fewer places but experiencing them in greater detail ? <p> Bonny , I am glad you enjoyed the article . = As far as the number of days needed are concerned , its all up to you . You may spend a week in Udaipur , because there is so much to explore around it . One thing you must know that Rajasthan is a big state , so if you wish to cover more than two cities you need good 10-15 days . <p> If you are visiting Ajmer to visit the the famous shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti , then Ambassador Hotel is the place to stay . It offers the best rooms and services at affordable rates , and is only a stone 's throw away from the holy shrine . <p> Thank you for your fascinating blog ! My partner and I have booked to go to India for 1 month end of July to August . We are flying to Delhi and we were thinking of trekking to the Valley of the Flowers and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be enough . What are your recommendations ? Thank you ! <p> I recently visited rajasthan it is superb place photography really awesome.as renukha told us.i am just planning for going back . I did take one visiting card from rishabh safa for buy headwrapes ( Turban ) i just bought from http : //www.rishabhsafa.com really feeling like i am in rajasthan jodhpur we can wear this as wedding turban party and occasions festivals.Every one should onece visit this website . <p> awesome for seeing royalty of Rajasthan. thanks for sharing this . Explore more come to see chittorgarh The grandest estate of Royal Rajputana ( old name of rajsthan ) . <p> The charm of Chittorgarh goes beyond its immense history and traditions . There 's nature , beauty , royalty and much more to it . With so much to offer , a trip to this historical town is a must for every one ! <p> I loved Rajasthan it instilled a love of India in me I need to return one of these days ! As you say , there is so much to see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found everyone to be respectful but would advise solo travellers to cover up and be respectful back as you will find so many more doors are opened to you . Happy travels . <p> Rajasthan is perfect place for every tourist . In Rajasthan you can explore heritage , wild , pilgrimage and d dessert tour . Palace and dessert is main attraction of Rajasthan . Ajmer is my favorite city in Rajasthan state . <p> Dear Renuka , Thanks for your article it urges me to try for a solo trip to Rajasthan as you described it as a peaceful place to travel otherwise where one can find a safe and peaceful travel place in a third world countries . I am sure gon na list this place for my next vacation . <p> Hi Renuka , Felt great after reading your blog on Rajasthan . After a lot of deliberation I have managed to gather the guts for a solo trip which I have been wanting to do for some time . And like you , even I have always been fascinated with Rajasthan . However I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shortlist one place . Any recommendations or guidance would be most appreciated , since I am a bit lost right now . Hoping to hear from you . Regards Rasika <p> Hello , Thanks for sharing such a fantastic blog.I really appreciate your blog to share information about Rajasthan Visiting in Rajasthan is amazing experience.Royal Rajasthan is not only the the land of Kings but also famous in tourist destinations in all over the India . Rajasthan is only one of the place where tourists can enjoy with many of things such as culture , civilizations , history , fairs &amp; festivals , Songs &amp; dances , food , forts , temples , lakes , hills and natural beauty with adventure tours . best blog <p> Hi Renuka , Thanks for sharing such a wonderful reasons why Rajasthan is perfect place for solo travelers . I have visited Jaipur &amp; Jaisalmer last year and truly admired the hospitality over there . From Hotel Staff to local vendors and Restaurant Staff to Tourist Guide every one welcomes you from open heart and not a single person will try to cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India has never been high on my list . However , am off there for work ( Pune ) and going to take a week to explore and a friend sold me on Rajasthan . You , have made me even more excited for it ! Thank you ! <p> I recently visited Rajasthan with my family . We feel that this place is unconditional love for travel . We feel amazed to gazing their architectural complex . Heritage place everyone must visit at least once . awesome and very useful content thanks , Renuka. 
@@21820943 @1820943/ <h> I Do n't  Own Anything <p> And I feel like- a giant failure who is walking a path to nowhere . I start to think how I 've let myself and my family down . The vortex of disempowering emotions start to swallow me into the sinkhole before my mind screams , <h> Reality check ! <p> Just keep breathing . <h> Focus on what you do have . <p> My little girl may not have sparkly stars on her ceiling or every toy ever made , but she wears a pretty consistent smile on her face . She lights up any room she walks in . Shes very intelligent and creative . Shes spunky , funny and loving . We tell each other every day how much we love each other . Shes just as excited as us to go to Thailand , to Disneyland , and to see the animals in Africa . <p> A baby , almost here , who is healthy and I 'm sure will light up the room more than any Eveready battery charged toy . <p> A loving husband and father who lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need it and leans on me when he does . A constant reminder that you can be , do , have , whatever you want and you are not alone in trying to get it . I 'm safe in knowing I am part of a team . <p> My family <p> I may not have a couch that I own , but the warmth of the hammock wrapped around my body , from the shores of Thailand and Zanzibar and the mountains of Laos , lingers on my skin . <p> I may not own my bed , but the awe I felt at seeing the curvature of the night sky filled with a thousand dancing stars as Craig and I lay on the sand in Koh Lanta gazing and dreaming is imprinted into my memory forever . <p> I may not have the latest luxury model car , but the lessons from bumpy pick up truck rides and overcrowded African mini vans rides to remind me that it is never the outer shell that matters but the journey that brings you to that far distant destination . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " retirement " future , but I have infinite wealth in each moment that I have lived in the present and experienced life for what it means now , not waiting until its the right time to live it . <p> I may not own the latest wardrobe or fashion accessories , but I have a simple beaded torquoise bracelet from the Masai who taught me that life should be lived in the custom that suits you , and a red warrior blanket that carries the message to be fearless in your attainment of that life . <p> Be fearless <p> The more I stop to think of what I do n't  own , the reality of what I truly do have begins to diminish that dark terror that lingers to tell me I am a failure . <h> What is the best thing that you own ? 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> What a brilliant attitude to have . I love the examples . They really bring it home . You do n't  just think it , you feel it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on our time , I think it will be our experiences and the people we shared them with that will generate the most joy and feeling . Not the materials we picked up along the way . <p> If you do n't  own anything I would reckon this means you do n't  have any debt either . = <p> Sometimes I think its better to be the hobo who is beholden to no one instead of the guy with a leased BMW in his driveway and a $300,000 mortgage he ca n't possibly pay . I 'm the hobo in case you were wondering . = <p> Debt is a killer ! ! There is nothing that will enslave you more . We are just climbing our way out of it and I hate that I made dumb choices that enslaved me so . Love being a hobo ! ! My brother has never had a single debt in his life and he is the most free person I know . Travelling for about 16 years and has the most amazing stories and is just so free and happy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It took me a while to between car payments , my college loan and my credit card , but one day I made my very last payment and that was it ! Right on the 4th of July too , of ALL days . = I refuse to get into debt for any other reason again , except maybe for a house if need be , but I wo n't even get a new car unless I have enough cash for it . Its better to live on what you actually have than how much you 're able to borrow . <p> Very smart moves Lincoln . We used to make smart decisions like this , and will be from now on . I guess everything happens for the lesson . I love how you paid it off on July 4 ! ! Independence Day alright ! <p> Thanks , it took some sweating but I saw if I finished a few months eartl I could pay it off right on that day and sure enough I celebrated my own Independence Day . = I know you will too , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! <p> Jacs13 <p> 6 years ago <p> Amazing article ! Such true words ! Sometimes I too , suffer from this . Especially since the majority of my friends are driving SuVs and renovating their bedrooms in the newest styles according to some show on tv that tells them what to do . You are what I have always aspired to be , you 're an inspiration ! All the best to your family too ! <p> Thanks so much ! ! That 's why Keeping up with the Joneses is such a devastating part of our society . We look at what others have and devalue ourselves if we do n't  have the same . That leads us on a path of debt and unhappiness . Focus instead on what brings you joy and live that . <p> This article is just what I needed to pop into my mail tonight . I have been struggling with the thought of selling the remaining things my son and I have left from the loss of a life we had with my husband who passed away in 04 , to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We no longer fit into the norm of the life we once had , and our old friends are busy with their intact families doing what we once did as a full unit with my husband . My son and I love to travel and explore wildlife , and places full of culture , as this brings us both a smile to our faces and peace in our hearts . The other side is I do worry , that a life without the stability of a home base and our things we will have to sell , or leave behind would be a mistake in one way , but a tragedy not to in another . You sound like you have some regrets , but mostly not . I just hope if I were to do this , it would be nothing but a new box of memories like yours that belong to just my son and me . Thanks for sharing these words and thoughts of yours . Sincerely , Mary <p> I 'm so happy Mary that the email popped in at the right time ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and live those dreams . it is scary giving up the world that you have known for so long and embarking on a new one . But if you feel in your heart that it is right , then it is and it will only turn out in the best way . Your son will gain so much from it . As long as you have a smile on your face and peace in your heart then your life is well lived . <p> i 'm with you when you said you own those great memories = like you i do n't  own anything of value anymore except for the adventures that ive had , the current wandering that i 'm doing and the zest for life that couldnt be replaced by anything = great post Caz ! <p> Not owning anything means freedom . I still own a few things , no furniture or anything big like that , and also trying to get rid most of it . The less you own , the easier it is to do explore the world , but yes of course we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we must own more and more things . <p> But , like with you , it is the memories that I have which have made me who I am today , not the things I own . <p> Gosh yes ! The memories and experiences are what make you who you are . There is no car on earth that could ever have helped me grow like my experiences are have . That is why I crave so many more of them . I just want to keep learning and growing and living . That is where the fun is . <p> Was just thinking about this todayso many of my friends are moving up in their jobs , buying houses , etc. and I feel a bit left behind ! Mostly because my priorities have shiftedIm not nearly as stylish because I do n't  have as many clothes , and I 'm not as available because I do n't  own a car . But I love the freedom that I have to do whatever I want and the feeling that I could pick up and go anywhere with just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I do keep : I always ship an envelope with any postcards and letters I 've received hometheyre up on my wall right now ! Those are my fun little memories from friends that I always enjoy looking through = <p> I think once you start travelling you live freedom and you become so addicted to it . You realize there is no better place to live from . That is why it is so difficult to settle back down to a normal life because it restricts you again , and you feel like you cant breathe . You start to resent those materialistic things as you just see them as stealing that freedom away from you . <p> A computer to read inspirational posts like this one . Is that too corny ? What I mean is that one of the things I value most is the ability to connect with people and to have my life view altered for the better by what they share . Thanks for writing such a beautiful reminder of what really matters ! <p> Ha Ha . Not corny at all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . First , because it is the means for me to do what I love , here on my blog , which gives me so much happiness and second because it does connect you with so many people and so many inspiring things . <p> Such a beautiful outlook on life . I do n't  think it hurts to feel frustrated at times . Its often during those times that we really take a close look at what we do have and what 's really important . I 'm on my way to getting rid of my possessions . Its been challenging yet freeing at the same time . You provide me with much-needed inspiration . Thank you . <p> You are welcome Peggy . I totally agree that feeling frustration can be beneficial . I think any emotion we feel has its purpose , we just have to spend some time trying to find out what it is trying to teach us so we can move on from it . <p> Hi Caz ! Wonderful post . it totally struck a cord as I have recently packed cartons and cartons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now do n't  have a use for it as I leave for my year long trip soon ( in 9 days in fact ! ) . Contrary to you I do own many things , but have sadly realized most of them I did n't  really need and probably wo n't , even when i go back to my normal life . Often we get so caught up in our lives and accumulating things around us we do n't  realize how little we actually need and what 's more important- things or experiences . <p> 9 days ! ! Awesome . It is really hard to recognize our pointless all the stuff is we have in our lives . A lot of the time when we live a " normal " life , we collect so much because we are stationary and we are going about our days , getting up , going to work , coming home and doing our thing . That repetitiveness does n't  leave a lot of room for exploration or for doing those things we really love that bring us the memories and positive emotions . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that they instead bring us that meaning . Of course it is nice to have nice things , we just have to learn to not get attached to them . <p> A few years ago I wrote about this and asked which is worth more a $1 worth of experience or $1 worth of stuff ? In reality , they cost the same . Society tends to value the $1 worth of stuff , but for you , us and many people out there its the $1 of experience that so much more important and valuable to the quality of life . <p> Happy Birthday ! ! I 'm only a couple of months behind you . What 's it like over there in that space closer to 40 ? ? Freedom is so priceless . I think that is why I am eternally wandering and cant stand it when people try to tell me what to do or how I should live- freedom has always been and will be my number 1 value in life . I guess everyone has different value systems and their choices in life will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should have seen our last apartment bean bag chairs and a bar fridge . I have friends who are house owners , drive super nice cars and wear nice clothes . The thoughts can sometimes make me feel worthless but then I realize I have a much different life , with different dreams and experiences . I do n't  think I would be happier with a house , car or couch to be honest . I do love owning a passport , though = <p> I love my passport too ! ! It is really hard to not look at what others around you have and feel worthless . Its because all of what you have ca n't be seen . Its your memories . You cant really show much for that except happiness , joy all those things that everyone really should be experiencing . Just got ta keep looking at those photos and passport stamps to remind yourself <p> And the older you get the more wisdom you find in these words believe me ! The only possession I find hard ( as in seriously hard ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it as " a collection " just as books Ive collected which I want to read again . The ones I know I wont read again I do discard . I 'm thinking Kindlea Kindle would be a possession , but then so is a computer or a laptop .. and those are the things I could n't live without ! <p> Oh I hear you on the books . This is the thing Craig and I battle with the most and what ladens down our backpack while travelling . I find books give me so much though in the way of knowledge , inspiration and entertainment so I see that as being a worthwhile possession . I am getting better at getting rid of those books that I really do n't  think I 'd read again , but it used to be so hard . A computer is one possession we actually could not live without now . <p> Such a great post , Caz . Funny enough , the same exact thoughts were going through my head just last night . I had to stop myself before I 'd pull myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easy for us nomads to get ourselves down when we start analysing what material things we do n't  have or what we did n't  accomplish . But we have more , the wisdom &amp; knowledge we 've gained from traveling , accomplishing physical challenges in nature , the priceless memories , the friendships we 've made along the wayI would n't exchange it for the world ! Thanks for the uplifting and inspirational thoughts , I needed to read that . <p> That place of negativity is a dark scary place is n't it ? I think when we start comparing ourselves to others is when we really start to fall apart . We have to be so careful not to do this , but it is so hard . You have to train your brain to compare yourself to yourself and focus only on those things that bring you true joy . Only ourselves know what that is . <p> Brooke said it best- I do love owning a passport ! we do n't  own a house either , and sometimes , especially since my brother just bought his house , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents but then I breathe and know they are happy that I am happy . And right now , this is my happiness ! <p> The happiness is all that matters ! My parents still cant understand why my brother ( who earns a lot of money ) just wo n't buy a house . He is the gypsy of all gypsies . He just does not want to be a slave to a house- it is not important to him , the ability to pack up and wander whenever he feels is his priority and what makes him happy . Life is too short to live it any other way . <p> Youve written this article at the perfect time Caz ince I 'm a cross-roads in my head and life . I 'm about to go to Africa as you know and when I come back , I begin 2 years of debt-clearing and trying to make my site successful before I head to Oz and the unknownThere will be no nail polishes ( I have approx 80 lol ) , no fancy jewellery or a bookshelf worth of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know its going to be a struggle . I know that the adventures and memories will be entirely worth it but , as you say , sometimes it just gets to you . However , the only reason it gets to us is because society tells us that the way we want to live our lives is wrong . It tells us that we should be in debt with a mortgage , we should try and own the fanciest car and we should have brand clothes but in reality all you need is a smile , love and the clothes on your back = ) <p> Crossing over from the world that society expects you to live to one that is unconventional takes time . You have to train yourself to let one go and the other one in . Slowly slowly . The more you start to live life in its present state , the more you 'll start to understand that this is the only way we should be living and the only way that creates meaning in our lives . The stuff tends to fade into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk away from it all . Suddenly the smiles and the love is all that matters . Its nice to have the nice things as well , and you can still enjoy them when they come into your life , but you are not a slave to them anymore and you can easily let them come and go . <p> When I left for this trip , I left behind so many possessions back home , I expected to miss them , but the reality is that I do n't  even think about them . Experiences are infinitely more valuable than possessions = <p> Beautiful ! Though we did n't  have the guts to do this while we had kids , we finally DID do it so better late than never ! Weve met some amazing folks out in this world raising incredible children hopefully well cross your path too ! -David &amp; Veronica <p> Wonderful Caz . Another important way to look at it is .. " Nothing owns YOU . " Cars need repairs and while you wait for them , you miss out on a fun day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning , and own your time daily to do so . Instead , you are free ! = <p> I love that idea of nothing OWNS you . I can not get over the whole idea of the imprisonment that comes with cleaning . That in itself is enough to make me want to be an eternal nomad . Why on earth does anyone ever want to spend their time doing that . It is the absolute definition of Insanity <p> This is a beautiful post . I have been thinking long and hard for a good deal of time now about taking your path in life . When trying to make the decision , my mind floats to those possessions that make me feel , now , that I need them . Reading this reminds me I do NOT and reinforces what I think LIVE ! ! ! Thank you for sharing this beautiful post . <p> This is such a beautiful and inspiring post ! Its so true what you say . If we die tomorrrow we cant take our money or posessions with us , just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 and hope that in 17 years time , when I 'm your age , that I will be as rich and loaded with love as you are . I do n't  want the dress and shoes that will date next month , only family , love and memories that will last forever and ever . <p> You have the right attitude Becci for such a young age . If that is what you are determined to do then you will have those memories in 17 years time for sure . Life is what you make it ! You have so much to look forward to ! ! <p> This is a great post . When I had to get rid of it all to go travel , I realized what burden my possessions were and how little most of them mattered to me . I still own a few things , but they do not matter nearly as much to me as experiences and memories . <p> I so wish for this freedom you are all talking about , for my son and me .. but freedom certainly comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . what can one do to afford this freedom of travel ? I would really like to hear what everyone does to pay for this freedom that we all so rightfully deserve . Thanks ! M <p> After selling 90% of everything we own , we still had to put a bunch of stuff in storage Sentimental items , photo albums , the bed , and a bunch of random things we that we cant even remember . We 've already had the conversation that well probably get rid of 90% of what 's left leaving us with just the bare essentialsnot because we intend to travel perpetually , but because like many others , we have signed on to the mentality of experiences over possessions . Hands down . <p> Its funny who your idea of sentimental items changes after a time as well . Those things you once held tight to because you felt you needed the sentimental value , you realized no longer really held that , and it was just an idea you had that they did . I even find its easy for me to let go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I really need one for a post ! ! <p> Ugh . I own a house and I 'm renting it out while I 'm in Costa Rica . My tenants are leaving at the end of this month and I do n't  have a new renter lined up yet . Its a HUGE stressor . Such a weight on my shoulders that they are literally aching from the stress . I try not to think about it and pretend like all I own is my laptop , tennis gear , and clothing . = <p> Oh we understand that stress from renting out properties we once owned as well . Try not to let it burden you too much . You 'll get someone else in there . Just keep focused on that . You can travel and rent out property at the same time . If you can do it , then it really is great for you . <p> While it may be true that you do n't  own many material possessions , you most certainly own a lot of travel experiences , memories and moments that 99.99% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experience at any point in their lives . Having a chance to share travel and diverse cultures with your children will be an invaluable experience for them and will shape who they are = <p> I 'm happy that I always have that to fall back on . It takes some of the fear and worry away and makes me focus on what is really important . Happiness and joy . This is all any of us should be working towards achieving , and we all take different paths to that but it should be the ultimate goal <p> What a great read ! Having traveled for the last 3 years and been away from my family I was struggling a bit with this while I was at home hanging out with my friends that had jobs , nice phones , lives , and routines . I missed that . To be honest though I 'm making my own of all those things . I have to find my compromises when it comes to balancing a life of travel and other things that I want . <p> I think you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met you yet I just know that you are amazing at what you do and are going to make lovely little human beings out of those two little girls . here 's to Thailand ! = <p> I think finding that balance is key . There is nothing wrong with owning the nice things , its only a problem when those things prevent you from doing those things you really love . And you have to find what works for you and learn to let go of worrying about what others are doing and comparing ourselves to them . We cant wait to meet you Annie . Well get this baby of ours out and then we can meet up soon ! <p> I have more respect to people like you than someone with loads of money and never satisfied with what they have . Most people these days are like ants trying to store every inch of wealth for the future which is unknown . People like you look at the world with a very different eye . Your kids are going to be Great ! Apples do n't  fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the world with a different view . Without prejudices and with an open heart ! <p> I really love this post and all the best about your travel adventures . You guys make the best out of this world without exploiting it . <p> I think that you do have to be careful not to be too judgmental . I do own an apartment but that does n't  mean I 'm not " free , " as people say my place is paid for outright . I LOVE traveling , but I also love my job and love having a home base . I travel about five months out of the year and that 's enough for me because I also take great pleasure out of being at home with my dogs and take satisfaction out of deep friendships that I have here with people I see regularly . Just because someone has " stuff " does n't  mean that stuff makes their life any less worthwhile than yours because you travel more . I 'm not judgmental of your life , I think its great that you live that way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgmental of the millionaire on the hill who is satisfied and happy with his life owning things and not traveling . That 's his choice and if he is thrilled by his life than the rest of should n't judge him . <p> I agree , I 'm not judging anyone . I 'm talking about my life in relation to me . This is my thoughts on ownership and how it makes me feel imprisoned . Everyone is different , and everyone has different things that bring them joy . I have plenty of millionaire friends and plenty of friends who do n't  own a thing . All I care about is that everyone lives their life in a way that makes them happy . A lot of people do n't  because they are enslaved to their possessions , but I was n't even really talking about that in this piece . It was a reflection of how sometimes I feel like a failure for not owning things but then I realize all that I do really have , which makes me feel better . I write this blog to share my thoughts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same things , it is not to judge anyone . Owing things and not being able to do what I want to do makes me feel trapped . If people take that as judgement then it is like saying that I think your bad because I wrote a piece on how chocolate ice cream fulfils me more , but you think strawberry does . <p> Ive come to think that we all have phases in our lives , and those phases are appropriate at the time . I have acquired many beautiful things over the years , and enjoyed it . Now , I have begun to downsize and , trite as it sounds , I feel lighter with every trip to Goodwill ! <p> In other words , you can have fun going up a mountain , and you can have fun going down a mountain , too . <p> Its all good ( if you think it is ! ) . Best of luck with the new baby . Peace . <p> This is wonderful ! What a great post . Owning things makes me feel tied-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone with a beautiful family to boot ! who has managed to keep her ownership of things to a minimum and still sees life for what it is an incredible experience and an open-road of adventures . I hope one day , when I have a family too , to continue to live the way I am now , and this post of yours gives me confidence knowing that it is indeed possible ! You have a beautiful family . Thanks for the post , its a really great one . = <p> I love this post ( and so does everyone else from the looks of things ! ) I know people who found it really hard while travelling long term to get over the fact that travellers do n't  have possessions . I find it really liberating but it can be tough not having the security of all the things that were told make us successful like a house and a nice car . But it does n't  take long to realise that these things are n't  important . You have a gorgeous , happy family what more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to let go as we have been so ingrained in thinking that we " need " stuff and preferably better than the person next door . All i need is my family creating memories together . <p> Its truly inspiring and empowering to know that you and your family have lived this way and make it a high value to embrace freedom , adventure , and happiness . I think traveling definitely teaches you to enjoy the present with what you have , so I too , have let go of many of my possessions , because I 've found that my memories and experiences during my travels are so valuable to my happiness and freedom . <p> As a young female , it is all to easy to fall into what society wants us to do , but I hope that I can live my life the way that you do and inspire others my age to be influenced by these very important facets of life like travel , minimalism , adventure , and comfort with the present . <p> Best of luck to you , your family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to run into you someday . = <p> Thank you Noemi ! It would be great to meet up on the travelling road . It is really hard to go against the grains of societys expectations . You meet with a lot of resistance , but as you say it is important to your happiness and freedom- which are the essential parts to our life . If you do n't  have these , you do n't  have much . <p> Yes so true . Its hard when all your friends have houses , cars , " toys " ( atvs , snowmobiles ) and are living life comfortably , and you want to live that life too ; but then you want the life of travel too . And the life of travel outweighs the " stuff " . People should love people ( family/friends ) not stuff . = <p> It is really difficult Michayla , and I struggle with it a lot . But in the end I know that the greatest joy I will ever experience is traveling and exploring the world with those I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . You have to make the sacrifices for the long term gain- which is so hard to do . <p> This is truly amazing . What you are doing is giving your children a real kind of hope for the future , ensuring they will become grateful and determined adults , placing no real importance on material things . If every American lived this way , this world would be a happier and healthier place for future generations . Keep on keeping on <p> I 'm a 33 year old slacker male from India . I 'm in the same boat as you , do n't  own a damn thing . Neither house nor car . Unlike you , I do n't  have a wife or kids either . I have n't been in a relationship since at least 6 years . Most women are n't  interested in a man that has no ambition to settle down with a house , a mortgage and a shitty job . <p> That being said , I have some awesome experiences to compensate for the void in my life . I have been to over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . I 'm planning my first trip to the US next year ( wish me good luck ! ) . <p> I chose to be a drop-out in life because I was deeply pained by the superficiality of so-called regular people . They are spineless , do n't  stand by you when you need them , are constantly jealous of your success . <h> Trackbacks <p> Caz admits that she does n't  own anything , but realizes that everything she has experienced is far more valuable . Studies show that spending money on experiences tend to make people happier than purchasing things so Caz is dead on in her realization . Do n't  worry about what you do n't  have and instead rejoice in what you have experienced ! 
@@21820944 @1820944/ <p> By all means , visit these places , but try to explore a little further and deeper . The rest of America offers so much heart and soul . <p> The second thing we are always reassuring future visitors to the States about is that the people are so beautiful . <p> Most people who have not been to America have the wrong impressions of Americans . They are actually warm , hospitable and so interested in you and your life . <p> We certainly have not been everywhere in the States , but after living in North Carolina for four years and taking lots of road trips , we feel there are many places we can recommend that will give you an insight into the real America beyond the typical destinations . <h> The South <h> Charleston , South Carolina <p> Beautiful southern homes in Charleston <p> Charleston is by far one of our favourite destinations in America . It was where we would take visiting family members and often go for long weekends away whilst living in Raleigh , NC . <p> Charleston is an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so much to see and do from plantation tours , horse and carriage rides along the cobblestones streets of the city , historic home tours , and nearby islands and beaches . <h> Beaufort , South Carolina <p> Beaufort , SC <p> My Mum phoned me the other day all excited about Beaufort once again . She saw it in yet another movie . We often reminisce about the town with my parents who visited with us in 2010 . <p> Youd recognize the beaches and waterways if you are a fan of Forest Gump . Its where most of the Vietnam scenes were filmed . The scenery is spectacular and the pace of life quiet and laid back . It also has a rich African American history . Its perfect for outdoor adventure , beach living , seafood feasting and camping . <h> Savannah , Georgia <p> Savannah waterfront <p> I think you can guess that we loved Savannah our daughter has the same name . Like Charleston , Savannah is a place we often visited . <p> We love walking up and down the riverfront precinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying a frozen cocktail while wandering , ducking into stores to try samples of peanuts and candy , and then stopping for lunch on the verandah of One Eyed Lizzyswith a $1 frozen Margarita ! <p> That 's not all you 'll find in Savannah , wandering around the squares and discovering gorgeous Southern homes , beautiful gardens and cute cafes and restaurants . <p> The streets with their overhanging oak trees draped in Spanish moss are ghostly in appearance adding to the Savannah charm . We LOVE this city . We suggest starting your exploration with a trolley tour for a historical insight and overview before delving more into those places that most grabbed your attention . <p> Be sure yo head out to Tybee Island to experience Georgian beach living , It was one of our favourite Southern beach towns very laid back and unspoilt . <p> gorgeous savannah homes <h> North Carolina <p> We did not know anything about North Carolina before moving there . It is now one of our favourite states and we soon learned how loved it is by so many Americans . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would gush about this state when we said we lived there . <p> There are a lot of Americans from the colder Northern states who migrate here because of the low cost of living , the high employment opportunities , the mild climate and the outdoor lifestyle , and the Universities . It has a little bit of everything , which is why we love it so . <h> The Smoky Mountains <p> great smoky mountains <p> We so love the Smoky Mountains . There are so many places to camp and hiking trails as well as rivers to slowly meander down from a rubber tube . There are many mountain tops you can climb for outstanding views and of course the Appalachian trail , for the fit and adventurous . <p> We loved horse riding in the Smokies and exploring the old historical towns on bicycles . Its also a good spot for a winter log cabin with a spa on deck . <h> Asheville , NC <p> A little hippy enclave at the base of the Appalachian mountains , Asheville is where you want to come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a vibrant music scene . <p> With the nearby mountains , there are pretty drives to go on including the Blue Ridge Parkway , hikes to enjoy and nearby ski fields . It is where we skied for the first timeon fake snow though . <h> Wilmington , NC <p> The Hollywood of the East . Wilmington is where a lot of films and TV shows are filmed : Dawsons Creek , One Tree Hill , Sleeping with the Enemy anyone ? Oh , and some guy named Michael Jordan grew up here ! <p> At only a two hour drive from Raleigh , it was a favourite weekend getaway for us . As soon as the warmth of spring hit the air we were racing down for beach time . <p> Wilmington , North Carolina <h> Outer Banks , NC <p> Another favourite filming location , the Outer Banks are pretty wild and untouched with only a few small towns here and there . IT is also the place where Orville and Wilbur Wright first flew a plane . <p> The coastline is rugged and great for outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barrier islands that are home to wild ponies . <p> Beaufort is a lovely little Pirate town where Captain Blackbeard is said to have lived for a short time . You can see his pretty little home and perhaps sniff around with a shovel for that buried treasure of his that has not yet been found . <h> Chapel Hill , NC <p> Definitely our favourite American college town and one we would love to live in . <p> Why are we the best ? Well , when we lived there ( i.e in four years ) They won two National Championships . And Michael Jordan played basketball for the UNC Tar Heels . That 's right the BEST basketball player in history , if not one of the worlds best ever athletes . <p> Its also a really pretty college to walk through , and the bars on Franklin Street are seriously pumping when basketball season is on . You have not been to America , or dare I say lived , until you have- jumped over a bonfire on Franklin Street and crashed a Frat house party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago <p> Oh the windy city sure is pretty . We LOVED Chicago and I am itching to return to experience the summer vibrancy in Chicago , a city known for its arts , culture , music , sports , and deep dish pizza ! <p> There 's also a fair amount of underbelly history to discover in Chicago with its shady Mafia past , but do n't  talk about this too much when there . Locals like to ignore that it was ever a part of their history . I think it makes it even more interesting . <p> We visited during Thanskgiving and froze our Aussie butts off . I think summer is where its at where you can attend festivals , eat in cafes outdoors , play in the parks and enjoy the beautiful Lake Michigan . <p> Do n't  forget to take in a Cubs game at Wrigley Field and views from atop the John Hancock building or Sears Tower . <h> New Orleans <p> If you want a wild party then head to Bourbon street . Go with your eyes open , or better yet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another strip club . <p> enjoying a hurricane cocktail on Bourbon st <p> I much preferred wandering the streets of the French Quarter listening and dancing to the wide variety of buskers on the street playing folk , blues , country , rock or their own mixed up version of each . <p> Hire a bike and head outside the tourist areas to explore old Southern neighborhoods like the Gardens District . <p> Jackson square , french quarter <h> Southern Utah <p> Highway 12 , utah <p> I cant say I had ever dreamt of going to America and visiting Utah on a road trip . Big mistake if you are thinking the same . <p> Utah became one of my favourite states with the first orange pinnacle I saw rising from the desert . Yes , the first . That means there were plenty more to come , and in a wide variety of colours : reds , pinks , whites , oranges , even black and grey . <p> Southern Utah and all its incredible National Parks will BLOW your mind . <p> Bryce Canyon NP <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew my heart forever had a home in the US. there was simply no turning back . <h> Colorado <h> Denver <p> We loved this mile high city . It has plenty of outdoor adventures to offer with the Rocky Mountains at its doorstep and the college towns of Golden and Boulder . Check out the Coors factory in Golden for a few free pints of beer . <h> Rocky Mountain National Park <p> We loved camping and explore the Rockies . <p> Hiking trails took us to glacier lakes , through snow , pine forests , and bare mountain tops during electrical storms . Not only did we enjoy hiking , but bike riding , exploring by vehicle , and swimming in natural spring waters at Glenworth Springs . <p> And we even had a marauding bear outside our tent one freezing summers evening . <p> You can also visit the source of the Colorado River , a small trickle of water . It was amazing to follow the river and watch it grow as we drove south through the states to the Grand Canyon and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain NP <h> The North Rim , Grand Canyon <p> The Grand Canyon is often visited by many tourists to America and it should be , it is stunning . But , most people stay for only 15 minutes at the South Rim . <p> Noooo . Do n't  do this . <p> Have a more unique experience by hitting the North Rim . It is just as beautiful and offers a different , quieter perspective . You can camp quiet close to the rim , hike down to the bottom and catch a pretty gorgeous sunset . <p> sunrise at north rim <h> Texas <p> We thought it was going to be sprawling fields of dusty farmland with the odd tumbleweed blowing past a steakhouse . Total misconception of Texas . <p> We fell in love with Austin , even though we only visited for a day . It has the college town vibe and live music scene that we love . <p> The San Antonio Riverwalk was charming and filled with cool restaurants and cafes . <p> san antonio riverwalk <h> Santa Fe , New Mexico <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks with our friends . <p> Santa Fe is an artistic town with a lot of Spanish and Native American history . The vibrant red and orange , pueblo style architecture is a reason to come here , if the food is not . <p> Enjoy a sunset with wine and picnic at the Opera , explore artistic Canyon Road , and take day trips out to the nearby mountains or historic Taos , where you will see gorgeous pueblo buildings . <h> Tennessee <h> Memphis <p> Memphis is of course the home of blues , rock and jazz and of course the great king himself . <p> I was worried about going to Graceland , I thought it would be a real kitschy tour and a let down . I actually really enjoyed it . I felt like I had missed out growing up as a child . Elvis died the year I was born . <p> My Mum and I would watch his movies on TV almost every week , it was one of our favourite things to do . I really lamented that I never " knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little connection I had always craved . <p> Now I just have to get my Mum over there . <p> inside Gracelands <h> Nashville <p> I was ready to trade the Doc Marten mosh pit stompers for cowboy boots after a visit to Nashville . <p> I had country fever for weeks after , which Craig was not too happy about . Hours on the road listening to whines about dead dogs and empty whiskey bottles is not his sort of thing . <p> Nashville is cracking fun though . Its all about country music . Visit the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum . I was fascinated by the stories and the evolution of music which began way back with folk and country roots . You can do tours of Elvis recording studios and hear tales of other famous artists like Johnny Cash and modern heroes like Keith Urban ! <p> Take in a show at the Grand Ole Oprey , or just let loose in the bars of downtown Nashville . Country artists will be jiving nad line tapping in each one . Its great fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Then add these to your bucket list : <p> Attend a college football game and tailgate before it . <p> Attend a college basketball match . <p> Do the seventh inning stretch at a baseball game with a hotdog and beer . <p> Attend a Halloween party , dressed up . <p> Crash a frat party ( One of the most exciting things I did . And they drink from red plastic cups ) . <p> Learn how to play beer pong and corn throwing <p> Spend thanksgiving with an American family . <p> Experience a White Christmas . <p> Ride a horse at a ranch in Montana or Wyoming or through an iconic place like Bryce Canyon . <p> Okay , so we are thinking a massive road trip across America is exactly what we need to do . North to South and East to West . Whos coming with us ? <p> UPDATE : We are planning an epic 2-3 year road trip of the USA to share all the America Unplugged Secrets . <h> Plan Your Trip in the United States 69808 @qwx269808 <p> Accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States 69807 @qwx269807 <p> Car Rental in the United States 69806 @qwx269806 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> A road trip is one of the best ways to see the States . We are really wanting to go back so we can discover more , there is so much left to see ! The better stories come from the places that are n't  frequently visited . <p> Lovely post . I agree , people have an image of the US through the bigger cities ( great places too ! ) but its the lesser known destinations that show more of the real America , like you call it . Ive been lucky enough to discover some spots through locals which I loved . On my recent Florida trip , it was confirmed to me again , Florida is more than Miami and Orlando , the first places we think of when speaking of Florida . Savannah and Charleston is SO high on my wish list . As is a road tripso much to see , so little time ! Thanks for sharing this information . <p> Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other quieter places . I think America wins with the big cities and the smaller ones . It is such a diverse country , it is hard not to find several spots that you fall in love with . <p> Great list ! I 'm actually going to visit my cousin in Atlanta this summer and were going to visit Savannah and Tybee Island . I 've visited Atlanta lots of times , but have never really seen much else of Georgia . I can vouch for Chicago as I used to live there , NOLA , and Santa Fe . I love love love New Mexico ! I have much love for my home state of California though . I 'm an Angeleno and I have a love hate relationship with my city . The Central Coast and Northern Cal are gorgeous though ! I would add Oregon to the list . My husband and I recently visited and we found that the people were so friendly , the place is so green , and the food is wonderful ! <p> Born on the east coast and now living on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beautiful . Ive been to 36 states so far so just a few more to go . Love that you led off with my home state of South Carolina but you need to spend a little more time on the west coast of the US too . California is as beautiful and diverse as it gets and not just LA and San Francisco . Love exploring this state . <p> What a great list . I 'm keeping this for future reference on a few places , particularly Utah . Next time you 're in Memphis I would suggest a number of other places to get a feel for the authentic music scene ( Sun Studio , Stax , Rock n Soul Museum , a number of blues joints , an endless amount of live music nightly ) . And of course a growing food scene in Downtown and Midtowns eclectic neighborhoods . <p> I live in a small town in Louisiana . There are so many different cultures in Louisiana alone.If you come to Louisiana , I would recommend seeing more than New Orleans . New Orleans is a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana town like Lafayette or Baton Rouge then venture north to Monroe or Shreveport to see a big difference in cultures . When you come , make it during the fall for football season . Try to make a game at LSU to see football and tailgate at its finest . The weather will also be a little nicer than our 100 degree temperatures during the summer . I would also recommend going to a beach town on the Gulf of Mexico like Gulf Shores or Fort Walton . Very popular destinations . <p> Starting 6 years ago , my husband and I began traveling the US full-time in our RV . Three years ago we started splitting our time between RVing in the US and sailing the Mexican coast in a sailboat ( so we could be warm in the winter ) <p> After all those years of sightseeing in the US day in and day out , we feel we have barely scratched the surface of what there is to see <p> We will likely spend the rest of our lives RVing around North America , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied place . <p> There are tens of thousands of people like us doing the same thing ! <p> Utah is our favorite state the best scenery and the friendliest people . But we also love Arizona , Idaho and Oregon , and there are jewels to be found in Nevada , Montana , Wyoming , Michigan and New England <p> If I were a foreigner coming to the US for the first time , I 'd visit just one big city any one will do , as they 're all the same and then I 'd spend the rest of my time in the small towns where Americas soul is and has always been . <p> Thanks for all the info on the South we are looking forward to going exploring there <p> Great tips and story Emily ! I love your lifestylethe best of everything . We are super keen to come back to the states and do a mammoth road trip . We will be definitely visiting the places you suggested and coming to you for advice when we do . Thank you for sharing <p> Couldnt disagree more that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia often skipped by tourists traveling between New York City and Washington , D.C. : Oodles of history , eminently walkable central core , world class museums , a dedication to urban community outdoor art , a city park with hiking trails , easy driving distance to Pennsylvania Dutch country and the New Jersey beaches , plenty for foodies to savor and discover . Obviously , I live there . I 'm a travel blogger . I love to travel all over the U.S. and the world , but I also love discovering my home town . <p> Mesa Verde is a really cool place to explore as well . I went with my family last summer and we had the time of our lives . I had n't  even heard of it before we went , and after I could n't imagine why everybody did n't  go there . <p> Caz , I loved your recommendations but was saddened that you left off my favorites . I have traveled to many countries on six continents and still my favorite place on this planet is Yellowstone National Park . You need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this magical and diverse scenic wonderland . A couple more places for your consideration would be seeing New England in the fall , and a visit to our nations capital , Washington DC <p> Thanks for the tips Joanne . They are definitely on our list to visit which is why they are not on this list . As said in the opening , the list is based on places we have been so they werent intentionally left off ! Ca n't wait to experience them <p> I would highly recommend a visit to Montana ! My home state is rich in natural wonders like Glacier National Park , natural hot springs and beautiful rivers and lakes . We also have lots friendly people with a laid back lifestyle . The fresh mountain air is an added bonus = <p> Caz , this post is brilliant ! As an American traveling the world I find myself realizing how beautiful and diverse our country really is ! <p> Couldnt agree more that Utah , or southern Utah specifically , should be on everyones to-do list ! It is so underrated but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could add to this list I 'd recommend Oregon in its entirety the whole state has so much to offer . And , another surprising one , Idaho . When we biked across the U.S. last year these were our two favorite states . <p> This blog post has made me smile , it is such an INCREDIBLE place on Earth and its such a pity that the majority of tourists coming in from Australia and various other parts of the world plan itineraries that scratch the surface or just see the main tourist meccas like you described . I also chuckled when you called it home , because that is the way I feel about it . Sure , Australia is where I happen to be born and was raised but the US is also my home after doing an exchange program in Seattle , living in Colorado for 2 years , based between there and Southampton when I worked at sea . We bought a campervan once and just travelled for about 8 months , Betsy the Beast she was a 19ft Dodge Ram ! Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also Portland , Oregan is a really cool town . California in itself has some INCREDIBLE National Parks like the Redwoods , Sequoia , Yosemite , Lake Tahoe is spectacular in summer AND awesome ski resorts in the winter ( Mammoth Mountain is great too , further South Closer to LA ) and ofcourse that incredible California Coast . We adore MONTANA The BIG Sky State.Glacier National Park is one of my favs . Wyoming you start to head into Cowboy Territory which we actually met a couple driving along remote farming land . LOVE The Tetons , the wild flowers are spectacular in the Summer and some epic extreme skiing in the winter at Jackson Hole . Colorado is something else.some breathtaking adventures to be had year round and it has such a beautiful american soul . Best champagne powder and blue bird skies for skiing . Utah is pretty good for that as well . And very interesting with the Morman influence . Loved Chicago alot , spectacular in summer . Such a planned well thought out city with so many diverse things to do.We actually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mafia and they showed us some history which was actually in their neighbourhood Johnny the builder . Love the baseball esp when the cubs play the white sox ( 2 chicago teams ) . The blues bars are super cool . And that deep dish pizza is sensational . Also LOVED Wisconsin , the state of beer , bread , brats , cheese &amp; potatos haha . Great festivals in Madison &amp; Milwalkee in the summer . We also went to the Jelly Belly Factory in Kenosha . NEW ENGLAND IN THE FALL.spectacular.I still dream of the beautiful colours in every direction you can look . The quiet walks in the forrest and the leaves fall is magical.a rainbow of red/yellow/orange/brown . I would go back in a heartbeat . Vermont my favourite ( oh and the apple orchards are really awesome as well.and the maple syrupoh and cheese hahaha ) . Maine is simply mystical as you edge toward the atlantic.adored the little lobster restaurants and Arcadia National Park is sensational . Cape Cod and the drive through historical Boston ( which you are guarenteed to get lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small states of Rhode Island and Connecticuit have some really beautiful , quirky little villagesalot of old money too . We once caught the ferry from New London CN over to Long Island and drove into Manhattan that way , it is worthwhile . The Hamptons are also on Long Island . <p> Spent alot of time in Florida , but havent done alot of the South.yet.only Texas . <p> What I also love about the US is how cheap it is to travel within AND so close to Canada , Mexico and the Caribbean . Cruises are way less than $100 pp/day and they are on sensational ships and will take you to a variety of destinations in the one trip . <p> I think I definitely need to pack up the fam and be a correspondent with you guys hahaha . It is a trip that we will do.probably broken up and travelled in chunks like 6-8 weeks at a time . <p> Thank you for writing this post . It has made me smile and honours that amazing country and its people so well . <p> PS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyoming.bloody amazing.VERY VERY special and historical place . It is worth driving up to Mt Rushmore if you are going across the country as well . I adored it . <p> So funny as I was reading this , I was thinking , she needs to write a post for us ! ! <p> Awesome comment and suggestions Kim . Thank you for taking the time to share them . You have experienced so much of the things that still sit on my must do list . <p> Its always a thrill for us to meet other Aussies who love the US as much as us . We feel like we 've met a kindred spirit who just understands how we feel and what we go on about and why . Most people think were mad . <p> Fun post ! Weve been lucky enough to have visited 48 of the 50 US states , and have lots of favorites . I grew up on Cape Cod , in Massachusetts , so the New England states hold a special place for me . Donny is from Atlanta , so weve also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right up there too , as is the Pacific Northwest ! Were still missing North Dakota and Alaskaso those are definitely high on the list . <p> Do n't  think I 've been to any of those places ! But I 'd add some other spots in Florida : Pensacola bay of Mexico amazing white sand , Key West down the bottom &amp; Key Largo pretty eccentric bit such friendly people . Also Yosemite National Park is amazing ( even if you break your ankle there like I did ) they sure know how to do National Parks in USA . <p> Great article and hopefully people will start thinking of the US as a destination not only to do when they 're older . There is so much fun and adventure to be had in our extremely diverse and wonderful country . For my money , anywhere west of Denver will supply you with a memorable vacation . <p> Awww , now you 've made me homesick : ) . ive always thought that 50 States = 50 different experiences . I spend endless amounts of time trying to encourage people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketed . I 've found the easiest way to do that is tempt them with the Great American Road Trip concept . Ive been to 46 of the 50 ( 2 cross country trips ) , but I 've been dying to do a coastal drive to the Keys , probably because I 'm so sun deprived right now = <p> Wow ! You guys really got around while you were in the USA ! I have to say I was eager to make a move out of my home country growing up , but on a recent road trip in California , it won me over again . America is stunning and has so many different landscapes . Plus the people are very warms and welcoming . I 'm glad you guys felt that while you were there . <p> Hi , What a great blog . I am from the UK and love the USA . Typically I started in Florida with a Disney visit and then went to St Augustine which is very pretty and has oldest house in USA . Also ventured south to scenic Key West . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunning and full of history . Continued to Raleigh and Smoky Mountains ( stayed at a lovely little place called Townsend beside a stream ) . <p> Let me add that I have been to South Africa and it was so disappointing . Table Mountain is just a flat uninteresting boulder and although Cape Town is pretty enough , it is not jaw droppingly beautiful by any means . The Grand Mesa in Colorado looks more stunning . <p> Also Sun City in Africa is so overhyped ; it is one casino stuck in the middle of nowhere . I guess when you have n't got much you tent to overhype and overpromote what you do have which is miles of scrub land . You can see all the animals and more in the Florida theme parks . <p> If I could I would have got my money back and never bothered going to South Africa . <p> Thanks for sharing your tips and experiences We loved all these places you visited too . I do love South Africa though and Cape Town is my favourite city . Just goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun City though , it sounds a bit over the top for me . <p> Virginia ! It has Southern charm ( and yes , VA is the South given that Richmond , VA was the capital of the confederacy . Some people argue that VA is n't in the South . LOL ) , and TONS of history . Just south of Washington , DC , VA is the home of Thomas Jeffersons home- Monticello , Colonial Williamsburg , Jamestown , tons of other historical sites . There are also theme parks Kings Dominion in Doswell , VA and Busch Gardens and Water Country USA in Williamsburg , and some beautiful cities ( though I would skip Richmond on that front ! ) , including Charlottesville and Fredericksburg another city that is heavy on the history . The Norfolk/VA Beach area is great if you are into Nautical history too . Lots of fun for the kids , and not far from our nations capital . <p> Were a military family so we 've been blessed to have been able to live in various places across the United States . Weve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . But Ive got ta mention my home state , Michigan ! Surrounded by the great lakes it is a beautiful part of the country you should n't forget . And my hometown of Grand Rapids has great atmosphere ! Another tip , visit in September or October for Art Prize . Artist come from all over the globe to display and compete with their art . Its placed all over the city and you can go on tours to view it and even vote on your favorite pieces . <p> We have been to Tybee Island a few times , so layed back and relaxing . Hard to believe there is so much to do on such a small island . Want to make it back for Pirate Fest , we have heard its a really good time . <p> I 'm so glad you 've had great experiences here ! We 've made several cross-country trips across the U.S. , both B.C. ( Before Children ) and after . We live in Southern California now , but I grew up in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , and can therefore highly recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a very large Amish community there , and their way of living is very different from anything most of us in Western cultures are used to . My husband and I have both traveled to parts of Europe , and we 've taken our eldest son there , but havent been able to afford a trip for the entire family yet ( we have three children now ! ) . Were planning it now , however , and when we do it the next time it will be a big oneat least a 6 month stay ! Your blog will help provide inspiration for us , so hope to see more of it ! <p> It sounds like you had quite the adventure here in America . I live in Wisconsin , and have for my whole life . I feel as if you missed MANY amazing spots across the country . Sure , you listed all the main tourist spots , but your missing places like Duluth ( MN ) , Seattle ( WA ) , Portland ( ME ) and other GORGEOUS cities across the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the hotspots , when you can go a little out of the way and have a unique adventure ? <p> Yes agree Calley , but the US is MASSIVE and we only had limited time and money . We are pretty great at travelling but we are not superhuman . We focused on our Must sees first and then other local spots near to where we were living . And to be honest the majority of the places we put on this list , foreigners would not see , so it does make it out of the way and unique for foreign travellers . We are planning a big road trip of the US in 2 years and we will have at least a year to do it which means well see more of the places that we missed . <p> Another USA tradition is to participate in the Halloween festivities ! When my husband and I visit NYC in the fall , we always make the short drive to one of the best haunted attractions in NJ . If you have not been to a Halloween parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun tradition . <p> I am very happy that I came across this post . I live in Southern California , but my dream is to visit other cities and states in the U.S. that are n't  very well known but beautiful . Even though I love California I still want to see other parts of my country . Thank you so much for this . <p> Caz , loved this post ! I lived in six countries and moved 16 times , before finally setting down roots in Wilmington , North Carolina . I love this town and the area all around , so I especially appreciated that you included Wilmington . I do still get the travel bug ( feeling inspired by your blog ! ) , but its great to be able to come back home to North Carolina . <p> Wish I had of read this three months ago . I loved Utah , drove from Salt Lake City , Jackson WY , Yellowstone NP ( would n't go out of my way to return ) the Bear Tooth Pass ( defiantly on my list to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLC UT .

I turn 35 ( but shhh do n't  tell anyone that , its my secret and my students still think I 'm in my twenties ) 35 once seemed so old to me . I used to think when you were 35 life was almost over ; It was swallowed up by dishes and bills and screaming children . Well , there is that aspect to it somewhat , but really life is how you choose it to be by what you focus on . And my life at 35 , ( although has adult responsibilities ) , still has the youth and freedom of my twenties . Why would I want it to be any other way ? <p> 35 they say is often the start of the out of control mid life crises . The point when you realize " Shit I 'm really not getting any younger . Life is slipping away and I have n't done anything . Time to go out and buy the sports-car and pick up a toy boy to drive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't  feel like the best years of my life are behind me . The best years of your life are the ones you are living now . Am I halfway to the end of my journey here on earth ? I hope not yet . But who can ever know that . Perhaps I am close to the end . <p> Thinking of the answers to these questions will lead you to the mid life crises or to the doctors for a Prozac prescription to deaden the pains of anxiety . Instead today , I am going to live another day in celebration . Celebration for an extraordinary life so far , and celebration for the amazing journey still to come . In honor of today . I am going to list 35 things in my past I am incredibly grateful for . <h> 35 things to celebrate <p> The greatest gift life has ever given me- my beautiful daughter Kalyra <p> My wonderful soul mate , Craig who has shared a 10 year dream life with me and has not yet killed me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me strength , taught me passion , and supported my nomadic desires to be away from them <p> Siblings who understand me , love me , and never question what I want to do instead giving me a " Good on ya " I love being in the company of my brothers and sisters . <p> Beating the odds to be born healthy and continuing that pattern of health for 35 years . <p> Being born in Australia , and having incredible opportunities that I know other people born in other countries will never have . <p> All the pain that has existed in my past , as it has shown me a better way , and forced me to learn some truths about myself and life . <p> Bec for years of friendship , fun , laughter and unbelievable memories . <p> Woody for never giving up on me and for always bringing belly hurting laughter into my life . <p> For all my friends in Oz and around the world- I 'm just ecstatic to have amazing friends . <p> For never having to call the in-laws " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the highest values in my life being fun and freedom .

Every day , I feel as if I am on the road again hanging out with you over beers or coffee . <p> University for teaching me how to drink beer . <p> Okay Uni , I 'm also grateful that you gave me my teaching degree so I could teach around the world . <p> For all the hugs , smiles , letters , and achievements of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Happy Birthday Caz . I really enjoyed reading your list of what you have to be grateful for . I think it is a fantastic exercise that we should all commit to doing frequently ; I bet it was easy to come up with just 35 things ! <p> Thanks guys ! It was really easy and there was so much more I could have added in . I make sure I spend time each day in gratitude . Its a amazing the difference it can bring to mine and others lives . I think my students think I 'm quite bizarre as I am always telling them how much I appreciate the things they do . The give me strange looks when I say " I really appreciate you putting your hand up to ask me a question . " <p> Caz , happy birthdayagain . However , its funny you pointed out the things you did . Today , my three biggest obstacles that I had to deal with ( besides work ) were bills I had to pay , screaming kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . So there is some truth to dealing with those things at 35 . Kids bring that stuff on . <p> Granted , I do live a bit more of a normal life than most people that travel . However , it does n't  mean I do n't  travel . Looking back , it was the highs and adrenaline of travel that spurred me on and made life exciting . Now as I have gotten older , I find enjoyment in simple things . Kids are a huge part of that . But traveling with kids too and you do n't  have to go far . <p> Last weekend , I went to the zoo with my kids . For most us , we need a safari and world famous zoo to be excited . Yet watching your little kids interact with animals makes you realize you do n't  have to go far to still enjoy the world around you . <p> Traveling for me , the more normal guy at 35 with all the things you mentioned , is different now . But its still as enjoyable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the eyes of kids brings a new meaning and perspective as to how you enjoy and appreciate the world . <p> Uugh .. the dishes . Thats Craigs job ! Ive been complaining all week to Craig about cleaning as it only stays clean for 5 minutes before the toys are thrown every where again . I agree that being with your children is a whole new world of travel . Just crawling around looking at bugs opens your eyes to the wonders that lay around us even in our normal lives . <p> Happy 35th birthday Caz ! ! I think it took me about 15 minutes to read the list you wrote above as after each line , I spent a few moments thinking about something that I am grateful for as well . So thank you for that . <p> And I need to get myself a WiiI want to be a rockstar now that I see how easy it can really be =

Any idea what the weathers like these days over there ? <p> The weather in Jordan is lovely in the spring , not as hot as you probably thought . The climate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences of Mediterranean climate in western areas close to the coast . The country is characterized by two seasons , the hot and dry summer between May and October and the relatively cool and wet season between November and April . <p> The winter months between November and March are cold , with rain and rarely snow on the highest peaks . Most rains occur between November and March . The average annual rainfall varies between 400 mm in north-west near the Jordan Valley and less than 100 mm in the southern areas of the country , the capital Amman receives an average of 280 mm of rain a year . <p> I had a great time in Jordan , but there are definitely some caveats I would give to anyone I encouraged to go there . Its expensive very much so , one of the most expensive countries Ive visited . There is almost no backpacker style accommodation , and if you 're in the off-season ( as I was ) you can get a cheap hotel for about twice the price of a cheap hotel in peak season in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to much cheaper developing countries , but its important to note : for all its souks and ancient alleyways , Jordan is a rich , first-world country . Bargains to be had here are few and far between . The sights you have to see them ! They truly are breathtaking . Petra costs -50 ( $80 ) for one person , for one days admission . You cant miss it its why most people go to Jordan in the first place but remember to budget for it ! We had an old guidebook and were a bit shocked to learn that the entry price has more than DOUBLED in the last 12 months . Food well , okay . Just steer well clear of the Mansaf : 0 ) I read an article by a travel blogger , praising the diversity of foods in Jordan . He mentioned how tasty Mansaf sounded , while clearly never having tasted it My stomach is cast iron . I lived in Thailand for a year eating off street vendors , Ive eaten locust , cat ( curried ! ) and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curdled yoghurt , made me throw up all night . Just FYI : 0 ) Theres loads to see and do in Jordan , and I agree with one of the commenters above who recommended Jerash its probably the most mazing Roman city in the world , I lost a whole day there and could easily have lost three . Book in to see the Chariot show there again , pricey , but well worth it the gladiators are drawn from the Jordanian army special forces , and some of them are truly spectacular up close ! Go in March/April if you 're planning a trip soon I went in may and it was getting uncomfortably hot , especially for long days of clambouring around ruins . June/July/August is a complete no go , unless you were born in the north of Australia or sub-saharan Africa ! <p> Awesome Tony ! ! Thanks so much for leaving such a helpful comment for our readers .

@@21820953 @1820953/ <h> What to Do in Penang with Kids <p> Penang is the heart and soul of Malaysia ; it is a melting pot of culture with beautiful people , interesting attractions and is a foodies paradise ! ( Locals will tell you it is the food capital of Malaysia ! ) <p> The first question you will want to know is <h> Where to Stay in Penang ? <p> This depends on what you want . Most people choose to stay at Batu Ferringhi . ( The locals call it foreigners rock ) . <p> This is where you will find all the big name resorts with kids clubs , buffet breakfasts and most of them are right on the beach . While it is a beach and you will find many water sports , be aware that it is not really a swimming beach the water is not as clean as you may expect it to be . <p> Batu Ferringhi comes alive at night . The main street is transformed into a bustling market place , with every type of ware ( including genuine fakes ) available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain . <p> Do n't  eat at your over-priced hotel restaurant , walk to the Long Beach Hawker Centre with some spare change and you will experience some of Penangs best food . <p> If you do choose to stay at Batu Ferringhi , please leave your resortto explore Penang . There are attractions easily accessed from the bus stop in front of your hotel . <p> If you are after something less foreigners rock then George Town is the place to stay . It is the capital of Penang and has something for everyone . It is a place where there is a Catholic Church next to a Mosque next to a Temple . <h> What to do in Penang with kids ? <p> Regardless of where you stay and how luxurious it may be , please get out and explore Penang . <p> We have been there twice with our children ; both times we had a baby who was welcomed by every local . <p> Here is a list of things to do in Penang with kids in no particular order . <h> Explore Georgetown <p> Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city with more motorbikes , buses and cars than you can imagine . <p> Getting around is easy . Taxis are plentiful and quite cheap . If you jump in a taxi make sure you haggle your ride before you get in . The taxis have signs saying " haggling prohibited " but no one seems to take any notice . A good rule of thumb is to take off five ringgit from what is offered to you . <p> A great way to see Penang is to hop on the free shuttle bus . Every 15 minutes you can hop on a bus which does a circuit of the main tourist sites of Georgetown . Special bus stops around the city are specially marked to help you navigate and explore . <p> It is crowded with locals hitching a lift to work or to shop ; be friendly and say hello , they will love the chance to chat with you ! <h> Penang Butterfly Farm <p> Butterfly Farm <p> Kids of all ages will love it here . You can get up close and personal with so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you keep still one might just land on you . <p> The farm is filled with stone paths leading around ponds and up bridges where beautiful orchids are home to even more butterflies . Allow 2 hours for a relaxing visit here . It is the last stop on the bus , so very easy to find . <h> Spice Garden <p> Explore the Spice Garden <p> Not far from the Butterfly farm ( a quick taxi or bus trip ) you will find the Spice Garden . We had Grandpa with us who loved reading all about the Spice trading history , looking at all the signed plants and smelling the spices . <p> Hubby and the little kids did n't  bother so much with that , but had a ball running along the beautiful paths and roaming freely amongst the gorgeous gardens . <p> There is a giant swing which swings you out over the edge of the rainforest . There are numerous waterfalls , ponds and bridges to find . It is a lovely place to stop for an hour or two . Nice tree top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funicular Railway <p> Penang is hot and very humid . A great way to escape the heat is to head to the top of Penang Hill . <p> Catch the funicular all the way to the top ; in just a few minutes you will be at the top to have a gorgeous view of Penang . It is much cooler up here . <p> If it is a rainy morning , do n't  bother as you will be unlikely to see much at all . You are best waiting until later in the day when the rain clears . There are a few cafes and exhibitions to looks at also . ( If you have little ones , avoid the owl museum found out the hard way lots of little breakable things in there ! ) <p> Top Tip:When you are ready to return , line up so you are first in line to board the funicularthen race to get to the front carriage . ( Speeding down the track with front seat view is awesome ! ) <h> Penang Botanical Gardens <p> On Board the Botanic Garden Train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them loose . <p> The botanical gardens are a must for energetic kids . They can run along set paths , climb bridges and watch waterfalls . For one ringgit you can jump aboard the mini train for a ride around the gardens . <p> There are lots of monkeys to spot be careful to hide your food ! <h> Kek Lok Si Temple <p> Kek Lok Si Temple <p> This is the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia . It is open to the public and a worthwhile experience for you and the kids . There are lots of steps and narrow columns to climb , so leave the stroller behind . <p> The temple grounds are beautiful ; there are sacred ponds and manicured plants to admire . The kids will love climbing the seven tiered Pagoda of King Rama VI and will be awed by a massive bronze statue of the goddess of mercy . <p> There are also glass elevators to ride in and turtles to feed . A great 2 hours of exploring and learning ! <h> Eat Then Eat Some More <p> First Curry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words here , but I wo n't . Try something new everyday , there is so much for your tastebuds to learn . <p> By far our favourite place to eat is Gurney Drive Hawker Centre . I am drooling as I remember it . From 6pm until late there will be hundreds of Penangs finest foods for you to sample and will cost you a few ringgits only . <p> This place will be buzzing with locals ; do n't  be afraid to ask them for a recommendation , or follow behind and order the same . When buying food for the little ones , remember to ask the cook to not put any chilli on their food . <p> We also caught the free shuttle bus to Little India . You will have a great time exploring lane ways and finding the perfect curry . The restaurateurs will delight in making your kids feel at home . <h> Shop Till You Drop <p> You need to take advantage of great shopping and cheap prices . <p> Shops generally open after 10am and are open till late at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you will find your brand name stores with great savings . <p> If you want to shop with the locals , head to the Komtar ( biggest building in Penang ) or Prangin Mall which is across the road . Here you will find a myriad of interesting shops and boutique stalls . You 'll find lots of cool gadgets and knick knacks for the kids to have fun with . <h> Catch the Ferry <p> Ferry to Butterworth <p> If you head to the ferry terminal in Georgetown , wander along the pier and food stalls and jump on a ferry just because you can . <p> You will most likely be the only foreigners on it , but it is so much fun for the kids . They can sit and watch other giant ferries pass by and after about 20 minutes you will be at Butterworth , the mainland . <p> When you get here , it is up to you . You can turn around and go back return trip is free or you can stay and explore . <p> The Penang Bird Park is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door worthy of a look . <p> You could also take the bus to Sunway Carnival Mall for some retail therapy . From here you can catch a bus back to Georgetown which takes you across the bridge which links the mainland ( quite a long journey , our kids fell asleep ! ) <h> Organised Tours or Independent travel ? <p> Personally , I would n't bother with organised tours . You can get package deals through various operators who will pick you up from your hotel and take you to three attractions on one day Easy ! <p> But the thing is ; Penang is easy and much cheaper to do yourself . <p> When you have kids you need that flexibility to stay longer or leave earlier . It is very easy to flag down a taxi driver and negotiate his services for the day . <p> This way you can see two or three attractions in one day and your driver will be waiting patiently until you are ready for the next one or to return you to your hotel . He 'll let you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bus system is so fantastic and cheap . You can reach most destinations by bus and the drivers are happy to point you in the right direction . You can buy prepaid bus tickets to give you unlimited hassle free travel . <p> I love Penang , it is my spiritual home . I do hope you visit and love it as much as we have . Make sure you stay for at least one week , more if you are able . <h> About Val Paul <p> I 'm all about having fun with kids : easy crafts , pantry friendly recipes , great books to read and whatever else life throws to way . My house is a chaotic mess , I eat too much chocolate and I procrastinate - a lot . Come have a Yibba Yabba with me on myblogand Facebook page . <p> Great introduction on Penang with kids .

We have traveled quite a bit in North America and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to get there soon ! <p> Val , I love your point about doing a tour on your own . Its the best way to go whether you 're with our without kids . I 'm definitely bookmarking this post as my travel buddies and I are planning to visit Penang next year . Thanks ! <p> I 'm going to throw a spanner in the works now . I 'm in Batu Ferringhi right now , we 've been on Penang for 11 days and I really am not impressed at all . Batu Ferringhi is too far from everywhere , we are spending hours on buses to see anything and the buses are extremely unpleasant , incredibly crowded , with scrums of people that push small children out of the way and rudely reserve seats for adults far more capable of standing on the windy , dangerous , road to BF than a 5 year old . The buses are also infested with pick pockets , we have been victims and there are warning signs on the buses . In 11 days we have n't seen everything we wanted to see , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , you mention Long Beach , we 've eaten there most evenings , its for the tourists , overpriced and not so great . Georgetown is much better for food , quality wise and price wise , but its almost an hour on the bus from BF . I 'm going to have to write a post I think ! <p> I have to partially agree with Alyson . Weve been doing non-stop world travel for almost 8 years as a family ( 45 countries on 5 continents so far on $23/day pp ) . <p> We 've spent a LOT of time in Penang recently as its been a great place for my 12 year old to immerse in her Mandarin and she is now so fluent she won a Chinese elocution contest amongst 1000 Asians and the 1st Caucasian to do that . <p> We tried BF at first , but I agree that it is too far out and isolated . We love the Tanjung Tokong area which is an easier access to Georgetown and everything , but not right in the thick of it which is too intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better than most places in Asia . There are basically no side walks , lights or cross walks , and crazy traffic , so that adds to the challenge of getting around with kids via busnot to mention the heat and humidity . <p> That said , even with the challenges , we think Penang is one of the gems in Asia . <p> Personally , Batu Ferringhi is not on my listI love Georgetown ! BF is the " foreigners Rock " so yes , it is over priced . It is a long way from town , but I guess many travellers book into their resorts and never leave ! This post was to get people to Penangand hopefully really explore Georgetown and other non tourist spots ! Sorry you had such an unpleasant experience , maybe just not the spot for you ? <p> Jeanne , Glad you like Penang . We love it ! We do n't  stay at BF , agree there are many other beautiful less harassing places to stay . personally I found the buses fine , I am always cautious when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found if we are friendly to the locals , they will be friendly towards us too ! <p> Just happen to stumble upon your site , very informative with some nice pictures . Allow me to comment here my views as a local resident Batu Ferringhi is an upper class tourist area which does not portray the real Penang and so is Gurney Drive hawker . I would recommend places in Georgetown where like you have seen ethnic Chinese , Indians , Malays , Thais and minority races live side by side . Penang is rich in diverse cultures and historical places and of course the food . Penang is a foodie haven where you can taste local ( Peranakan ) , Malay , Chinese Indian and Thai hawker food . Agree that you would need at least a week to really get to know Penang . Try to visit the Penang Tourist Center for the tourist maps or the official website which have loads of info on the cultural and historical areas as well as hawker food recommendations . Keep up the good work and I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . <p> As a local in Malaysia , I 've been to Penang several times and I have to agree that staying in Georgetown would give you better access to all the glorious foods that are found in Penang Island . Another great places that I have in mind is Malacca ( I believe you have been there ) and if you 're adventurous enough , Sarawak = <p> We are in Penang ; Batu Ferringhi right now and staying at the Park Royal . Location is perfect for the kind of holiday we were looking for . If you 're after a resort style holiday and still be able to walk out your door to access street markets and hawkers food this is the place to be . Great for kids , safe , people are pleasant and everything is reasonably priced ( except hotel restaurants and one or two larger establishments ) . We are well traveled and can share some basics with you ; Penang is safe ( of course you need to have your wits about you any where you travel ) . Choose your holiday destination according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transport , activities are cheap in Penang ; just like anywhere you need to check out your options for , do n't  just book the first hotel package . Penang is clean compared to many cities although navigating a pram is a little challenging , just accept you need to be walking on the road way a little , simply follow the lead of the locals . If your looking for similar destinations try Sharm El shake or dahab in Sinai Coast . <p> hai val about to travel to penang with my one year old daugter in january 2016 still confuse abut where to stay which is kid friendly and on budget can you please help me : ) . lots of thanks and are the food street kid friendly or do i need to bring their meal anywhere we go ? <p> Thank you for so many fantastic suggestions here . We have just booked a family holiday to Penang and can hardly wait ! Anticipating lots of fun with our three children , not to mention the delicious food !

Huntington Beach area is great the parking fees are a bit much . Loved seeing oil drills and beach at same time as you drive along . Love that there are so many State Beaches . Just loved the whole area . Did Disneyland while there and love it better than Disney World . Would love to live there . <p> Craig went to Chili peppers and Rolling Stones at the Rose Bowl many years ago . He loved that concert .

Would love to on our next trip to LA though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips ! <p> I definitely agree with staying a day in LA and then going off and seeing some of the other great SoCal cities . San Diego is awesome but Santa Barbara is a truly unique experience . The drive up is amazingly scenic ( be careful not to swerve when you catch yourself staring off into the beautiful Pacific ocean ! ) , and the town itself has a really cool , laidback beachy vibe . The food is great and there are tons of amazing hikes ( I recommend Seven Falls by the Santa Barbara Mission natural waterslides ! ) . Take a walk around downtown State Street , the city requires that buildings be kept under a certain height to keep the authentic feel of the old Spanish architecture . Santa Barbara is often known as the destination for the rich and famous ( with locals like Oprah and Michael Jackson , you can see why ) , and the hotels can get pretty expensive . I suggest staying at a budget-friendly inn like The Sandman Inn ( www.thesandmaninn.com ) on State Street so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious food .

Very keen to go back now <p> I was just in LA last month and I had a blast ! Too bad I was n't able to visit Venice Beach !

I hear food trucks are really big over there I cant wait to try a fish taco from one of them ! <p> I do n't  think this article really did Los Angeles any justice . As a native , the best things to do werent even mentioned . You have Universal Studios/City Walk , Disneyland/Downtown Disney ( outskirts of LA ) , Santa Monica Pier , Promenade .

Griffith park is a great place to go for the observatory and if you want to star watch/check out los angeles scenery at night . There are great museums like LACMA , MOCA , la brea tar pits . Los Angeles is VERY diverse , there is a koreatown , china town , etc . We have some of the greatest sporting events from Lakers , Kings to Dodgers . <p> Then if you want to do the touristy things , you can hit Hollywood ( where every native avoids ) and check out the stars , clubs , bars , wax museum etc . <p> Every city within LA has its own farmers market . The one mentioned in the article above is actually known as the Grove . They have many free concerts throughout the summer . If you want to catch other performances , there is the Hollywood Bowl , Nokia theater , Staples center , etc . <p> I would NOT stay near LAX airport as it is really expensive and its not the best area in town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places mentioned in your article is still Los Angeles because its part of Los Angeles county . <p> Thanks for sharing Lizzett .

Very helpful <p> We just moved to LA after visiting four times and could not be happier !

All for fun . <p> There was heaps of fun on offer on this cruise ship holiday for our four year old daughter Kalyra , and for kids of all ages at all times of the day . <p> When you 're on a ship that 's the length of three footy fields and 12 decks tall , there 's never a shortage of things to do , see , taste and try for the kiddies . <p> There were two things we were really excited about going on the cruise as a family ; the opportunity to participate in tons of fun activities , and for Kalyra to have lots of kids her own age to play with . <p> In no particular order , here is our list of kids activities <h> 1 . Mini-Golf <p> Kalyra had so much fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good at it for her age , even getting a hole-in-one . On Carnival , you have unlimited time and games to enjoy with the whole family <p> Kalyra teeing off <p> Daddy and Kalyra <h> 2 . Hit the Pools <p> It would n't be a cruise without hanging by the pool . And if your kiddies are anything like Kalyra , then there will be plenty of pool action . With two family friendly pools and spas on board , your kids can swim and play till their hearts are content <p> Kalyra lovin the poolKalyra and Daddy in the pool <h> 3 . Youth Programs <p> One of the great things about Carnival Spirit was the kids club ( youth programs ) . Not only will your kids love the activities and hanging out with other kids their own age , but its a welcome time out for us busy parents . <p> There are three different youth programs catering to different ages : <p> Camp Carnival where kids ages 2-11 have their own space , games , paints , crayons , scavenger hunts , and pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counselors were fantastic . <p> Club 02 . Teens 15 " 17 gather in their own lounge area to play the latest video games , dance on the state-of-the-art dance floor , or just relax and chat with friends at the non-alcoholic drink bar . <h> 4 . The Waterpark <p> What will be the largest waterpark at sea in Australia was a " splash " with Kalyra . This area is more for the younger kids and it includes a mini-slide and giant splash bucket . And with an elevated position on the ship parents can relax with a book and an awesome ocean view whilst your kids have fun in the sun <p> Kalyra on the leftDaddy and Kalyra <h> 5 . The Water slides <p> Twister <p> Twist your way down in the yellow twister water slide that 's great for all kids , but especially the younger ones .

Eat Yummy Food <p> With food options galore for breakfast , lunch , and dinner your kids will not want for anything . In particular , the La Playa Grille is an international food court with a plethora of options . <p> But if the four restaurants are not enough , the- 24 hour Pizza and Ice Cream in the Lido is a hit and the room service in your cabin or on your balcony makes for a fantastic experience <h> 7 . The Chocolate Extravaganza Buffet <p> Your kids will not wont to miss this . Its a chocolate lovers heaven . Just think chocolate and they can create it <p> chocolate smorgasborgchocolate fountainso many cakesso yummy <h> 8 . Enjoy Quality Time with Mum and Dad <p> Are you a busy family ?

See a Family Friendly Show <p> From family friendly comedy shows to live entertainment of singing , dancing , and games throughout the day and after dinner , your kids will love all that is on offer . <h> 10 . Land Based Activities <p> Not only is there unlimited fun on board for the kids , but take advantage of the land based activities at your port of call . Our Carnival Spirit cruise was to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico and we enjoyed a 4+4 jeep adventure , family time at the beach , and yummy food options from the locals <p> Now just imagine doing this in the Pacific Islands or New Zealand <p> Jeep adventure in Cabofun at the beach in Cabofun in the sandKalyra admiring her shipfun in the Mexico sunDaddy and Kalyrayummy nachos in Cabodelicious fish tacos in Cabo <h> The Facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2012 with various cruises throughout the Pacific Islands and New Zealand . <p> Looks amazing ! We will have a 4 and just 1 year old when looking at our next holiday . Would you say what a few more years before going on a cruise with the little one ? A concern that makes us want to hold of on a cruise for a few years , is the sleeping arrangements . Is it lights out for everyone in the cabin , including us parents at 8pm ? haha . When we go to Asia we can hire a babysitter at a very good price if we want to go out for dinner alone , but on a cruise are they expensive ? And on land we have a drink of wine on the balcony etc . Our older son could be up a bit later at night , but if our little one will only be 1 , he will really need to sleep . Your advice would be much appreciated . Oh , and its stroller friendly I assume ? = thank you in anticipation ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bit of a headache getting it around . I would say hold off for a couple of years with the little one . They can go in the kids Club when they are 2 , so it is worth waiting till then . That way you can have some down time with both of them having fun with new friends . The kids Club goes till 10:30 at night too , so there is ample opportunity for you to kick up your heels . You can hire a babysitter after that time and I found it pretty reasonable per hour . I think it was around $11 ? ? If you get a connecting cabin it makes it easier for sleeping with the kids , but more expensive . We did n't  have much of a problem when it came time for sleeping as teh girls were so tired they just flaked . <p> Hi Guys thanks for the info has been very helpful .

We are leaving Sydney and heading to Vanuatu/New Caledonia and its our first time ever on a cruise .

The last thing I wanted was for Kalyras appendix to burst whilst we were on a long drive in the middle of nowhere . <p> We were in Winton , our favourite town in Outback Queensland , and had been up most of the night with Kalyra feeling sick and crying in pain from a sore tummy . <p> At 4.00am , it got to the point where she would wince at a gentle touch of her tummy and I decided she needed looking at by a doctor or nurse , but had no idea if a hospital or medical centre existed out here . <p> Winton has a population of 900 odd people and is a 1,355km drive from Brisbane. - This was our second visit to Winton and I did n't  recall ever noticing a Hospital , or even a sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory Hotel <p> I grabbed my phone and did a quick Google search and to my delight a Winton Hospital was listed , but the opening hours stated- 0800 to 1700 . I decided to call anyway and thankfully a nurse answered the phone . <p> After a short discussion about Kalyras condition , she suggested we bring her in for observation . Still half a sleep I grabbed my keys and Kalyra and headed for the hospital . Savannah was still asleep , she 's a bugger to get to sleep but once down will sleep through most things , so Caz stayed at the hotel with her . <p> Upon arrival at the hospital , we were greeted by the friendly nurse I spoke with over the phone . All the initial- checks and questions were carried out and the nurse decided she needed to see the doctor who would be in later on that morning as hed already been in overnight attending another patient . <p> This doctors name now escapes me , but he carried out more tests , asked more questions , and decided that Kalyra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 8am . <p> Dr Bryce arrived shortly after 8am , was friendly and playful with Kalyra , and reassured her everything would be ok . He did his checks and looked at the results from the previous tests and said everything was pointing towards it being her appendix . <p> The signs were there she had no appetite the night before , did n't  touch her dinner at all , and had stomach pain in the exact location of her appendix , but he couldnt be 100% certain , just yet . <p> He then ran me through some scenarios of getting a complete diagnosis . <p> First option was to drive back to Longreach , a two-hour drive away , and have a scan done they did n't  have the equipment in Winton . But they only did scans on certain days and today was an off day , but he said it would only take a phone call and it would be possible , especially considering she was a child . <p> But , he thought it was too early in her sickness for a scan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was then that he mentioned Townsville or Mount Isa ( 5-hour drive further west ) , as they both had scanning equipment and surgeons who could take care of it if it was , in fact , her appendix . <p> Neither of these options seemed appealing due to being LONG drives with an 8-year-old with a potential burst appendix on our hands . <p> It was time to pick up Caz , get her to the hospital and figure this out . <p> Kalyra was quite teary at this stage as I left to grab Caz from our hotel , not so much about the pain which had eased thankfully , but of all this talk of hospitals and surgeons and not understanding what was happening . <p> Kalyra in Winton Hospital <p> When I arrived back with Caz we had a long discussion with the doc and again he ran through the options : going to Longreach for a scan , driving straight to Townsville or Mount Isa where they could take care of everything , or staying in Winton and monitoring the situation . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue , and whilst he assured us driving to Townsville would n't be risky as we had a big enough window of time to get there without complications , we were unsure of our next move ! <p> So he suggested we stay in the hospital in Winton , get some blood tests done that would show if it was just a virus , and monitor the situation . If she did deteriorate and it turned out to be her appendix , they could put her on medication to ease the pain and stabilise her until the RFDS arrived to fly her to Rockhampton . <p> The RFDS had n't  even entered my mind , partly because I was still half asleep from being up most of the night , and partly because I did n't  know it was available for situations like this and its not a service I 'd ever thought I 'd be calling on . <p> " They would fly here ? " I questioned . <p> " Yes , they fly everywhere , all they need is a strip of grass to land . Once I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive , but we could stabilize her and shed be fine " , he reassured us ! <p> If you 're not familiar with the RFDS , Ive taken this straight from their website : <p> The Royal Flying Doctor Service is one of the largest and most comprehensive aeromedical organisations in the world , providing extensive primary health care and 24-hour emergency service to people over an area of 7.3 million square kilometres . <p> Using the latest in aviation , medical and communications technology , the Royal Flying Doctor Service works to provide emergency medical and primary health care services to anyone who lives , works or travels in rural and remote Australia.The RFDS has 63 national aircraft covering the length and breadth of the country . <p> The RFDSs emergency retrieval service operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , delivering the finest care to more than 290,000 Australians each year . <p> I cant tell you how reassuring it was to hear that we had the RFDS to call upon . <p> To know that we could keep Kalyra in Winton and stay under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , somewhat risky drive to Townsville was music to our ears ! <p> Not only is the RFDS delivered by a dedicated team of passionate and caring professionals , but the service is FREE. - And not only would they fly Kalyra for free to the nearest regional hospital , but one parent as well . That 's AMAZING ! <p> Kalyra- spent all day in the hospital and the following night under observation with Caz in a bed beside her , and I took Savannah back to our hotel . The following morning we met with the doc again , and thankfully , he had good news . <p> Kalyra had improved considerably over this 24 hour period and the blood test results came back clearing her of appendicitis and pointing towards a virus , and she was discharged with a full bill of health , healthy enough that she could have gone to school in fact . <p> We do n't  know how she got this virus or what it was , but were very grateful that Kalyra was fine , and although we did n't  require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fantastic organisation exists in our country that helps so many people in need each year . <p> It sure was reassuring knowing that they were just a phone call away ! <p> Although we did n't  need you , to everyone at RFDS , we would like to say a BIG thank you for what you do for the rural areas and Outback region of Australia . We gladly just made a donation online. - <p> And to Doctor Bryce and his staff at Winton Hospital , you guys were fantastic with Kalyra , your care and attention first class and again its reassuring to know that you can go to a hospital in a rural area of Australia , and receive such great care . 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Wow .

Second , what a fantastic organization the RFDS is , its great to know such an organization exists and I wonder if there are any other countries that have services like this <p> The U.K. has various regional Air Ambulances that are involved in rural medical emergencies &amp; in areas where to drive would take more time than is wise for the patients care . I live in Northern Ireland where we have just lobbied to have an Air Ambulance for the province , which will be shared with the Republic of Ireland , which is excellent . <p> These services are provided free of charge however they are not government funded &amp; rely 100% on business support , fundraising &amp; sponsorship . I hope I never have to use one , but I am so grateful they are there . <p> Oh poor little Kalyra . It must have been so worrying for you and Caz being so far from anywhere . Thank goodness you werent somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RFDS is a fantastic organisation and must save the lives of so many people living in the outback . I would also tip my hat to them . Happy travels ! <p> It was worrying at first when he mentioned her appendix and driving to Townsville , I 'm like what ? ? ? But having the RFDS as a backup plan definitely eased our minds . Massive hat tip to all those involved ! ! <p> Thanks for sharing such an important story , Craig . The RFDS is a wonderful service that provides peace of mind to thousands of people living in remote parts of Australia . <p> Did you know that Alice Springs , Northern Territory is home to the Royal Flying Doctors Service ? You can visit their museum in Alice Springs , and even the memorial site for John Flynn , founder of the RFDS . <p> Since you and Kalyra ( thankfully ) did n't  get to ride on the RFDS plane , make sure you visit the RFDS museum in Alice Springs one day where you can hop on board RFDS plane under much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind right there . Yes we visited the RFDS museum in Alice Springs briefly on our trip around Oz after visiting Uluru . Such an awesome organisation , but like I said , they did n't  even cross my mind in Winton due to being half asleep and not thinking her condition relevant . <p> Ive been evacuated twice by the RFDS and fundraise for them . Anyone travelling away from population centres in Australia needs to know about the RFDS . They run clinics and may other services apart from the free evacuation service . One was Tibooburra Moomba Adelaide ; the other was Yulara to Alice Springs ( after an ambulance ride to reach there and an emergency operation before I could be loaded into the aircraft ) . Let everyone know hopefully people will donate so the service continues . <p> A beautiful letter , a great result and a fantastic team at Winton hospital . When my husband was first sick he flew with RFDS to Townsville and when he returned to Winton four months later , RFDS brought him back . My grandson ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the night a few years ago and couldnt have been cared for any better if hed still been in hospital . If this Dr Bryce is the one who attended me in 2014 then I know exactly how safe and secure you and your family felt and his sense of humour is to be experienced to be believed . He also explained , with his wealth of knowledge and care , what was happening to me during my stay there . <p> Hi Wendy , thanks for sharing your story and glad to hear you also had a pleasant experience with RFDS in a time of need . I 'm not sure if it was the same doctor as he has n't  been in Winton that long . But either way , all of the staff were fantastic ! <p> I think the RFDS is an amazing service and has saved and continues to save so many lives . I can imagine how scary it is living on an isolated property and having no medical attention nearby . It would be amazing to have them fly you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winton under medical care and not have to drive her back to Townsville . That would have been a nightmare . <p> So wonderful to hear Kalyra is OK . I live in outback Queensland in a small Opal mining town , Yowah . We are fortunate to have the wonderful doctors and nurses of the RFDS fly into us every Friday for consultations and anytime there is an emergency . Each doctor specialises in certain fields . Their service and dedication is second to none . God Bless and thankyou to the RFDS <p> " hit enter before finish " To continue I want to say glad all finish well and she is fine This is amazing and inspiring blog I 'm passing for financial difficulties but as soon will get back on my feet will plan a travel . Gratitude = 
@@21820960 @1820960/ <h> The Journey to New Orleans <p> As professional travelers we find it really easy to make last minute travel decisions . There is so much freedom in knowing that we can decide to go somewhere on a whim and not have to worry about where were going to stay and what were going to do . We just know how to do all that and feel very confident in turning up in a town and having all the pieces fall into place perfectly without the stress of planning weeks or even months in advance . <h> Journey to New Orleans <p> The journey to New Orleans , French Quarter on the bus <p> So this morning we decided the city of New Orleans would be our travel destination . We scrapped Puerto Rico as it was going to rain there everyday and we just werent that inspired by it . We had intended to visit New Orleans on the year that Katrina hit , so that wiped out our plans . <p> This would be the perfect time for us to visit now . A couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the beach to enjoy the spectacularly and unusual warm April weather they are going to be having over the next week . Hurray for the return of the sun . <p> Luckily we scored a great deal on a hotel room for just $50 in the French Quarter just a street back from the action of- Bourbon Street , infamous for its drunken debauchery especially during Mardi Gras . Craig works for Delta which means we get free flights to anywhere around the world on standby . We quickly packed our bags and left on our 3 night adventure . <p> It felt so comfortably exciting to put the backpack on again , like I had finally returned home . We managed to get on both flights with fantastic roomy seats and free cocktails . <h> Arriving in New Orleans <p> Our bus journey was a little shocking before we arrived at the historical center of New Orleans . <p> Craig and I are backpackers by heart and are so used to roughing it that we did not find a problem with jumping on the local bus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sore thumb- pretty stupid ones from some of the " You must be crazy " stares we received . The bus driver was sure to give us strict walking instructions on how to get to our hotel after he let us ride for free , probably as a reward for our bravery stupidity . <p> We 've traveled through the wilds of Africa and through some scary , dodgy places so we feel pretty brave to venture into some areas and do things that others wont . I 'm not sure whether its because now I 'm a mother and a bit more cautious and protective but the bus ride into town and the couple of blocks walk to our hotel had my heart thumping with fear . <h> Surprised at the poverty of New Orleans <p> We were stunned and shocked by the level of poverty we saw riding into town . We remembered when we saw on the news during Hurricane Katrina how it looked like something you would see in Africa . This was really the reality that we saw right now . Dilapidated houses and US style shanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rubbish was strewn about everywhere and we had to walk past gangs of street youth and doped out looking homeless people . <p> Part of traveling we love so much is the journey you experience arriving to a place , getting local transport , talking with the locals and witnessing the reality of life for everyday people . For us that is part of the adventure and it was a pretty scary and shocking one today . I really recommend that unless you are used to this kind of a ride , get the shuttle bus into town for your trip to New Orleans . We certainly will when its time to leave . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805

@@21820968 @1820968/ <h> Meet Poi and Kirsty : First time travelers <p> Poi and Kirsty are a young English couple who are getting ready to go on their first round the world adventure together . Poi and Kirsty are a great travel find and already have the traveling spirit . I love reliving through their blog posts , the excitement that comes with first time travel . And I cant wait to read about their traveling life . <h> Who are Poi and Kirsty ? <p> Well I am Poi , aka Chris , but not to many people . - I am 22 years old , English and I am currently one of those boring people who works full time Monday to Friday and lives Poi and Kirsty <p> for the weekend . At the time of writing this I live with 3 good friends . However , this coming weekend I am returning home to my parents for the last two months before our trip to spend some quality time ' but mainly just to save some money . <p> Kirsty is ginger , likes purple and doing whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just finished 4 years at Aston University in Birmingham and is currently working a full time job in a call centre in Telford . - We both consider Lincoln home , despite neither of us being born here , we spent most of our childhood here . <p> We have been a couple for two years now after 4 years of friendship , it 's going well or a least I think it is ? <h> What inspired you both to decide to leave the comfort of the conventional box , to travel around the world ? <p> It 's something I have wanted to do for a long time and if I am being completely honest , there were times when I thought it was just one of those things I never thought I would get round to doing . Being with Kirsty though who also wanted to travel ( after a bit of time debating it ) made us just take the plunge and book a non-refundable one way flight to China . <p> Plus " Work sucks right ? <h> What has the reaction of your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive of the idea , he had a couple of opportunities he turned down when he was younger to travel so I think in a way he feels as though I am doing it for him . I have a few friends who also want to , so on the whole the reaction from everyone has been positive however there is always a few people who try to put your plans down , jealousyit 's a bitch . <h> What are your travel plans for your round the world adventure ? How have you chosen your destinations ? <p> Fun with Kirsty <p> Our travel plans are very vague at the minute but that 's how we want them . So far we have a one way flight booked to Beijing and the first few nights in a hostel arranged , after that , who knows . We chose Beijing as our starting point as Kirsty has always wanted to visit China and it seemed like the obvious place to start especially as south East Asia was on my list of places , so it worked out quite nicely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to South East Asia and hang around there for a while . <p> To begin with we were going to spend a set amount of time in Asia before going to Australia within the year but that seems to have gone out of the window , we still plan on going there but who knows when . <p> We have been very distracted by looking after our website and forgot for a while we actually have to go on the trip we keep writing about . We 're getting better though , the last few weeks we 've kicked ourselves up the arse a bit and started doing the necessary arrangements . We 've also entered a competition to win 365 free nights in Radisson hotels which would obviously affect our trip hugely , so if you can spare 20 seconds , please vote . <p> I think we are more prepared than we think , it 's amazing how much we 've learnt from all you experienced travellers by just spending a couple of hours here and there clicking through travel blogs . <h> Do you plan on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? <p> We plan on working anywhere we possibly can along the way doing anything we can . Part of leaving our plans so open was to allow for this , we do n't want to be forced into turning down opportunities because we have already planned to be somewhere . So if someone can offer us work for a while we want to be able to say yes ( within reason of course ) . <p> We want this trip to last for as long as possible and with no ties to pull us back to the UK we will do anything we can to prolong it whilst we 're away . Although Kirsty might disagree and say anything but working in a call centre . <h> What do you have hoped to achieve by the end of your travels ? <p> The main thing for me personally would be to not come back feeling like I missed out on anything . - I do n't mean doing all the extreme sports and such like but more the What Poi likes to get up to at the weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not very shy but when it comes to new cultures it might be too easy to say no to a lot of things and I hope to force myself to get stuck in to everything around me . <h> What 's the best travel advice you have received so far about traveling the world ? <p> Do it solo ? I 'm planning on breaking the news to Kirsty sometime this week . <p> Really though , it gets said a lot but travelling slowly , as time goes on our plans get less and less restricted and even now the sense of freedom is getting to me and we have n't even started yet . <p> Also just have fun ' is a great piece of advice for anything including travelling . <h> Why travel ? <p> This one is quite easy as I woke up the other morning and thought to myself I am so glad I have something planned ' . The idea of waking up every Monday morning and working until Friday , doing my own thing at the weekend and repeating for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when put like that , how can anybody find it appealing ? <p> What I have learnt over the last couple of years planning is that it 's not for everybody though , we have friends who are settling down with houses , kids etc and they are really genuinely happy because it 's what they 've always wanted . I just hope more people consider travelling as a real option and actually look into it rather than it just being one of those things I wish I could do ' 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 
@@21820969 @1820969/ <h> I 'm Not Afraid to Take a Stand For My Dreams <p> My second biggest passion after travel is music . My dream in life ( and always will be ) , is to be a rock star . However , there are a couple of things standing in my way . <p> When I was at University , I had to pass a music class as primary school teachers are expected to teach music.I had to practice my Doh Reh Me tunes with the assistance of a computer program in order to pass a basic singing test . After my 111th attempt to hit Doh the computer politely told me that it was best if I took a break and come back another day . <p> I have still not returned , yet that does not stop me from singing my heart out in the car or shower and being totally moved and inspired by music and the stories that lie behind them . <p> At the moment , I am loving Eminems new song " I 'm not Afraid . " - Its about Eminems return to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song he talks of not giving a rats about what his critics say and that he is back to stand up for his dreams . Its about him reclaiming his power , which others ( including his own demons ) tried to take from him . <p> " Cause ai n't  know way Ima let you stop me from causing mayhem When I say Ima do somethin I do it I do n't  give a damn what you think , I 'm doin this for me Ima be what I set out to be , without a doubt undoubtedly and all those who look down on me Im tearing down your balcony " <p> Songs like this fire me up to continually strive to live my dreams and to tell those dream destroyers who constantly stand in your way to get lost . Dream killers are irrelevant to you and your life . Your life is your life , and your dreams are there for you to live and stand up for . Each time you allow a negative comment made by somebody else effect you , you allow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to them and saying " No , this is my life and my dreams , you will not have a say in them . Do n't  tell me what I can and cant do , " is reclaiming your power . <p> When I hear this song I think of all those people who want to start traveling but are afraid to go . I think of those who allow the naysayers to feed their fears and convince them to not follow their dreams . This is unacceptable . Never allow anyone else to define your life or limit what you are capable of . Someone else will always set the bar lower for your life then you ever would . And if you 're like Eminem and made a mess of your life , its not too late to change it ; all that matters is NOW . Reclaim your power . <p> " And I just ca n't keep livin this way , so starting today I 'm breaking out of this cage I 'm standing up to face my demons I 'm mannin up , Ima hold my ground I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my life back together right now . " <p> So if it is your dream to travel the world , then just do it . There 's no reason why you cant . If its your dream to write a bestselling book , then do it . If you want to climb Mt Everest then think of all the reasons why you can and do it . Whatever it is you want to do in life , go and do it , because you can and nobody can ever tell you otherwise . Stand up for your dreams , they are worth it and do not be afraid . You are reclaiming your power . We promise that we will hold your hand with encouragement and inspiration the whole time . <p> " I 'm not afraid , to take a stand everybody come take my hand well walk this road together Through the storm Whatever weather , cold or warm just letting you know that you 're not alone Holler if you feel like you 've been done the same road " <p> Reclaim your power and become King of your world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came time for our group singing , I received a 4/5 , while my 3 friends who could not stop laughing at my horrible attempts at singing , passed with 3s .

I love posts like this , because I get so frustrated when people say to me , " I wish I had your life " or " I wish I could travel . " And I always respond , " What 's stopping you ? ? ? " People forget how powerful they are and that when they put their minds to something they CAN accomplish it . <p> Lovely sentiments from some of the loveliest travel bloggers I know . On a similar musical theme , this post reminds me of a lyric from one of my favourite bands , The Hold Steady ; Yes , dreams can cost some money , but money costs some dreams. Banishing those anxieties is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold me back at the moment from following in your footsteps is how to convince my partner to opt for a life on the road , or at least for a trail period of living abroad . I 'm a little jealous of you guys and how you 've made it work together ! I look forward to seeing you pack out stadiums one day for that ultimate travel n music lifestyle combo ! <p> Thank you Jools , such lovely comments . Craig and I are lucky that our dreams match , we know how difficult it is to have two people wanting to become nomads . We are also doubly lucky that Kalyra seems to enjoy traveling . I do n't  think she had much chance otherwise . Maybe just start with baby steps for your partner . Small trips at a time and then the idea of living abroad might become more enticing . <p> Great post ! I recently wrote a post on " Rewriting your Story " It does n't  matter how long you 've been doing something , when you decide that you want it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it happen ! Sometimes we mess up , but what matters is the moment you take a stand and decide that its going to be different . People do n't  realize the power behind that . <p> In regards to Jools I met a boy that was amazing and he had returned from backpacking Europe with his dad for 3-weeks when we met . We had a dream to travel for extended periods of time , but whenever it came time to take actionable steps towards that dream , he failed to deliver every time . WE had a long history togeather for 4-years and something came up that made me see everything in a whole new light . We just wanted different things out of life and even though we had a great healthy relationship we were both compromising what we wanted out of life to be togeather . So I broke up with him . Now weve both gone our separate ways and I cant tell you how much happier I am with life and living . I thought he was my happiness , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most importantly making my dreams come true . If your dream is to go travel , then you need to go do it , otherwise you 'll always regret it and maybe even possibly resent them for it . <p> Great advice Jenny . Sacrificing your dreams does make for some extra challenges to overcome . You just have to try to make sure you will have no regrets later . I always try to live my life so I have no regrets . Regret is my least favourite emotion . <p> I think when you take a stand for your dreams you understand that failure is just a part of the experience . It makes it easier to put it behind you , learn the lesson and move forward . Once you say " Yes ! " to your dreams , incredible things start happening for you , with the least amount of effort on your behalf . Its like you are riding a giant wave into shore , no freestyle needed . <p> I love encouraging posts like this . It is so common to find people putting obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passions . The best thing you can do is believe in those dreams and believe in yourself and go for it . For me its better to attempt your dreams ( even if they 're not as successful as you want them to ) and be satisfied that you did it , than sit around and beat yourself with the " what ifs " . <p> I was watching Oprah yesterday ( haha ! yes , I watch Oprah ) and she was talking about not " dimming your inner light " and not lowering yourself to satisfy others . Keep your dreams up , own yourself , and get the most of it . <p> It took me a little while after graduating college to come to the same conclusion ; You have to follow your dreams no matter what . It is so easy to get sucked into a job you do n't  like and settle for things that do n't  make you happy . Following your dreams is never easy , but you must do it to be truly happy . Thanks for posting this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no regrets . A study has been done that shows the thing that most people say on their death bed is " I wish I had of taken more risks " Following your dreams is a massive risk but the rewards will be extraordinary . Your dreams are there because they reflect your true purpose , that is why you become so happy when you follow them . Thanks for appreciating and leaving a comment Alex <p> I 've always looked at it this wayIts reasonable that people are afraid or lack the confidence to go after their goals , especially when it requires standing up against everyone and everything around them . We are told from day 1 how to live our lives and what we should strive for and its no easy task to take that inner spark of a dream and decide to turn it into reality . <p> But the beauty is , the hardest part is simply making that decision to go for it . Once we are able to do that , then everything literally becomes possible ! <p> Ha Ha . Lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never = The decision is always the hardest part . Once you decide to stand up for your dreams , the weight is lifted and your free to start creating . Always say Yes ! <p> Great post . I agree with Andi in that I hate when people say , " I wish I could just quit my job and travel for a year " as though someone just gave us a stack of cash and said " GO ! " We made it happen because that was our top priority . We sacrificed TONS to be able to do it . <p> Its all about doing what YOU want to do . Some may say its selfish , but hey , its your life , do what you want with it . I try my hardest not to judge anyones way of life . If traveling is your way of life , then do it . If your passions involve music or sports or teaching or raising a family , that 's great , too . <p> I talked a lot about this in my latest post about reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole process is that everyone should just do what makes them happy , not what you 're " supposed " to do or what society tells you to do , what YOU want to do . <p> Great response Adam . Craig and I used to get so mad when people spoke about how " lucky " we were . WTF ? There was no fairy godmother who threw a wad of cash in our laps . We both made sacrifices- massive ones which enabled us to take advantage of the opportunities that are there for everyone to grab . I 'm all for selfishness . I mean really ? Isnt your life about you ! Go live it how you want to . I make an effort to never judge anyones choices on how they choose to live their life . My responses are usually " That sounds awesome , " or " good on ya , " " go do it , cant wait to hear about it . " As long as you are happy I do n't  care what you do with your life- you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest post by the way = <p> Been wanting to comment on this all day , finally getting to it . Your passion for music is obvious , a great lesson to anyone who wants to break out . Too often , we settle for a watered-down life and accept this is how it should be . I agree with Andi what 's stopping you ? Only yourself .

There is still much for me to figure out , but I am on my way . <p> Ive grown so tired of caring about how many people are reading my posts , if my traffic is increasing , are there comments , are people sharing it , will Google ever love me , have I stumbled today , what about helped others out in forums , checking emails , making money , getting annoyed at major corporations who just do n't  get it and want to take advantage of bloggers all the time , and the constant fighting that goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is travel , share it with others , and interact in a fun community . <p> Its all this other stuff that just takes over and steals the joy away . <p> I 'm no longer basing my success on that . Its all about <h> " Did I make a difference in the life of someone else today ? " <p> And that is all that counts . <h> Are you Living a Half-Filled Life <p> I saw Wayne Dyerspeak in person last week . If you do n't  know who he is , I 'd encourage you to discover his words of wisdom and his gentle spirit . He lives his life mission of making sure we all become aware of the " AM that I AM " the greatness that resides in all of us and to know how to get in touch with that . ( Many thanks to Lina for taking me with her ) <p> And in doing so making sure that we do not stop the world knowing that we have lived a half-filled life . <p> Spending your days worrying and steeped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Caring and allowing your life to be dominated by things that do n't  inspire you or fill you with joy is living a half filled life . <p> The stuff was dragging me down . I 'm learning to free it up and focus on just the things that make me feel the joy , which is why I 'm doing this in the first place . <p> Part of that for me , means approaching that subject that terrifies me . <p> The quality of my writing . <p> Quite frankly it stinks . <p> And I know that I have control over my own life . I could wallow around in my own self-pity , and in true masochistic form , hang out with those that are better than me and start stopping the world , because I am such a failure I really need to jump . <p> Or I can do something proactive about it . <p> Wayne Dyer has taught me to spend my days focusing on that which I want to be in the form of already being it . <p> So from now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ive already achieved that , I 'm just waiting for my hands to catch up to that truth . <p> Instead of feeling inferior to those who are better than me , I 'm letting them instead inspire and teach me . <p> I completed a freelance travel writing course last weekend which gave me some confidence to know I can do it . ( And if you are interested in freelance writing , then watch this space as I am going to share my journey with you through vlogs ) <p> I have armed myself with books and courses on writing in the hopes that some of their magic will rub off on me . <p> And I have forcibly removed myself from all but one online group . Its a group that still maintains the spirit of positivity and helpfulness . <p> The focus is not getting involved in petty arguments , but improving my craft in order to provide a better experience for those who want to travel the world and life a full life . <h> The Travel Itch is a Respinning of the World <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the world and jump off . Its that itch that wont go away , the urge to quit our jobs , sell all our possessions in search of . <p> None of us really know , we just know we need to stop our old ways as they are causing us to lead a half filled life . We need to sit back , take stock and allow the answers to the questions to come to us . <p> Its only then that we learn how to respin the world into the full life we all desire . <p> I do n't need to stop the world . I just need to learn to spin it a new way <h> Have you learned to respin the world into the full life you desire ? <p> P.S I will be sharing a lot about what I have learned lately and throughout my life on living a full lifeat Mojito Mother . Come join me over there to learn more . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> " All I wanted to do was sleep , play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bleating giggles . " <p> I can totally relate to this post , and especially to this line , as my daughter offers a similar sense of playful escape for me . Weve been working so hard trying to get GGT big enough to monetize that Ive been sick for over a month now , and both my writing and our numbers are suffering as a result . I 'm honestly tired of caring , and other circumstances beyond my control have me switch my focus to other things at the moment . I keep reminding myself " Whatever will be , will be , " and staying focused on our central mission to make the world a better place , and hopefully everything will work out for the best . Glad you 're taking steps towards finding your own happiness . <p> Our children are such a blessing . They keep me grounded and motivate me to create a joyful life together as a family . <p> I 'm sorry to hear that you 've had a rough month as well . You are doing such an awesome job and are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think we have to have peaks and troughs . The troughs are just helping us to gather up the steam we need to reach the peak again . <p> I think I am dropping the caring about the things that do n't  matter . I only check my stats once a week now which has been truly liberating . I 'm achieving so much more because my time and energy is going to those things that I really care about . Its hard to let go like that but you need to . <p> Let go and trust . You and Mary are making the world a better place already , just by being in it = <p> What a pleasure to read this on a Monday morning ! I especially like the part about why one writes , for the joy of community and not stats . Were still new at this game but I started getting overwhelmed with the idea that maybe what were writing is useless , etc but then I simply ignored and started enjoying myself . And if someone reads , than that 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend saying he s now going to a travel show because of something I wrote . It brings you a smile and shows you the real reason were doing this ; for our love of travel and to spread the passion ! Thanks Caz ! <p> They are the best messages to get Caro ! Makes you realize that what you are doing is important and it does n't  have to be on a large scale . Sometimes we complicate things and put too much pressure on ourselves . I 'm learning just to let go and trust that things will work out for me , if I just focus on doing the things I love then it can only work out . <p> Such honesty and transparency . I love it . Ive been there , we all have . I was at a similar spot just a couple months ago . There are a lot of questions that often come . Sometime its just needing to get away , but sometimes its much deeper . For me , it meant that it was time to reinvent my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation where my passions , purpose , and skills collide and I find myself much happier and feeling like I 'm living purposeful as a result . You guys are so loved and respected in the travel community , I 'm sure you 'll get the affirmation and support to help you . Look forward to seeing how you guys continue to evolve ! <p> Thanks Spencer ! You know I adore you . And you are definitely an example for so many of us to follow . <p> I think its so important to pay attention to the questions , not the answers . Accept that the answers will come if you open up to it and allow them to arrive in their own time . That 's the problem is having the patience to wait and not get frustrated . And then finding the courage to act on the answers ! <p> Well I adore you guys too ! You hit on a great point about paying attention to the questions . I think that 's half the battle is realizing that there are questions that need to be answered , yet being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to this point , but I 'm one to walk up to the cliff and look down , but then take a few steps back and get a running start and jump . The outcome is n't always as planned , since there is n't always a plan , but with some course correcting , I get headed down the right path . For me , its been about making sure that I make the necessary tweaks when I realize what they are and not continue on in unhappiness or without purpose . So often people get comfortable and they just continue on as they are because its what they know . As scary as it can be , the process of evolving can really be exciting and I look forward to see how you guys , evolve , adapt , and innovate . <p> I definitely have that stop the world feeling right now ! I travel blog for a hobby , not for a business , because I cant imagine me ever caring much about statistics &amp; google rankings etc . I also work full time while launching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ( though I know it will be worth it in the end ) . <p> Then days like yesterday happen when work blows up at me for being late in traffic , and they got upset at me because I do n't  stress over traffic ( because I ca n't change or control it ) . I do n't  have the time to care how others feel right now , as horrible as that sounds , but unfortunately until my business is up and running I have to pretend I do , making it harder to respin the world how I want it to be . <p> I have been going through this for the past 10 months on and off ever since my dad got i 'll . Its horrible . Its a sick cycle of worry and anxiety and it does nothing good for you or anyone around you . The worst part is knowing that and still not being able to get out of your own head . I felt pretty dead inside because things that I cared about no longer really meant anything to me and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea at all what to do with myself . Traveling slightly made it better , but honestly not much . A whole new set of anxieties came with being far away . Of course my health suffered too , i was sick for months on end and also gained a lot of weight . No fun . But I 've been working really hard at looking on the positive side of life and sometimes its hard but it helps . I got a juicer for my birthday and that has actually really helped too . Straight up vitamins from the source are a good thing ! I think you are being a bit too hard on yourself your writing is great , your blog is great and everyone adores you and your family . I know its hard to see that but its going to get better just keep plugging along and one day the world will be spinning in a better direction and you 'll wonder why you were so bummed out before . = <p> I 'm so sorry Beth . It sounds like you 've been put through the wringer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too overwhelming and challenging . I can understand why you want to stop the world wtih your dad being so sick . <p> After my recent surgeries its made me realize how important our health is . We need to be making it priority and that includes dealing with our stresses and trying to turn it around to peace and happiness . I think the juicer will be such a great start for you . I would so love a juicer- straight up vitamins , no sugar . <p> I recently discovered carrot and pineapple juice- sounds like a weird combo but so fresh and delicious . <p> This too shall pass will be our new mantra . here 's to a healthy and happy 2012 for all of us <p> I can completely relate and I 'm glad you have found some peace . I do n't  know how you guys have kept up with all the social media stuff for this long . I cant keep up with everything , so I choose what I feel is important . I recently wrote a post that helped me understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much about the outcome . <p> Focusing on our health is always a good decision and I have had to spend less time away from the computer in order to do this , but I feel great and would n't have it any other way . It sounds like you are on the right path . = <p> ITs been so hard . Youve maintained a pretty full on pace , especially with having Savannah and Kalyra . I 'm feeling so much better since I stopped caring about the outcome . Our sites have been crashing a bit lately and it has n't  even bothered me that they have been down . Before I would have thought it was the end of the world . <p> Caz , Thanks so much for your post . Lately , I have been feeling a bit lost . For me , a traditional job seems like such an easier path , but I know it would lead to a half-filled life and kill my travel dreams . I appreciate you opening up yourself and sharing your feelings . Today , you helped &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I keep thinking about the ease and certainity of a return to the job world , but really how will that keep me in joy . I love the blogging and I feel its what I should be doing but it is so so difficult . I think it will pay off eventually , just keep at it . You and Bret are doing amazing things <p> Heartwarming article Caz , one that 99.1% of the blogosphere can probably relate to ( even if they are n't  admitting to it ! ) . And your writing has a clarity and honesty that is refreshing , so do n't  stop . As an older Mum , I cant tell you how fast the child-rearing years go , and how much you sometimes yearn for them when they are over , so I can only commend you on taking time out to love , kiss , hug and snuggle with your littlies . Raising two new beautiful women is more important than blog stats . Keep writing but Keep Cuddling too = <p> You are so right- I love that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although that can be a very fightening thought . My girls are so lovely and they are my priority . I cant get enough of them at the moment . <p> I need to read this article once a week , forever . I struggle with the concept of writing for " an audience " , so , I 'm just writing for myself . If other people enjoy it , well , that 's just a bonus ! <p> Your writing is great , and as Laurence said , " heartfelt " . Most people , myself included , cant write that way ( yet ! ) . So , you 're already providing something unique to the world . Just remember to do what *you* want to do , and that family well and truly comes first . <p> A beautifully written and perfectly timed article , thank you Caz.It is reassuring to hear that you too query these feelings.Family is everything- Children grow up so quickly that it is important to enjoy every moment you can of their early years.You cant get them back ! <p> Wow ! What an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much sucked into the throws of what you describe its very interesting to see how parenthood and family changes your perspective and makes you thankful for the simplicity of things . Its something I realised when I came home from exile at Christmas you can do and go anywhere but you can never change who and where you came from . <p> Parenthood changes you in so many ways , Ways you never thought possible . You wo n't believe how overjoyed you get just by little things like your baby holding their own hands and a smile- Its amazing how as adults we do n't  really notice just how wonderful a smmile is but bring a baby in the room and you would stand on your head just to get one out of them . 
@@21820971 @1820971/ <h> So You Want to Be a Travel Blogger <p> Every now and then I like to check in here and write a post about travel blogging . It is relevant to a lot of readers , and it might just be relevant to you , the person who is sitting at home contemplating this travel blogging lifestyle . <p> A lifestyle that currently has me sitting at Sydney airport awaiting a flight to Bangkok for a week press trip after a week blog trip kayaking , surfing , and sunset harbour cruising in Sydney . <p> This blogging life is hard slog , with great sacrifices and for the first couple of years , little reward . <p> You have to totally dedicate your life to making this nomadic travel lifestyle a reality . <p> And I mean dedicate . <p> Say goodbye to sleep , to fancy cars , and luxurious items . Say goodbye to nights out with friends and family , and day trips as well . Say goodbye to time out , to conversations that do n't involve multi-tasking on the side of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late for me , I ca n't turn back . This is the life we committed ourselves to , the lives we have dreamed about for so long and slowly we can see them becoming a reality . <p> I do n't want to tell you go for it , start a blog , you 'll get free travel and live this glamorous life as it 's not the truth <p> but it could be . <p> It just depends on YOU . How much work do you want to put into it ? How much are you willing to allow your life to be overtaken by it ? <p> It depends on your MISSION . <p> Your WHY . <p> If you just want to do it to get free travel then I am going to help you out here by telling you FORGET it . It is not worth it . You will have to give up far too much just in order for you to gain free travel . <p> Time is far more valuable than money . <h> Dreams are Made For Keeping You Awake at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . There has to be a greater why . An itch that you just ca n't scratch . <p> A driving force within you telling you to be more , to do more , to make a difference . <p> And you just ca n't stop until you do . You just ca n't sleep until you do . <p> Because you KNOW that this is the path you were meant to walk , a path that is strewn with thorns and bristles and overgrown weeds that confuse you as to where it goes . <p> Your feet will bleed , your heart will ache , and you will be so so tired . But you 'll keep walking , hell , sometimes you 'll run , because you know that this thing you are doing is BIGGER than you and you ca n't stop it . <p> It is so much bigger than you that you will even agree to leave your children for a week . That is when the knife slices through your total being and you sit in an airport chair sobbing . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is my greatest sacrifice . It is why I ca n't stop ; will not stop . <p> Because my WHY is so much bigger than me . <p> It is so my daughters will have a mother who LOVES what she does . It 's so they can learn that THIS is the way we should live our life and to NEVER ever take second best . To NEVER let your dreams pass by because of fear or doubt , or tiredness . <p> It is so my daughters can spend the majority of their days with their mother and father experiencing the world together . <p> It is so they learn that the world is an amazing place , that whether we live in igloos in Alaska , sleep under the stars at night in a Bedouin camp , prostate to a GOD named Allah , or spend our days surfing waves , we are all far too similar than we are different . <p> It 's so they know that life is far better when you share it , and you CAN make a difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And so I say YES . I will dedicate my whole life to this . I will leave my children for a week . I will cry every day and this gigantic hole inside of me that longs for my arms to be wrapped around them will intensify to the point where I feel I ca n't breathe . <p> I will do all of this because I believe in that which is greater than myself . I believe what this sacrifice will eventually give us . <p> I have to believe in it ; otherwise I am wasting my time . <h> Yes . You can have this dream life of yours . <p> Absolutely ! There is NO reason why you ca n't . <p> You just need that reason WHY YOU CAN . It 's going to be a reason that hurts you . <p> It 's the ONLY way we commit and dedicate . <p> What 's your pain ? What 's your why ? <p> Until you get clear on that , until you accept that , you will never walk the path you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> My dream is n't to be a travel blogger , but a writer who travels and who inspires others to seek their own version of happiness . <p> My pain is not living near our family grandparents , cousins , nieces , nephews , and friends . My pain is constant goodbyes , but I do it , like you , because this is who I am made to be . I want my children to grow up to be who they were made to be , an its up to me to show them how . <p> Exactly . Your children may not listen to you much but they will follow what you do . So if you want them to live their dream and be happy then you have to do the same too . And that means taking the hurts and the sacrifices . That also teaches them that pain and sacrifice is a part of life , you just have to learn to deal with it rather than trying to hide it or run from it . You are doing an awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your children are extremely fortunate as they will grow up with enquiring minds , a expanded outlook of life and the tolerance to be global citizens . And great you can share your love of travel with them ! <p> Thank you so much . Its so great to hear that because often you worry about if you are making right decisions and doing the right thing for them . I think this is probably normal for a parent though . Worry and guilt suddenly entered my life when they arrived . <p> Once again Caz , you have nailed the subject matter right on the head . I decided to make this Jump due to my passion for travell . I made the decision in the middle of my plans to relocate to Malaysia . <p> WOW ! I was use to walking out the door w/ a backpack on a moments notice . <p> NOT ! This time , I was stuck with selling off 47 years of assets , checking immigration laws , settling with family , building a Fan page and still working on a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> I 'm in Malaysia now . Hopefully the " Little " free time will allow me to finish the Blog . <p> Now , with a soon to be family , I find myself travelling with my Partner in crime around S.E. Asia . Another huge turn of events . My head spun 180 degrees travelling with someone after 20 years of Solo . I was not in charge of wandering aimlessley around 3rd world countries . <p> But alas a solution . I would still travell with my fiance and Solo when she could not ( Dreaded vacation Limits ) . So , now I register a new domain name for us &amp; keep my own . Leaving a loved one behind is tough , you still think about it when you 're out there alone . <p> It takes a lot of support and patience . And it is not a free ride for a long time and never a free ride 100% <p> Thank you Kevin for your great comment . I certainly miss those days of just walking out with your backpack too ! Werent they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and I think about quitting , but when I think of the alternative I know I never will . There is nothing else that makes me feel so alive and fulfilled . Any other work or job leaves me to shout out " Oh fuck " when the alarm goes off in the morning telling me to go to a job I hate . I cant live a life like this so the sacrifices are worth it and I 'll keep on doing it . As long as we make sure we stop to smell the roses along the way . You enjoy your travels . I 'd love to be traipsing around SE ASia right now ! <p> Right to the point Caz and spot on . Successful Travel blogging is no different to any other kind of successful endeavour . It takes time , hard work , heartache , sacrifice and questions , lots of questions . I think that all too often were led to believe that blogging is a reasonably easy way to riches and a location independent lifestyle . But you 've hit the nail on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish for , there is no such thing as a free lunch even if you 're working your butt off . Keep paddling = <p> I thinnk you are right Jo , blogging does seem to have that easy road attached to it . I guess because anyone really can start a blog and have success with it , but that is all people are looking at . They are not taking the time to stop and look at what goes into it behind the scenes . I knew it would be a lot of work , but never realized just how much . I truly donot belive in overnight success . I think that usually those who appear to have this have had years of failure and learning before the overnight success came . <p> This is an excellent post that transcends beyond travel blogging . All the sacrifices you 've described could relate to so many other dreams and goals . Nothing in this world that 's worth having comes easy . That 's why when we achieve a goal it feels so good . <p> Awesome ! I keep finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going this is another thank you for re-inspiring me to stay on course . I 've needed what I 've been reading lately so thanks Caz . <p> Yahoo ! ! I am so happy Jeremy . I know so many times I have been given a huge boost up by what other people have written so I am happy to know that I have been able to return the favour . One big thing I really believe in is that we are all here on Earth to help each other and we are all so alike . I feel I know what others are going through because I go through the same and if I can do anything to help , then I am going to , including writing posts like this- some that can even be really personal . Onwards and upwards Jeremy ! You can do it . <p> I 'm sorry you were so sad Caz . I just got back from eight days in Japan and missed my three Candy kids too . Many of the other travel writers I was with spend six months a year away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all although a week or two here or there is fine : ) <p> Its all about striking a balance which will come in time and be easier as your babies get bigger . <p> I 'm sure we both have lots more travel adventures with our families ahead of us but if travel blogging is hindering that it might be time for a rethink . <p> I look forward to seeing you reaping more of the rewards you mention . You so deserve it : ) <p> Gosh I could not do six months . I guess everyone has their different crosses to bear and decisions to make . I guess that is one good thing about travel blogging is that you can often work it so you can take your children . It is much harder to leave Savannah than Kalrya , just because she is a bubs and does n't  understand and I fret that she will think I have abandoned her . But she was fine and happy as ever when I returned home . I guess it helps her to learn she can rely on others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a week again next week and I think that might be the last time I do it . Its just too hard for me . <p> Great post . I own a landscape business in Las Vegas that 's 14 hours days but with about 4 to 5 months I can do most of my work online.So I travel all over asia mostly because of its low cost.Im lucky to know a Captain for United and 2 Flight att for AA and Delta so flying is close to free to anywhere in the world.I read your blog and Do n't  ever look back and Wandering Earls Blogs.I remember going on a white water river trip in Malaysia that was a trip of a life time.I was thinking if I had to go back and write about it that would be a full job . So I just send pictures to my friends and daughter so they know I 'm still alive.Anything worth while is hard long hours of work . <p> You are so right Ken . I do n't  think we would get as much out of it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was thinking today how really anyone has to go through an apprenticeship of some sort before they even start their careers . So for me I consider the first few year of my blog my learning and preparation for it . I think I am ready for it the full time reality now . That is so great that you can spend a lot of time travelling with your landscape business . You are living a life of your choosing which is very liberating and inspiring to others . Thank you for sharing <p> So true , so true . Its hard to explain to a non blogger what all goes into this crazy blogging black hole . It is so much work and only worth it if you truly love it and want to get a message out . For us , we do it for every person that starts traveling and tells us we were their inspiration . Best Payment Ever ! <p> It is always funny to hear the reaction of those who are non bloggers , they totally do not get what we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we talk about it to explain to him again how it all works . I 'm sure my parents are still a little baffled even though they follow along with much enthusiasm and support . There is nothing better than receiving a message from a reader letting you know how you helped change their life somehow . It makes it all worthwhile <p> My plan is to invest in myself . I am confident that I can be a successful travel blogger , but successful does n't  necessarily mean generating an income . It would be nice if I did , but that 's not why I quit my job for a life on the road . I did it because I love to write and I love to travel . I took savings and invested in my future happiness . Whether or not I find success as a travel writer , I can never say I did n't  try . And if anything else , I will have a hell of a lot of awesome memories from an unforgettable year . So why not ? <p> There are so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself- brilliant , you are your greatest asset and you can only ever truly rely on yourself , make it the best you can . 2 . Why not ? I 've written a post on this before LONG ... I think it is one of the most powerful things you can ever say . It helps you to live a life of no regrets 3 . Its all about the memories- even the bad ones teach you something <p> Thanks so much for sharing Jill . And you are right , success means so many different things to different people and how you define that will define the actions you take <p> I love your encouraging response to my comment . This is what I love about the travel community . Everyone is insightful , encouraging , brave and brilliant . Thank you for taking the time out to assess my words . Im touched ! Also , I love the The Power of Why Not post . I read it sometime ago and decided that I definitely have a case of the why nots ! <p> We started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rtw trip over the next few years . Mainly for personal reasons ( the memory is n't what it was ) and for family &amp; friends and not for monetary gain . I would think that promoting a travel blog is a full time business , and not something you could contemplate whilst on the road . I guess that 's why many of the most popular travel blogs are n't  from people actually travelling full time as they 're too busy planning their next destination . I enjoy these blogs as the expertise and passion from these travel gurus makes for good reading . Also everybody needs to earn a buck , so if you love travel and you can get paid for it , go for it . Any tips on how to get readers for a new travel blog ? Your dedication and commitment shines through in your article Ta <p> Thank you ! I can never understand all the arguments that go on about making money off blogs- and its not just in the travel blog niche either , happens all the time in the mummy blog niche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get paid doing what you love . Isnt that what everyone wants , is n't that what everyone SHOULD be doing . Just think how great the world could be if we could contribute by doing what we love and are best suited to . That is why I am always so happy to hear of anyone doing it . What 's there to argue about ? <p> Promoting a blog is a full time business and there are so many who do n't  want to take that on and just enjoy writing and sharing their stories . This is awesome as well . Everyone has their purposes and own goals and they all need to be respected and valued . <p> I think the biggest tips for getting new readers is to guest post and to hang out where your readers hang out and engage in conversation with them/ Just make it fun and enjoyable . <p> Good luck on your journey , your trip sounds like fun and very inspiring ! <p> Amazing post , and exactly the emotions that flow through me everyday ! I want to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have realized it takes an extreme dedication to be a travel blogger ! Lately , I have fallen a little bit behind since I was lacking any internet . Until you have a steady base of visitors , it is important to stay constant with posts , social networks , and communication in general . Sure , I travel because I love it , but I want this to be my job , and Ive come to the conclusion I will get little sleep , miss out on some parties and such , but that is what it takes in the beginning . Thanks for the post , and it was a perfect read as I am getting back on the saddle ! <p> WE know what it is like to be disconnected . It can really be frustrating some times . <p> In one of those eternal debates betweeen travel bloggers and writers that you see going on everywhere , I saw a comment from a writer complaining how she could n't believe how upset travel bloggers got if they could not get connected online . In some aspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a travel writer had all their pens and paper taken away from them and they could n't do their job as a result they would be a little upset too . <p> You have to learn to just let it go and enjoy your surroundings . Know that you can catch up later and do what you can offline while you wait . I use those times to write my posts in my notebook . Sometimes I can think a little clearer that way . A motto we try to live by is " Do the best with what you have from where you are . " <p> And then when you can as you say work full out if you have that drive to make it more . LOVE that you are getting back in the saddle ! <p> I started my travel blog just for fun and using the time spent waiting for the next order or project . ( i 'm self employed ) Did not know that my travel blog has been read by people all over the world and I have been invited to give talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Language while travelling , A few wives of corporate standing personalities requested me to bring along their children to rough it out backpacking with me . The travel blog inspires people to come out from their shell.INSPIRE BUT NOT IMPRESS should be the main aim of any travel blogs.I now do enjoy posting stories of my travels on my blogs as its now part of my community service .. Cheers . <p> Wow Shahrin ! Thank you for sharing . It is awesome to see where your travel blog has taken you . It is so great that you are having an impact on the lives of children as well . Nothing beats that . I have been thinking lately how cool it would be to go into schools and teach children how to blog and talk about travel . I 'm a school teacher so I know how little attention is given to those topics that inspire us and show us that there are multiple paths to the attainment of our dreams . <p> This is all so true Caz ! As a family we just have an unwavering desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , and now weve just given into the reality that its what we need to be doing . Blogging for me ( us ) is a way to share our passion and love of Australia with others , to hopefully inspire families to realise that its not out of their reach , and that we have an amazing backyard to explore ! I think any venture that requires you to work from home tests your drive , determination and reasons , and after years of working from home , I 'm actually glad to have something that I LOVE to do although sometimes its hard to keep going , as you say , and its hard not to get frustrated at all the other distractions life throws because I want to be blogging . Truly I think blogging is a platform for growth , and that 's what I see it as for our family . A platform to build the base for other great opportunities that will become available over time . Like most things , most people give up JUST before they become successful , its only a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually reap the rewards , and I would say you guys are on the way , which is awesome x <p> Spot on Loreena ! I think that is so true that people give up due to their frustrations . That is why I think if you get really clear on why you are doing it and what your pain sacrifice will be it becomes so much easier to keep on pushing through . Otherwise you just do n't  have enough power behind you . <p> I love that you are sharing our beautiful country with the world . It is such an amazing place . <p> You guys are my benchmark for what is possible when you really work incredibly hard at something . Its been awesome watching your success grow on the back of your efforts , and I am always in awe of how you manage to juggle so much ! Keep up the good work = <p> Great post Caz , as usual . You 're so inspiring and thank you for sharing all your tips , advice and thoughts on blogging . Its so useful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so beautiful ! <p> Great and inspiring post . After years of settling I realized life is too short to continue in a unfulfilled life ! So at the end of last year I decided to chase my dreams of writing and released two books ! Our family is also moving to Hawaii next year ! This post is great affirmation of our path , thank you . <p> Perfect ! no more settling . Too often we do and we are told that this is okay . Its not okay . Life is not about being extraordinary . I love the amazing things that are happening for you because you decided that this is how your life should be . So inspiring ! <p> Ive been reading your Mojito Mother blogs for ages and finally got the opportunity to check out your travel blog . It is very inspiring but I do understand the sacrifices and hard work that must go into it . <p> Even though we have only been blogging for 6 months we are at the stage where we know this is what we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge detail what sacrifices we are going to have to make for this to become a reality . Luckily for me I have an awesome other half who is willing to support me through it all ! So many timely posts at the moment about blogging full time which just makes me realise much more that I want to make this passion my career and lifestyle . Cheers as always . <p> It is so great to have someone else walking the journey with you . Not just to share the workload , but to support you and remind you why you are doing this . That is awesome that you are realizing you want to really do this . That is when your passion and dedication will start to take over . There 's real power in that <p> Thanks Caz , I do n't  bookmark your site , I just return to it every now and then , and always get some great advice . Useful advice that makes me think about life , the universe , and everything = <p> My why ? I love travel , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that 's a good start , right ? On top of that , I love bringing my unique perspective on the world , to others . I 'm now about 7 weeks in ( haha ) , and things are going well . I have n't yet had the dreaded writers block , but I know it will happen sooner or laterwhen it does , I 'll just check back in here for inspiration . <p> My pain ? Wow , this is a deep one . Suffice to say , I feel the pain of the world , and want to make it a better place . We all have pain , I guess its important to use the pain as a motivation , rather than as an obstacle . <p> Wow ! I thought you had been going longer than 7 weeks . You are doing awesome . I think your pain is a huge motivator and inspiration . That will drive your why- to make a difference and there is nothing more powerful . It will get you through the challenges . Keep doing what you love Nate- its making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You have continue to inspire me with this writing . I started blogging only January of 2011 and through my own experiences , I have more and more respect for all the established bloggers the dedication , hard work and continued progress to create a better blog each year/each post is truly an inspiration . The wonderful memories ( even the not-so-amusing ) from all our travels would forever be etched in our hearts and no one can steal that away from us . Such an empowering article Caz ! Thank you ! = <p> Thank you ! No one can ever steal your memories , that is why our tag line is Its all about the memories . This is all life is about living it to the fullest and creating amazing memories that you will have forever . Thank you for saying that you have respect for those established bloggers as sometimes there are many hurtful arguments created online by people wanting to tear them down . It does take a lot of hard work and I believe anyone can do it and everyone deserves the rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogging are always so inspiring yet heart-wrenching , Caz ! This really speaks to me at the moment as I 'm busy starting up my own travel blog and trying to get out there , but finding it difficult sometimes to balance it with my jobbut I know that writing , travel , and photography are my three passions that I really want to pursue . <p> The balancing act is hard . You 'll start to find your own groove soon enough . Just understand it is all part of it and this too shall pass . Always pursue your passions , there is no other way that we should be living . <p> This post simply inspires people to engage themselves into an interesting journey . And I 'm not necessarily talking about traveling , but rather about being able to experience many places and moments according to your own schedule . Blogging about what you love makes the most sense of all . And being able to live that in the meantime is dream come true . Great article . <p> Thank you Slavko . It is a dream come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hard work has been worth it and that you have created your dream life . And I believe that anyone can do it and we are far more powerful than we give ourselves credit for . We have been taught to much that we do n't  know enough <p> Thanks for this post . It was just what I needed to read right now . I love my blog , but it sucks up all of my free time and there is always something else that needs work or fixing . It is hard to see sometimes that I am getting anywhere . I am just going on faith right now that this will all amount to something someday , but it is hard sometimes . <p> Youve got to focus on the end picture or you will get bogged down by everything that has to be done and all the challenges that arrive . Just do the best you can with what you have from where you are- that 's the best you can ever do . You 'll get there <p> Caz , Thank you for giving us would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes we should just jump and trust that our parachute is in place . You 're the hand that is gently ( or maybe not so gently ) pushing at our backs , gradually weakening our resistence . I would urge everyone to jump now . I wish I had started to make this move so much earlier in life . But then again , I do n't  think I really knew what I wanted or understaood what I needed , out of life , until recently . <p> Travel blogging is ridiculously hard , no doubt about it . There are so many conversations about the rewards to it . <p> I have gone on a couple of press trips , I do n't  find them worth leaving my kids for . I 'm a family travel blogger , not sure why press trips for family travel means leaving the kids behind . I have yet to figure that one out ! <p> So I do the trips on my terms , sometimes I have to pay for flights and transportation , but I can work out other deals . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real way of travel these days . <p> however , that 's not a big deal of travel blogging , because you get a great trip , but who gives you money for it : ) <p> I am at a cross road with figuring out where blogging on a whole can take me . <p> I feel the more I know about blogging the less I know and its like starting over each and every day . <p> Vent away Simon . I was venting to Craig this afternoon ! Better out than in . It is hard work but can be very rewarding . It must be difficult to go from journalism into blogging , but I always think journalists are so much further ahead , as you have the craft down pat , and I am sure a lot of connections . You can use the best from both worlds . I am sure you will do really really well ! <p> Caz , I am SO glad that you appreciate the impact that travel can have on the minds of your young children . As someone whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel , I can tell you what an enormous impact is has , particularly on such a young , impressionable mind . The lessons you mention are some of the most important that one can learn ! <p> Why ? Because I love to travel . Its not easy . I cant tell you how much sleep I 've sacrificed ( just in the last week ) . And its not always fun . However , its my passion . I am glad that a few people enjoy what I do and I hope I can help others in some way through my journey . <p> The time taken to get a good reader base and from there , an income for a blog , should not be underestimated ! I find the hardest balance , is in enjoying the travel and experiences whilst not being trapped behind the computer for too long . It can be quite easy to fall into the trap of overworking , which for many people , was the motivation for them to travel in the first place . <p> Caz , this post is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if travel blogging was my path , if I did want it , I believed in that which was greater . I needed to read this today and now I feel cured . Thanks so much . <p> I love that you are demonstrating to your children a passion for the life you lead ! I 'm about to take a TEFL course in Europe so that I can enjoy more of a long-term travel experience , which has always been a dream of mine . Its so lovely and encouraging to see others living out their dreams . I 'm also just starting a travel blog after years of having a personal blog , and I know it takes a lot of effort to get to the level you want it to be . It does n't  help being a perfectionist , either . Your blog looks beautiful , and I 'm enjoying your posts ! <p> Thanks Sarah ! I hope I am demonstrating that to them . My parents were pretty good about that and I know how empowering it can be . My Dad finally made his dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youve got to have a passion . That is great you are starting the travel blog with experience already . That will help you a lot ! Your TEFL course sounds great . It is such a great way to travel the world . Thanks for finding us and commenting Sarah ! <p> I have to thank you for these words of wisdom . As a fledgling blogger , I 'm in certainly in slog mode ( but enjoying the work ) . Thanks for the reminder that its not supposed to be easy , but is possible . I need the inspiration as I strive to break away from a soul-sucking job and create a life that excites and inspires me ( and , hopefully others ) . <p> Oh the soul sucking job ! Know it well Jeff . I do n't  think anything worthwhile is meant to come to you easily . We would n't learn much then . Keep moving forward and focus on all the amazing things that are happening and all you are learning <p> Damn , to much good stuff here . This really motivates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we aren-t thought these wonderful things at school ? Feels like I-ve been fooled for such a long time to do things I hate , tricked into thinking that this is the way life is supposed to be and there 's nothing I can do about it then accept it . <p> Thanks for bringing me back to life ! Wish you and your family a wonderful weekend ! <p> I want to be a travel blogger , but not for it to be my life . You guys have worked so hard for everything you have its amazing , but you 're also really lucky you both have the same dream . I wonder what your girls will end up doing ! ? <p> Caz great stuff . Your post really speaks true to the amount of work , time , money and overall dedication that goes into travel blogging . There are a lot of moving parts and a ton of knowledge that has to be acquired if you 're wanting to fund your travels further . Not only do you have to be knowledgeable on travel , but you also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your post is great for setting those expectations and also inspiring those who are willing to work for it . Thanks again for sharing and I wish you and Craig the utmost success with your websites . <p> SEO Yuck ! You guys are so lucky to be really sharp with that . There is so much to know and concentrate on . Sometimes I want to quit but then I see that alternative and I keep pushing through . I know that the life I have now blogging every day , although hard is one that I really do love . You just cant get bogged down in the hard stuff . Been great to meet you online Darcie <p> This is a beautifully written and inspiring post . It almost brought tears to my eyes ! I especially loved the part about doing what you love so that you can show your daughters that they can follow their dreams too . You and your family lead a bold , unconventional and extraordinary life and it is incredibly inspiring and life-affirming . I wish you all the amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly ! I appreciate that . I never want my children to be stuck doing something that does n't  make their heart sing . That would break my heart . They have so much life in them now and so much joy I could n't imagine that been taken away by living a life less ordinary and I hope it does n't  <p> I love this ! Its completely true- its fun but its a lot of hard work . And the hardest part for me is ALWAYS leaving the babes . I have two girls too one 2.5 years old and the other 6 months . That 's why I bring them along with me- I love my girls and I love to travel- why not combine them both ? People always think I 'm crazy and say that they wo n't remember any of it- but I 'm giving them more than memories , I 'm giving them experiences which to me is much more valuable . Experiences mold us into who we are . <p> Exactly right Hilary . They wo n't remember it but it will definitely have an impact on their character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont remember any of the travel she has done in her life so far , but she knows so so much about the world already which will stay with her and she knows so much about her self too . It is such an amazing gift for your children <p> Hi Caz , thanks for such an inspiring post ! ! Ive been travelling since 2005 but only just getting my own blog up and running ( talk about procrastination ! ! ) , and the reason i started it is exactly what u wrote here , its the thing that keeps me awake at night ! I 'm literally so excited about what I have to share that I wake up in the night to write it down . The only prob I seem to be having is finding the time to type it up and post it all ! How did u find the time when you first started out ? ? I 'm new to your blog and loving the inspiration you provide ! Thankyou ! ! <p> Yeah it is really tough , and with two small children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to scribble down my post ideas and notes and then type it up late at night . Most of the work we do now is late at night as we have to work around the girls . <p> I find now that I craft a lot of the post in my head . I have all the ideas swimming around and I put it all together in there so when it comes time to actually type it , it comes out real quick as I have the outline and my key points ready to go . <p> The longer you do it for the more you 'll find your groove and see what works best for you . Whenever you get those inspirational flashes stop everything ( if you can ) and write it all down . I would sometimes be able to write 4-5 posts in an hour with those bursts . <p> Thanks for the tips Caz ! Its great to know there are others out there doing the same thing and showing us new comers that it IS possible to make a living doing what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helps block out any adversity . Youve got one more inspired follower ! Thanks again = <p> Hi Merry Christmas to all = I just reading this post , I am a newcomer , recently I am starting my voyage to Leh with some of my friends . One of my friend put an idea for sharing our story with masses so we create a blog . But as a new to this type of work i could not start , on Google i found this blog about blog when i read i felt more confident to write more and how to write correctly in a systematic and tasty way so the read do not get bored . In the end I just thanks to you CAZ for this wonderful and worthy read , definitely this will help me lots . <p> Great post ! We have been travelling for 9 months and our blog is only a few weeks old a newborn ! It has been a lot of work , but so so worth it . <p> Without the opportunity to blog we would not be meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this one , but loving the community we are finding ourselves in . Of course you guys are such an inspiring example of what is possible , thanks for leading the way ! <p> Super honest ! A buddy from college and I are taking to the road to start creating video/written content about the culture in US cities meaning I had to quit my " comfortable " job for a huuuge chance . I 'm not crazy , I swear ! <p> Anyway , really liked the line about people being more similar than different . That 's a huge theme that we plan to get across during our travel . And of course , the many little quirks ! <p> gets tough on no-ticket travel.BloggingCheck out this post on the ytravelblog about becoming a Travel Blogger for a real insight into the world of travel blogging .

It never used to be like this . Its been in itunes for ages and all of a sudden this is happening . I am useless at tech stuff too so it is driving me batty today 
@@21820975 @1820975/ <h> The Power of Why Not <p> A facebook question recently asked for responses in regards to Pink taking her baby for a hike five days after birth . My response as always was , <h> " Why not ? " <p> Why not ? <p> I had paid for a three day seminar for women on wealth building and positive mindset when I was pregnant with Kalyra . I knew I was running a risk as the conference was on 10 days before my due date . <p> If she held on I would be okay ; I 'd just be heavily pregnant and if my waters broke then it was n't a problem I could n't handle . <p> But , of course , Kalyra has her own little agenda going and she came two weeks early . This meant the conference was on when I had suddenly become a mother to this beautiful little baby that I had no idea what to do with . <p> I had a really easy and healthy pregnancy . I 'm not sure that I could say labour was easy , but better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt fantastic . <p> So when people thought I was absolutely crazy to go to this three day seminar with Kalyra my response was " Why not ? " <p> I felt fine about it , so Why not ? <p> We went , she slept in my arms the whole time . When she was hungry or became unsettled ( which was rare ) I walked outside with her for a little bit . We had a wonderful time , I learned a lot and she was surrounded by the love and positive energy of 400 women . <p> For three days she absorbed this information on how to build wealth , manage money , strive for your dreams , think positive thoughts and be happy . <h> Why not ? <p> I 've never regretted it and would do it again in a heartbeat . <p> Why not ? <p> These two simple words can bring you so much power . <p> There are so many reasons why you shouldnt do something . Usually these reasons are things that other people tell you . <p> The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of . They are basing your decisions on their experiences , capabilities and view points of the world . <p> They have no idea of how you think , what you can do and what you believe . <p> When you listen to why you cant do something , the cracks will begin to show and begin to shatter your dreams away . <p> All you need to do now is when you state your dreams and desires , is follow it up with a simple Why not ? <p> This opens your mind to the possibilities , the positives , the opportunities and allows your strengths to rise to the surface to do this . <p> Sometimes your " why not " might fall into a massive failure . But , this is life . No one is perfect . Everyone fails somewhere . All you need to do is turn the failures into lessons and move forward . No big deal . <p> That is why when someone tells me what they want to do with their life , my response is always . <p> " Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to tell them they cant . Its my place to help them believe that anything is possible . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> Thank you Lainie ! It is not as easy as the first but still not a bad one . Not long to go now and we have some exciting things planned to do when she arrives that we really have to say " Why not ? " to . I know many others will think we are mad . <p> Well said Caz ! I left home with a broken heart and EVERYONE told me to stay at home but I thought why ? ! So I said why not and went instead I came home feeling the most healed and happy I could have ever imagined and I finally found what I wanted to do for the rest of my life travel and write . Without thinking why not I never would have left Heathrow and found my calling . We are stronger than we think = ) Forget societys rules and make your own ! <p> Only you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not affirms . If you have that feeling that you can do it and want to then go right ahead . Only good things can come of it . As you said , make your own rules , forge your own path . It is so much more fun . <p> People do n't  stop thinking it is okay to comment on other peoples lives , especially when children are involved . You have to be strong to stand by what you believe . Only you know what is best for yourself and your family . <p> you know , ive been thinking about doing a few projects and other things that i just couldnt make my mind up about . thanks for this post . i agree about other people telling you why you shouldnt do this or that ; it really gets your hopes down . youve just inspired me to go ahead with a few of my ideas . and if i fail , at least i can say i did my best . take it easy . <p> Awesome Mack ! you go for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fail , then at least you can say you did your best . " Exactly , and you will never have to be left wondering what could have been . You know , you learn , you move forward . Someone threw a mistake back in my face recently and my response was " So what . it was just a mistake . That 's all it was . No big deal . I can learn and I can recover . " mistakes do n't  turn you into failures . <p> Caz , I really like the message in this post . Cultural norms and friendly advice from others often tells us to play it safe or settle for the common path . I think its fantastic to think outside of the box &amp; make decisions based upon your own intuition &amp; instincts . Why not ? = <p> Exactly .

We want to learn about any of the places you visited in August and if you 'd recommend we all go visit too ? <p> So in the comments section down below , please answer two quick questions . Your answers can be as brief or as detailed as you like . <p> You can share about a day trip , a new place you discovered , a weekend getaway or your whole month away somewhere . <p> Tell us : <p> 1 . Where did you visit in August ? 2 . What did you love about that place ? <p> Lake Placid , New York We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Resort overlooking Mirror Lake , it was beautiful !

Our tradition for vacations is the last day of our vacation we plan our next vacation We booked a week of vacation for Jan 2015 in Grand Turk . <p> In August , I travelled to Manchester for a Japan Day Festival . What I loved about that place was returning ( mentally ) to the Land of the Rising Sun . But the day before , I went to the Leeds Reggae Concert a free event in town . What I enjoyed most about that day was seeing a new side of Leeds especially when I was cycling to the concert venue . <p> I went to New York City this past month ! It is so beautiful and there is so much to do , its overwhelming for a short visit . My favourite experience was going to the Rockerfeller Center . A must see for sure ! <p> We are 2 Aussies who had a wonderful time in New York last year . It is a very exciting place . Central Park and the Statue of Liberty from the Statten Island ferry were my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite country in South America . Its still a bit untamed . But , in August , I traveled to Galapagos with a group of high school girls . We all got seasick on the boat transfer between islands , so I found an air taxi &amp; chartered 8-seater to get off the Island . One of the girls got to help fly the plane . Amazing adventure . Oh , we snorkeled with sharks , turtles and sea lions too ! <p> Not very far haha . Only to Gold Coast for ProBlogger , which was the usual inspiring , business and social fun ! Very sad right now being back at work but there 's so much in the pipeline that I 'm excited about . <p> This month I visited the Altantic coast of Colombia , which was an especially memorable trip for me since that 's where my boyfriend is from ! Cartagena is an ideal destination for those just passing through , but I especially loved the time I spent just hanging out with family and friends in ( non-tourist mecca ) Barranquilla . <p> 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wealth of history and modernity , and that it is not as dangerous as people say it is . Guanajuato is a colonial town in the mountains that has multicolored houses , beautiful plazas , and beautifully sculpted buildings amidst just a smidge of grit . <p> We are 2 Aussies who spent 3 weeks staying very cheaply at flash casinos there . My husband likes to gamble and made a bit of money to further finance our travels . I loved the huge shopping Centre pier that went out over the sea , complete with sandy beach &amp; deck chairs . Cheershttp : //www.teachorbeach.com <p> Hi Chris , We are 2 Aussies who have spent months at a time in Thailand . We love it too . There is a fabulous book that I bought there called Private Dancer about young guys getting sacked in by the girls . A must read for all guys going there .

I just wont ever be backpacking in the winter there again = <p> We were in Italy for most of the month and really liked the Langhe region . Great wine , beautiful fields of vineyards and hazelnut trees , very friendly people , not many English-speaking tourists , traditions , and delicious food . <p> 1 . We camped on Anacapa Island in Channel Islands National Park here in Southern California . It was my first camping trip as an adult , and in retrospect , it was awesome ! There were easy hikes , stunning views , and thousands of seagulls ( its a birds island ) . <p> 2 . More than anything , I loved the sunset . It will forever be etched in my memory . The sky turned 10 different shades of pinks , oranges , and purples , the birds were squawking , the foghorn was buzzing , and the view of Anacapas other islands in the distance was phenomenal . <p> Many highlights but perhaps somewhere that often gets overlooked may be best ( there 's obviously countless ruins , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us was Puente de Dios ! <p> I went to Karuizawa with my family , a mountain retreat about a three hour drive from Tokyo . It was wonderful to escape the summer humidity in Tokyo ! On the flip side , I always went on a hitch hiking adventure with a friend from Tokyo to Tokushima ( Shikoku ) and back again ! Two very different adventures . <p> We love Japan and taught English in Nagoya for 2 years while our 2 young daughters went to a Japanese school . Luckily we got to travel around a lot . We are Australians and have always recommend it to our friends.http : //www.teachorbeach.com <p> I came to Norway where I spend 3 weeks in Bergen . We have been for a 1000 km round trip the last days and it was soooo amazing views ! I have then been seeing fjords with dark blue water and sun reflecting so beautifuly on it , lakes with turquoise water , mountains with and without trees we have been to 1436 meters high at the glaciers - , always on narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys , old houses and centuries churches and barns West Norway is really amazing . We also have an amazing nice sunny weather so I hope it continues till I leave ! Articles and pictures will be in my website this week <p> I spent August in Laos and the waterfalls near Luang Prabang were the most amazing falls Ive seen so far . The town itself has a cool vibe and great atmosphere walking along the Mekong was my favourite . <p> August was the month of the chateau for us , we visited Robert le Diable , Breteuil , and Gaillard . We live just outside of Paris and all of these places are within an hour drive for us . We love heading out with our 4 kids for a days adventure . Thankfully our kids still get excited about visiting new places . We were lucky that Chateau Gaillard had a Medieval Festival with several hands on activities . I also had a girls weekend in England with my sister where we saw Highclere Castle and spent a couple of days in London . Never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 2 Aussies travelling the world . After Budapest we spent all of August in Croatia , which was fabulous . The highlight was spending a week on the island of Murter with our Aussie friend &amp; his daughter . They were visiting his parents in their amazing little village of Betina . The sea was warm , the sailing was great and most of all the community spirit was wonderful.http : //www.teachorbeach.com <p> I am an exchange student studying in Perth , WA right now ( I was inspired to look at my school because of reading your blog ! ! ! ) and I took a 10 day camping trip through Northern WA from Perth up to Monkey Mia , Coral Bay and over to Karijini National Park . I had a blast and I cant wait to see more of Australia ! ! <p> We tend to stay closer to home in August because everyone else in Europe is traveling so places are crowded and expensive . I was in London twice . My favorite parts were : ( a ) straddling the Prime Meridian in Greenwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope from the Mary Rose in Portsmouth ( one of the Henry VIIIs ships ) ( c ) sharing the footpath with the giant pelicans in St. James Park . Happy travels , everyone ! <p> Weve been in Savusavu , Fiji since June . Were loving it here , house sitting for a couple who are out of town for 4 months . We just dig the laid back , slow island vibe , the unreal beauty of Fiji and the sunsets from our front deck/yard . <p> Weve overlooking the bay , sitting about 50 meters above the water . <p> The weather has been fab too ; almost like fall time back in New Jersey , cool temps and dry . <p> This August , my family and I rented a beach house in Panama City Beach , Florida .

I loved all the natural beauty in Iceland and Norway and the history in Europe ! <p> Taiwan , such an underrated country . The whole country is covered in green forests . Can move quickly the length of the country on the high speed trains . Also loved the night markets eating great street food . <p> With both kids home this summer working and both now leaving for college we needed to stay close to home . We did however drive to see the Painted Hills , which is considered one of the 7 Wonders of Oregon . <p> To France , the Dordogne region for a wedding . I fell in love with everything about it ( apart from the fois gras farms ! ) , the balmy evenings , the small mediaeval towns , eating amazing food outdoors as the sun went down . Heaven ! <p> 1 . Where did you visit in August ? In August we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels , Brugge , Ghent ) and Luxembourg . <p> 2 . What did you love about that place ? Amsterdam was surprisingly kid friendly and I love Dutch food . Belgium we housesat for over 3 weeks , which despite the 17 animals was a great chance to relax and catchup on work . And Luxembourg was a real surprise . Beautiful , lush country filled with history and nature . Highly recommend . <p> 3 weeks in Kyrgyzstan and 1 week in Uzbekistan in Central Asia , incredible experience . Kyrgyzstan offers some of the best treks in the world ( go visit Ala-kol ! ) , and Uzbekistan has awesome sights in the ancient cities . Hardly anyone visits these places but they seriously should , I had no bad experiences the whole time . People are often too quick to dismiss visiting these countries but its definitely their loss Go there ! Its very cheap too ! <p> In August I traveled to Ottawa for the first time and to Montreal ( third visit LOVE Montreal ) and this trip what I loved most in Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancing good times ! In Ottawa I loved the rock art along the Ottawa River and walking along the Rideau Canal from Dows Lake to the locks near Parliament Hill . <p> Our family traveled to beautiful Ladakh , India . I cant recommend this part of India enough ! It is a perfect destination for a family . It is culturally rich , stunningly beautiful , affordable , peaceful , interesting and the week hike we took was one of the highlight of our time in India . Best of all one can stay with local families , which was priceless . Here are some photos from our time there : LONG ... <p> I went to London by myself for a few days . It was fantastic . I 'd only been there once before , but this time I could make my own schedule , do as I please , and I fell in love with London . I met up with some friends , spend hours just sitting in coffeeshops eating cake , and really enjoyed life . = <p> This August I was lucky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by myself for the first time and it was absolutely amazing ! I 've used some of the tips mentioned on this blog , met incredible people from all around the world , got to taste delicious Portugese food and listened to heartbreaking Fado . I was getting lost in Lisbon , Porto and Peniche but it felt like I finally found myself . I finally could shout to the world : " You know what ? ! I travel alone and its amazing ! I CAN DO IT ! " There is a song ones heart that was left in Tokyo . Well , I definitely left my hearts on the narrow streets of Lisbon , when the sun was shining brighter , people laughing harder , smiles were growing wider and my heart was beating faster with this overwhelming feeling of pure happiness . I would definitely recomend to check out Portugal . Lisbon : If you like seeing contrast , beautiful views of the city , exploring portugese traditions and If you dare to take worlds most creative subway . Porto : is the city for your soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoy the best wine and different picturesque landskapes all around the city . And as for Peniche it is the perfect place to enjoy The Atlantic Ocean , perfect beaches and you can also take some surfing classes ! Right now its hard to say why exactly I fell in love with Portugal . Because it was just like falling for a person-sudden and all at once . But I guess to me people matter the most . And Portugal has the best of the best ! Plus , how can anyone not like portugese food ? They have pasteis de nata If you know what I mean I hope that even though this post can fully show how great my trip was and how happy I am with Portugal someone will think of traveling to this great country ! And If you do , say Ola to Lisbon from me = <p> I spent most of August traveling in Indonesia- Bali , Nusa Penida , Lombok , and Gili Trawangan . The best thing I did was dive in Nusa Penida off Manta Point . We had ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They are so majestic and big ! We also hiked Mount Rinjani in Lombok . This is a very challenging hike ( 3,726 meters ) but worth every step . There is nothing more rewarding than reaching the summit at sunrise because the view is STUNNING . And you had to work for it . <p> August was a slow travel month . A work trip took me to Nuremberg , Germany one of my favorite German cities . It gave me a chance to explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Wurzburg . I also took a trip to Northwest Indiana . Its one of the places that really surprises you . It does n't  have the best reputation , but I found some great things happening there ! <p> I just traveled in my backyard Except by back yard is paradise ! ) I went rock climbing in Krabi , Railay specifically . It was absolutely amazing . The climb was tough , but the views were so worth it ! ! !

@@21820979 @1820979/ <h> How to take greater control of your money <p> I 've got a confession to make . I hate dealing with money . When it comes time to look in my bank balance and manage it , I feel a slight sickness in my stomach . <p> By this I do n't mean looking at how much you 've got coming in and celebrating ( which I hope you 're doing ) , but I 'm talking about tracking , budgeting , making financial goals and planning for the future . <p> You know I 'm big of the law of attraction . You absolutely can create more money by feeling better about it . BUT , the second biggest important thing to creating and keeping more money is to treat it right when it arrives . <p> I 'm learning that the woo woo needs a bit of grounding . <p> I have a crystal I wear around my neck . It 's a quartz enveloped in red jasper . To me , this represents a firm coupling of the earth and the spiritual realm . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , needs to be strong in order for the spiritual , or woo woo to work it 's magic . <h> Walking through your money fears <p> Recognising where your fears and unsettled feelings lie is important as it means this is the place you need to take action . You ca n't avoid or run from fear , you have to walk through it . Waiting on the other side of fear is growth and the results you want . <p> You just have to do the work you do n't want to do . <p> I 've been walking through that fear and learning how to become a better money manager . I 'm setting up systems to manage my money and prepare for my future . <p> I 'm also learning some shocking realisations about how I 've been treating money ! That needs to change pronto or it wo n't come a knocking anymore . <p> The following strategies have taken me several weeks , if not months , to implement . I 'm a bit of a turtle . But at least it 's movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identify money leaks <p> I discovered a few handy apps recently via a Money magazine I brought . They are- created by ASIC , a government body created to help Australians become financial literate. - You do n't have to be Australian to use them . I found the Money Health Check useful in identifying some of my potential money management issues. - ( They also have money tracker and financial goal setting ones as well . But I prefer to use pen and paper for that ) <p> The red flags they threw up for were : <p> Superannuation ( 401k ) : I kinda knew that one as I 've spent most of my working life outside of Australia and then having my own business for the past few years has meant I 've not contributed anything . <p> Income protection : I guess I did n't have much income for so long I never bothered . Ha . <p> Sorting out a plan for these areas is now on my to do list . <h> 2 . Track my money <p> One of the best ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . <p> We 're traveling with some friends we made in Broome at the moment , and Nikki is passing on her love of spreadsheets on to me . Well , maybe not a love for them , but a willingness to embrace them so I can see the bigger picture and make the required adjustments . <p> Even though I drag my feet to start , I definitely feel more empowered and in control once I 've finished . <p> I 'm now tracking my money spends daily . At the end of each month I track our personal and business expenses and then have a faint heart attack . I have for the past two months . We went a little crazy in Darwin and Broome . It 's hard not to indulge in urban joys after weeks driving through the dusty , red outback . <p> I have a year-to-date spreadsheet where I input the monthly totals so I can see in what directions our spending and income are moving in . I feel this really motivates me to spend more consciously so I can fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love a good game against myself . <h> 3 . Create a spending plan <p> Tracking my money helped me to realise that I was walking down a slippery path " ignorance of how you spend money will only lead to a downfall . I 've always done that as I fear what I 'll see and I fret about having my freedom curtailed . <p> But , respecting your money is important and ignorance is not bliss . The better you manage , the more freedom you 'll have eventually . I 'm glad I 'm waking up to this before creating another financial disaster . One per lifetime is enough . <p> So , we 've now made some sharp adjustments and cut backs . I 'm already feeling a huge improvement and feeling better . <p> Each month we adjust our budget where needed and set new goals . <p> Now , when it comes time to spending money , I think about how it aligns with our goals and my values . If it 's not in alignment it 's a no go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial on some things : wine , eating out and coffee . Although I am down now to only about 1-2 take away coffees a week and a few glasses of wine a week . It can only be good for my health right ? <h> 4 . Pay myself first <p> What a terrible job we do of paying ourselves first . Usually we pay the tax man , then the bills , and then scrape up what 's left over , if there is anything . We have to let money know that we want it to visit and we 're laying out the red carpet for it . <p> Paying yourself first is the best way to do this . <p> Make a stand for you and your dreams . When you receive your income , we suggest putting 10% straight into your savings . If you ca n't manage 10% , do 5% . Even if it 's only $10 with each pay check , this one simple thing will let the Universe know you 're serious . <p> This month , Craig and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our salary is not high , but at least we 're recognising that we deserve to be paid . <h> 5 . Create money buckets <p> I 've written about this in a post before over here . It 's so important that you direct the flow of money into your priority areas . Now every month we share our profits into money buckets that match our goals . These money buckets live in high interest savings accounts . ( We use ING Direct . ) <p> We have buckets for : <p> Tax and GST <p> Superannuation <p> Vacations <p> Emergencies <p> Future house deposit <p> Kids savings account <p> You do n't have to put a lot in each , just a small percentage shows your commitment and ability to manage your money in the future . It really does help to make you feel money smart . <p> I like how , instead of having my money sit in one account , we 've defined how we want it to work for us based upon our goals and priorities . If you do this , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised how this money can build up and how more secure it makes me feel . <h> 6 . Talk with a Financial adviser <p> I 've definitely identified a need to talk with someone who might be smarter than me when it comes to investments , insurances , and money plans . I 'm really keen on getting financial literate . <p> I 'm in the process of organising a free initial consultation through my superannuation providers ( Love free ! ) I 'm expecting a knuckle rap , but I wo n't feel ashamed about it . <p> You also need a great accountant , especially if you run your own business and a structure in place with trusts involved like us . It can get complicated . We use Emma from Nudge Accounting who has streamlined everything for us. <h> 7 . Contribute to superannuation <p> I have a thing about superannuation . I just do n't get why I 'd deny myself money I could use now to have a fantastic life , to put in a place I ca n't touch until I 'm 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the memories now . <p> But , I 'm forcing myself to see the tax , investment and security benefits of it . ( Actually still not completely sold on the security part ) As we 're now employees of our own company , we 'll be forced to make contributions . Every small step counts . <p> Tired of the money struggle ? <h> Results of my Money Management project <p> I definitely feel much more empowered and lighter . No more living in denial . <p> I wo n't create a more stable and secure one by ignoring the logistics of how I treat money . It 's so much easier to know exactly where your money is going so you can better plan for your future and evaluate if you are adequately meeting your needs and desires . <p> I 'm starting to feel a little excitement now when I sit down each month to manage the money . I 'm learning to be patient and kind to myself and forgive my past mistreatments . It 's never too late for change . <p> My tip is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put on some music you love , make yourself a cuppa , or pour yourself a glass of wine . And if you start to feel stressed , walk away and take time out . It can sometimes take me a couple of days to get it done . <p> Take action today . Your task is to spend time identifying your leaks and making a plan for them . <p> Lay out the fine china for your money and it will keep returning . <p> Do you have good control over your money and awareness over how it moves in and out ?

The weather is gorgeous and activities are plentiful . <h> Where to Go <p> Wine tasting in Tuscany is a bit different than other parts of the world . Most wineries are n't  open to the general public for drop in tastings , rather you 'll need to make an appointment .

Heaven . <p> First of all let me say that it was quite funny to see you go from one kid-based post to a get drunk post . But more to the point , these places all look great . I have been to Napa and can vouch for it . I would also recommend Cappadocia , Turkey . The wine is not quite world-class yet but is constantly improving , and when you add the scenery , it is worth the trip . However , given the more conservative , Muslim society in which Cappadocia finds itself , I would not recommend getting drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few years English sparkling wines have beaten champagne in almost all the blind-tasting awards .

She was getting ready to fly to LA in the morning for her dream trip to the USA . <p> The effects of a falling dollar ( or whatever your currency is ) can be brutal for your travel plans , but should they be enough to stop them ? <p> I know many people would see the falling dollar and consider their travel dreams crushed . While a falling dollar definitely hurts , there can be some upsides and it does n't  necessarily mean you have to quit on the dream . <p> My sisters dollar is certainly not going to go as far , but that did n't  stop her from going . <p> The high Australian dollar seen for much of the past year is gone and apparently not coming back . But , the sky has n't  really fallen down chicken little . In fact , the Aussie dollar is currently sitting at around 92 cents . <p> That 's pretty darn good . When I first went to the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much above that with each subsequent visit . <p> It just means you have to plan differently and have solutions in place to make your money go further . <h> How to Travel on a Falling Dollar <h> Travel Domestic <p> A falling dollar is great for travel in your own country . In fact , Australian domestic tourism is high-fiving right now . All the tourism operators have been begging for this turn around for a long time . A low dollar always benefits those within the country . <p> Tourism Australia ( TA ) has launched a campaign to encourage families considering an overseas trip to instead stay in Australia . A recent survey by TA found Australians preferred local beach holidays to overseas getaways . <p> Is spending quality time with your family together and staying local of more value than spending several thousand dollars in flights jetting off overseas ? <p> The cost of flights alone for our family trip to Thailand early this year came to $2,800 ( flying budget airlines ) and out of the two week period we spent three days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to be travelling Australia on our road trip beginning this September . I think for the first time ever we have timed it right currency wise . <h> Go to the Cheaper Regions <p> If you really wont to go overseas , and we do love going to Asia for many reasons , you wo n't notice the pain of a falling dollar much if you travel to those regions that are super cheap anyway . <p> The difference wont be that much to make you cry into your $1 can of beer . <p> Think of regions and countries where your dollar has more strength and buying power . For us as Australians visiting Asia is hard to beat , and also South Africa , the Pacific Islands and New Zealand are good options . <h> Lock in Your Money <p> Yeah , my sister was spewing she did not lock in the Aussie dollar rate a couple of months ago . With travel money cards , it is much easier to lock in preferable rates .

Pay attention to those who say they can make their predictions . I think generally they know what they are talking about . <h> Take a Pre-Booked Package Tour <p> Experiences like cruises and all-inclusive resorts can often protect you against a falling dollar as you have already pre-booked at a certain price . They are therefore immune to the fluctuating dollar . You know in advance what you will be spending . <p> When choosing your accommodation think very carefully about what you intend to do in the area and how you will get around . There is no point choosing cheaper accommodation if it is miles out of town and you have to pay extra in transportation to experience the local area . <p> Research the area you are visiting for accommodation costs and choose your accommodation preferences .

Thanks to the pound , I campervanned Western Europe for 10 weeks . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> I gave up the dollar watch years ago . Sure , you can have a cash bonanza when you travel places on a strong dollar , but if it is a dream trip , do n't  sweat the small stuff ! Have one less drink at dinner or have water instead of whatever costly drink you were planning on having ! When I was living in Australia and planning my RTW trip , a girlfriend asked me how I could afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to bars and was astounded by what she spent ! There was her answer I lived smaller at home so that I could live larger on the road ! I still live that way today would rather spend the money exploring the world than blowing it at home at the nightclub ! Works for me ! <p> I was super surprised when I handed over $100 US only to be given about $75 worth back in Yen a few years ago . But having the weaker currency never stopped me from traveling just made me be more wise with how I spent my money ! <p> ( Yet so many people during my time in Japan still kept equating 1 Yen to 1 USD , when it should have been .75 USD so they were very confused when their bank accounts were almost empty when we went home ! ) <p> Great points ( and we covered many of the same tips recently too ! ) . A year and a half ago we were in Canada &amp; the US and it was sure nice to have the Aussie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things must come to an end ( or so they say ) . A weaker dollar definitely does n't  stop us from traveling overseas though . as you 've said , it still goes farther in cheaper countries like Asia plus the benefits of travel always outweighs the deficit ! <p> For the last 5 years the US $$ has gone down and down now finilly its going back up.I stuck to asian countries where the $ goes a long way . Next week I 'm going to Cairns Aust. for the 1st time and should get about 20% more for the US $$. 
@@21820991 @1820991/ <h> Where did you travel to in September ? <p> Its that time again where we like to ask you guys what travel experiences you got up to in the previous month . <p> We 've spent the majority of September in the northern part of Western Australia as part of our road trip around Oz , and mostly we have spent our time based in Broome , which has been AWESOME . Weve needed that place where we could slow down , catch up on some work and regroup and Broome is just perfect for that . <p> When were not working on our website , were at the beach and enjoying sunsets . As you can see from the colours in the photo above , Broome is a pretty place . Life is good here ! <h> BUT , today we want to hear from YOU ! <p> Today is YOUR day .

Where did you visit in September ? 2 . What did you love about that place ? 69799 @qwx269799 <p> We travelled to 1770 for a week of camping during the school holidays . I loved that even though it was holiday time and fully booked out , it was n't crowded , no line up to use the amenities . The amazing sunsets ( we had a beach front site ) and most of all my technology addicted teens loved every minute of it and did n't  whinge at all . Its a little slice of heaven <p> I traveled to Tyneside ( in the northeast of England ) to participate in the Great North Run . What I loved the most about my trip to Tyneside was that there was a beach near the finish line . And the beach was actually quite lovely in addition to the weather being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WA . Our youngest left for college , so we treated ourselves to our first of many adventures as empty nesters . The food is always great in Seattle , but we also enjoyed taking a ferry to Bainbridge Island for the night . You have to start somewhere with travel plans , right ? <p> We travelled from the States to Australia for the first time ! It was half business and half pleasure but all wonderful , much of it thanks to your tips . We were in awe of just about everything from the different trees and flowers to the delicious food . The best part was the people we met . Everyone was very friendly ! Definitely need another trip someday <p> Iceland ! ! ! my daughter and I went for a weekthe people were great , the parts of the island we saw were incredible- moonscapes , mountains , black sand beaches , steam rising out of the ground in random spots , and the airbnb guesthouse was perfect in the heart of downtown Reykjavikwhat a great time ! ! ! ! <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and travel to Los Angeles . The one thing I love about this city ( and California in general ) is the weather ! Its been nice and sunny every single day since I arrived almost a month ago . This is my 5th ( or 6th ) trip to LA and I do n't  think Ive ever experienced a rainy day here . <p> Northumberland , England , more castles than any other English county to explore . Add to that fantastic coastline , Roman Forts and Hadrians Wall , and lovely weather , a great place for a short break . And of course possibly the best fish and chips . <p> Travelled to Zambia , southern part of Africa.I loved the beauty of Victoria falls . The best part of this place is there are so many activities to do . I had good time doin the devils pool , microflight , white rhino safari and also spent to nights at South Luangwa National Park . There are no words to describe the animal and human connection here . The best trip for me ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels , Amsterdam , London and Brighton . In Brussels you should go to the Delirium bar where they have over 2000 or 3000 types of beer ( I do n't  remember ) and you can also order 2 litres glass of beer . In the capital city of cyclists ( Amsterdam ) you will enjoy definitely the atmosphere . And in London try to visit Camden markets , many of my friends do n't  know about this place . Heres me video from the trip https : //vimeo.com/106728819 . <p> We spent almost all of September travelling around peninsular Malaysia . Started in KL and did a loop covering Ipoh , Cameron Highlands , Penang , Langkawi , Perhentian Islands , Taman Negara and Melaka . We finished the month in Singapore . <p> Best thing was undoubtably the food . I actually think Malaysia might beat my previous favourites of Thailand and Vietnam . Such variety and all so delicious ! Second best thing was the people . So friendly and very little tourist weariness which is prevalent in so much of the region . <p> We loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit when they 're in SE Asia . Were currently working through our trip on our blog http : **27;1994;TOOLONG <p> We travelled from Qld to the NT . We flew into Darwin , hired a car and drove ( 10 hours ) to stay with my parents who live at King Ash Bay near Borooloola . We fished , fished and fished . We spent a couple of days in Darwin looking at the sights and fell in love with the place . We could easily move and live there . By far one of our best holidays yet . <p> I started my long-term travel adventure at the end of August , I spent most of September in Indonesia ( Bali and Java ) , and the final week of September brought me to Malaysia , where I 'm continuing to explore this month = September was a lot of adjusting to life on the road for me ! http : **26;2023;TOOLONG <p> We went to our daughters wedding in Vanuatu . Having been 20 years ago on a cruise I expected a lot of changes . But Vila is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant fathom why even if a place has a lot of poverty the people do n't  have the skills to pick up their rubbish . Tourists spend a lot money visiting . I loved the little island Erakor where the wedding was held . I found it quite expensive to stay in a shared villa for 6 people at $158 a couple each . Tranquility Island was worth a visit to see the Turtle Sanctuary . We sailed on a ketch to Moso Island . Now that was so picturesque . The water was very clear and snorkelling on the reef was amazing . Previous visitors make little towers on the rocks out of white coral . They looked quirky and cute against the beautiful colour of the sea . We felt like we were in a private paradise miles from civilization . Its a shame our party of 20 all became i 'll . Maybe the water or the hygeine at establishments . I would advise travellers to seek out a better destinationjust my thoughts .. <p> In September , we continued our trip through South America and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trek to Machu Picchu ( still worth the hype ! ) , we got stuck longer than planned in Cusco and we discovered some a bit less touristy gems in the Sacred Valley . But the best surprise was maybe the peruvian gastronomy . We started well by visiting Mistura 2014 , the biggest food festival of Peru where we got familiar with all specialities -guinea pig included- ! September was a great time to visit south Peru a bit less crowded than during June-August . <p> I went for one month in Norway beautiful country , I felt in love with it ! Amazing nature , light and pure air , nice people Then I went to France and now , I am in Switzerland where I come from before going back to France and then Quebec where I live.http : //www.omvoyages.net <p> Ive been in Iran now for about 2-+ month , hitchiking , couchsurfing and getting to know the lokal people very well .

If i would recommend a country to go to , it would without doubt be Iran ! <p> Awesome David . That 's a much different perspective than wed otherwise hear about Iran via mainstream media . The people sound very generous and welcoming . Thanks for sharing and enjoy the rest of your travels there ! <p> Our lovely places were : Florence , Burano &amp; Pula . Taken more than 4800 pictures ; now we are disposed to write our history , with photos and videos about the art , the sunsets , the beaches and those little spaces in hidden streets that we found .. <p> Burano with his colored houses , Florence with his arts and Pula with his amazing and lonely beaches <p> I went to Helsinki for a weekend to take part in the tough viking race , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome experience to take part and considering that I never went 12k before in my life I felt very proud = Apart from the race we spend the weekend in a summer cottage at the sea just outside of Helsinki , enjoying the finnish sauna culture .

More of my travel adventures you will soon be able to find here : http : **25;2051;TOOLONG Im enjoying it a lot following you around Australia = <p> We spent all of September riding our motorcycles around Cambodia . The temples of Angkor was of course a highlight , but the ride to Sen Monorom was perhaps the most beautiful . Also following a little dusty back road that ran alongside the Mekong Delta from Kampong Cham to Phnom Penh , through tiny villages was pretty special . <p> We flew out to Penang , and are currently still here . We have been to Penang before it is my favourite destination for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cooked so well . Without good food you cant really enjoy yor travels . <p> I was still in Bali and just go to the beach kuta during the month of September . I 'm personally would like to visit Australia . but still a long time . please visited our website http : **25;2078;TOOLONG about activities in Bali <p> Were about two months into a BIG trip crossing the Pacific Ocean . In September we spent the first week completing our PADI scuba diving qualifications in Vanuatu before boarding a plane to Suva , Fiji . We spent a few nights there before catching an overnight ferry to Taveuni " the Garden Island . Taveuni is stunning . Its a luscious green island ( hence the name ) with crystal clear waterfalls , perfect turquoise azures and sandy beaches . We spent our time camping on the beach , before moving on to Sau Bay and Savusavu on Vanua Levu . I thoroughly recommend Fiji , but if you do visit , head north to the outer islands away from the tourist trade " its tropical island paradise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of September . Of Vanuatu , Fiji and Samoa , Samoa is my favourite , but you 'll have to ask me " Where did you visit in October ? " to find out why = <p> Sounds like paradise Peter . I 've only done the resort thing in Fiji and agree with you about heading to the outer islands . Sounds like you 've got an exciting October ahead of you , I will ask the question in a few weeks = <p> I spent the entire month of September at home in Chiang Mai , Thailand . Its the first time in many months I 've spent an entire month here with no travelling and it felt great to relax . Ca n't wait for my next trip next week though ! <p> September was hectic , so only a weekend getaway from Barcelona . Took the train up along the Costa Maresme and spent a long weekend in Santa Susanna lounging by the pool , eating way too much from the buffet and having an occasional sangria . I love it because it reminds me of my childhood vacations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a kid , sub the sangria of course . I do that twice a year now to start and end the Barcelona summer . Highly recommend the train ride , it goes right along the beach almost all the way up ! Posted some impressions about it on my blog : LONG ... <p> Ive been working hard to get started in my new job so I havent had the chance to get out as much as I wanted to . <p> Just last week I was able to get up to Hanging Rock , however ! Did you manage to get there on the Victorian part of your trip ? I love it up there . Its mysterious as hell but I do n't  feel unsafe for one second there ; the rocks actually feel really safe and welcoming . The magnetism does sometimes stop my phone from working , however . = <p> We traveled to Sonoma , CA , for the Sonoma Wine Country Weekend over Labor Day Weekend . We go every year . So much great wine , food and company . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great time eating , drinking and exploring the French Quarter . Despite all the day drinking and debauchery that takes place there , its still a wonderful place to visit , with so much culture and uniqueness . <p> 1 September saw us in Tikal Guatemala , travelled by bus and boat to Belize and on to Caye Caulker for a beachy six days , then explored the Yucatan until 20th Sept , then Cuba to finish off the month a varied month I have to say ! <p> We went back east to Washington , DC , Virginia Beach and Williamsburg , VA . I grew up in the Williamsburg area and spent many summers there , so it brought back great childhood memories and I was able to share that with my husband . The scenery is gorgeous and the food ! I 'd go back just for seafood and hushpuppies . <p> In September we finished off with Kenya and crossed over to Tanzania . We loved the Ngoro Ngoro crater and unplanned encounter of sleeping in a massai hut in a pretty remote area . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Same .

@@21820995 @1820995/ <h> You Have to Have a Big Enough Why <p> I 'm writing this after a frustrating day of site breakdowns and business related blow ups . <p> Actually , it has been a frustrating month where nothing has really gone right for us . Really , if I wanted to be honest it has been a frustrating and hellish couple of years for us . <p> As I do almost every day , I walked away from my computer and said , " To hell with this . I 'm done . I cant do this anymore . " <h> The Road to Your Dreams <p> Travel Blogging is hard work . There is a lot that can go wrong . Most of the time its problems that are far beyond my realm of ability to fix . <p> Not only is the blogging hard work , but it is trying to manage that with work , being a parent , general day to day stuff- and piled on top of that is the personal hole we have dug for ourselves and are doing everything we can to dig back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one thing that really makes our spirit soar . <p> Life has seriously been a bitch . At times I feel as if I am bi-polar . One moment I am extremely excited about what we are doing and where we are going and the next I 'm bursting into tears in a childrens playground . <p> I 'm not bi-polar . I am travel blogger . I am a person who is pursuing her dreams . A person who believes in something way bigger and better than herself and so has to endure a roller coaster ride to bring it to life . <p> I 'm not sure why it has to go this way but it does . Achieving your dreams means sacrifice , failure , and hard work mixed in with some wins . <h> Have a Big Enough Why <p> It is this belief , this purposeful why , that keeps pulling me back . I know with the clarity of a newly polished diamond just why I am doing all this . <p> When I want to throw the computer out the window , shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to go to hell , there is this little voice inside of me that speaks <p> " Remember , why you are doing this . " <p> Kalyra and her daddy explore Venice Beach <p> It is that why that helps me breathe again and to focus with razor sharp intent on the vision I have for my life and my children . <p> There is no greater pain than to be stuck in a life you do not want or love . Like Harry Potters dementors it will swallow and suck up your spirit , fill your life with blackness and steal away your happiness and joy . A life without these is a wasted life . <p> I know what a wasted life feels like , and I know what my dream life feels like . I can not stop until I make that my reality again . <p> That means at times I do have to tell certain people to go to hell . The people who want to tear down my dreams and let me know I am not good enough . <p> After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down upon we should be congratulated for taking a stand for our passions and , considering the circumstances , maintaining a positive and friendly attitude . You have no right to stand between me and my dreams . <p> To hell with you . <p> That means when the technical obstacles come my way , I have to walk away in order to find that small voice again giving me the strength to tell those dramas to go to hell . I will not let you beat me . I will find away and I will call upon those wonderful souls who can help me . <p> And when the tears fall , I 'll tell them to go to hell too , They can have there place to fall , but they cant have their place to destroy my dreams . Fall , cleanse and then be gone . <p> And when the dirt starts to fall back into the hole , I will dig faster than I have ever dug before and tell the gravity to go to hell . <p> My dreams are bigger than you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never quit and I will not fail . <h> What is your why ? <h> Is it big enough to withstand the pressures and setbacks that come with pursuing your dreams ? 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Funny , I had the exactly same thought , up all night . You know , I 'm not a full time travel blogger , and have a day job-big ass one . So recently , I thought I cant live like this because I cant handle my day job . and you know the talk . I had one of the worst night of my life after the talk , and glad to know one more person out there , thinking same as me. yes we sometimes have to say go to hell to certain people , even if they are family . <p> Yep . It does n't  matter who they are , if they are trying to steal your dreams from you you need to tell them to go to hell . i think there are many people who are feeling the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just you . You do such a great job with what you do Juno , keep moving forward . It sucks that the day job has to get in the way . We understand totally what that is like . <p> Yep . I think you have to pay the price in order to prove you really want it . If you want it bad enough you will push on through the crap to get to the dream . At least that is what I have convinced myself of = <p> I really feel for you guys . Dealing with issues that are beyond your control on top of the day to day stresses in life can sometimes feel like the last straw . I 'm glad you have decided not to let it break your spirit . Stay positive and things will turn around . <p> Travel blogging IS tough . I go through waves of loving and hating it too . I force myself to take a step back from blogging when I 'm feeling overwhelmed or frustrated . I think many of us who want to fulfill our dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel like all our blood , sweat and tears is for nothing . But the reality is that we can only do so much and we cant force things to happen . It will happen in time and everything is as it should be at this moment . Stay strong and please let us know if you guys need anything . <p> Thank you Christy ! I appreciate it so much . I think you are so right in regards to pushing ourselves too hard . We do that for sure and it does make those setbacks harder . You become so involved in what you are doing , and you know how much you have put into it , you just want to see some payback. all good things come to those who do n't  quit ! ! <p> I could n't have said it better . Ive been doing my best , in amongst a full day-job with 3-4 hour daily commute to build my tech blog . Now I 'm new to blogging , sort of new to writing , but am keen and ambitious , regardless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it had just gotten to a point of flat-lining and possibly going nowhere . Being the charming , overly-emotional type , that I am at times , I was being a general grump in a state of depression , until my partner , Mel , asked what was wrong . <p> After telling her , she gave me the most wonderful words of encouragement and support . That 's what I think counts at these times and what can save you from throwing in the towel . <p> Not all of the traffic , comments and general satisfaction made up for those kind , honest words and a great hug . Yes , there were some tears too . <p> The best thing though , was the next day I had a 16% traffic jump and its persisted since . So going from that low moment , to 1 knowing someones there supporting me ( you ) 2 that the work really is paying off <p> makes it all worth it in the long run . Day-to-day can seem pointless , but having a long-term view , I feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep a sense of balance . <p> But I also totally agree with what you say about at times , just walk away . Despite the energy and enthusiasm , there 's a life outside of the blog and computer too . <p> I 've really enjoyed reading your Facebook page and regular updates please do n't  stop . You have a fresh , open , enthusiasm and perspective that would be a shame to see end . <p> " I 'm not bi-polar , i 'm a travel blogger " haha LOVE it ! I 've felt like that so many times , especially when my site goes down and there is nothing I can do but wait around for some IT guy that lives seven time zones away and wont be in to work for two days .

It is so frustrating because you do n't  know how to fix it . The tech guys told me I had to fix my issues or else they would take my site down again . I did n't  have a clue what they were or how on earth I could find out . Luckily Chris Richardson helped me and I gave hostgator a good serve , so they ended up fixing it for me- in two minutes ! ! ! You put yourself through agony for your dream life . Believe in it and it will come . <p> We all have days , weeks and yes even years that suck .

We are not terribly techie ourselves , and sometimes we find ourselves staring at the laptop for hours trying to fix some crap WP glitch , only to then ask for advice and have some genius figure it out in 27 seconds the cool thing however is that the travel blog community is so incredibly helpful they are truly great , so as long as you know that there are others who got your back , hopefully that wont make things so bad ! <p> The community has been so great and helpful . They have saved us so many times . Do you guys know Chris Richardson , the Aussie Nomad ? He is brilliant at helping you fix tech issues . Do n't  know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Caz . Sorry you 've been going through this tough time , but you 've got it right do n't  let anything destroy your dreams . I also understand the bi-polar feeling . You 're not alone . Just keep up the great work you 've got lots of fans ! <p> We should start a bi-polar travel blogging group on facebook . Well probably get heaps of members . It is such an up and down business . It is your passion so doing it fills you with many highs but it is hard work which can just kill you with the lows . Its good we can help pull each other back up . <p> The funky vibe is viral ! ! May has been an all round crappy month for it for us . Next month will be better . There are no great rewards without great sacrifices really .

You are an amazing writer and you two are amazing at what you do with your blog . I do n't  have half of the responsibilities that you have and I find myself ready to give up or put it aside at times too . Sometimes it just seems like too much ; too much competition and too much hard work . <p> It seems like you got all of the site problems worked out , I hope it was n't too much of a hassle even though I know it was annoying and frustrating nonetheless . <p> Keep up the great work guys , you two are at the top of my list of inspiration ! <p> The site is appearing to be working fine right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problems with it . Ah well . I 'm learning a lot about coding , back ups , error messages and files at least ! ! Thanks so much for your encouraging words . I think I 'm in need of a good drink or trip to Thailand . Both will have to wait until after the baby is born . So for now its yoga to keep me sane ! ! <p> Your site and your writing never fail to inspire me , Caz ! I love that line : " My dreams are bigger than you " because that 's exactly the way they must be treated . Even though it sounds like tough times right now , I have no doubt that you 'll pull through because you never lose sight of the goal ! Loved this post . <p> I cant tell you the amount of times I 've sent out a damsel in distress tweet asking for help . I love to work things out for myself but some times the problems with the blog etc are just further than my capabilities and I have to accept it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . One look at Kalyras gorgeous little face should do that . You have to remember , its not just about the crappy stuff that we have to suffer through , its about the legacy ( emotionally and physically ) you are building for your family .

I 'm not American and my country has not yet achieved their independence from Britain . However , this does n't  mean that I can not take something from this national day of celebration for my American friends , and use it to enrich my life somewhat . That is what travel is all about . And besides I like a party so Ill always jump on that bandwagon . <p> Ive been living in the States for 4 years total now and Independence Day really has n't  - meant that much to me . My first year I watched fireworks from the Atlantic Brave Baseball stadium , standing up for the 7th inning stretch , - with a beer in one hand , a hot dog ( pre-vegetarian days ) in the other , and a free baseball cap on my head . We felt had experienced America . Every other July 4 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any idea of what it really meant . <p> That was until we went to Williamsburg just recently and I saw , in reenactment , scenes from the time when Independence was declared- the events leading up to it and after . The scenes brought to life the stories in the history books that I had fleetingly taught my students . Before this time , my only thoughts on it were a tinge of jealousy that Americans had the balls to stand up to Britain and become their own nation , wishing my own country would do the same . But then after I watched , and learned and thought maybe its not all bad . <p> ( note : I hope I do n't  make any people mad by my thoughts . Please read it with an open mind . This is me just understanding things and not bearing any malice . I love America and its people . I chose to live here for 4 years , it is and always will be my second home . ) <p> On July 4 1776 , - the colonists joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer willing to stand for Britains tyranny , and knew they had the ability to create a nation founded on their own beliefs ; bringing forth a sense of freedom with it . The people fought hard for their independence , and through this belief in their own greatness , as well as determination and perseverance , they won . They were determined to keep themselves separated from the Mother Land . " - They did n't  want anything to do with Britain or the outside world and so by thoughts and actions it became us separate from them. <p> This was a revelation for me . It made me finally understand why Americans are so intent on not joining the rest of the world . Something I struggle with living here , is a sense of being cut off from the rest of the world . I miss the world when I am here . I never hear much about what is going on out there. - There is such a sense of us verse them . - The students I teach do n't  know much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American football World Champions . When Brandon Donovan recently scored a World Cup soccer goal to advance the US team through to the next round , one papers headline the next day read Donovan saves the World ! " - Worlds best travel blogs are rated based in part using a tool that only measures US traffic . And then there are the statements I always hear , - that America is the only free country in the world . <p> Things like this used to always make me mad . Why does the US not want to participate in the World with the rest of us ? Why do they always refer to the US as the World ? and why do they think that they are the only free country with the best systems ? But now I understand and I 'm not so mad anymore . Travel is so great like that , as it allows you to explore the why of things and with that comes a little more understanding and a lot less judgement . America had to become separate in order to win their Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were an example of being free back then . The New World became great and it flourished and that is something to be proud of , but did the separation come at a price for this new New World- a global world ? <p> What does this mean for me now and my own country ? I admire America for making the break , and I still hope that for my own country one day . I think we are strong enough to stand on our own two feet . But now my thought is , did remaining connected to Britain somehow keep me connected to the world ? And if it did , then for that I am grateful to still be part of the Commonwealth . <p> I love the world , and I love growing up feeling a part of it . - I love that I experienced English , and American TV shows growing up , and that I know the differences between the accents of all- English- speaking people . I love that I grew up knowing a lot about India , Pakistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup cricket . I love that Rugby has brought me to European countries and allowed me to celebrate wins and losses with France , South Africa , New Zealand and Argentina . I love watching the Commonwealth Games and seeing our flag flying amongst all the other countries and learning something new about another place in the World each time . I remember when there was talk of separating our selves from Britain my first thought was " Oh , that means we would n't be in the Commonwealth Games anymore , " highlighting that sense of loss for me in separating ourselves from- the greater world . I loved that when I saw other flags that had the Union Jack on it , I got excited , not because it represented Britain , but because it was somehow connected to me . I think growing up part of the Commonwealth allowed me to see more of what we all have in common . A felt part of a greater whole . Does that mean Americans missed out on this growing up ? Not necessarily but I think maybe it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I take from all of this . The hope that my country can follow Americas past and be strong enough to claim our independence , and have the belief in the great nation that we are . I love that America is patriotic . Its important to love and value your own nation . But I hope that in claiming our independence we do n't  separate ourselves from the world , realizing that it is indeed no longer necessary like it was all those years ago . <p> So today , I am going out to celebrate independence , freedom and also unity- the New World . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Once again , Caz , I love your post .

Let 's just say I was forced to rethink where I was heading ; I discovered my reality was nothing like my fantasy and I did n't like it . <p> How does one obtain something that seems so unreachable ? <h> Stop seeing it as unreachable . <p> I believe nothing in this world is impossible if it 's something you truly want . <p> If you believe strongly enough in it , it will come to you eventually . I started believing in my dream , I starting planning how I could achieve it and guess what " It eventually happened ! <p> It 's all about thinking outside the box , being open to ideas and possibilities and finding a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of mine ? <p> To travel indefinitely and live nomadically . <p> Let me go back a little bit and explain how I made it happen . <h> 1 . The Dream <p> I did n't start traveling internationally until I was 29 . <p> Growing up , we did n't have the means for travel so it was n't until I had become financially independent that I could travel overseas. - But , I was born with the travel bug . Even as a young girl I was fascinated with the world . At bed time , I would look at the family atlas instead of typical bedtime stories . <p> In 2004 , my hubby and I took our first overseas trip together to Fiji and Hawaii . Well , that was it for me . Now that I had had a glimpse of the beauty in the world , I knew I had to see more of it . <p> Each year we took an overseas trip . While I was very grateful for all those vacations , I would come home miserable and left wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . I dreamt about living in new countries and immersing myself into their culture and customs , eating amazing foreign foods and meeting wonderful people with beautiful stories to tell . <h> It became an obsession ; a dream I could n't , or would n't , let go of . <p> Then a few years ago , life kicked me around like a soccer ball and I was lost and broken . I retreated into my fantasies even more . I found this wonderful world of travel blogs and oh my god , it was amazing ! <p> I read stories of people who travelled a lot , some of them even perpetually . I was hooked . Instead of working , I spent most of my day reading these blogs and discovering that my dream might come true ! <h> 2 .

I 'll be honest , at 38 years of age , I 'm not fond of the idea of hostels or couchsurfing. - So it was going to have to be hotels and they are quite expensive ! <p> So I started researching other accommodation ideas and there was one that stood out from the crowd " Housesitting <p> We had house sat 13 years previously when we were building our first home together . It was a great way to save on rent while we were also paying a mortgage . I do n't know why I did n't think of it earlier ! - It was a perfect solution . <p> Once we had that sorted out , our budget looked more realistic so we made the final decision to go and set our departure date ! <h> 3 . The Result <p> We have been housesitting our way around the world for 16 months now . <p> We completed 11 house sits in 5 countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USD ) in accommodation costs . <p> That 's not to be sneezed at . We would have been forced to go home after 8 months had we not been housesitting . But instead , we see this is our new lifestyle to enjoy for a few more years yet . <p> And while the money savings is the biggest benefit to our new housesitting life , there really is so much more . <h> As we travel we are able to immerse ourselves into the local culture and customs by living ' there . <p> We get to meet amazing people , usually the neighbours and homeowners , and have made some wonderful friends along the way . And for us , as animal lovers , we have pets in our life which is wonderful ( we had to leave our two cats behind with family when we left Australia ) . <p> But most importantly , we have learned that no matter what your dream is , no matter how far fetched it might seem , if you have a passion and the determination to see it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of positive thinking and never ever think you deserve anything less than extraordinary . <p> AUTHOR BIO : <p> Nicole , and her husband Michael , are an Australian couple in who gave up their careers , sold their possessions and left their conventional ' life behind for a life of travel .

Just got back from the U.S. from a study abroad semester in The Netherlands and I really want to do something like that again . Lodging has really killed me on costs so I am wondering if there are any housesitting opportunities for students ? Preferably in Australia where I am headed next . Anyone know where I can find any information on something like that ? <p> Hey Tony Yeah , Michael and I keep asking ourselves how we are ever going to go back to having a mortgage/rent again ! I am sure one day we will want to stop traveling and settle down ( maybe ) and when we do I think we will really struggle with the fact that we will have to actually pay rent or a mortgage again ! Perhaps we will just house sit forever = <p> Housesitting sounds like the dream travel plan but having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat . After quite a few applications were passed over I got talking to others and it seems the dream has become the same dream of many others . <p> The competition for a housesit now is crazy . Those who have been in the system for some time appear set but for us new starters its harder than a job application . <p> Hey Chris = Yes , there is a lot of competition but once you get started and have a few good references its a lot easier . We were picked out of more than 100 applicants for our recent Barbados housesit but then have been turned down for ones with much less competition . It all comes down to what the homeowner is looking for in a sitter . Keep trying though , something will come up = <p> Hi Lorraine = No real downsides to be honest , but we have heard stories from other house sitters of less than perfect sits . But we have been really lucky and have enjoyed every sit we have done . Oh , we had a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = But other than that , its been a very good experience all round . And let 's face it , when you are saving that much in accom costs its might be worth a little downside = <p> Awesome post , Nicole ! Weve been chatting a bit on Instagram , so I 'm sure you already picked up that I 'm sooo jealous of your Barbados housesit , haha ! <p> I really agree with you if you want something enough you can make it happen ! Once you stop making excuses for everything you realize that its actually not impossible at all ! <p> I told my boyfriend about housesitting , and we spent some time reading all the great information about it that you have on your blog . Were so amazed by it and plan on looking into it more when our Europe bike trip is over ! Ca n't wait ! Its such a great way to save money when traveling . <p> Were currently keeping our accommodation costs down by camping in our very small tent . But even that can be quite pricy , actually ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and safe travels ! = <p> ps. so sad that we left Amsterdam wouldve been great to buy you guys a beer ! <p> Loved this article . Weve been road tripping through the USA for the past two months and have saved a load house sitting too . Probably around $3,500 . Not as much as you two , but were now living as digital nomads so well probably be at it for awhile . Thanks for a great article . <p> I really do love your blog , but lately your headlines are getting more and more misleading . This one , and the worst I remember was recently one about your amazing jet lag secret . You said what it was then go I have n't actually tried it . What ? ? It makes me not want to actually click on your articles in my reader cos I cant tell what its actually going to be about anymore . <p> Thanks Gina . I 'm not sure how this is misleading because it actually shares a tip as to how Nicole did travel for 16 months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jet lag secret , just because I have n't tried it does n't  mean it does n't  work . At least I 'm honest in admitting it . There 's scientific evidence to say it does . So why would I hold off sharing that with many people who do suffer from jet lag when I have discovered something that can help them . I 'm sorry I 'm not like that . Its kind of like not sharing a remedy you discovered for cancer for someone who is suffering from it just because you have n't tried it . <p> Headlines are written creatively to get people to click on them . Try looking at a magazine they do it all the time . If the headline does n't  grab a persons attention they wo n't read and then they miss out on learning tips than can help them . We pride ourselves on making sure we provide value to our readers . WE have had an overwhelming positive response to this article .

I also had an overwhelming response to the jet lag one too with people so excited that they finally have something they can try to help with their jet lag . <p> I understand you are n't  happy and that you feel you are n't  getting something in return . I am surprised you could n't find anything valuable in either of those articles , but as I like to say different strokes for different folks . here 's the thing though Gina , I do this every day because I believe in the power of travel and I want to help people travel more .

It was a huge report that drifted into a 20 minute discussion . <p> My sympathy turned to discomfort which soon grew into a lot of fear . <p> I envisioned- the demise of traditional media and then the economy . An avalanche of thoughts and emotions thundered down and by the end of that radio discussion I was convinced that we were doomed . <p> I had no security . No back up plan . Inconsistent income . And now the bloody economy was against me . The money well was drying up for everyone . <p> What was I going to do ? <p> I could n't return to teaching as I burned my licence to shut off all exit plans . But , then how was a job going to help me ?

You 're allowing your personal world to be controlled by the media 's interpretation of it . <p> What 's the truth for you right now ? <p> When you turn off that media and you perceive the world as you experience it daily through your own five senses what do you see ? <p> Abundance . Opportunity . Growth . Success . Happy dances . <p> So why would you let one news story , as sad and devastating as it may be , completely change your perception and so destiny ? <p> Turn it- OFF . <p> You do n't really need to know how bad the wider world is .

And then they make decisions based upon this fear . <p> When you make decisions based upon fear , abundance does n't flow . <p> It flows through the happy dances . It flows when you optimistically step forward through your day and seize the opportunities . <p> There 's a reason why there are lots of millionaires created during depressions it 's because while the majority of people listen to the fear-based media reporting all the bad , others go out with eyes wide choosing not to get sucked in by the devastation . <p> The key to bringing more money into your life is to focus on the wonderful ways you can tap into the abundance waiting for you . <h> Here 's a challenge <p> For the next week go on a media ban . <p> Just try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or watch the news .

Choose joy over fear and just watch how doors begin to open for you . <p> Start to be more aware of the impact the media has over your thoughts and emotions and choose to not let it distort your perception any longer . <p> Want more money project gold ? <p> Are you addicted to the media or have you already chosen to remove it from your energy field ? <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> hey great idea ! i often find on weekends i put my tv on in the winter just for background noise when at home just out of habit but i could def ban radio and tv for a week although social media i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos i always see on facebook are great and since seeing your family in summer clothes up in QLD while shivering in the cold down in VIC i will def be heading north soon ! <p> Yes , youve really got to be careful of the background noise you put on .

I think the thing to take on balance is the secret agenda that the media have . They know bad news sells so everything is thrown as such a terrible thing , everyone is horrible , nasty , why cant they ( the headline topic ) act like sane , rational and humane people ? <p> It is true that in adversity many people come to the fore . In recent times I 've followed the progress of Pat Flynn who really is a great example of creating opportunities and taking them . <p> I love this ! I almost never watch the news , mainly because of how depressing it is . When I tell people this , they seem shocked , almost as if I 'm making myself dumber by not engaging with it . But they 're the dumb ones , because media is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better to think of the world as you 've experienced it yourself = <p> I have noticed that there are a lot of people who are addicted to the news . Like any addiction , its not good , erm , news : p I definitely limit it and it helps me on a personal level as much as anything . <p> This is great advice . We just returned from our latest trip and for some reason , while we were away I felt strongly that when I got home I would start to unfollow all of the news sites that come across my Facebook feed . I think because while I was traveling and happy I got annoyed with the negativity and realised that I do n't  need it . We do n't  watch tv but do still have a bad habit of reading news sites which will be hard to break . <p> Awesome advice ! I grew up without a TV and have never regretted not having one . There 's so much misery on the news that a person ca n't take it all in and stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! <p> I just spent 3 weeks in Turkey researching updates to my guidebook . Which meant to outside information via TV or Radio . I was glorious . Meanwhile people back home were fearful for my safety related to ISIS and I was living in a blissfully unaware bubble integrating myself into the local community . Yes I was cut off from the outside world , but I got a deeper level of understanding and connection to the small world I was suddenly living in . <p> My husband and I played a lot of backgammon ( .. who knew it would get so competitive .. you can call me champion .. just not within earshot of defeated opponent ! ) I forgot how much fun it is to create your own entertainment ! <p> Okay so I just had to Google ISIS as I was completely clueless . I feel really sick . I just ca n't understand such hatred . I much prefer to be blisffuly unaware because I know I cant do anything to change it , but perhaps if I continue to live with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make an energetic difference which is where all change comes from . <p> So happy to hear your story and the positive experiences you 're having in the region of the crisis yet in that safe happy bubble . STay in there . <p> Its insane how one can get stuck in the tragedy around us . This way of life is reminiscent of the hippie who lives in the present , one day at a time . I have tried to live this way before , it worked really well but then my life spiralled. 4 years later , I do n't  regret a thing . I wonder if it is possible to constantly live this way and still stay successful , informed and on your way to happiness . <p> I have been TV-free for close to three years now . And its not that I do n't  ever watch TV , but I do n't  own one so I only get to watch TV if its right there on a bus I 'm riding or in a hotel room . <p> Definitely , there 's more happy dances happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view the world from . We get a lot of noise and news from such a small peep hole . <p> I 'm from a developing country and if I watched the news everyday , I would never dare go out my door . But I gave away my TV , and not only did I save money on my electric bill ( I used to have TV on all day just for the ambient light and noise ! ) , but I began to be genuinely interested in getting to know my surroundings personally . Travel ! 
@@21821001 @1821001/ <p> I do n't  care how people choose to travel and where they go . Whatever floats your boat . <p> My only gripe is when people travel expecting and wanting everything to be how it is back home . Now there is a real problem . <p> We love our off the road adventures , but we also love visiting those touristy places that are touristy for a reason . This is what travel is about . Visiting those famous landmarks you learned about that helped you to know what the difference between France and Italy was . <p> Sure the Eiffel Tower and Coliseum by no means defines the culture of these places , but it is part of their heritage and was what first intrigued you . <p> They draw you into the country , which is when you can do some further discovering to learn just what the culture is really about . We do that through talking with the locals , trying their cuisines , experiencing the climate , and participating in activities that are off the beaten track and on it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a hard day of teaching in Bangkok and dealing with culture shock . <p> We loved the Grand Canyon , the Eiffel Tower , Vang Vieng when it was n't trashed by drunken Westerners ( and so okay this could possibly be a very negative effect of travel to touristy places . But really the antidote to that is to just raise individual standards a littleor maybe I am just showing my age now and once would have thought that fun ! ! ) <p> Why would you not want to see this ? <p> And why would we ever recommend to a visitor in Australia , to not spend time in Sydney Harbour because it is too touristy ? Are you kidding me ? It is one of the most beautiful harbours in the world . <h> Make it Unique and Memorable <p> Here is a tip so that when you visit these touristy places you give yourself the opportunity to have a unique and worthwhile experience . <p> Try to experience it from a different angle . We recently discovered Urban Adventures and was fortunate to give 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already read Beverly from Pack Your Passports cool adventure Kayaking the Yarra River in Melbourne , giving her the opportunity to see a different side of this cosmopolitan city . <p> A statistic that shocked us was that the majority of visitors to the Grand Canyon stay for 15 minutes to get their obligatory " I was here " photo , which can lead to the discussion are they really getting to know the place or not ? <p> Getting to know the canyon from Within the North Rim <p> Again , not really my business as if that is their idea of travel then that is travel for them . <p> What I suggest is you make your time and effort to go to these places worthwhile . Spend time there . Try to experience it from new angles . <p> I like what Kerion and Amy from Do n't  Ever Look Back did on their recent trip to the Eiffel Tower with their cheesy photos . <p> Do n't  just get the elevator up how about climb the stairs ? That would make for a different experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red wine and have a sunset picnic underneath the towerIts magical . <p> When we visited the Grand Canyon , we went to the North and South rim and hiked at both places . At Zion , we hiked the adventurous Narrows , and at Bryce Canyon , rode horses through the canyon . <p> Just a little bit more than the " I was here " photos which allowed us to truly appreciate what was so magnificent about it . <p> Of course we did n't spend all our time on Khao San Road whilst living in Bangkok , instead exploring the streets of Chinatown , and many other neighbourhoods and having weekly Friday night movie and dinner dates with our Thai friends . <p> Dinner with our life long Thai friends in Bangkok <p> Sometimes you can incorporate a tourist destination into your working holiday experiences . <p> London became not a place where everyone around the world comes to visit , but a home for me for two years and Dublin , a third home , a place where we learned the best local pubs to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Temple Bar . <p> You can have both when you travel . There is nothing wrong with following the tourist trail . It really should form part of your travels , just as much as getting off the beaten track does . <p> Mix it up and look for the unique experiences where ever you go , spend time getting to know the culture and the local people and your life will be enriched . That is when you can call yourself a traveller . <h> What are some unique and memorable ways you have experienced a touristy destination ? 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Great post Caz . To each his own , a chacun son gout ( one of the many French phrases drilled into me in school ) , but its so very true . Everyone has their own taste , and there are many different ways to explore and experience places . I think its unfortunate when people dismiss places like Europe because they 're too touristy or not off the beaten path ( yes , Ive seen people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 're missing out on . Even if you do n't  want to hit the major sights , so much of Europe is waiting to be experienced , and if you avoid places based on too touristy , you can miss out on something fantastic . There 's a way to indulge in the touristy spots without feeling like a camera-toting , fanny pack-wearing , stand-out foreigner , but hey if that 's what you want to do , go nuts ! Thanks for contributing to the discussion in a different way than has already been written about . <p> I LOVE Europe . I can never understand either how people say this . There is so much to see , do and learn from this amazing continent . I do n't  think I 'd pass up an opp to travel anywhere . I think I would enjoy myself no matter where I went , what I did or what I saw . The world is far too amazing not to enjoy it , touristy or not . Thanks for your comments Lindsay ! <p> Your post brings back my own memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a beautiful place ! <p> Because of budget constraints and other reasons , we do spend quite a bit of time off the beaten path , but sometimes it is nice to do the tourist danceit is usually easier and requires less planning to get to a well known tourist destination than it is to get somewhere waaaay off the beaten path . <p> In Thailand recently , we ran into lots of backpackers and the attitude that we mostly got from them was that if you werent living out of your backpack for months at a time staying in little villages that no one has ever heard of then you werent a " real " traveler , and frankly , I got a little sick of it . <p> Oh this attitude is so crummy ! Why is it that they always seem to be in Thailand . I think if you are in Thailand you are on the beaten path , because it has been very touristic now for many many years . People like this are far too worried about how they look in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . <p> You gave some good points about the cost of travel in regards to off and on the beaten path . Awesome Shanna ! <p> This is what you call a Real Adventure ! I myself love to travel in some places like this , hiking , rappelling , trekking and mountain climbing . These are my favorite part of vacation . I have n't gone yet to Australia , but I hope it would be soon . <p> Spot-on herewhenever people get too uppity about travel , I say that things are usually touristy because they 're worth visiting ! At the same time , I like being able to spend enough time in a place to get beyond the major attractionsto see the alleyways and not just the Eiffel Tower , to take leisurely walks through the rice paddies instead of just popping into Ubud Market . I love seeing the tourist attractions , but I also like just BEING in a new place . <p> Another way to help deal with the " touristy " aspect of popular destinations is to go in an off-peak season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually a really crowded place ) in the winter , with most of the crowds gone and tourist traps closed for the season . <p> That is a great tip Jane ! I never thought of that . I would like to experience Yosemite like this because when we went in summer it was like NYC Time Square- couldnt believe it . But we did get up really early to go hiking and we were the only ones on the path which was fantastic . We discovered that Americans did not like to get up early to go hiking , they preferred to go in the middle of the day . so when we got back , they were all starting and we had the campground almmost to ourselves to relax <p> You make a great point here Caz . There is more than one way to explore a place . Even in Machu Picchu we found quiet parts that most people did n't  make it to . I love the idea of hiking in the Grand Canyon . <p> I love these tips , because I definitely think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take pictures that have been taken a million times from a different angle , I will start doing that with the places as well . <p> We travel with our two school-aged daughters so we tend to hit all of the touristy spots . These famous landmarks tend to be the ones that the kids have heard about so they are interested in seeing them for themselves . And they know that when they return home that everyone will ask them if they saw the Colosseum , the Eiffel Tower , the London Eye etc . I do n't  mind seeing them with my kids and we make lots of time for wandering around doing not-so-touristy things too . <p> Exactly ! It is so great for children to be able to have those history and geography lessons come alive . It helps them connect to travel more and to understand just why it is such a worthwhile thing to do . We see how children get when they see their favourite Disney characters in real life , it is the same magical feeling when they see these famous places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them create their own unique stories when they visit .

Even though I did not understand a word , I knew that it came directly from his heart . <p> This must be the way Maoris have greeted each other from the beginning of time . <p> Why do n't  we do that it in our culture ? It 's usually a shy aversion of the eyes , a cordial handshake , or a solemn nod of the head . <p> Prince called on the spirits of the ground and sky to be with us as we walked and talked through the Auckland Domain . <p> Prince talks of the native fauna <p> " Today is a good day , " Prince began . " My mother is here visiting and she has graced us with her presence . It is a fine day for a walk and she will be joining us .

My parents were afraid I would be beaten . I learned it later at University . " <p> He told us that the Maori people are now the indigenous culture that is most thriving throughout the world . <p> " Tell me Prince , " I asked " If this is so , are the Maori people helping other indigenous cultures around the world ?

" He then told us more about The Aucklanders Playground , " - the domain we stood in , the springs running underneath us , bubbling up in the gardens as fountains . <p> The famous Kiwi silver fern <p> We learned about the native fauna in the park as well as taking a stroll through the English Gardens . <p> The Auckland Domain is a peaceful recreation area where many Aucklanders come to lie in the sun , play a friendly game of soccer , or go for long walks , the Sky Tower marking the city scape sitting just beyond it . <p> In the centre of the Domain on a small hill sits the neo-Greek building housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best displays of Maori culture and the history of New Zealands involvement in the war . <p> Auckland Museum <h> The Parting Gift <p> Princes mother slowly walked along side us , nodding her head in agreement and adding bits of information here and there .

It was only at the end when we were departed that she opened up with the excitement of a four year old dying to share the toys they received for Christmas . <p> " You see this on my chin , " she pointed to the markings that were etched on her chin , symbolic of something we did not understand . <p> " I only just received this a few months ago .

A gift for you as we part , " Prince added <p> We stood under the draping branches of a tree unknown to me in the shade of the Wintergarden . Prince and his mother began once again to bless us , this time as we departed company . <p> They asked that the spirits of their ancestors , who had joined us for the two hour talk , now leave us , lest they want to stick around and keep us company . <p> " The spirits must stay here .

As for this list I am hugely honoured to be on it as I am a massive fan of Sarah Wilson , Marie Forleo ( I also LOVED her interview with Gary Vee ) and Kris Carr , and I always keep one eye on what Nicole has to say as she has such awesome advice for families and keeping organised !

@@21821005 @1821005/ <h> What Woy Woy Means to Me <p> It is amazing who you meet in the travel blogging world . Annie and I met recently after she contacted me to tell me of a memorable experience she had traveling through my hometown Woy Woy . It is not often that travelers visit our beautiful town , bypassing it on their way from Sydney up North . I thought it was really cool , that a girl from small town Washington State had a memory from my small town that always lights her up when she thinks of it . Of course , I had to have her share her story <p> There are many things about my student exchange in Sydney that stick out to me as shaping moments in my life . Those kind of moments that replay in slow motion in your mind , you can see them over again like favorite movies . <p> Most backpackers passing through Sydney for a couple of weeks or months probably do n't make it up the coast to some of the smaller towns , but one lazy April day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us sitting around the couch of one of our share house that afternoon , trying to walk the fine line between being on a budget and being bored . The pages of my Lonely Planet were creased from going over and over the options . No one could come to a conclusion . I had suggested wine tasting in Hunter Valley but as the clock struck four , we had no time to get there before the wineries would be closed for the night . I looked through the book again , and my gaze fell on an unusual suggestion . The Central Coast . I offered my idea to the group , I read that there was a famous camping beach there and mentioned it 's nearer vicinity to Hunter Valley . Heads were nodding in agreement . <p> Annie and her traveling friends <p> The next hour was a whirl of K-Mart , searching for tents and sleeping bags , packing backpacks and the necessary stop at the bottle shop . We made a fateful decision that day . Five backpackers looked at the contents of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a box of white wine . Soon we would learn this was the white wine that defines Australian travel , something we had never known until this day . We bought our first box of Goon . <p> We hopped on an evening train and were set for Gosford . For the next three hours a recycled milk carton refilled through a secret , hidden source was passed between us as we revealed to each other who we really were . Never before this trip had I really taken into consideration how amazing it was that I was living with a group of people who grew up halfway around and all over the world from me yet somehow had the same hopes and dreams . We had language barriers , we had different life experiences , but there was some fateful element that put us all together in that train in that moment . It was amazing . <p> After we arrived at Gosford , the station was met by five inebriated travelers , asking ever taxi in site if he would take us to Putty Beach . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . Forty-five minutes in a taxi and we were looking around the campsite . We found an open spot and as soon as the tent was pitched we set off at a sprint toward to sound of the crashing waves . Just as in the train , the hours were spent talking , laughing , exploring . We were met with the hospitality of our Aussie tent neighbor as he hunted us down with a plateful of burgers and sausages . We learned from him that Putty Beach is one of the hardest places to get a reservation for camping , we sheepishly admitted that we had just hopped out of the taxi . He did n't seem to mind , only that we were fed and taken care of . <p> Putty Beach- camping anyone ? <p> The night was sleepless , it was spent as each of us took the time to talk about everything we never knew before . Twenty-something years of life , ideas and events shared by five people . Accents were deciphered and stereotypes demolished . We ended that night by squeezing five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing and turning as the sun rose . <p> Trying to find our way home <p> The next morning , feeling the full effects of Goon , a hangover that a few hamburgers could n't even fight , we were on our way to the nearest train out of there . We walked for what felt like hours , on roads that appeared to be paved through jungles . We stumbled upon a tiny town , later we learned this town was Woy Woy . Thanks to the hospitality of a friendly cafe owner , the comfort of a little dog called Copper and some breakfast , we were as good as new . Until we learned that there was no station in walking distance and buses did n't run on Sunday . Second taxi ride of the trip and we were finally on the train back to Sydney . We were so weary that we spent the rest of the day sleeping but when we woke up we all smiled at each other and laughed at the pictures of the best camping trip any of us had ever taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence , Italy and discovering the humor in living with a Florentine .

@@21821006 @1821006/ <p> At first I did n't  think we would really have a need for Yelp , but as we got through the conversation I began to see what a valuable tool it would be to use both as a consumer and for us as travelers running a travel blog . <p> We love to share information on places we stay and eat . We do n't  often find it worthwhile or practical , however , to write complete blog posts on every hotel and restaurant we discover . That could get a little time consuming and boring and is only relevant to those people traveling to a certain region . <p> Enter Yelp . <p> Yelp is an online community of ordinary people ( called yelpers ) who review small businesses in their area . Yelp was founded in 2004 to help people find great local businesses like dentists , hair stylists and mechanics . <p> It had an average of approximately 61 million monthly unique visitors in Q3 2011 and Yelpers have written over 22 million local reviews . <p> We can use yelp as another extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twitter . Facebook is the place where we build our community ; Yelp can be another area where we can offer reviews and suggestions of places we stay and where we eat on our travels . <p> I find it a very valuable resource for anyone traveling . When you turn up to a new place ; you want to go to places that are good . We all know what it is like to waste time and money on disappointing cafes and hotels . <p> Best to ask the advice of those within the local community . <p> It seems another good way to get that local connection we all crave as travelers . <p> We 're Yelping with Jeremy ! <p> Also I like the idea of becoming a Yelp Elite ( a yelper who yelps a lot ) , because that involves lots of meet ups and parties . And we like that sort of thing . <p> So we are going to be utilizing Yelp on our travels around the world to write reviews . <p> We will still be doing them on y Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Well be highlighting the best of them on here and then writing reviews on Yelp . Well keep you in the loop and you can friend us on Yelp as well . <p> And well definitely be using it ourselves so we can enjoy the right places on the traveling road . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> I love Yelp . I use them all the time when I travel . Ill have an upcoming post that will talk about just that soon . The Yelp community managers are active on twitter and can offer great , personal recommendations for meals which I always need help with . <p> YES ! ! ! Great post , so glad you got to learn about Yelp and meet Jeremy ! Thanks to Ben for shooting me this post over . Travel bloggers are awesome and I envy you guys greatly . So glad Yelp can help you out ! Much Love ! <p> Yelp has been huge in America for years its cool to hear that the rest of the world is now getting local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yelpers got their own parties I just think of them as the people who have waaay too much free time on their hands = <p> Yelp is an absolute scam . I was called for advertising when i declined my negative reviews grew and postive ones disappeared . The salesman from Yelp who was helping has since stopped calling and wont return my questions on where my positive reviews went . The old they got stuck in the filter bullshit does n't  work " I wont pay them , just trying to strongarm. 5 stars for the person who came up with the scam. its called pay for reviews . great idea . Stopplemen is a wimp hiding behind his shit ass company . 95% of bad reviews stick and 5% off good ones do n't  in hopes you will buy advertising to ease the filter <p> Thanks for sharing your experiences Mike . Obviously I cant comment as I have had no experience of these things from your side of the fence . I would hope this is not the case , but it sounds as if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who else has experienced this as well . Hopefully you can get it sorted out soon .

@@21821007 @1821007/ <h> Memories of African Wildlife : Coming Face to Face with a Cheetah <p> " Only 5 people can come into the enclosure with the wild cheetah . Who would like to volunteer ? " <p> I looked at Craig , knowing flashed before his eyes as they said Oh God , here she goes again ! <p> I smiled , nodded , and shot my hand in the air . I did n't  have to be concerned about missing out , no other visitor was half as keen as me to confront the fastest wild- land animal on earth in the open . Craig grabbed the camera and trudged behind me to the enclosure gate . <p> We were at the Cheetah and Servile Cat Rehabilitation Center in Zululand , South Africa . We had just finished learning how this lithe and elegantly spotted cat was in danger of becoming extinct within the next 20 years . The project was doing everything they could to rehabilitate sick or injured cheetahs to put them back into the wild and increase their numbers . <p> We had just gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they were deeply engrossed in their fresh meal of chicken . There was no way I was about to miss out on getting up close and personal with a cheetah , and although my legs were wobbling and my breath quickened a little , I was more than ecstatic to race through the pen gate behind the ranger . <p> Once inside , he gathered his brave volunteers together for a safety chat , while the cheetah sat within striking distance and ate her tasty chicken meal . <p> " The cheetah will attack , " he paused and stared giving us the opportunity to leave , but at the same time silently sending courageous energy our way . <p> We all looked at each other and then all 5 heads turned toward the gate but no one dared to move toward it . <p> " She will attack in an attempt to guard her food . " WTF ? - Why did n't  he tell us this before we entered the pen ? That 's a f**** cheetah , its not a playful kitty cat . Me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story to tell . This may be my very last story , told instead by the smart onlookers behind the wire fence . <p> " Do n't  worry . I 'll make it so she attacks me. " , he continued . My eyes remained locked on the cheetah that sat in the tall grass behind him quietly attending to her meal , so far undisturbed by her uninvited visitors. - " All you need to do is stand absolutely still . Do n't  even attempt to breathe . I know you will be tempted to run . Having a cheetah charge has that effect . But you must not , under any circumstances , run . If you do you will confuse her , she will think you are prey , and well we all know the end of that story . Can I count on you all to do that ? " <p> We nodded frozen to the spot with fear . I did n't  dare even look at Craig . <p> The ranger turned to walk toward the feasting cheetah . She looked up , gave a snarling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with frightening power and velocity sprang forward , pouncing onto his perfectly still body . He quickly gave her a semi hug and pushed her down . Realizing he was n't here to eat her food , she backed down with a growl , walked back to her tasty meal , and continued eating . <p> Feelings of total awe and elation flooded my body with the return of my breath . Wow ! I- just stood within metres of a cheetah pouncing on her prey and witnessed the extreme power this swift and sleek feline possessed . What a mind blowing experience . My heart raced with adrenalin and I paused for a time to absorb this special wild animal encounter . <p> Satisfied with the friendliness of her visitors , the cheetah allowed us to stay , a s long as we respectfully kept our distance . The less aggressive male , however , was happy to let us get much closer to him as he ate . I did not waste anytime to enhance my experience and crouched down face to face with the cheetah to say hello. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished him well , and promised I would do what I could to let people know just how beautiful and precious he was , and how we needed to do whatever we could to help his species not just survive but to thrive . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Cheetahs have always fascinated me and Ive seen a few of them in zoos but I do n't  think I 'd be able to muster up the courage to get so close to one as the people in the video . . -= Cancun Travel Guides last blog ..

You have to step it up a little by investing in your online business . That 's what makes it a business . <p> But , it can be a minefield out there and everyone has an opinion on what tools and services to use . Before you decide , it is essential that you choose what is best for your specific online business needs and goals . <p> Here are a few useful tools and services that help keep our business running efficiently and smoothly . Some of these are free ( yay ! ) and others involve an investment , most of them a small one . <p> I try to keep it as simple and real as I can . There is nothing worse than overwhelming yourself with too many tools , services and gadgets . <p> For a deeper look at over 100 recommended tools and resources for your digital nomad business , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note some of the links below may be affiliate links . This means I receive a small commission which helps cover the costs of them ! ) <h> Blogging tools <h> 1 . Windows Live Writer <p> I could not live without Windows Live Writer . This saves me many headaches trying to get my content written when I can barely get internet access . And if you live in Australia like me , it also saves me huge data costs by doing it all offline . <p> I write and edit all my blog posts in Windows Live Writer and then post it to the blog when finished . It also makes me far more efficient with my time as I 'm not distracted by Facebook Land . <h> 2 . Websynthesis <p> Websynthesis is the web hosting platform we use . Our site previously had continual hosting issues , i.e. crashing and slow to load , since it was born , until we moved to Websynthesis . Not a single problem since . #BLISS <p> It is probably a web hosting solution for more advanced and robust sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our tech guru guy , Chris Richardson recommended it and set it up for us . <h> Creation , productivity and communication tools <h> 3 . Ontraport <p> Ontraport- is the system we use for managing and sending out emails to our subscribers . I 've not even delved into most of what it can do , but it 's very robust and powerful and makes your email communication much stronger with your subscribers . <p> You can do in-depth tagging and targeted emails , which makes your communication much better . PLUS , they have the ability to create pretty awesome landing pages , optin pages and sales pages . Its effortless to do it once you learn . <p> NOTE : This is really only for advanced users . It is expensive and you do need a strategic plan and a large subscriber base to make it worth it . <h> 6 . Trello <p> I 've just started playing with Trello , but so far I love the simplicity of organizing my thoughts , ideas , and to-do lists . I love the simple drag and drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Docs <p> Google docs is great for sharing files and collaborating on documents with others . The only annoying thing is you ca n't access them if you are offline . I usually only upload them once they are finished and ready to be shared and viewed . <h> 8 . Drop Box <p> Another file sharing place , Dropbox is great for any large files or images we have to share and ca n't make it through email . <h> 9 . Asana <p> Asana is the project management software we use , and we spent a lot of time on there with our kick ass design team when we relaunched our site . <p> It 's also helped me to plan out the framework for my upcoming 30 Day Money Cleanse and keep on top of the all the tasks that need to be done . It brings so much flow and direction into the business . <p> Like Ontraport though , it is really slow to load . <h> 10 . Jing <p> Jing is the free software I use to grab quick screenshots or to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free version stops the video recording at five minutes which can be annoying . But , you can upgrade . <h> 11 . Skype <p> Skype is what we use for our international business calls and interviews . Its free from Skype-to-Skype accounts and there 's also a chat feature . <p> But we have to be careful as calls , especially video calls , seriously chews up our data we do n't  have unlimited data plans in Australia #KillMeKnow <h> Accounting tools <h> 12 . Box <p> Box is the web based software/app we use with our accountant . I take photos of any business related receipts and then upload them directly into the appropriate file in box . It 's such a quick and efficient way of staying on top of the bookwork <h> 13 . Xero <p> Xero is an online accounting subscription based software . I get free access to it via my accountant . I create all my invoices in Xero " it 's super easy to do . <h> 14 . Kikki K Stationery <p> Kikki K is my secret obsession . It 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have 20% off sales like last week . Over $100 later I walk out with beautiful stationery and organizing tools . But , it does help my scattered brain stay focused and better organized . <p> I use their receipts folder to hold all my monthly business receipts . There 's even space to record all my spending habits . I also use their budget book to track my daily expenses . <h> Social Media tools <h> 15. - Latergram <p> It allows you to schedule photos and videos to your account as well as engage with hashtags and repost other peoples photos . Its very easy to use . It does not publish your photos to Instagram , but it will send you a notification to your phone that its ready to publish . You just then hit a couple of buttons and its done . <h> 16 . Tailwind app <p> Tailwind app is a tool we use to run our large Pinterest account . Its been a lifesaver and our Bryanna also has access to it making Pinning easier . <p> It has great in built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduling tool which we use a lot to post our Pins for when most of our followers are online in the US . <p> For $10 per month you can add one account , get basic website insights and 400 scheduled pins per month . <h> 17 . Hootsuite <p> Hootsuite is a social media scheduling tool . We only really use it for Twitter . Again , very helpful for our digital lifestyle . We only use the free version , but there is a premium version as well . <h> Internet Connection <p> As this is a post about tools and services that enhance our online business , we will not mention our internet service providers , Optus . As they are crap ! <p> They continually cost us hundreds in lost productivity as we travel around Australia and get this , we 're now going to an important Travel Summit at The White House next week as one of the top travel bloggers with NO PHONES . Craig has n't  had a working phone for 6 weeks ! ! <h> Photography <h> 18 . Lightroom <p> Lightroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used so far . Easy to understand and use and enhances your photos . <h> 19 . Picmonkey <p> Picmonkey is a super easy photo editing online software to use . We do n't use it to edit images , but to create text overlays and collages for our Pinterest images . It 's so easy to use and can make your pinnable images pop . <p> We have the Royale version and for only $5 a month , totally worth it . Pinterest is the number one referrer of traffic to our website , so it 's an essential tool . If you want to drive traffic to your site from Pinterest , do n't hesitate to make the same investment . <h> 20 . Canva <p> Canva is another tool to help you create amazing graphics for your blog posts and social media . Canva has a lot of great functions and can help you start designing like a pro . You can create more than images we use it to create PDF files like our media kit . <p> They have lots of great tutorials to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not good to use if your internet is slow , it chews up the data and is super buggy . I use less of it now because of these reasons and prefer to use PicMonkey for ease and the less frequent use of expletives . Time is precious and a lot of it seems to get wasted when I use Canva ! <h> 21 . Photoshop <p> Photoshop Elements 12 is on my computer , so I use this whenever I need to . Photoshop is a pain to use , because I do n't have the right brain for it . Otherwise I think it would rock the house . <p> One of these days , I will learn to use it properly . For now it works well for basic photo editing . <h> 22 . Canon 700D <p> We recently shared a post here on our camera lenses and camera . We have used Canon for ever and love our Canon 700D . The quality of our photos drastically improved when we got it and better lenses . We now have our eyes on a Canon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) . <h> Computer tools <h> 23 . Asus <p> I like my Asus . It was the computer most recommended to us by other travel bloggers and the salesman told us it was by far the best model out there . He said this even though other computers were more expensive , so I felt he was legit . <p> It 's been pretty awesome so far and does all I need . I 'm still getting my head around Windows 8 and there are a few things I do n't like but on the whole , it 's a winner . <h> 24 . Macbook Air <p> I 'm not an Apple fan and have resisted joining the cult . I 'm happy with my PC system and android devices . Craig uses his Macbook Air and wishes he knew how to use it better so he could become more of a raving fan . <p> He does like how lightweight and fast it is and how they do n't give off any heat . <h> 25 . Seagate slimline external hard drives . <p> We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite quickly with all our photos .

Thank you for this useful post &amp; greetings from Perth . <p> Schedugram is such a great tool and it takes away the stress of having to post manually several times a day when you also have other social media to manage . In my experience its SO important to structure the time I use on my online business , and all these tools help do exactly that . Thanks , you guys ! <p> Great article and so timely ! My husband and I are planning a 12 month trip around Australia next year and my biggest worry is internet access ! ! ! ! ! I 'm a social media consultant and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i need reliable , consistent internet ! Ca n't wait to read about how you 've managed your internet connection ! <p> Some AMAZING options here a lot I use and a lot I cant wait to try when I get back to the land of decent Internet in Melbourne . = I really want to learn to use LightRoom I do n't  edit my photos much and what I do edit ( brightness , contrast .. ) is all done using iPhoto ( shhhhh ! ! Some of my photographer friends had heart attacks when they found that out ) and resizing done in Photoshop . Really hoping it will help me take my photos to the next level and assist in my rather poor photo organisation skills ! <p> For accounting , I use FreshBooks . It does cost a little if you have more than 5 clients in your address book ( I think ) so I am keen to check Zero out , but its really easy especially when working on **34;2201;TOOLONG work . <p> I love you guys but it was seriously silly of you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending so much time in the country . Optus may outperform other networks in the cities ( its who I use and love them for CITY trvael . My current plan sucks with their new data model and I need to go instore and beat them down on it but that 's a story for when we bitch about them over coffee one day = ) but for Internet/tablet SIMs/RURAL CONNECTIVITY Telstra has ALWAYS far out performed every other carrier in Australia . Its why I used to have a Telstra SIM in my iPad and now travel with a Telstra MiFi device when travelling anywhere in Australia ( even cities because Australian hotels charge a ridiculous amount for Internet ) . <p> Good luck ! Hope you guys manage to get new phones now you 're in the big smoke or buy one in the US unlocked ? <p> I have not heard of some of these tools but I am going to check them out . I am still learning Photoshop and Lightroom and I am looking forward to the day when I can finally produce excellent pictures ! Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of Shedugram but thought it must exist thank you . I use Lightroom on my laptop and have Photoshop on my desktop , have started a course which I 've done 1/6 off then stopped for a while and will finish it next year Photoshop is bloody complex BUT I 'm all good with Adobe Camera Raw and use that a lot . This is a post I will come back to again and again thanks guys . <p> I feel like every time I read a post like this I get at least one takeaway , in this one it was a simple update of my windows package . I did n't  know they had softwear for bloggers ( crazy I know , but its true ! )

Since then , our travels have spanned over a 10 year period and we are the people we are today because of the life lessons we 've learnt living in 5 countries and traveling through many others . <p> Travel is what we do best and its what makes us feel most alive ! <p> One of our favorite quotes is " The world is a book and those who do n't  travel read only a page " We have learnt more about the world and ourselves through traveling than any formal degree could have taught us . To learn more about us check out our Meet Us page . <p> The yTravel Blog Purpose <p> Building a travel blog site was a natural progression for us . Caz loves to write and journal , Craig loves taking photos , and we both love to share our travel passion and inspire others to live their best life ! Another quote we love is " Life is n't about finding yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have a passion for travel and living in foreign lands to get out there and make that dream a reality . <p> Too many people make the mistake of putting off what they really want to do . It is said that " the REAL tragedy of life is not that it ends too soon , but that we wait too long for it to begin ! " Through our writings , photos and stories , we hope to motivate people to stop waiting for that perfect time in their life , which never arrives , and to just get up and go ! You can read more about our purpose at Our Missionpage . <p> At the Brazen Head Pub in Dublin , 2003 <p> The Journey So Far <p> We have learnt a shit load in the past six months about building websites , blogging , social media , building a community , and how to have massive fights and annoy the crap out of each other with differing opinions and ideas ! <p> We built our website from scratch , a first for us ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears shed ) , and whilst it is VERY much a work in progress , we are proud of what we have so far put together . Now , we are never one to blow our own trumpet ( the sound travels twice as far when somebody does it for you ) , but we are quite proud of what we have achieved in a really short period of time . <p> A Google page rank of a big fat ZERO ! . Cmon Google , we own a Droid , show us some lovin ! ! ! <p> Are these statistics a good yard stick ? Yes and No ! Of course there are other measures of your blogs success , but well run with these for the time being ! <p> Some Personal Challenges . <p> Besides all the usual challenges any new blog facesdesign issues , technical problems , hosting failures , research headaches , and friggin SEO nightmares , the past six months whilst building our travel blog has been the toughest and most personally challenging period of our lives ! We have faced tremendous challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a health situation that rocked us emotionally ! <p> We had a real estate transaction in the USA go horribly wrong costing us a TON of money and almost sending us into bankruptcy ! <p> We had to re-locate internationally from the USA to Australia which is very time consuming ! <p> We 've both been working full-time jobs ! <p> And we have a 3 year old daughter who obviously deserves a tremendous amount of family time ! <p> So , considering all that , we 've done alright , and are VERY excited about where we can take this puppy once it gets our full attention and we can get back on the road again ! <p> Beer O'clock in Lijiang , China 2006 <p> Our Thank Yous <p> We 've had a steep learning curve . What we know now compared to six months ago is friggin amazing . Weve learnt about travel writing through the 3 month program at Matador U.Weve got ourselves educated on how to build and monetize a travel blog through Travel Blog Success . And another big thanks goes out to Jack Humphries at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to make a career out of blogging . <p> Other than that , a HUGE thank you and shout out goes to everyone who has connected with us through our travel blog , all the people who have become fans on our Facebook Fanpage and contributed to our community there , and a big cheers to all those awesome peeps who interact with us on Twitter . <p> How We Share Some Blog Lovin <p> We come from the mentality of abundance . We believe there is enough room online and offline for everyone and everything . We have always been about helping and sharing , whether it be helping other travelers whilst traveling , our family and friends , and now other bloggers . Each of us need all of us , and all of us need each of us . <p> Zig Ziglar says " Help enough other people get what they want , and you will get what you want ! " <p> So , here is just a snippet of what we do <p> Every month on our Facebook fanpage we have a fan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jess from Globetrottergirlsand Laurence from Finding the Universe . <p> Every Sunday we have a Tag Party where we encourage you to share your favourite fan pages . <p> On Fridays we have Post Your URL Daywhere we give you the opportunity to post your own travel blogs URL on our wall so everyone can see what you 've got going on ! <p> Our Fanpage is just as much yours , as it is ours , so pop your head in and let 's hear what you 've got goin on <p> Victoria Falls , Zimbabwe 2003 <p> Who Inspires Us <p> Firstly.One of our favorite motivational figures is Yossi Ghinsberg . One of our most memorable travel books that we read whilst backpacking was his bookLost In The Jungle , a true story of survival in the Amazon Jungle . And what was even better is that we got to meet Yossi in person and hear him speak in Peurto Rico . <p> With Yossi Ghinsberg in Peurto Rico 2009 <p> Watch this short video as Yossi talks about " How To Live Outside the Box <p> Secondly.Being the sports fanatics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there has been no-one better or bigger than Michael Jordan in his sport ( did I hear someone say " Tar Heels " lol ) . But even the great man himself failed many times , as this short video below explains , and that 's ok , because as long as you Never Ever Quit and you keep stepping up , you will succeed ! <p> Our Personal Tips : <p> Do the Best You Can , from Where You Are , with What You Have.Everyone comes into this with different skills , backgrounds , experiences , knowledge , resources , and time . <p> Do n't  Hide Behind the Internet.We ca n't believe how many blogs and facebook fanpages we visit and we have no idea what the person looks like , what their real name is , or where they come from . How can you make a connection with this person ? We cant . <p> People Follow People , Not Your Blog.Be yourself , bring out your personality , use lots of photos with you in them , and build your brand . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is great , because they will do more for your blog than the hundreds of one-time visitors who will just come and go . Who is it that interacts with you , shows you some lovin , and " shares " your blog ? <p> Do n't  be a Social Media Fake.Its amazing how many people call themselves social media experts , yet they are unapproachable and its all about them . People , social media is like a big party . You would n't invite someone into your home for a party and ignore them and their comments would you ? So , if someone leaves you a comment , question , or whatever.do your best to respond to it . <p> Do n't  Get Obsessed With Back Links First focus on writing great content , building your brand , and finding your niche . Then people will stumble you , tweet you , like you , subscribe to you , and link to you . It will eventually take care of itself . <p> Do n't  Be a Pain In The Ass.When on the road travelling do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be like it is back home , and always invest in an open mind .. You signed up for this so deal with it , or please , just stay at home ! <p> Our Future Plans : <p> To be the best we can , from where we are , with what we have Lol.Other than that : <p> To get back on the road ASAP ! <p> We are creating two other websites and facebook pages ! <p> Incorporate video blogging ! <p> More focus on travel destination tips ! <p> Adding more content pages to all our sites ! <p> To share more blog and social media lovin ! <p> To have a second child ! <p> To Party Hard and Live out Loud ! <p> OK , that 's a wrap !

@@21821011 @1821011/ <h> Living in Chiang Mai <p> With a squeal of brakes the noisy old bus clattered into the station and wheezed to a stop , kicking up a small cloud of dust in the early afternoon sunshine . <p> The brief silence was shattered as the door swung open to a crowd of tuk-tuk drivers clamouring to offer over-priced rides into the city . <p> I scooped up my backpack , squinted towards the carpark and grinned as I headed towards the nearest songthaew . <p> Chiang Mai <p> I had made it to Chiang Mai . <p> Coming from a laid-back month in Laos I was n't sure what to expect from this large city in Thailands north , but after a couple of days of exploring its temples and laneways the place started to get under my skin . <p> Even with the downpours of monsoon season turning the streets into rivers each evening , there was something about being there that just felt right . <p> I could n't quite put my finger on it at the time , but as I headed south to Bangkok and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chiang Mai . <p> A year later my body returned as well . <p> Much had happened in those twelve months . My previous trip had finished and I had gone back to Australia . I rented an apartment . I got a real job . I drank great coffee and pretended to fit in . For the entire time I was there , though , part of me really wanted to be somewhere else . <p> A couple of months ago I listened to that part of me . I packed up my life again and headed back to Thailand . <p> It was absolutely the right choice . <p> As good as Chiang Mai was during the monsoon months , it is immeasurably better when the sun is shining . <p> The cooler months from December to February offer a welcome respite from Aprils sweltering heat or the rains that start in June . Cold enough at night to sleep without a fan but more than warm enough to lie beside the pool in the afternoon , there is no better time to be here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The cuisine of northern Thailand is noticeably different to that further south , with obvious influences from nearby Burma and Laos. - Khao soy is my new best friend . <p> The night markets <p> The air of the night markets is filled with the tantalising aroma of foods and spices being simmered and stir-fried to perfection . <p> Perched on a plastic chair watching the ebb and flow of people walking past , I enjoy some of the best food and drink of my life for a dollar or two . <p> On the rare occasion I want something different there is a surprisingly depth of international food here as well . Excellent Mexican , Italian , Indian and other Asian restaurants do a thriving trade at very reasonable prices . <p> Thailand promotes itself heavily as the Land of Smiles . <p> While that cliche can sometimes be hard to find in the tourist-heavy south of the country , the genuine warmth of the people that live in Chiang Mai brings a smile to my own face as well . <p> I pay local prices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stall holders take the time to stop and chat for a while many know me by name , or at least by my regular order. - People in the street smile at me , and I smile back . <p> Most of the time though I am just another face in the crowd , just another guy at the traffic lights . I am not special , and nor do I want to be . <p> I am just living here . <p> Chiang Mai is the perfect spot for people looking to drop out of the rat race and do something different for a while . Fast internet and reliable power let me work online. - My furnished apartment ( including utilities ) costs around $250 per month , and total expenses struggle to hit $1000 . <p> The pace of life is surprisingly slow here , and even the daily traffic jams barely raise an eyebrow as I weave between snarled vehicles on my scooter . Having one is a luxury , really most things I need are within walking distance of the old town , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the countryside is a few minutes away and the alpine scenery and quiet roads cry out for regular exploration . <p> Chiang Mai <p> Food , weather , infrastructure , culture , scenery . This place has it all . <p> The only thing it is missing is a beach but then again if it had one it would n't be Chiang Mai . Without the resorts and sun loungers this place offers something different to the rest of Thailand . <p> I will happily holiday in the islands for a month or two with the sand between my toes , but it is to Chiang Mai I will return when the rains come . <p> Of course to return , I will have to leave in the first place . <p> I do n't  even know if I can . <p> BIO : Dave grew up in a small town in New Zealand , which seemed like the perfect incentive to get out and see what the rest of the world looked like as soon as possible .

I hope we have a chance to get together again before you head off . <p> Chiang Mai is indeed a fantastic place for digital nomads to hang out and get some work done . What surprised me the most is the amazing art and music scene here . There is some great local talent here with art galleries and good live music every night . The cafes , while very western , are also fantastic . <p> I also have been getting some dental work done at 10% the cost of Canada . <p> While I enjoyed Chiang Mai , my experience as a tourist was completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a great city , but for me , it feels like one of those places that needs more time than the average tourist can give it . You need some time there to explore all of its hidden gems and to let the experience soak in . <p> I think that , had I more time to explore its streets in ore detail , to get to know more people there , I would have enjoyed it a lot more . <p> Still a great , friendly , beautiful city in itself and a great jumping off point for other locations in Northern Thailand .

I have been to places that have taught me about Australian history , such as Gallipoli , Turkey. - ANZAC Day has such a special meaning for me now , and all because I have been there , felt it , and can understand what our diggers sacrificed for our Country . Travel not only teaches you about other countries , but allows you to develop a deeper appreciation for your own . <h> What has been your most memorable travel experience yet ? <p> My most memorable travel experience would have to be travelling around South Africa , Zimbabwe and Botswana. - I adore animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind blowing. - I spent three days in the Okavango Delta and to hear the lions roaring of a night was simply amazing .

I could n't anyway as it sounds like a 747 taking off and would totally drown out my voice . <p> The ancient computer also ca n't work without electrical charge so I ca n't be too mobile with it . I do as much work as I can using word , but then the other day word would n't open and I thought I lost all my docs , that I had n't  yet backed up . <p> The iPad is useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook . <p> The Samsung Tablet wont charge anymore . I think because the kids always used it while it was charging . I never realized that was a thing ! <p> And my phone battery is useless , the car charger has broken , as has one of our phone chargers . So were down to sharing one . Grr ! <p> And then there is , of course , the fucking internet . <p> We were packing the van up at 5:30am last week so we could drive an hour to the next nearest town , which we were praying would have internet . I was hosting a webinar at 9am and could not miss it . Luckily the one street town had a library and internet and the lovely librarian let me use one of their conference rooms to do it . <p> This racing around to find a signal is a common part of our day . <h> Insights into dealing with tech issues on the road <h> 1 . Drink lots of wine <p> Yep . Pour yourself a great big mofo glass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its in the morning , but totally up to you . I cant tell you how many times the internet has made me want to pour myself a double bourbon at 9am and I do n't  even drink hard liquor . <h> 2 . Surrender <p> What else can you do ? Have a little dummy spit if you must , but then just let it go and deal with it as best you can . <p> No point crying over spilt milk , as they say . And if you lose some files , its not the end of the world . You 'll recover . You cant take any of it with you in the end anyway . <p> There 's always a reason behind everything . I take great comfort in remembering a time five years ago in 2010 when my computer suddenly just stopped connecting to the internet . I surrendered and decided to use that opportunity to start writing a book about my travels . That adventure soon led to us starting a travel blog . Probably never would have happened had the computer not died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hurdle is in fact leading me to somewhere awesome ! I 'll let you know once we discover what that is. <h> 3 . Protect yourself with an extended warranty <p> We usually do n't  pay the extra money for these extended warranties on tech gear . We 've often found them a waste , but when we brought my ASUS last year in Victoria , we knew we were heading into hardcore travel territory and it was best we did . <p> Super glad we did as it means my computer will now be repaired or replaced free of charge . The only problem is the computer broke in Alice Springs , and for some reason , it takes three weeks for it to arrive in Melbourne to be assessed . <p> Apparently the Cobb &amp; Co are still running the mail in these parts . <p> Its been three weeks now and I still do n't  have a computer and Harvey Norman currently do n't  know where it is ! Fantastic . Perhaps the coach was held up by Ned Kelly . <p> Make sure you keep your receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them know how important your computer is to you . It probably wo n't make a difference , but you 'll feel better . <h> 3 . Back up your computer <p> Okay , so I do n't  regularly back up . I 'm lazy . Ive tried scheduling backups before , but they do n't  work and because I 'm rarely on the computer if it backs up when I am it slows down my productivity . And , to be honest , I feel really stupid as I do n't  even know how to restore the backups if the computer breaks . Am I just complicating things ? <p> Going to fix that . <p> We have these external hard drives , which we- keep all our photos on . But , they tend to get banged up a bit . We also have protective cases for them , which I think is worthwhile having . <p> By the way , if you have one of these long-term warranties , and you need to save your data from the hard drive ( because you 're like me and do n't  have a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up their offer to take your data off for around $160 . <p> Go to a local computer shop and have them take it off first . It only cost me $80 . <p> Yes , on my new computer , I will have a regular backing up routine ! <h> 4 . Backup online <p> I sometimes back up important files and documents to Dropbox . I do n't  like to back up online much because of our stupid internet costs . This would eat up my data and cost me thousands each month . I am not joking ! <p> I just laugh at people when they suggest backing up anything online . " Mate , I 'm from Australia , do n't  be stupid . " <h> 5 . Prioritize your work <p> Were usually very good at prioritizing and being very swift with our work , which is another reason we cry when the internet fails us . <p> We know we have limited time to push out a lot of content , and we can given the internet works . But mostly it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity . We cant wait to stop traveling so we can actually get stuff done . <p> We 've had to be brutal with what we can and cant do this past three weeks . Pretty eye-opening how much time you waste on irrelevant stuff . Once the computer comes back , I 'm still going to pretend we only have one so I can stay focused . <p> And now the ones who ask us questions that can be answered by a simple Google Search get deleted too . Another of my pet hates . <p> Respect peoples time the number one key to building solid relationships ! <p> Our ebook has a serious amount of travel strategies and tips in there too ! <h> 6 . Have backup devices and rotate between work <p> We use our dinosaur computer to edit photos on Lightroom and to write our content on Word . When one is doing that , the other jumps on the Mac Air to do all our work that needs to be done online . Its not the best solution , but its helping . <p> Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . I do n't  do much typing or creation work on the iPad . You cant even download on it . Give me a tablet any day . <p> Being computer less has been a great opportunity to nut out a lot of plans and create systems using good old pen and paper . This is the stuff that has been on our list of things to do and is priority work . Now when we settle down well have a plan to quickly implement . <p> Emails can be micro-managed and sometimes answered using our phones . Social media can usually be easily done on our phone , which eases the burden . <h> 7 . Get help through Google <p> The only computer classes I 've ever taken was in University on ancient- Macintosh desktops . Since then I 've used PCs and have never taken a class . I 've always been able to easily figure out how to use it . I believe theyd define that as intuitive . <p> Apparently , Apple products are sooooooooooo intuitive . <p> WTF ? <p> I 've never used Google so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you save something on Apple ? How do you download a movie on an iPad ? Why cant I save anything to my external hard drive on an Apple ? Why cant I open links in a PDF on the iPad ? Why is Apple a pain in the arse ? Would you say that the Apple cult is a greater brainwashing then Waeco Texas ? <p> There ai n't  nothing intuitive about it . Im know not a genius , but I 'm certainly not stupid . I do n't  want to use something I have to grow a new brain to use before intuitive becomes a definition . <p> So if you have n't guessed I hate Apple almost as much as I hate Australian internet . And now Im stuck with it until my beloved ASUS PC returns . <p> Trying to manage these issues using Apple products has increased my stress levels and has confirmed for me the fact that once you go Apple , you can go back ! <h> 8 . Use an iXpand Flash Drive <p> Not only can you use it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your iPad , which Kalyra did in two days with her obsession with taking photos and vlogs ( she 's very cute , funny , and talented btw ) <p> I had to make her delete them all so I could download a movie ( through iTunes as its the only way you can ) . Now she can save more onto the drive because we sure as hell ai n't  saving them to the cloud ! <p> The iXpand Flash Drive has saved my sanity by allowing me to transfer files between the iPad , - the MacAir and our old PC . Because I cant save anything onto my external hard drive using the Mac and it meant I could n't get anything done when Craig needed to use the Mac or vice versa . <p> If we did n't  have the iXpand to transfer those files and photos we would have been screwed and I 'd be sobbing all over again . <p> I love this device and for Apple lovers out there , I recommend it . Its useful and intuitive . <p> Now , I know that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean many of you are n't  . I can not ignore what our readers like and love . So for all you Apple fans out there , I still love ya and respect your devotion . I wish I had your brain ! <h> 9 . Use protective equipment <p> Travelling with your tech gear will cause you to have a lot more wear and tear and bumps and scratches . Its best to invest wisely up front to protect your gear from damage . <p> We have just finished our 18-month road trip and seriously limped across the finish line . Craig and I laughed about it when we cracked open the wine oclock and realized we only had one wine glass left . What the hell ! <p> The tech gears falling apart , the wife no longer wants to cook , the vans crumbling around us and weve only got one freakin wine glass . <p> You know the world as you know it- is coming to an end when that happens . <p> Bring on the Gold Coast and " normal " living , its going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomad biz . Its not anywhere near as glamourous as the brochure makes out ! <p> Update : Because it takes so long to write and publish a post this is a bit behind the time .

I also just found this post to explain how your energy field can affect technology and what you can do about it . <p> Share your travel tech woes and tips . What broke ? What did you lose and how did you handle it ? <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> The worry I have with that is the data costs to do it . I really need some tech guru to come and set all that up for me , as I do n't  know what I 'm doing and just put it off as I do n't  have the time to learn . Can it sync between Mac and PC ? <p> Yeah . There 's a notification that pops up when you do that says it will drain the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea either . I do it all the time as well obviously ! ! Unless there is something else going on with it . I 'd not do it just to be sure . <p> I totally agree ! The computer devils seem especially hard at work in other countries and out in the sticks ! We 've had our share of internet battles that most people reading travel blogs would n't understand , sigh <p> Backing up our computer files is high on our list always because if ( when ! ) the computer dies we can still keep rolling . We 've adopted the paperless life , so all the important stuff is encrypted and everything is backed up a few times . I insist on double-backing-up my files on 2 external hard drives because the internet where we travel is n't what these " online backup " preachers have at their fingertips . <p> Hi Caz , thanks very much for sharing ! If I had the choice I 'd choose number 2 . Surrender " properly because I 'm 53 years old and I 've traveled the planet when I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even thought of . And I 'd properly add number 11 . : First travel , then write , then publish . Or alternatively : travel and write " and have someone else publish your posts and take care of the rest . At least that was something we learned before the year 2000 <p> Back when we were complete n00bs , we would ALWAYS have issues with our hard drives . There were always corrupted files and this eventually cost us hundreds of dollars in other hard drives abroad . Our advice is to experiment with your equipment and get a good grasp of knowledge before arriving abroad and being absolutely clueless and then getting angry ! <p> I will be going on a 10 month Raodtrip around Australia soon . At the moment I am also evaluating my tech options . One of the things is data-backup mostly for pictures and movies , the all important memories you do n't  want to lose ! One of the ideas I had was to use an online backup service ( Dropbox , I-Drive , OneDrive , ) and do online backups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in restaurants , bars , tourist offices , ) . Is this something that is relatively common in Australia or rather something you only find in the larger cities ? I will also have a mobile data plan ( preferably Telstra after reading about your experience ) for accessing the internet on the go , not to shift large amounts of data . I would like to avoid only having my pictures with me for such a long time ( even if I had 1 or 2 backups ) you never know what might happen . <p> Since I wont be doing any work at all on the go . Just enjoying the road trip and my family , I was wondering if it would be necessary to bring as laptop . In my mind a Tablet would be enough for some web-browsing , entertainement , communication and online backups . Plus it is much more compact , lighter an less fragile . <p> I think if you 're comfortable with just the tablet and it suits what you need it for then it should be fine to bring with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in Australia and if it does it can be really slow .

@@21821020 @1821020/ <h> Trust Where Travel is Pulling You <p> Do you ever feel a dying urge to travel to a destination , or do you have an unexplained fascination with a certain place or period in time ? I often find these urges are taking me to a certain place to learn something about either myself or life. - These travel directional pulls need to be listened to with close attention . <p> Growing up , I had a fascination with the Vietnam War . I did not know where it came from , but I could not deny that it was there . I watched all the TV shows and movies , listened to all the music from that era , and read all the books I could get my hands on about it . I often thought that perhaps in my previous life I was a soldier in the war or a peace protester on the streets . My friends always made comments to the effect that I was a hippy somewhere once . <p> Whether or not this is true about my past life , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urge that was pulling me to Vietnam for some reason . I followed that urge and first went there in 99 with my best friend . It was my trip of a lifetime and I soaked it all up . I did all the war tours , crawled through tunnels , hung out on China Beach , and traipsed around in the steamy jungled landscape I had seen in all the movies and books . - I loved being a part of this exotic world that had enchanted me for years and I could see why so many soldiers became trapped in its allure . <p> Craters and where grass will no longer grow <p> Within this captivating world , however , lay a world of destruction , and the horror of a land and people ravaged by war was evident everywhere . In many parts where the war was heaviest , craters still remain deeply embedded over the countryside , and dirt exists permanently where lush grass used to grow . <p> Bombs and unexploded ordnance threaten to continue killing daily , and children and grown adults walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agent Orange disfigurements . Life intended to teach me that war is never a good thing . <p> Upon returning home , the reading of the books continued but with somewhat diminished fervor . Then the attack on the World Trade center happened and planted some seeds of doubt within me . I was not completely satisfied , and the pull returned , dragging me and Craig with it- in 2002 . <p> One morning , Craig and I sat on the beach chatting as a woman sat over the cooking stove she carried across her shoulders , like a set of balancing scales all day along the beach . <p> All in a day 's work <p> She was barbecuing- some fresh prawns and we communicated using the universal language of smiles and laughter . A young boy walked up with a pineapple for sale . Before we had a chance to ask him how much , we heard an unmistakeably loud explosion coming from the jungle behind us . Fear and sickness struck a blow to my stomach and I swallowed hard . The young man shrugged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the next breath continued " So do you want to buy a pineapple ? " I will never support war as a result of my time in Vietnam , instead I choose to work for peace by first allowing it to exist in my own heart . Since that last visit my fascination with Vietnam , or any war for that matter , vanished . I 've never picked up a book or watched a movie about it again . <p> It was not just truths about war and peace that I came to learn in Vietnam . It was while lying on a beach in Nha Trang , that I met a man who was to forever change my thoughts about my life . I was absorbed in a book I had purchased the day before from a book seller on the beach , and yes , again it was about the Vietnam War . <p> The clanging of change close to me caused me to lift up the side of my book and peer around it . There on the sand , sat the trunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the hip , were two little deformed feet , in the place where legs should have been . My eyes moved up toward his face , which was covered by the shadow of his large baseball cap . On either side of his shoulders , where arms should have been , sat two deformed hands , one of them holding the small calico bag containing the coins he was begging for . My minds shutters clicked at that moment , etching finely the snapshot of that small little man forever into my memory . <p> Follow , listen , learn <p> From that day on , his image would appear , followed by- a phrase that I would use and remember during all times of my life , happy or sad , and no matter how small or big my problems may be , <p> " I - have two arms and two legs , I 'm doing well . " <p> This small little man had taught me the power of gratitude ; there is always someone who is worse off than you , so you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always going to pull you in the direction you need to go to learn the things you need to fulfill your purpose . Trust in those , follow them , and pay attention so you can learn the lesson and move on . The only challenge is trying to work out what it is all for and what your purpose is , but when you ask the right questions , the Universe tends to answer them for you . Now when I feel the urge to go somewhere , the questions I ask are : Why am I feeling this ? What is it I need to learn ? <p> And then I 'll follow with eyes and ears open . <p> Have you ever been pulled in the direction of a place before through urges or unusual fascinations ? Where did you go and what did you learn there ? Or do you feel it now ? <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> Great write Having also traveled to Vietnam a couple of times , I agree with everything you have said I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as a huge admiration of their work ethic . And it is an absolutely beautiful country to bout , from Halong Bay to Phu Quoc . Just shows how wrong war is . <p> Its in your face just how wrong war is hey ? If only the leaders instigating all the wars could see this and come up with better solutions . We did n't  make it to Phu Quoc but I have heard and seen through photos that it is stunning . <p> A great , great piece of writing . Your fascination with Vietnam perhaps is n't unique , but the things you 've learned from it and the story you 've told with it certain are . <p> I 've never quite been moved to visit a place like you have , but I do have the unexplainable urge to visit Eastern Europe ( especially places like Hungary and Romania ) . Hopefully someday I 'll get there to explore the pull this area of the world has on me . <p> There will be some lesson there for you , no matter how small . Just start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those areas and you might be able to uncover something . You 'll get there ! <p> I think travel is our only hope to bring about peace and joy . That is why I am such a huge advocate for it and one of the main reasons for this blog . I just want everyone to travel so they can see a world that is full of joy , wonder , peace and love . <p> Great post ! I too feel pulled to visit Vietnam . but I cant really explain why . Actually , I think its more of a pull towards S.E Asia in general . But , I 'm a huge proponent in following gut instincts , so I 'm sure I 'll make it there one day ! Thank you for fueling my urge to work even harder towards this goal ! <p> wow , that was so well written i wish to write like that .. and the 2 photos ( Trust in the Pull &amp; All in a days work ) are fabulous !

As an Asian , I always feel that pull to visit Indo-China , so far its been all good except that I need to re-visit some of the amazing countries again . Vietnam namely as there is so much they have to offer . <p> Nice post Caz . The pull of a place you have never been to is an interesting one . Once you explore that pull and get there , it is amazing how impressions and ideas can change like it did for you . I do n't  think I have ever been pulled to a place . I feel this need to go to Greece at some point , but for some reason ( despite being in Europe multiple times ) I never get there . Perhaps that is another facet of the travel pull . Do you actually go or keep your notions at bay ? <p> Love this post Caz . You created such a compelling story that is highly identifiable at least for me . <p> Places definitely have an attraction that pull each person differently and lures them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young I felt an attraction with Thailand I dreamt about visiting that place all the time . I finally got to visit it in 2008 , but still , I feel the pull calling me back . And just like you , for some reason I feel a certain " fascination " with a period of time . In my case is WWII . Last spring I took the time to visit some places in Europe to try to look first hand the effects of WWII and what it left behind . I wrote briefly about some of the WWII places i visited in my blog. http : //wp.me/pUmHK-tg <p> I let myself be pulled all around the world I do n't  resist it , there 's no reason to . <p> I always relate to your posts ! This so gracefully explains why I never " worry " about where I want to go next the opportunity always arises , and who am I to argue . I always have such a hard time explaining it , but I do go where my travel gut tells me . This gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I agree that the pull you feel is something that is seeking a completion in the place you 're drawn to . I love that there are these mysteries that we occasionally feel in certain places . We know we must go but not why . I do agree there are lessons the Universe sets us up for . These days I wonder about that . I should be asking myself exactly what you suggest what is it that I 'm to learn ? <p> Talking of Vietnam War , we would recomend to read some books such as " Quite American , Diary of Ms Dang Thuy Tram . Even though the war is behind but lots of Vietnamese are suffering from its results especially orange agent . <p> I hope that we all together can do something to help those victims of Vietnam War .

Maybe you might have to move back in with your parents for awhile . <p> Do what you have to do . <h> Sell Unused Possessions <p> Ebay and Craigslist are ready to be your new best friend . <p> Go through all your crap and sell what you do n't  need or use . Even if you only make a couple of hundred bucks , that is money that will give you a few days in Asia or Africa . It is all worth it . <p> Trade your materialistic things for memories . <h> Make it a Working Holiday <p> This is one of our favorite strategies . If you plan to make your travels around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash beforehand , then one of the best ways to fund your travels is to work as you go . <p> This means you do n't  have to save as much to begin with and once you are there you 'll be earning the local currency . <p> My students in Bangkok , Thailand <p> You also get to experience another culture deeply by being immersed in the day to day living . <p> You can hop from country to country on different working holiday visas , and if you are lucky enough you might land a work opportunity that provides you with free flights and accommodation . <p> This happened to us in Australia , Thailand , and the USA . <h> Save Your Tax Returns and Bonuses <p> This has given us huge lumps of money at times to travel with . Tax returns and bonuses are unexpected win falls . <p> Do n't  ever use this money for anything other than paying off debts or saving for your dreams . Take that cash and put it straight into your savings account . <p> In 2005 , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer months and did not have anywhere near the amount of money we needed . From out of the blue , a friend I worked with in Dublin contacted me to let me know I had back pay due to me from when I taught in Dublin for 6 months . <p> After arranging how she could deposit in my bank account for me , I had $2,500 to go play with on our road trip . <h> How Do I Save Money for World Travel ? <p> Get clear on what it is you want from life . <p> If you find you have a wardrobe full of clothes never worn , or a shed full of unused toys then you are not clear on what you want from life or your purpose . <p> The stuff is filling that void for you . Why are you here ? What do you want your life to be represented by stuff or memories ? <p> When tempted to buy things you do n't really need you need , stop and ask yourself some serious questions : <p> Could this be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Barrier Reef ? <p> Do I want this to be the representation of my life 's experiences ? <p> How will it enrich my life and bring me closer to my goals ? <h> Luxury Verse Needs <p> Get back to basics . <p> You do n't  really need a lot to survive , nor to have a great life really . You can get by with less . Your life will feel less cluttered , which will free up more energy in order to attract more money to you . <p> Ditch the labels , the expensive price tags , the brand new cars and other goods , the fancy restaurants , and top shelf drinks . Start living on a needs basis , not a want . <h> Public Transport <p> One thing we loved about living in big cities like London , Bangkok and Dublin was that we did not need a car . Cars are expensive . <p> Not only do you have to buy it , you have to insure it , maintain it , and fill it with expensive fuel . <p> Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car for public transport or better yet , your feet . This will help you get in shape for your travels physically as well as financially . <h> Eat at Home <p> This is probably the one we have most difficulty with and I blame travel for this . We are too used to going out to eat , especially in cheap countries like Asia and Africa . <p> The first place to cut is buying your work lunches . Take your own lunch to work , including drinks and yes coffee ... bye bye Starbucks ( weep ) . <p> Reduce dinners out as much as you can and substitute them for picnics at the park or barbecues at home with your mates . Make eating at home fun by trying new recipes and drinking local beer and wine while you cook . <h> Live Off One Wage <p> This was one of our biggest strategies for saving a lot of money fast . If you do n't  put this into practice before you know it you will have spent both your wages on stuff you do n't  need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you have followed these saving tips for world travel ) and then bank one whole complete wage into a savings account and live off the other . <p> If you do n't  have the money for something , then you cant do it . <h> Open a Travel Savings Account <p> Use a high-interest savings account for your travel fund . Automate it so that a certain amount goes in there each week , or month , depending on how often you get paid , and reduce your access to it to avoid temptation . <p> Research to find out which savings account is going to give you the best interest with low fees . In Australia we use the ING Savings Maximiser account as our travel fund of choice . <h> Work Out a Travel Plan <p> Take some time to plan your travel style <p> How do you plan on getting around when you travel ? <p> What sort of places are you willing to stay , where will you eat ? <p> In other words how low budget do you plan to go ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater chance you have to get on the road earlier and for longer . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> Really really useful tips , thank you ! I feel really inspired now , I guess that if you have a dream , there is always a way to try and save for it ! When traveling in Asia , where most of foreigners take cabs , i try to take public transport too , not only you save money , but also get to learn a lot : language , about the geography , the local people , the area . Another thing is restaurants , i try to go eat following some local . I may get some stomach ache the first day if I am not used to it , but , its cheaper and plus , you get to learn what do they really eat . That 's the whole point of traveling after all no ? it does not make sense to go to another country and try to live on starbucks like if you were home . thanks ! <p> If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice and get it done . But you have to have a big enough reason WHY ? And yes , traveling like the locals is always best financially and for interaction . <p> I am a single mom planning an around the world trip with my daughter in two years time . It might seem like a long time away but it coincides with the paying off of a HUGE loan and a number of months to use that freed up money to bump up my savings . I have a boarder that has been with us for a couple of years . I recently renovated my basement so I could get a second boarder in and fast track our savings ( paid for the reno with my tax return ) . I am also planning to rent my house while were away so I can cover my mortgage , property tax , insurance and condo fees . <p> Your trip sounds great . Good idea to pay off that bad debt first and then work on the savings . That 's what we did and we also rented our place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = <p> Fantastic tips ! You have to be intentional about saving and sacrifice in order to get what you want . <p> I live in a one income household with two kids in the most expensive state in the US California . Yet I have no debt . I made it a focus of mine to pay off debt that I have and I refuse to live in debt . In 2009 , I had a car accident that forced me to buy a new car for my family . In Sept 09 , I bought a 2005 car . In April 2011 , that car was paid off . <p> Living on a budget is essential whether you are traveling or not . There are lots of little tips but you must know the difference between needs and wants and sacrifice you wants to get something you want even more . One of the biggest things I would encourage people to do is pay off their debt as this will be something that can really free you up once it is paid off . <p> Fantastic tips ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stop there ! = <p> We followed a lot of these same principles when we saved for our trip . Our biggest accomplishment was n't saving for the trip , it was paying off our student loans before the trip- leaving us with no debt hanging over our heads . That made travel A LOT easier and coming home even better ! The key is to find out where you spend your money and then decide where you can cut back ! ! <p> Useful tips , particularly the get rid of your crap one . I also often barter , trading in one item I do n't  need for another I do . One more thing : create a nest egg wghich you will absolutely not touch . I do this by buying gold , mostly in the form of coins and stash them in the bank .. then forget abiut them . If ever there is an emergency , they can easily be converted into cash . <p> My wife and I are in the process of simplifying our lives to free ourselves up for new opportunities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traveling . This certainly gets me thinking in the right direction . <p> You have to spend all day on the boat , pulling the cages out of the water that house the pearl shell . There are baby ones , and full grown ones . You then have to put them through a cleaning machine , chip all the barnacles and growth off them and throw them back into the ocean . Very laborious and monotonous work . EVerything else surrounding it is exotic though <p> What a wonderful article this is , I need to earn a lot of courage to follow your lead . Sacrificing all the things that you are used to save money for world travel is actually needed . The most useful tip I got is to have a working holiday visa . I 'm a teacher myself so I guess I can dot it . Wish me luck ! <p> I am recently divorced and am looking for that BIG change . I have always wanted to spend my life traveling not sitting behind a desk spending my life wishing . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts man o man am I thinking not only should I look into it again , its time to stop wishing and hoping and start LIVING ! <p> Great tips ! Sometimes working the harder jobs etc mining or hard labour is ca n't hard and exhausting but in the end you are paid very well and as you have said , if its your dream , you struggle through it ! It is about need not want you have to be strong and decide you do n't  need to buy those new random gadgets you have seen all over TV , you want to save to be able to enjoy your dream in life travelling <p> Absolutely ! I feel like I am so way behind everyone most of the time with stuff and technology because I never collect any of it . I think it is fine to have these things in your life as long as you are n't  attached to it and it is not detracting you from living your dreams . <p> Indeed ! In the end , the things you do make memories not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things but as I grow old , i want to experience more thing than get new laptops or phones . I would rather use the $2k for a new laptop on a plane ticket ! <p> Hi , some great tips . Just wondering how you go about travelling with 2 little kids all the expense of christmas and birthdays and extra stuff ? We intend on doing a couple of years travelling with 2 little kids in a couple of years and just wonder how you manage . Thanks <p> You just have to be really selective with what you spend your money on . Remember memories are more important than possessions . Children will be fine if they only receive one small gift on these special days . Make sure you know what your priorities are and plan your budget around that . <p> I just stumbled across your blog today and have been reading a whole bunch of your articles ! I am currently in college and have always wanted to travel but I have not had the means or time to do so . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to travel all around the world ! <p> Hi , I 'm reading your issues on your year round family travel and I really enjoy it . I wish I could use all of your advises for earning more money out of the things that we possess ( and probably not need ) . I have n't used e-bay yet but I think I should give it a try ( I live in Athens , Greece ) . I do travel ( in Europe and USA ) and really enjoy it . Last summer me ( 50 ) and my daughter ( 16 ) drove with our little car all the way from Athens to Switzerland through Albany , Montenegro , Croatia , Bosnia , Slovenia and North Italy ( 6.500 km roundtrip ) in just 12 days . We crossed borders 15 times ! ! We fell in love with the Dolomites region ( were North Italy borders with Austria ) and with Venice . Slovenia is a surprise with beautiful lake Bled , Triglav gorge and the Postoina caves . Croatia is proud of the Plitvice waterfalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden difficulty ( my mother in law died the very first night of our trip , so we speeded in 3 days to Bergamo , Italy , parked the car there , catch a plane that cost us a fortune , came back for a few hours and return next day to continue with our trip ) . The hole trip cost us about 1.500 euros ( except for the unforeseen costs of airtickets ) . We have booked our accomodation from booking.com and saved a lot and we ate only at night , buying cheese and ham from the supermarket . That way I lost 4 kg ! ! and speared a lot of money . But the best think was that we had a great time together with my daughter , she was my precious co-driver , responsible for the maps and did an exccelent job , we talked a lot ( while I drove almost 10 hours every day ! ! ) and never quarrelled ( something that happens all the time back home , with the tension of schools , jobs etc ) . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 16 and son of 9 ) . My wish for 2015 is to persuade the rest 2 of our family to join us this year in another challenging trip . I wish you a happy new year and all the best for your travels to come . <p> Thank you SO much for sharing this ! It 's easy to look at people who travel all the time and think they are simply living the life without paying off a cent so this is such an important message to anyone and everyone who travels ! Sacrifices are hard but oh so worth it ! <p> I can relate to all of these- the things we do for travelIt 's always worth it . There 's nothing more annoying than people living with the same possible opportunities as us &amp; saying they ca n't afford to travel . You just need to make sacrifices ! ! Keep exploring <p> Great advice on saving money ! It is the most common question we get asked after traveling the world . How can you afford it ? As you mentioned , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up a few luxuries and save for that epic trip . We have now seen over 100+ countries with fairly average wages so yes , it is possible !

" <p> No compassion , just a shake of the head and more barking to clean and move the car . <p> Except I was not moving the car .

For those shorter holidays I also want a little more comfort as I 'm travelling more for indulgence , destination highlights and relaxation . <p> Researching online can be a whole lot of fun IF you have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . <p> I generally leave the hotel research and booking sites to Craig because they do my head in .

It acts a little like Pinterest and Trover in that you can create boards , called yonderboxes , which you add your potential or dream hotels into . <p> A yonderbox is like a travel scrapbook , a place where you keep hotel ideas and notes for your trip . You make your own or follow other boxes including those offering expert tips from travel advisors and bloggers . <p> Yonderbound came at the right time for me because we are currently considering a holiday over Christmas in Bali . ( Yes we need a holiday from the holiday ) I 've got yoga retreat in Ubud calling me , but I 'm not sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . <p> So I jumped on Yonderbound to create a yonderbox of hotel options for Bali . <h> Searching for Hotels on Yonderbound <p> Yonderbound acts like a typical search engine . <p> Type in your destination , dates and people in your travelling party and it will return the results . You can filter by distance , price , or trip advisor reviews . You can select map or grid view for the results . <p> I love how the design of Yonderbound is very modern and clean . Its very sticky , which means it inspires you to stay on and click around . <p> Yes . you could get lost on there for awhile . <p> Its addictive like Pinterest and Trover too because suddenly you want to start creating lists for all your dream bucket destinations and experiences . <p> Each hotel comes up with a price , information on the hotel , a map , the facilities available and reviews from Trip Advisor direct on the information page . <p> I really liked this feature and not having to click over to Trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add the hotel as a possible to my yonderbox or not . <p> I also liked how the results gave you the figure for one night but also totaled up your entire stay once you clicked on the hotel to see more information . <h> How to Create Yonderboxes <p> A yonderbox is easy to create . <p> You find the hotels you are interested in and then add them to your yonderbox . You create a yonderbox based upon the destination you are visiting or the experience you are wanting to have around the world . <p> So for example , we created this yonderbox on Luxury accommodation in Australia . <p> These are the places we 've had on our Australia bucket list for years . <p> We have n't made them happen yet , but I 'm a big believer in the power of vision boards helping to create your desires and I like how I can easily set up this one purely just for hotels . <p> Now I have these boards set up , its so easy for me to find them again if the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into my yonderbox to see the price and availability and book directly from there . <p> You can add in any special notes for any of the hotels you add to your yonderbox , which is such a helpful tool for planning and finally deciding which place or places to stay in . <p> It can help you remember why you liked a certain place or what are the stand outs . <p> When we are looking at so many places it is easy to forget and time consuming to go back and reread information and reviews . <p> Yonderboxes are displayed beautifully as well with big thumbnail images and separated into locations .. <h> Yonderboxes are great for family or group trips <p> Travelling with other family members or a group of friends ? <p> Yonderboxes are great as you can share them with anyone via email or Facebook. - It makes it much easier to decide which- hotel will suit all members of the travelling party best . <h> Yonderboxes give great tips <p> The other cool features of the yonderboxes is you can research what other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So when searching for hotels in Bali , under my listing showcased Yonderboxes that had already featured places in Bali .

I 've seen yonderboxes in there for Best Eco Resorts , Greek island hopping , or Get naked and unwind . <p> I bet the Kimberley region in Western Australia is listed in that one as I 'm currently sweltering and contemplating the naked thing ! <p> Weve put together a yonderbox of the hotels we 've stayed in on our Australian road trip as an easy reference guide for you .

I love how Yonderbound are asking what users think . <p> Its an awesome chance to share- your ideas on how Yonderbound could be improved . <h> Here are my suggestions : <p> The ability to search hotels by features . I would have loved to have searched " health retreats in Bali " to save me time looking at each property to see if they offered that service . I know how much families would love to search for " kids club " . <p> You ca n't search directly for a particular hotel you want . <p> Searching via flexible dates , or no dates , would be great . Often you 're just poking around to find interesting places and are unsure of when you want to go . So for the dreamers the ability to search for what 's available without any dates would be a good idea . I - had trouble finding the properties I wanted for my Luxury accommodation in Australia board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel to show . A needle in a haystack kind of thing . <p> A greater range of hotel options , including hostels ! . Yonderbound is new so I 'm sure the inventory will start to grow as it does .

I guess that 's a fun adventure in itself . <p> Great idea of developing a bucket list for your return home . I especially like the idea of being a traveler in your hometown . I look forward to returning to the Midwest of the US and writing about the traveling experiences one could have there . <p> I just came upon your blog last night and its really good . I really like this post , I 've always tried to travel my home city as much as I can as well as travel the world . Thanks for sharing about your experiences !

It 's always the same . <p> Not much has changed in nine years , which is a big part of the reason we keep coming back . <p> The cousins have grown " the eldest boy from 4 to 12 , the two girls from 2 to 10 , the younger one- from 3 months old to 8 years and the littlest boy , who debuted in 2010 , is going on 4 already and- eager to keep up . <p> The Poppy has fought cancer and come out the other side , and all of us have gotten older , if not- wiser . <p> We still eat and drink too much at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we'll- moderate . It 's what we always say . <p> We get four cabins by the creek and we share drinks and meals and good times . <p> We fish and jump- off the bridge , paddle a couple of kayaks , swim , read and rest and watch the tides change , the bank- on the other side growing bigger and bigger at the low , until the creek is almost swallowed by the- sandbank . <p> We take our boats ( a couple of tinnies ) , across to the North Shore ' of the Brunswick River where- we fish , paddle a couple of kayaks , swim , read and rest and watch the tides change . <p> Cheeky scrub- turkeys and the odd water dragon keep us company . <p> We fish ( well I prefer to read ) and we seldom catch anything . We 've caught a few crabs over the- years and there 's always talk of how the fishing will be better this year , until it is n't . <p> We swim at the little sheltered beach at the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're starting to brave the open surf as well . <p> I always say I 'll fit in a few beach runs , and usually settle for a few walks .

It 's a chance to renew the soul . <p> Bumswick is the stuff of childhood memories , made and strung together over the 10,080 minutes , - give or take , shared over seven too-short days , linked to all the weeks enjoyed in the years gone by- and to all the weeks to come . <p> These are the memories that thread through life to give it meaning . <p> Holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from work and daily life , much- more than just rest and relaxation . <p> Such holidays ground and centre you , reinforcing who you are , - where you 've come from and what really matters " family , and the memories you make together . <p> Do you have a family holiday tradition ? <p> Would you like to start one ? <p> *Bumswick is what our daughter called the place when she was 2 years old because she couldn't- pronounce it properly " the name stuck . <h> Author Bio <p> Kathy Kruger is an adoptive Mum to two beautiful kids from China .

It tended to be down to the family farm in my family the farm is located outside Ballarat and the tradition including big meals and playing cricket on a pitch mown in the paddock . <p> Curiously , our family farm is now available to others to start their own traditions perhaps we seriously have to book in to get our own holidays there !

The only problem is you do n't  know how to go about it , or if you know how to set up one of those free blogs , you have no idea how to get anyone other than your loyal follower- mum- to read your posts . <p> There are many people who are happy maintaining a blog as a hobby . Then there are those who are committed to achieving- travel blog success and making money from their travel blog . You have to fund the nomad lifestyle somehow ! <p> Love working from wherever I choose + have the kids with me <p> If you 're serious about being a top travel blogger , you have to learn from the best . You can learn it all yourself through mistakes and costly lessons , but to save yourself the time , its best to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel blog , we had spent about a year studying how to set up , write and market a blog . We had other blogs we were writing , with some success , however we werent as passionate about it as we were with travel , so our success was limited . <p> I believe our quick success with our travel blog came from the months of studying we put in before we started . We had done various courses and studied from the best , and by that I mean people who are making 6 and 7 figures a year blogging . So when I came across Dave Lees Travel Blog Success course , I did n't  pay it that much attention because I had had all this previous training . I thought Daves course would be more beneficial to beginner travel bloggers . <p> As my blog continued to grow , I was ready to make money , but I noticed some holes in my training . I knew how to make money in ways that did n't  really suit the travel niche , and I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . <p> Learning is a continual process and you can always learn something new from someone . Craig and I have attended many seminars on wealth building and personal development and every time we go , we say " If we can just learn one new thing , then it will be worth it . " <p> I wanted to be sure I would get some benefit from the course and that it was n't just about the basics . I contacted Dave on twitter and asked him a couple of questions . He got back to me immediately and after a session of DMs to each other , I felt very confident that I would learn some travel blogging monetization strategies as well as become part of a supportive travel blogging community . <p> This was really attractive to me , not only could I get help from Daves course but from others who are having success with travel blogging as well . I thought the price was so reasonable for what was on offer that I really had nothing to lose . <p> I signed up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordpress plug ins that I had trouble working out how to use . <p> I dived into the course straight away and even though I knew a lot of the content , I picked up something new in each one of the 12 training segments . <p> What I really noticed going through the course , was the simplicity with the way Dave presents the information . A lot of the other training I had done was spoken in intermediate and advanced language , so for a beginner it was slow learning . Dave takes away that for you by putting it into simple language and having some easy follow up exercises to help direct you in the implementation of what you are learning . <p> Dave helped me to learn what to do when people contact me for advertising on my site . This is such a great bonus as this is something I find so nerve wracking to do . I 've also learned other money generation methods to apply to my blog . Currently , I have almost finished my first free travel ebook , and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanics of this together . <p> The absolute best part of this course , and its where you will get the most value from your money is through the community groups . I love this . Its such a great way to interact with others , share your ideas , get feedback about your site and what you are doing , and find lots of encouraging support . <p> Whenever I have a question about my blog now , whether it be technical , about content , traffic generation , marketing or monetization , I post a question in the forum and within a couple of days I have an answer , if not several , to help solve my problem . <p> Everybody has different strengths , and levels of expertise , it is so comforting to know there will be someone within the community can help you in the areas where you may be weak or just not knowledgeable enough . <p> Questions answered <p> So for me , someone who already knew quite a bit about blogging , I found Daves course very worthwhile , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliate of Daves course because I 've used it and know that it is of value and Dave is a trusted , respected teacher . <p> If you are serious about having travel blog success and making money then I suggest you rely on the knowledge .

Its really impressive how minor and " insignificant " details can bring a lot to life . Its true that home does n't  need to be a place .

I do not have any children of my own , but I know that even the small , short trips my family took me on as a child made a huge difference in my life . I see families traveling with their children now in much more " exotic " places , and it makes me smile . <p> You know I saw him first Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast for three days , and once again Kalyra is beside herself with excitement . She just glows every time we travel and I swear she loves it more than us . We have such great family times together why wouldnt we want to do it all the time . I 'm not sure why society wants to tell you its bad if you do <p> I do n't  have children of my own but I cant see how travelling with your children and exposing to them to the world can possibly be a bad thing . It broadens peoples horizons in so many ways and starting young is the best way to go in my opinion . <p> i think some people are so used to things being the way they were when they were growing up that they just expect this to be the only way . And there is nothing wrong with either way of living , its just for us the travel with our kids side of thing is how we want to do it , and it benefits us all so much <p> I think travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In French , we have a saying that says " travels helps the youth grow " , or something like that . And its so true ! I admire what you guys are doing and I am sure that your lovely kids will have such a rich knowledge and most importantly , an ever curious spirit . <p> I agree that traveling enhances kids knowledge about other people and their culture . The kids may not appreciate it now but they will realize how lucky they are to have discovered different things growing up . <p> I agree . As a kid I grew up as a showkid ( amusement rides , etc. ) , and I would n't trade it for the world , I got to see so much of Australia because of it , the only problem I have is not being able to sit still , I love to travel , pity we do n't  have the money to do it all the time My husband and I went to Viet Nam and Cambodia baack in 2008 ( belated honeymoon , 8yrs of marriage and 3 kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time was miss them and wish they were with us , we vowed to never go on holidays again without them . We went back to Viet Nam with them in 2010 and they had a ball . We are heading back to Viet Nam once again with the kids later this year , we all cant wait to go back . We love our 4 girls so much and love to spend time with them . As the old Polish proverb goes " You have a lifetime to work , but children are only young once . " . <p> What a wise proverb . I was thinking about that today as I left my girls to go work . How sucky life can be when you so often have to make decisions that go against what your heart really wants you to do . <p> Its so great to hear your perspective as a child who travelled so much and who now takes her children away on holidays . Vietnam is not an easy country to travel and I am sure your childrens eyes were opened quite a lot , which is fantastic 
@@21821035 @1821035/ <h> Dear Beijing <h> Dear Beijing , <p> I 'd like to start by saying it 's been lovely staying with you these last two weeks but I 'm afraid it 's time for us to move on . You 've been a great host and given us the perfect start to our trip . I 'd like to share with you in this , our parting letter , a few things we have noticed about you during our stay . <p> Qianimen Gate <p> Firstly , thanks for keeping us entertained for the whole two weeks , I know we said we 'd only be around for a week but plans change and you were very accommodating . Just when we thought we 'd found everything you had to offer we stumbled across something else and got to begin exploring all over again , you know how to keep us happy . <p> When we first arrived at the airport , our mission was to find the metro and navigate our way to the hostel , well what an unexpected delight that was , Two Yuan per journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing the routes , announcement 's in English and clean well signposted stations.you 've really out done yourself there . We took advantage of the metro daily so thanks for that and the buses were n't bad either. <p> Beishan Park Pagoda <p> As if you have n't made it easy enough for us already there 's also cheap food for us eat on every corner and boy did we take advantage . Every morning , we took a trip to the supermarket to fill up on various pastries costing a twentieth of what they would back home and made the most of the cheap bottled water to keep us alive in your blistering heat . For our evening <p> For our evening meal , you made it just as easy and even fun ! Night markets , just brilliant ! Fresh local food of all varieties , some of it still alive " nice touch and again so cheap . Spicy noodles , kebabs , sweet corn , spring rolls , and fried ice cream , which are actually just donuts by the way ! All there ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying something else delicious . It got even better when we found another of your markets away from the main road where the same food was even cheaper yet again . <p> Night Market Food <p> All of the things I 've mentioned seem to evolve around being as cheap as possible and I hope you do n't take that the wrong way but this budget travel thing we 're doing means that 's just the way it has to be . Besides less time sitting in fancy restaurants , means more time exploring your many interesting streets . <p> Kirsty and the Forbidden City <p> Oh and one last thing before I go , I hope you do n't mind me asking , but do you ever relax and just take it easy ? During our stay not once did we come across a time when you were quiet . Whether it was getting up at half five in the morning to visit the great wall or walking the streets in the early hours , you seem to have people just everywhere , all of the time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the way you like it , we certainly did . <p> Well that 's about it for now , Beijing , I know you 're not the type to reply , so I hope you enjoyed having us as much as we did staying with you and hopefully we 'll see each other again someday . <p> Love Poi &amp; Kirsty <p> P.S. I was going to ask if you could have a word with some of the locals about why they walk so slow all of the time but then I decided maybe that 's something for us to change about ourselves , we 're not in a rush anymore and it 's going to take some getting used to , we 're travelling . <h> More Resources for Beijing <p> Poi and Kirsty are an English couple in their early twenties , currently travelling through China before heading off to explore South East Asia . The eventual plan is to visit Australia and New Zealand but with no set itinerary , even they do n't know when this will happen . They document their adventures on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx269799 <p> Believe it or not , there are some quiet places in Beijing ! Awww , I miss China so much from all of your posts ( minus the crazy rash you had LOL ) . Enjoy the rest of your trip ! ! ! Try to make it to Tibet if you can . <p> I really like your almost " Dear John " letter here guys ! I 'm so glad you are having a blast . While were not going to find ourselves on that side of the world for a while , you should visit us in South America . = HINT HINT . You too Caz and Craig . Well make it a party . <p> Great post guys , you make Beijing a very attractive looking place to visit . All I really need to hear is good , yummy , cheap street food , and I want to go . Love the style of the " Dear Beijing " post , very original . Glad you two are enjoying yourselves so much . Ca n't wait to read more ! <p> I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Wall of China , would you agree ? The Forbidden City is really cool , except it feels like its never going to end at some points . <p> I am a Chinese who had lived in Beijing for a while . I appreciate your blog as I love the city too . We walk slowly because we do n't  feel pushed ( maybe people in CBD do rush ) . And I hope you can go visit Shanghai , too . It would be a totally different but equally fascinating adventure . Thank you for writing so nicely about Beijing ! ( I live in North Carolina now though ) 
@@21821036 @1821036/ <h> Travel the World Doing What You Love <p> I never stop being in awe of those people who have found a way to travel the world doing what they love . It is vital that in life we do what we love , and if you can combine that will travel and exploration then you have found what I consider to be Utopia . <p> Craig and I have had the dream for many years . We of course have been travelling the world , so we are halfway to Utopia , but we have been doing it by means of jobs we do n't  love and are not passionate about . We- are- working hard to put both parts of the dream together . <p> On Tuesday , Kalyra and are were able to spend some time with a couple who have found a way to travel the world doing what they love . <p> Kalyra is a little princess and is enamoured with all Disney fairy tales . Next month we are taking her to see the spectacular Disney on Ice show where she can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frozen ground . <p> Disney on Ice <p> Of course , I could not reject the opportunity to meet two of the stars of the show , Simba and Nala , Aka Brian Duckworth and Melanie Carrington for a skating lesson , a cup of coffee and a chat . <p> Brian and Melanie- Simba and Nala <p> I love ice skating . I 'm terrible at it and spend most of my time experimenting to see how I can create the biggest bruise on my butt , but I love it just the same . Due to my track record and- current condition , - I decided it would be best if I sat out of the skating and allow Kalyra to have all the fun instead . <p> Kalyra and Melanie <p> I think I enjoyed watching her skate for the first time way more than if I was out there with her . <p> Brain teaches Kalyra to stand on her own <p> I was so proud of the way she immediately jumped at the chance to go out on the ice with two strangers and attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice skating with a Disney princess <p> She loved skating with Brain and Melanie , especially when Brain twirled her around like a real princess . <p> Dreams coming true <p> After the skating , we sat and chatted more about the show and their lives as professional ice skaters . They travel for- almost 9 months of the year , visiting areas such as USA , Australia , South East Asia , Europe and South America <p> Their schedules , although demanding with training and performances , allows plenty of time for them to fit in travel experiences while they are in each new city or country . <p> Doing what you love <p> Brian and Melanie first started skating as a partnership several years ago , and from that love blossomed and turned into marriage.Their lives seem glamorous and exciting , but to them it is just something they love to do and now get to travel the world as a couple and get paid to do it . <p> Travel the world as a couple <p> It really brought home to me just how many different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trick is for you to find them . <p> So if you want to travel the world , think how you can combine this passion with a career or business that will actually pay you to do it . 69800 @qwx269800 <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 69799 @qwx269799 <p> I love finding out about people following their dreams and doing what they love . This couple is an inspiration and when travel is involved it is a added bonus . Good to see that Kalyra was n't scared of getting on the ice . Looks like she is having a ball . = <p> Inspiring ! Good point about being creative and looking for ways to combine what you love with your career . I teach ESL , and though I have n't taught overseas since 1997 , I hope to start doing some teaching abroad pretty soon . I hope it will help me see more of the world and make it at least somewhat more affordable . Your daughters love of everything princess reminds me of my sons current obsession with superheroes . He s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring the older we get do n't  we ? All this fun they have being princesses and superheroes ! I think so many people overlook the actual working part that can be incorporated into your travels . Lots of people are looking for the digital part to get them around the world , which takes a lot of time . There are so many other options . Why not find a job you enjoy and do it that way too . Do n't  discount it ! <p> Ah yes the grass is always greener .. skating and working to put a PERFECT Disney show with happy smiles and attitudes is a LOT of work too . Glad they are getting to do it and smile their way around the world . It sounds like both of you have done well living as ordinary people in regular places . You have many riches . 
@@21821037 @1821037/ <p> I 'm really starting to love Malaysian food and the Thai-worshipping food lover inside of me is beginning to worry that it has some stiff competition on its hands , especially now that I discovered a fierce rival to Thai fish cakes , which would have to be one of my all time favourite dishes . <p> Otak Otak <p> At the Malacca Straits we ordered some Otak Otak for entree . A dish I had never heard of but absolutely loved . <p> Delicious <p> It is spiced fish fillet wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in coconut milk . It is similar in texture to a Thai fish cake but has a more creamy coconut curry flavour . It was simply divine and the pick of the entire meal . <p> Mixed entree <p> We also ordered a serve of our favourite Thai entrees- spring rolls , fish cakes and curry puffs which were delicious . My first bite of the spring roll had me say " Oh these are really authentic , just as you would find on the streets of Thailand . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to Chef Tan who is the ex-chef of two other very well known Malaysian restaurants , Neptune Palace and the Malaya as well as the former Executive Chef of Malaysian airlines . <p> For mains we decided to try a new calamari dish , Sambal Sotong . We both love calamari and decided to try it in Sambal , which is a traditional Malaysian spicy sauce . <p> Spicy Sambal Sotong <p> The calamari was tender and really tasty , although it set off a small flame in our mouths . I do love the kicking cleanse that comes with spicy food , but we had trouble finishing this dish as it was a little too hot and after awhile the strong shrimp paste flavour was a little too much . <p> The vegetarian curry was filled with delicious vegetables and tofu and was so creamy , just like a curry should be . It reminded me of a thick laksa such that I have come to love . Of course , our curry was eaten with Roti , which we have really come to love and is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curry <p> Kalyra wanted her usual Mee Goreng noodle dish , which she devoured in an unusual fashion . It was filled with vegetables and prawns , which we had to fight her to get a sampling of . I love how Kalyra relishes in Asian food as there is not much else she will eat . <p> Mee Goreng <p> Our meal at Malacca came in the middle of a very busy Sydney day for us , so it felt wonderful to sit and relax for a little bit and to build up our energy reserves for the rest of the afternoon and evening . <h> About Caz 69804 @qwx269804 69805 @qwx269805 <p> I 'm not too sure . It looks a little like Pasembur , which is a salad of fried potatoes , bean curd , coconut and prawn fritter , boiled eggs and cucumber topped with a tangy peanut sauce . Could this have been it ? <p> I keep going to Malaysia &amp; going there again in December . Have been to Malacca as well . I was invited by tourism Malaysia for a food festival here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to me . <p> I 'm glad you 've finally found Malaysian food to be really good . Am very surprised to learn you love otak-otak which is quite an acquired taste even to Malaysian standard . Though I love them too .. Maybe you should try some dessert next time particularly ice kacang . <p> We love having curries ! I love the look of your pictures .. sure makes me want to try the Malaysian food the Spicey Sambal Sotong sounds so yummythe spicer meals give you such a good feeling on the inside ! <p> U sure know your Malaysian food , Caz , and u are right on Nancys photo . It is the pasembor , although that did n't  look authentic at all . The peanut sauce looked too light in color . By the way , I 'm Malaysian and i 'm really glad you love our food . You should go to Malaysia then ! You will truly be happy there . Food stalls ( basically , a Mamak shop ) &amp; restaurants are open almost around the clock . Kalyra wont have an eating problem at all
