If you want something simple to fly that you can have a lot of fun with then this is a good plane . It 's design is a little simple but still flies well in 3D or as a bush plane ! Keep in mind the plane was designed with cost in mind , it 's not perfect but if you tinker it 's a great flier . <p> PRO - Low cost , you can build the entire plane with electronics for the cost of just the air frame from TH - Flies well , would recommend for a 2nd plane if wanting to get into Aerobatics - Straight forward build if you have built EPP 3D before - Seems to follow standard format for electronics in this size <p> Cons - The EPP is n't the best quality , cost in mind it does n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too bad - Wings are n't really stiff enough , they sag a little . - People report it 's tail heavy due to placing the battery in the cabin , and the servos sitting too far back . <p> Biggest Con : - The rear of the fuse is horribly loose and the tail flaps around when flying , takes away from the experience as well . This is commonly mentioned on the RCG thread . But can be corrected with stiffening . 
@@100458873 @4658873/ <h> Additional Information 42422 @qwx902422 <p> The SBach 342 balanced out using my 3W 60 with 4 ounces of lead in the stab wing tube to hide it and I moved the batteries back into the radio tray ( was n't comfortable with the back in the tail ) . Once in the air I checked the balance by using the standard 45 degree climb and rolled inverted ; the model continued to fly straight so I knew the balance was neutral ( spot on ) . Next I took it 3 mistakes up and chopped it back to idle and started hitching in elevator . I got a little bit of the typical wing rock as it " mushed " down in a harrier attitude . Making a few knife edge passes , knife edge had no push to belly/pull to canopy , I only used rudder ! On the second flight , I tried some snaps , flat spins and stall turns . The inverted flat spin actually stopped vertical descent and held .. Then with a little right aileron , a touch little rudder and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped as soon as I let go of the controls , rolled her upright and flew out . Landings were 3-point with no bounce ( good landing gear which is unusual for an arf ) and came in at a slow landing speed with no try to drop a wing or become unresponsive . I must have completed a dozen or so take-offs/landings during the flights today since the plane flew so well . <p> I fully expected to work on the fit/finish of parts , but everything went together accurately and solidly . This design is both lightweight and well though out . With the great parts fit , the assembly was much faster than I am used to and all of the bolts/screws lined right up ( I normally have to spend a few hours getting a good fit on wing/stab tubes and other parts ) . I used an older 3W-60 with a J-Tec large volume Pitts muffler which is a bit heavier than the newer design 50 class engines so I moved the battery packs behind the wing tube to balance . There is plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs and the smoke system which I have not yet installed ( there 's still plenty of room for the smoke tank on the CG ) . Even the wheel pants mounted right up with the included bolts without any fuss ! <p> I will add to this review after flight balancing and report the handling as well . I have no doubt the SBach will fly great , especially for as light it turned out . I will be purchasing more of these kits in the near future and would love to see some models in the 100cc class .

@@100458893 @4658893/ <h> Details <p> Allows you to use any lithium battery charger that can charge 1S LiPO to charge lipos with Walkera connector . <p> Designed for use with lipos utilizing the Walkera micro connector . <p> HOW THE CABLE WORKS <p> This wire is designed to allow you to connect Walkera batteries via a JST connector to the LiPo charger of your choice . The adapter connects them in parallel , accommodating batteries of different capacities . By charging in parallel the only requirement is that all cells must be near their normal discharged state before connecting together and consequently charging . You have complete control over the charge rate , allowing you to choose a safe 1-hour charge for max battery life . <p> The adapter simply allows you to connect up to 6 batteries in parallel so that you can charge them as a single larger mA single cell battery ( i.e. 1s6p ) . The only requirement is that all the batteries be reasonably close in charge level . For example , if you either time your flights or fly till cutoff . You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharged cells , since a rapid rush of current would occur . As you plug in the batteries they will be tied together and will self balance . Then connect the JST connector to your existing charger that supports 1 cell ( 1s ) charging and set the charge mA to the sum total of the mAh rating for each cell . You can even mix 70mAh with 110mAh , 150mAh , 250mAh and so on . Since they all receive the same voltage each cell only takes the mA it needs to charge to 4.2 volts max . For example : If you have a 70mAh and three 110mAh batteries you would set your charger to 70+110+110+110= 400mA . At this current they will charge at the safe 1 hour rate . Want to do more than 6 batteries ? No problem , get a second or third adapter and connect with a parallel Y adapter and charge up to 12 , 18 or more ! You are limited only by your chargers current capabilities .

I was a little surprised to find a slight diehedral in the wing , most stick aircraft have a flat wing . No matter though , it flies and lands like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any maneuver you can think of . Would highly recommend as a second aircraft or for more experienced pilots . It makes for a great sport flying hot dogging around plane . The Stick design is about 30 years old , so it is tried and true . <p> I am sorry to say , I have now crashed the two models that I kept 14 times each , and am happy to say that they are still easy to repair and still fly well . they look the same as they did when they were new and weigh about the same . One exception is I extended the nose on one to eliminate the motor mount box . The other one went to a friend that has not even put it together yet . ( Posted on 9/4/2016 ) <p> Bought this plane a second time . Having learned more about it I immediately strengthened the landing gear area buy adding approx 3/16ths piece of wood . As usual the covering was in excellent shape . I also took the dihedral out of the wing completely . Am still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this plane . Vertical is unlimited . This plane flies like a rocket . With the dihedral removed it flies more stable to me than before . and more capable of aerobatics . The new control wires and clevis ends were much better now and work smoothly . Without the fully plastic clevis as was on my previous model I doubt that I will have any trouble as I did before with the plastic pins . It now has steel screw pins . This arf has improved the hardware and is of a higher quality than even before . I also add CA to every joint and Point that I can . In taking a little time and a few pennies you 'll end up with a quality plane that you can fly for next to nothing . It is my " go - to plane " now . ( Posted on 5/14/2016 ) <p> Like the aforementioned reviews , good ARF , went together well , pretty straight assembly , until you get to the control rods , very sticky and stiff , not sure if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try the graphite and see , might just put thinner rods but really do n't want to . I really did not like the clevis supplied , not a big fan of plastic and did not like the screw idea of attaching to the horn replaced with metal clevis . Also reinforced the tail gear where it is installed into the rudder . Overall good plane , just those minor things . ( Posted on 9/17/2015 ) <p> Maiden flight today went great . Plane flys awesome . Landing gear block should be reinforced and set up rudder with as much throw as possible ( even on low rates ) because rudder authority is weak . I used old Tower Hobbies .46 engine , SG5010 servos for ailerons , MG996 servos for rudder and elevator ( a bit overkill , I know ) . I recommend this plane as a 2nd or 3rd plane . Ca n't comment on directions because I just expected them to be garbage , so I did n't even open them up ( except to get cg ) . I used supplied hardware and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control rods for tail because tube guides create too much friction . All in all a pretty straight forward build that only took 2 nights to get it ready for flight . ( Posted on 2/21/2015 ) <p> I bought this plane based on good reviews . I am overall satisfied with my purchase . This plane is a good sport plane to train on after you have mastered a slow trainer . I mounted an OS 46 AX on my plane . It is much faster than my slow trainer . The planes covering is beautiful except some of my decals started coming off after the first couple of flights . Also the servo tray came loose after a few flights . Not enough glue was used at the factory . I used 30 epoxy inside the radio compartment and engine area to beef it up . I also place some epoxy around the landing gear mount to strengthen it . I mixed some epoxy with alcohol to fuel proof the engine firewall . I did n't like or trust the plastic clevises supplied with this kit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will also change out the wheels for larger wheels that will roll on grass easier . I think this is a great plane if you add more epoxy and change out some of the hardware . It flies great and performs very well . I would purchase another one . ( Posted on 12/5/2014 ) <p> I have now crashed each one seven times and they are still flying . These were bad crashes , with rebuilding the front of the plane and having the tail break off , and having the wing break in half . The landing gear still has a tendency to break off in a heavy landing but I have seen other much more expensive sticks ( they cost twice as much ) break off just the same way . Maybe I need to land gentler ? That 's what I bought them for , to learn how to land smoother and gentler . ( Posted on 11/29/2014 ) <p> I have three of these . Originally , the idea was they would not survive my rough landings , but I have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third is still in the box . ( Posted on 11/23/2014 ) <p> i havehad two of these planes and just love them . i made a few mods that helped , such as larger wheels and lubing the pushrods. i also epoxied and fiberglassed the fuselage at landing gear location . ( Posted on 10/19/2014 ) <p> I crashed and rebuilt two of these 4 times each , they are easy to repair . They are still flying . I replaced the bottom first 6 inches with 1/4 inch plywood . and replaced the wheels with Dubro and replaced the pushrod tubes . I can now land without knocking the wheels off . I am using a 40 size electric with 4 cell 4000 batt . ( Posted on 9/27/2014 ) <p> Having read other reviews I ordered this plane . Great Buy at a Great Price . Being honest , it is not the quality that you will find in a double the price ARF . However it is well constructed . It needs some extra glue in some places - especially around the engine mount box and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this plane superbly . I find no faults whatsoever with the plane - especially considering price . I do recommend beefing up the landing gear . I made a perfect landing on the maiden flight but the landing gear broke loose . The balsa was just not heavy enough nor glued properly . I 've mounted an EVO 10cc gas motor and added extra weight in the tail section . Total flying weight of plane with field scale came to 5.8 lbs . It flew very nice at half throttle with this motor and a lot to spare . I am thoroughly satisfied but as I said the strength of the fuselage needs to be beefed up somewhat . After having rebuilt the landing gear I look forward to having a lot of fun with this plane - it loops , rools , figure eights etc with ease using the 10cc motor . Remember this was only maiden flight . Nice plane at less than half price . GO FOR IT ! As far as pushrods - mine were stiff too but I placed a little graphite oil on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rods did have strength . ( Posted on 4/18/2014 ) <p> Opened the box and was surpised by the build quaility of this product . The construction is first class , the covering is flawless - everything went together with no surpises . It took the best part of 1 day to built the model and install the servos , glue the wings , install the motor etc . Even the motor thrust angle is built into the frame . The only problem I had is that the pushrods were really stiff and binding - I decided to replace them with - much better . I also replaced the small wheels with larger ones as I fly off a grass field . <p> No problem with the first flight - it takes a while to get used to it after moving from a high wing trainer , so the plane is much more responsive and easy to perform aerobatics. 100% satisfied Gerry ( Posted on 12/2/2013 ) <p> This was by far the best 75.00 I 've spent on a RC plane ever ! The only reason I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes . mine seemed to bind just a little and I replaced them with a Dubro pushrod system . but it might just be me also ... I 'm picky ... but the covering on this thing was beautiful &amp; flawless ! went together easy and instructions were pretty good ? I put a OS 40LA on it because I got a good deal on it , thinking it might not be enough power ? No , it wo n't burn holes in the sky ! but does pretty good ! a 46LA would be plenty ! the maiden flight blew me away ! a couple of clicks of trim and this baby flew like it was on rails ! tracks perfect and super easy to takeoff &amp; land . and I love it 's a tail dragger ! not a trike gear fan , and the GP version of this plane is ... do n't pay twice as much for the GP stick when you can get this one for 75.00 !

It is capable of producing up to 22oz of thrust and generate about 140W of power . Does not include prop adapter , collet prop adapter required to mount the prop . Bullet connector not installed .

Even though my Beaver is grossly over weight ( do n't know the exact weight ) it had plenty of power to hover with no problem with a 3s 8x4.3 setup . The only downside is that this motor is about 10 grams heavier than the recommended motor . ( Posted on 6/25/2016 ) <p> I have quite a few of these , some I use as purchased , but most I rewind to my specs . I notice that some complain about bent shafts .. I have yet to bend one . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prop adapter on the long shaft gives it too much leverage . Shaft should be cut just long enough for the prop adapter . Use only as much shaft as required .. whether using a prop adapter or prop saver . Another mod I do is I drill two extra holes for grub screws and tap them to 6-32 . Sometimes I re-tap the existing grub screw holes to 6-32 also . It 's much easier for me to find 6-32 tap and drill sets and 6-32 set screws than metric . Boxes of 50 set screws for less than $6 . I still use Loctite on the screws . Of course , if you already have a metric tap and drill set to match exiting holes then just drill and tap two extra holes . Another benefit is that not as much force is required on the grub screws and reduces the possibility of distorting the bearing tube .

( Posted on 9/21/2016 ) <p> I have built a lot of planes and that is what helped me get through this build . It was shipped with two motor mounts . I ordered the 5055 motor and the instructions said to use the larger motor mount with the larger motor option . The mounting went well but the cowl was nearly an inch too long so the prop could not be mounted . I ended up mounting the smaller motor mount to the front of the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clevises for the push rods were too small . 3 of 4 of them would not thread onto the pushrods . I ended up using pin connectors on both ends of the pushrods . The covering was very well done and had very few bubbles in it . The color scheme is very attractive and very functional as the plane can be seen extremely well in the air . This plane is rock solid in the air . I have flown it now with both a 6s and an 8s battery . It flies well with the 6s and is incredible with the 8s though it is a little nose heavy . I have over 20 airplanes and this one may well be one of my favorites . I would recommend it to anyone with intermediate skills . It is not , in my opinion , a trainer . Good job on this one , Value Hobby . Work on the instructions , please . ( Posted on 6/15/2016 ) <p> This is a follow-up to my previous review after putting on substantial flight time . This is really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rails . The tail surfaces are large enough to do 3-D stunts requiring those controls , however the airlerons do not have enough surface area for 3-D manuvers that utilize ailerons . While vertical pattern climbs with the specified setup seem pretty well unlimited , I think a little larger motor &amp; prop will be required for a true 3-D type vertical hover . I use a 4000 4s battery and after about 7 minutes flight and find the battery at 15%-20% after landing . I do not think I would use a smaller battery . Currently this is my favorite plane to fly and I will likely buy another one if this one should this one should ever meet its demise and it is still available . I love it ! ( Posted on 1/31/2014 ) <p> I set the plane up electric as per Value Hobby 's recommendations ( except I use a ESC w/out a BEC , so I have a separate radio battery ) , which turns out to be a very good combination . Plane is straight forward to construct , but the instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ( elevator ) . The tail wheel is not pre-bent and the instructions leave a lot to the imagination , but not beyond what the average builder can handle . I had to use the Dremel tool on the electric motor mount and body edge as well as do some triming to make the cowl fit correctly . The covering was very smooth with no bubbles , which actually created a problem for me as I normally go over a whole ARF with a Monokote iron to get out wrinkles and make sure the coverin is well secured . Because there were no wrinkles , I forgot to go over it with the iron and did not notice that part of the covering was loose . This created a major vibration in flight and some control issues . I brought it down and still did not find anything wrong ( without the wind of flight , the covering went back tight ) . On the second flight I could tell right after liftoff that the vibration persisted , which affected the lift on the left wing , so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell out of the sky . Fortunately , it was fairly close to the ground , I was able to flair it and was caught by a cotton plant . There was some damage , but I was able to pretty well repair it in one weekend . Examining it after the crash found the covering problem . I can not say I put the model through its paces because they were abbreviated due to the vibration problem , but I can say what little flying I did indicated that it will be a nice flying model and I look forward to getting it back in the air , sans the vibration problem next weekend . There were lots of positive comments from my fellow club members about the general looks of the model and the trim scheme . This is a great plane for the price , just inspect it carefully before putting it in the air . ( Posted on 10/21/2013 ) <p> Lots of little issues , but nothing that ca n't be overcome by a person with a moderate amount of experience . First the positives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . The colors are nice , the scheme is attractive , and the covering was smooth and unblemished . It looks like it is fairly well constructed . I checked all the joints I could see and it looked like it was assembled pretty good . <p> The negatives : The instructions are poor . Section 4 seems to omit how to mount the elevator on the horizontal stab . The two elevators are supposed to have a pre-drilled hole for connecting rod . Mine did n't have holes in either elevator . The tail wheel in the kit is different then the one shown in the instructions , plus the rod is not pre-bent for installation into the balsa of the rudder . The connecting rod clevis ( how do you say multiple clevises ? clevi ? ) did n't seen to have the pins to close them . I threw them away and went with Sullivan 's . I received two nylon wing bolts , but two different sizes . Both supposed to be a 5mx20 , but one seems to be a 4mX20 . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little bit of the plywood had to be ground away by my Dremel to make sure the cowl fits nicely . The wheel pants are kinda dodgy too , but they work . <p> I mounted the recommended GForce G32 motor , Towerpro MG996R metal gear servos , and a 70A ESC from another vendor . So far , no batteries soof course I have n't flown it yet . <p> Overall , very good value for the money , but it definitely is n't a shake and bake kit that goes together without a problem . VH ( that 's not Van Halen ) needs to take a few hours and improve/clarify the instructions . I recommend , but with some reservations . ( Posted on 6/17/2013 )
