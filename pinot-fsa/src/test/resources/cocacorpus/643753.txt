The very best of them mourn the loss of a tiny fraction " the U.S. fraction " of the wars ' victims . <p> But if you search this and other U.S. cities , you 'll have a harder time finding memorials for North American genocide or slavery or the people slaughtered in the Philippines or Laos or Cambodia or Vietnam or Iraq . You wo n't find a lot of monuments around here to the Bonus Army or the Poor People 's Campaign .

Where is the great blowback memorial mourning the governments overthrown and the arming and training of fanatical killers ? <p> While many nations erect memorials to what they do not wish to repeat as well as to what they wish to emulate , the United States focuses overwhelmingly on wars and overwhelmingly on glorifying them . And the very existence of Veterans For Peace jams that narrative and forces some people to think . <p> Well over 99.9% of our history is not memorialized in marble . And when we ask that it be , we 're generally laughed at . Yet if you propose to remove a monument to a Confederate general in a southern U.S. city , do you know what the most common response is ? They accuse you of being against history , of wishing to erase the past . This comes out of an understanding of the past as consisting entirely of wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Confederate war monuments , which had been erected to advance white supremacy .

Almost as hard as finding such a law would be finding any peace monuments around here to consider taking down . I do n't count the building of our friends nearby here at the U.S. Institute of Peace , which if defunded this year will have lived out its entire existence without ever having opposed a U.S. war . <p> But why should n't we have peace monuments ?

In a sane society , the war memorials would be one small example of many types of public memorials , and where they existed they would mourn , not glorify , and mourn all victims , not a small fraction deemed worthy of our sorrow . <p> The Swords to Plowshares Memorial Bell Tower is an example of what we should be doing as a society .

@@82789490 @4289490/ <p> Ah , outsourcing , what would businesses do without it and how would things evolve without the existence of an outsourcing component ?

In this article , we are presenting the top advantages and disadvantages of global outsourcing so that you might get a better idea of how it can help your business . <h> How does it help you be aware of your entire network of operations ? <h> The matter of expertise <p> When it comes to expertise , not having it versus gaining it through global outsourcing is a no brainer .

This does n't just ensure that the task is completed in good time but also that the final product will be one of good quality since it has been outsourced to an organization that specializes in that field . <h> Focusing on the core tasks <p> Often times a company will have to deal with core problems that have a critical impact but also with smaller side-issues which need to be dealt with on a smaller scale . - Just because they are n't main projects does n't mean that side projects do n't deserve the same amount of detail and supervision being put into them . <p> The latter category can be outsourced for maximum productivity . Not only does this allow companies to focus on the core aspects of a project but also ensures that the proper time and dedication is put into the side elements as well . <h> Reduced costs <p> When a company lacks the necessary personnel or equipment to deal with a situation , it can get pretty expensive to change that .

This is obviously not something a company would want to happen , but the benefits of outsourcing often times make businesses not fully acknowledge the dangers of exposing important data . <p> That 's why it 's important to use computing solutions that allow you to keep a very tight record of every bit of data existent on file . However , it can get pretty expensive to invest in such a service especially if you run a big business that incorporates many units . <p> That notwithstanding , you could take advantage of coupon codes from companies that monitor local PCs , remote PCs , and networks such as SpyTech Web . This will help you to enjoy a trustworthy and efficient data monitoring solution while staying within your budget . <h> Hidden expenses <p> We previously said that outsourcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the disadvantages of this solution is that there might be hidden costs involved within the process of signing a contract .

When outsourcing , the company to which you are doing so might also have other clients at the moment . This means that they must split their focus between all handled projects and thus they might take some of their focus off of your tasks . <h> Discussion <p> Its unfortunate that global outsourcing still has its disadvantages . However , its hard to deny that it is far more inexpensive than in-house work . That 's what reels in companies into sourcing out jobs . <p> Countries such as India or the Philippines are known for their cheap rates .

@@82789506 @4289506/ <p> Since October of 2015 , the U.S legislation surrounding daily fantasy sports ( DFS ) has started to tighten . While the establishment of UIGEA ( Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ) in 2006 originally exempted daily fantasy sports from the category of illegal gambling ' , considering DFS a skill-based game and thereby making it completely legal to practice nationally . However , due to the restrictions of state laws , individual states retained the right to determine themselves whether DFS , and indeed all fantasy sports , is a game of skill or a game of chance , just like other sports betting . Towards the end of 2015 , several states started to make the shift towards declaring DFS a game of chance , and therefore rendering it illegal practice according to UIGEA in that particular state . <p> Since then , throughout 2016 , there 's been somewhat of a domino effect . As it currently stands , nine states in total have declared DFS a chance-based game , the nine states being : Arizona , Nevada , Hawaii , Washington , Idaho , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been of significant impact on fantasy sports operators like Draftkings and FanDuel , which will be merging their two separate companies by the end of 2017 .

Draftkings and FanDuel , together with the Fantasy Sports Trade Association , are currently locked in legal contestations with several states in order to fix the situation . Their intense lobbying might very well work , because what these states seem to be overlooking is that DFS gaming can be a significant contributor to the state 's annual income . <p> According to a report , over 57.4 million Americans and Canadians were playing DFS and traditional fantasy sports in 2015 alone . 20% of the U.S population took part in it in some way : 18% of those were adults , and 32% were teens .

@@82789537 @4289537/ <p> Eight games into the 2016-2017 UVA basketball season , and no , we still do n't have a sense of what this Cavs team is going to be . <p> It 's not going to be the recent vintage with a balance of scoring from the perimeter and the post . The dismissal of Austin Nichols , who was set to replace the production lost with the graduation of Anthony Gill , guarantees that . <p> But that 's not the only story . Each of the past three years , coach Tony Bennett has had to account for the loss of a perimeter leader to the NBA " Joe Harris in 2014 , Justin Anderson in 2015 and Malcolm Brogdon in 2016 . <p> Anderson stepped up after the loss of Harris to vault from being the team 's sixth man to being an NBA first-round pick . Brogdon , similarly , went from being a secondary option to being one of the best players in the country in the wake of the loss of Anderson . <p> One constant throughout that process has been point guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who , logically , would be the guy to step up to replace the productivity lost to Brogdon 's move to the NBA . <p> Except that Perrantes is n't a scorer like Harris , Anderson or Brogdon . Sure , he can score , but Perrantes is at his most effective as an old-school pass-first , shoot-when-I-have-to point guard , despite the talk around the program the past couple of years about Bennett wanting Perrantes to be a little more selfish . <p> Which means that it 's going to have to be somebody else to step up alongside Perrantes in the backcourt . <p> Who that ends up being , well , your guess is still as good as mine . Only Perrantes is averaging in double digits in scoring right " at 10.0 points per game . Darius Thompson ( 9.8 points per game ) and Marial Shayok ( 9.3 points per game ) are probably the best-equipped to increase their productivity . Shayok ( 45.5% FG , 1-of-11 on threes ) shows glimpses of his potential as an elite scorer , but he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeds . <p> Thompson still seems to be getting his feet under him in terms of his confidence , but from what you see " 52.8% shooting from the field , 47.8 percent from three-point range " you definitely want to see more , and it 's confounding that you do n't . <p> Kyle Guy , a heralded freshman who was Indiana 's Mr. Basketball and a McDonald 's All-American , is averaging 7.8 points per game , but notably is only getting 15.4 minutes per game off the bench . By far , Guy seems like he 's going to be a special player , though he 's primarily a shooter , not necessarily a scorer , but you have to imagine that his relative lack of playing time is directly proportional to where he is in picking up his assignments on defense . <p> You have to guess the same about sophomore Jared Reuter ( 6.1 points per game in 15.8 minutes per game , shooting 60% from the field ) and freshman Mamadi Diakite ( 5.4 points per game in 15.0 minutes per game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem most capable of being able to score in the paint , back to the basket , and Diakite has shown range to be able to pick-and-pop . But right now , their apparent limitations on defense have them watching the offensively-challenged Isaiah Wilkins ( 6.8 points per game in 25.1 minutes per game , 59.5% shooting from the field ) and Jack Salt ( 4.9 points per game in 19.9 minutes per game , shooting 58.6 percent from the field ) get the bulk of the minutes at the four and five . <p> There 's no reason for UVA fans to hit the panic button . As much as we fondly remember the contributions of Gill , for example , we conveniently forget that he was basically a non-factor in his first season on Grounds , as a sophomore transfer from South Carolina , well into February , as he struggled to figure out his place in the Pack Line . <p> Down the stretch in 2014 , Gill became a force in the post on both ends , and a UVA team that could n't put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VCU and Wisconsin went on to win the ACC regular-season championship and brought home the first ACC Tournament title for the school in 38 years . <p> Brogdon , we also remember for his exploits , forgetting that he was a 6.7-points-per-game scorer as a freshman . And that Anderson kid playing in Dallas now , scored 7.6 points a game as a freshman and 7.8 a game as a sophomore , and 12.2 as a junior , before heading off to the pros . <p> Guys get better in-season with Bennett and his staff , and they get better season to season . <p> They 'll get this figured out . Honestly , the coaches will look a lot smarter , and the fans will be a lot happier , when Thompson and Shayok grow more confident in their roles as go-to scorers in the backcourt , and when Reuter and Diakite get more confident in what they 're expected to do on defense , and thus can put more attention to what they can contribute on the offensive end . <p> Perrantes , who seems to be struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key their game plans on him , in the absence of other guys stepping up on a consistent basis , will be more efficient when what seems right now is the weight of the world is off his shoulders , and he can be the point guard that he wants to be again . <p> We knew going into this season that this Virginia team was going to endure some growing pains , with the losses of Brogdon , Gill and Mike Tobey , with new guys like Guy and Ty Jerome getting integrated into the rotation , and returnees like Shayok , Thompson and Devon Hall being expected to do some different things . <p> I 've been saying since the spring that this UVA team would lose a game or two in November and December that you would n't expect them to , but by mid-January , it would start to live up to the preseason expectations . <p> Losing to West Virginia is nothing to get upset about . There are still two toughies on the schedule this month " at Cal and at Louisville . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to dismiss individual game results , but the ones that matter , as we all well know , are the ones in March .

Uncertain why Bennett , in UVAs first top 25 face-off used Jerome and Hall down the stretch . Shayok who seems to be the only Cavalier that can create offense for himself off the dribble might have been a better choice . Also , one piece you left out has been Bennetts occasional use of the 4 guard offense .

@@82789550 @4289550/ <p> The Virginia General Assembly will celebrate its 400th anniversary in a couple of years making it the longest-running representative legislative body in this hemisphere . Although not much has changed in the basic procedures of lawmaking with committees and structured floor debate , over the centuries there have been adaptations to the times as the legislature has sought to best serve those it represents . Most recently the biggest changes have been to the housing of the legislative functions . <p> For those interested in details , here is a summary of the major changespast and present . The General Assembly in 2004 abandoned Mr. Jeffersons Capitol for the first time since the Civil War to give the place a major renovation that would keep it standing and expand its size underground so as to not take away from its iconic exterior . For that renovation , the legislature moved to the former state library whose upstairs had been renovated to be the Governors Office but whose reading rooms downstairs had been left intact and became very efficiently the House of Delegates and Senate chambers for several sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly Building ( GAB ) have been crumbling asbestos explaining the white dust that periodically appeared on the furniture . Legislating should not be considered hazardous duty , at least in a physical sense , nor should failing plumbing and heating and cooling systems cause delays in the work of the legislature . For decades , the Life Insurance Company of Virginia had occupied the building before it moved to an office park in the suburbs and sold its aging building to the Commonwealth . The building is currently being demolished , and a new office building will be constructed in its place with a parking garage across the street . That will be good news for those who want to participate in the legislative process but have been prevented from doing so because they simply could not find a place to park . <p> The last act of legislators this past session was to pack ourselves up for a move down Richmonds Capitol Hill to the Pocahontas Building , formerly in private hands as the State Planters Bank of Commerce and Trust Building , where we will have temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new building will be constructed . The Pocahontas Building was available to us as the Attorney General and his staff who had offices there have recently relocated to the Barbara Johns Building , formerly the Hotel Richmond and later state offices , just across the street from where the new General Assembly Building will be . <p> Regardless of whether you chose to follow all that , the good news is that when you come to Richmond you will be much more likely to find a convenient place to park , and you will be in a safer setting . <p> With our physical surroundings taken care of , now we need to go to work on bringing the legislative process up to date by making it more transparent and responsive . Maybe a significant anniversary and a change in working environment should be viewed as a time to start anew . <h> Web Design 171140 @qwx791140 171137 @qwx791137 171139 @qwx791139 <h> Marketing 171138 @qwx791138

@@82789582 @4289582/ <p> The plight of many small business owners is figuring out how they are going to expand their marketing effort without impacting the bottom line too heavily . Larger companies tend to throw money at a problem to see if it fixes it permanently or even temporarily . This simply is not an option for a smaller company as a few failed expensive marketing campaign can spell bankruptcy prematurely for the business . There are plenty of platforms that will allow a smaller company to compete with the larger corporations without money being the deciding factor of who comes out on top . The following are tips to market your small business in a cost efficient manner . <h> Social Media <p> The best thing about marketing on social media is that you can do it for free . Setting up tweets for an entire month also takes just an hour or two of writing per month . The most important thing that a smaller company can do on social media is to engage their current and potential customers . Review sites are also a huge deal as people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the quality of product or service is up to par . Responding to complaints as well as compliments on these sites as well as social media can be used to market as well as take care of customer service issues . <h> Outside of the Box Marketing Approaches <p> The smaller companies sometimes have to use different marketing approaches to compete . The best example of this is a smaller brewing company trying to become a household name . A great strategy would be to have some branded products given away with certain cases of beer . Custom branding ideas could be a wooden coaster that has the brewery name on it as it is reusable and is a good conversation piece . There could be customers that buy the beer just for the coaster but keep coming back because of the quality beer that is produced . Making sure the product is high quality is a huge part of marketing as marketing subpar products spells disaster for a brand . <h> Content Marketing <p> Content marketing can be done via the blog on the business ' website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a great way to become a thought leader in an industry if you create some engaging and interesting content . Content marketing is also a great way to help with your search engine rankings . These can make or break a small business as being on the 3rd or even the 2nd page of a local search leaves them in the dust . Most people do not go past the first few results as they think Google has ranked them by quality when in fact the companies at the top of the search can thank the marketing team instead of those providing the service or product . <h> Track Every Variable <p> One huge mistake that small and large companies make is to account for all variables when tracking return on investment for the marketing budget . If these variables are n't tracked then the exact ROI can not be found and the marketing strategy for the coming quarters will not be as efficient as possible . This is why changing only a few things at once is the best strategy as you can track what works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not always take an enormous budget to see a return on your marketing budget .

Neat , huh ? <p> Today 's focus is on- PROSCIUTTO <p> As far back as 100 BC , Romans were drying pork legs in salt to create the delicacy known as prosciutto . Not familiar with this form of pork ? Well , if you enjoy bacon then I 'm willing to bet you will absolutely fall in love with prosciutto . <p> Prosciutto is dry-cured ham that comes from Italy . The ham used to make prosciutto is specially selected , based on the right amount of marbling and the right amount of surface fat . <p> It takes anywhere from nine months to a couple of years to produce the perfect prosciutto .

What can Ralph Northam or Tom Perriello actually achieve in the next four years ? <p> For the answer to that , look at what Terry McAuliffe has been able to accomplish as his four-year term wraps up . <p> Yeah , nothing . <p> OK , so McAuliffe diehards " I 'm sure they exist " will point to his successes in pushing economic development projects . As the editor of a Virginia-centric news website , I get press releases practically every day touting projects bringing jobs and investment to the Commonwealth . <p> Which is of course great news , but I 've been the editor of this news website for 15 years , and I 've been getting these type press releases from governor 's offices touting jobs and investment dating back , oh , about 15 years . <p> So while McAuliffe would love you to remember him as the economy governor , what he really tried to hang his hat on was being the governor who was able to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 400,000 Virginians without healthcare insurance . <p> Why he failed is why it really does n't matter much whether Ralph Northam or Tom Perriello gets the Democratic Party nomination to run for governor in November . <p> Republicans hold a slim 21-19 majority in the State Senate that ca n't be overcome until the next round of Senate elections in 2019 . I agree that it 's odd that we do n't stagger the terms to have half the seats up every two years , but that 's part of the quirkiness of our system here in Virginia , and not nearly as quirky as electing a new lame-duck governor every four years . <p> The House of Delegates is a different matter entirely . In a state with two Democrats in the United States Senate , Democrats holding the three statewide offices , and Democrats as winners at the presidential level in each of the past three cycles , we have a near veto-proof majority for Republicans in our lower legislative chamber " a 66-34 advantage for the GOP . <p> You can decry the fairness of gerrymandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is property of the Republican Party of Virginia , and will be for the foreseeable future . <p> Best case scenario for Northam or Perriello , then , is that they get a majority in the Senate in the 2019 elections , and have a small amount of leverage on the House in their final two years . <p> But as we saw with McAuliffe , who had what was effectively a majority in the Senate in his first year and a half , with a 20-20 tie in the Senate and Northam as lieutenant governor able to break ties in the Dems ' favor , he still was n't able to get done what he wanted to get done . <p> Democrats , at best , dating back to Mark Warner 's term from 2002-2006 , have been reduced to playing defense on public policy . <p> And for this , Republicans deserve credit .

@@82789752 @4289752/ <p> A poll out last week from the Wason Center at Christopher Newport University has Gov .

Bob McDonnell on his ethics convictions was fair , support an increase in the minimum wage , want governors to be able to run for a second term , and want delegates and state senators to have term limits .

@@82789754 @4289754/ <p> UVA coach Tony Bennett and players talk with reporters after the Cavs loss to Notre Dame in the 2017 ACC Tournament . <p> COACH BENNETT : First , credit to Notre Dame . We were outplayed today . We were behind in the play . They really were moving the ball well . They 're hard to guard . They played well , and we did n't  have one of our better games . We have to learn from it but pick up and move on and just were a bit lethargic . <p> Again , when a team can move the ball as quick as Notre Dame moves the ball and we were a step behind , they got a lot of easy looks , and they looked fresh , and we werent as fresh physically or as fresh mentally as we 've been in the past against them for sure . <p> Q. Coach Bennett , what do you guys need to do to prepare yourselves for the Tournament now that that 's what you 're looking towards ? COACH BENNETT : You learn from this . We talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of time now . We recover . We rest . But we prepare as well as we can in practice and tighten up . We werent as sound as we 've been in the past . A formula for our success has been we 've taken care of the ball , and we 've shot it pretty well . <p> Notre Dame guarded us hard . They were ready . You could see it . They were very looking forward to playing us . <p> Weve got to find ways to guard a little better when we get in that situation , handle those four-guard lineups , and just keep battling . There 's not a whole lot we do n't  throw it inside and score a ton , but we 've got to just keep doing what we 've done and have a great however many days prep it is for the NCAA Tournament . <p> Q. Tony , how is Isaiah feeling right now ? 14 minutes tonight , obviously , he was a big part of your game last time against Colson and things like that . Will this break help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with a bad virus or whatever this is . Maybe a blessing in disguise if he can get some more rest and recover . He is a big part of our energy and helping defensively , and he was n't right in terms they 're hard to guard . <p> When its Beachem , its a hard matchup for Isaiah . And Colson . They put pressure on you . They 're playing Colson as the five . And they 've got good quickness and skill offensively . So if your defense is n't really locked in , its a problem , and they exploited that tonight . <p> Q. Coach , Kyle obviously had a tough night tonight after the good night last night . How much were they kind of keying on him , do you think , after what he did yesterday ? COACH BENNETT : Well , obviously he played well yesterday , and I 'm sure they were contesting shots . As a first-year guy , he s got to learn from that . That wasnt one of his stronger games , and there 's going to be some ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good tonight . <p> Q. Tony , I think you used ten players in the first ten minutes . Could you tell right away that something was n't right tonight ? COACH BENNETT : Well , they just I think , again , Notre Dame , they were hard I felt like we were behind the play . Again , there 's matchup issues with them because of Colson at the five , and we had to use Nzei in limited minutes . We werent knocking down our shots , missing easy ones and then werent knocking them down . <p> So , yeah , we were scrambling a little bit . Its a hard matchup who you 're going to play at the four . So , yeah , I was searching for sure . <p> Q. Tony , you guys are so good defensively from your chair , what Mike is able to do offensively , how impressive is it in terms of schemes and how he uses guys ? COACH BENNETT : He really spreads the floor , and he plays four guards and a really skilled five man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double-double guy . So their ball movement was terrific tonight . The pace on their cuts was good , and they had us behind the play . When were at our best defensively , were there , and were anticipating . <p> So , yeah , they put a lot of pressure . We 've had a lot of good success against them . We 've bothered shots and protected the lane , but we had trouble protecting the dribble off the bounce , and when they started getting in that way , again , were playing catch-up . <p> Q. London , your shooting was n't what it has been . How much of it was Notre Dame , and how much of it was fatigue or anything else ? LONDON PERRANTES : Obviously , Notre Dame played some good defense tonight . But , yeah , missed some chippies , some layups . I had a couple of open threes that I missed . I do n't  know , I cant really tell you what its from . <p> Obviously , Notre Dame played good defense , and I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed some open jump shots as well . <p> Q. Coach , you mentioned you guys have been playing well defensively , especially throughout the year . What do you guys need to do offensively to take that next step , especially against teams that play faster like Notre Dame ? COACH BENNETT : Well , we 've got to play better defense . Ill start with that . But , no , we 've got to take care of the ball . We had a couple of live ball turnovers that led to some easy buckets and even some out-of-bounds defense that got some easy buckets . <p> But its the ability to all I want these guys is to get quality shots and take them . If were making them , great . If were not , were going to shoot the outside shot when its there . Well occasionally look inside . Got to try to touch the paint and make plays . Probably , when we take care of the ball and are low with our turnovers and moving hard and taking quality shots , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screening well , getting London the shots and helping him set people up . <p> I think its not going to change for us . Its just doing it a little bit better and taking care of the ball . I think that 's a huge thing for us . <p> Q. London , you mentioned yesterday about your defense being so successful against them in the past . What do you think was the kind of change today that they were able to get some shots into you guys ? LONDON PERRANTES : I do n't  think our ball screen defense was good at all . Matt Farrell was able to throw the ball out of our I guess we tried to trap a ball screen when it happens , and we did n't  do that at all today , which allowed open shots and allowed us to be behind the play , which is tough . So , yeah , I mean , that was a huge part of it . <p> Q. Question for Tony . I do n't  know , its probably a difficult comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the tournament , the NCAA Tournament . I 'm curious , can you compare just how the teams are competitively speaking last year to this year , and in terms of just going forward , what that might mean . COACH BENNETT : The depth of this league is so much better . In terms of parity in college basketball , its matchups and who 's playing hot basketball in the NCAA Tournament . There were some really good teams last year that had a chance to go all the way . This year , I think there 's a balance in college basketball , so its deeper . I do n't  know how many teams well get . Obviously , we want to get as many as we can . <p> Were a different team than last year . Matchups will be important for us . Carolina is playing . I think its comparable and maybe a little more depth . <p> Q. London , after the North Carolina game , you talked about the connection between your guys offense and defense and how , when you 're a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that . Was that what you guys were feeling at all tonight ? Was there any tightness ? LONDON PERRANTES : I think it kind of just started with our defense . We gave up some easy looks at the beginning of the game . Obviously , were not going to make every shot , but I think giving up some easy looks kind of takes the air out of house , and knowing that were not supposed to or we should n't be giving up easy looks kind of messes with our head , I guess you could say , especially with some of the young guys . Obviously , Kyle and even me had a little slump today shooting the ball-wise . <p> Yeah , it all starts with our defense , and we werent right from the jump , and that kind of dug us a hole . <p> Q. Devon , I believe Virginia beat Notre Dame ten straight times . Did you see anything different in Notre Dame today ? DEVON HALL : Yeah , I think they just came out with a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Coach said . We werent as good as we usually are at our ball screen . So it was a little frustrating for us . And they just came out with a lot more pace and effort than we did . <p> Q. Coach , it did look like Marial got it going a bit today . Did he look more confident or anything ? COACH BENNETT : Yeah , Marial , he can create a shot off the bounce . He got us some buckets when we were there . He s been had a little bit of a knee issue or a quadricep issue . He looked like he was moving better , and he gave us a lift . We cut it to six at the half , had some chances , then in the second half it separated again . I was happy to see some of his offensive prowess come back . <h> Web Design 171140 @qwx791140 171137 @qwx791137 171139 @qwx791139 <h> Marketing 171138 @qwx791138

When outsourcing , the company to which you are doing so might also have other clients at the moment . This means that they must split their focus between all handled projects and thus they might take some of their focus off of your tasks . <h> Discussion <p> Its unfortunate that global outsourcing still has its disadvantages .

On the other hand , a direct lender will stick to what you have applied for and therefore save you from unnecessary offers . <p> Direct lenders also seem to be more serious with security and privacy policies . On the other side , you may never know the reputation of networks working with indirect lenders . <h> Always review the terms before signing the loan documents <p> Although you may be in a hurry to get the money , it is your responsibility to understand what you are signing up for . Most people who get in trouble with short term loans rushed the application process and later they get surprise charges . <p> Responsible borrowing becomes automatic when you act from knowledge rather than impulse . To make sure that the loan suits you , keenly look at all the aspects of the loan and make sure you are comfortable with each of them . <h> Choose a payment schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be friendly it must blend with your current financial situation . There 's no need to have a loan that demands unbearable changes in your lifestyle . The more comfortable a payment schedule is , the more the benefits you are likely to enjoy . And with different types of short term loans , you can decide how long you want to pay the loan as well as the amount for every billing cycle . <p> As a rule of thumb , choose a schedule that also allows you to pay the loan before it 's due at no cost . This way , you 'll only be paying interest for the time you had the loan . <p> If your payment method is through a bank , ensure there 's enough money in the account by the time the loan is due . At all costs avoid the charges that apply due to insufficient funds because they are usually accompanied by overdraft fees . <h> Make sure you have a payback plan <p> The high-interest rates that come with short-term loans can be overwhelming when you are out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss payments . Having a clear plan will keep you within the safe zone and the loan can be cleared very quickly . While you may not have the money to pay the loan now , there 's definitely an anticipated source of income that can be a payday , asset sale or an upcoming job . Whatever the plan is , it must be solid and sufficient to settle the debt . If you are not sure of the plan , you ought to refrain from taking the loan until the plan is solid otherwise the situation can get more desperate . <h> Communicate with the lender and ask for help when stuck <p> After you have taken the realistic loans , you can be faced with difficulties that affect the ability to honor payments . Most reputable lenders will work with you to adjust the payment schedule but they ca n't act if you do n't ask . <p> Whenever you suspect that an upcoming payment can be missed , communicate with the lender early enough and ask for an extension . Most lenders are quick to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your situation . <h> Conclusion <p> Short term loans should not be feared or avoided especially when its the only available option . Instead , striving to understand the key aspects of a loan can go a long way in making good decisions . Also , they must be used to solve short-term financial issues . When used as a long-term source of funding , they become more expensive than you can be willing to pay . <p> To make sure you are happy and content with these loans , take a moment to learn more about the lender as well as the offer . <h> Web Design 171140 @qwx791140 171137 @qwx791137 171139 @qwx791139 <h> Marketing 171138 @qwx791138
