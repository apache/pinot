When surveyed as to which previously-discussed authors works the group would like to revisit , Agatha Christie came up as the top vote-getter . We discussed the Mr. Parker Pyne stories in June 2008 , but the group has never officially read and discussed either a Miss Marple or a Hercule Poirot novel , so it seems long overdue to tackle one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desserts members are encouraged to read ANY of the 33 novels , 1 play or more than 50 short stories that feature Christies famed Belgian sleuth , whose legendary " little grey cells " brought numerous killers and thieves to justice . Feel free to grab one of the best-known novels , such as Murder on the Orient Express , or Death on the Nile , or either the first or last Poirot tales , The Mysterious Affair at Styles and Curtain . Or pick one of his lesser-known adventures . Poirot has been portrayed on film and television ( and radio ) literally hundreds of times , by numerous actors , from John Moffat and Albert Finney , to Peter Ustinov and Tony Randall and Orson Welles , but is perhaps best known from the performance of David Suchet , who only recently finished adapting every single Poirot novel for PBS Mystery . <p> For group discussion , well let everyone speak up to identify the particular novel , play or short story collection they read , and what they thought of it . <p> The Great Books Reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to everyone interested in talking about some of the classics of the written word .

@@28425093 @2125093/ <p> The names of Charles Raymond Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate hold a place in the history books as Nebraskas most notorious mass murderers . Their saga began when 19-year-old Starkweather killed a gas station attendant in December 1957 . Then , in late January 1958 , Charlie and his 14-year-old girlfriend Caril began an eight-day murder spree that started with the murder of Carils family , and eventually led to ten total deaths before they were captured on the highway outside Douglas , Wyoming . Tried and convicted of murder , Charles Starkweather was executed at the Nebraska State Penitentiary on June 25 , 1959 . Also convicted , Caril Fugates initial life sentence was commuted to a 30 to 50 year sentence in 1973 . In 1976 , after serving 18 years , Fugate was paroled and she eventually resettled in Michigan . <p> The Starkweather case , seemingly tame in comparison to serial killings that have followed it in subsequent years , was one of the most heavily publicized mass murders in U.S. history , drawing national attention both to Nebraska and to the psychological issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the rest of Nebraska , lived in a near-constant state of hysteria and panic for several days . The events inspired a fictionalized 1973 feature film Terrence Malicks Badlands ( starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek ) and a 1993 television mini-series Murder in the Heartland ( starring Tim Roth and Fairuza Balk ) . Even a hit song , " Nebraska " , released by Bruce Springsteen in 1982 , was based on the events of 1958 . In 2004 , Liza Ward , the granddaughter of Starkweather victims C. Lauer and Clara Ward , published the bestselling novel Outside Valentine , which incorporated the Starkweather spree into a fictional storyline . <p> Over the years , the Lincoln City Libraries has proven to be a prominent research site for individuals wishing to learn more about the Starkweather case .

Wodehouse wrote numerous novels and shorter works , but is probably best known as the creator of Bertie Wooster and his faithful manservant Jeeves . Wodehouses works were satirical , yet gentle , pokes at the established societal order in Great Britain . His light , frothy plots farcical in nature are always meticulously worked out , and the witty bon mots of his characters belies a savvy intelligence , in particular on the part of Jeeves . While " class differences " may be a popular subject for fiction writers , there are few who handle the topic with the refreshing mixture of humor and absurdity that Wodehouse applied to the topic .

Nao is no angel , but neither should a young person know such isolation , or regard suicide as a reasonable response . <p> - Ruth becomes more and more pulled in as she slowly reads Naos story . Even though she realizes that years have passed since Nao wrote the diary , she feels an urgent need to communicate to someone that Nao may be a danger to herself . Ruth had developed writers block while working on a memoir , and Naos story seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her artist husband have chosen , on an island with barely 50 other people and crazy weather , contrasts vividly with Naos life in Tokyo . <p> - Contrasts propel both the action and the ideas . The contrast between Ruth and Nao . The contrasts between Naos previous happy life in California , her sad life in Tokyo , her great-grandmothers life as a nun and her late uncles life as a kamikaze . The contrast between the tiny population of Ruths island with the number of times people drop in on her . The contrast between what people initially think of each other , and what they later learn . The contrasts between ideas of time , mortality , love , cruelty , and suffering . <p> - Ozeki successfully creates a whole of these parts . Nao introduces big ideas despite her youth and apparent failure at school . Ruth and her husband reasonably discuss and build on those ideas as they work their way through the diary . Ozeki creates an energetic young persons voice as effectively as she describes the married life of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bullying and isolation intensified the entire novel . While I sensed the action beginning to fizzle as I neared the conclusion , that 's more a quibble than a problem . <p> - I recommend this generally to people who enjoy literary fiction . I certainly recommend it to book groups . The novel struck me as an extended conversation between people whod never met each other , and I sense that there 's plenty here for readers to keep that conversation going . <h> " The Faraway Nearby " by Rebecca Solnit <p> - " The Faraway Nearby " begins with apricots , picked from Solnits mothers tree . The three boxes of apricots were too many to manage , her mother too far gone with Alzheimers to know . Solnits preservation of the fruit via jams , liqueurs , and other devices contributes one of the first metaphors in this rich book . <p> - I was intrigued by the title , " The Faraway Nearby . " Here is what she says about that , " After years in New York- City , Georgia OKeeffe moved to rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people she loved , from the faraway nearby . ' " ( p. 108 ) <p> - Solnit employs thirteen chapters , the first six leading to the seventh , " knot . " The remaining six mirror the first , going backwards to apricots once again , ending where she began . Within this firm structure , she rambles amid her mothers story , her own cancer scare , and an artistic escape to Iceland . How she works in Che Guevara , arctic explorers , Scheherazade , Frankenstein , Buddhists , and others , is a wonder . And yet it feels like excellent conversation over coffee , how she goes from one story to another , linked by ideas . Throughout , she reflects on how we tell our stories . She considers how we work over the material in our past to create a promising future . <p> - I found particular resonance in this excerpt , as she describes how her friends took her in hand through a serious health scare . " People gathered from all directions , and I was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished that life was always like this , that I was always being showered with flowers and assistance and solicitousness , but you only get it when you need it . If you 're lucky , you get it when you need it . To know that it was there when I needed it changed everything a little in the long run . " ( p. 122 ) This perfectly describes my own experience when my husband died , and she 's right . It has changed everything a little . <p> - At first , I was put off by MY wanting the action to move forward more quickly . I wont recommend this to readers who want to march through a plot . It was worth slowing down to savor the extras that she brings to her story of herself . I do indeed recommend this to those who enjoy a lusciously long conversation through unexpected imagery and reflection , as if the coffee pot would never run dry . <h> " Too Bright to Hear Too Loud to See " by Juliann Garey <p> - Briefly , its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case bipolar disorder , eventually climbing back toward a glimmer of hope for his recovery . <p> - Greyson Todd narrates all twelve sections , each correlating to an electroshock treatment in a psychiatric ward . He includes flashbacks to his adulthood and childhood , revealing the lingering impact of his fathers mental illness . <p> - Todd has achieved high success as a studio executive in California when he decides to leave his wife and daughter . It has become more and more difficult to hide the manifestations of his illness . He has ample money , so he travels to various countries , living all kinds of adventures before that money runs out . <p> - I 've been reading most of the books on the Notable Books lists for over 20 years , and my bar is now set very high . This one barely measures up . I cant point to particular faults with it , I simply did n't  feel the pull of strong narrative or compelling characters . <p> - Even so , it is a potent book group book . Where Garey excels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior and the progress of his illness . In doing so , she asks important questions . What does it mean to hit rock bottom ? How do we respond to someone who 's mentally i 'll , especially when he is violent ? How do families re-build ? Can mental illness be cured without love ? How does trust ever happen ? <h> " The Woman Upstairs " <p> Its narrator is Nora Eldridge , a third grade teacher in Cambridge , Massachusetts . She introduces this novel , " How angry am I ? You do n't  want to know . Nobody wants to know about that . " Nora intended to be an artist . But that has been set aside . At 42 , she is a popular teacher , a dutiful daughter , and a dependable friend . She is " the woman upstairs .

It did n't  happen as I expected , and perhaps that is why this is a strong book . It seems entirely realisticthis earthshaking interior change in Nora , instead of propelling her into a life of art , kindles fury instead .

@@28425167 @2125167/ <p> The winner of the 2015 Pulitzer Price for fiction , it follows two young people through World War II . Doerr tells the stories of a blind French girl named Marie Laure , and a brilliant young German solider , Werner Pfennig , at first separately , but then draws them close together in an artillery-racked city . Neither child has an easy life . Maure Laure , whose mother is dead , loses her sight when she is six . Werner , growing up in a German orphanage , seems destined for the life of a miner . <p> And yet , each is gifted . Maurie Laures loving father teachers her to become independent and walk around Paris on her own ; his job as locksmith at the Museum of Natural History provides the perfect home for her remarkable intellectual curiosity . <p> Werner figures out how to repair and build radios .

The war takes one thing after another from them , until they encounter each other just once , in the heavily bombed French coastal town of St. Malo . Doerr draws a compelling background of Europe in the midst of World War II , but the novel really shines in the characters he creates . <p> A Library Journal reviewer said , " The novel presents two characters so interesting and sympathetic that readers will keep turning the pages hoping for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but entirely reasonable , are the loose ends Doerr leaves . The nature of war is that some peoples fates will never be known . The novel ends in our own time with the people who remain , carrying on even with those holes in their hearts . <p> I usually reflect on whether each title on the Notable Books List deserves to be called " notable . " This book more than earns the label , beginning with many fascinating parts , and shaping them into something both heartbreaking and beautiful , and whole . <h> " Year Zero " By Ian Buruma <p> I 'm just now getting caught up on reviewing several books I recently finished . I had taken plenty of time reading " Year Zero : A History of 1945 " by Ian Buruma , from the nonfiction part of the Notable Books list . I began it in May or so , read about three quarters of it , and set it aside until a few weekends ago , when I determined to finish it . <p> Its a sweeping look at the year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people began making organization out of the chaos of the war . Buruma addresses various topics in three general sections , describing the situation in Europe , in Asia , and in other parts of the world impacted by the war . Some chapters are primarily how individuals adjustedhow hunger , exultation , and revenge played out . Later chapters address institutions and cultures , such as how the allied countries went about re-educating the German and Japanese people . A theme that recurs is the complexity of relationshipsfew people , groups , or countries were entirely " clean " in motive and behavior . This is what will stick with me from " Year Zero . " <p> Buruma introduces the book with the story of his Dutch father , who was kidnapped as a college student to work in a factory in Berlin . When the war ended , he nearly died of starvation , but eventually made it home . His story led Buruma to ponder all of the stories , all of the adjustments , all of the things that had to be set right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Burumas approach , interesting . Its drawback is that his basic idea , to explore this chaotic time in regard to several aspects , and spanning continents , keeps him from developing a strong narrative thread . The view is awfully wide , and not especially deep . Certainly he explores interesting themes , but without the strong storytelling structure that would create a more compelling book . <p> Even so " Year Zero " addresses an era of interest to many readers . I expect that for those who are quite familiar with the time period , Burumas rich information and perspective will add much to their own already-developed sense of the wars story . <h> " Hitlers Furies " by Wendy Lower <p> I 'd just recently finished the novel , " HHhH " by Laurent Binet , also set in the Eastern European areas taken over by the Nazi government . With that still in mind , I learned a good deal from " Hitlers Furies " and found it readable despite its serous subject matter . <p> Wendy Lower is a professor of history at Claremont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial Museum . Here she digs more deeply into the general understanding the the Final Solution depended on the participation or cooperation of the general German population . Half of that population was female , and yet the role of women has been seldom explored . <p> In " Hitlers Furies " she tells the stories of particular women who fall into the categories of witnesses , accomplices , or perpetrators . Typically , these women were teachers , nurses , camp guards or wives of German officials . Many of them had moved to the countries to the east , where Germany was clearing space for the German people to live . <p> Lower begins with a chapter called " The Lost Generation of German Women " to set the context for the behavior she describes . This was keylooking back on this time we wonder how it ever could have happened . Lower tries to put the reader in the period before the Nazis rose to power , before Germany was defeated , when the Nazis seemed to offer the redemption of the country . <p> The narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes how the existing prejudice was drilled and shaped into a pattern of brutal behavior . Also not be to ignored is the contrasting societal expectation that all women should be natural nurturers who would unite in their opposition to this behavior . Lower probes the intersection of these forces . <p> Lower writes as an academic . Shes careful to use reliable sources , and careful as well to draw limited conclusions . While she sometimes describes unbelievably violent behavior , she does so in exploration of understanding , not for sensation . <p> I 'll recommend this to readers interested in this era , or in the role of women , or those seeking a sense for how a country can create such an effective and horrific organization of death . <h> What a Notable " Unbroken " by Laura Hillenbrand <p> Finally , I 've read " Unbroken " by Laura Hillenbrand . I 've heard so many people comment on this nonficiton story of Louis Zamperini , a runner on the US Olympic team who became a World War II hero by surviving for weeks on a life raft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And it was good , one of the titles on this years American Library Association Notable Books list . <p> Laura Hillenbrand ( who has an interesting story of her own ) follows up her stellar " Seabiscuit " with this compelling story . She tells it straightforwardly and chronologically . Hillenbrand has that gift for telling the story in a way that is clearly shaped and considered , for example , in how people are introduced and then brought back into the story , and yet her style gets out of the way of the story . <p> What I 'll remember from this book is both the evil behavior of many of the Japanese captors , and the survival of the prisoners . How DO people maintain their dignity and selfhood in the face of so many attempts to break them ? In Zamperinis case , he was made a target of beatings and cruelty because of his fame . Yet he survived . I knew that the sections set in the POW camps would be horrifying , but I found myself especially touched by Zamperinis return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet he was falling apart , drinking himself nearly to death , before he turned himself around at a Billy Graham event . <p> I noticed how Hillenbrand goes out of her way not to judge the behavior the men who were stranded , or were prisoners . She works hard to set a context where every rule and every expectation are turned upside down , where people survive by doing things they never thought they could do . She also makes a point of developing characters , not allowing all Japanese or all American people to be presented a certain way . <p> I finished this book on Independence Day . It seemed an especially fitting day to reflect on the people who have been called the " greatest generation . " I 'll recommend this to a lot of peoplefiction readers will appreciate the strong story , history fans will find sound information , and people who enjoy " extreme " stories of survival certainly will find much to value . I think that many people have avoided reading this because they shy away from the depictions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still encourage people to read this with open eyes and mind .

@@28425186 @2125186/ <p> Once we get past the irony of Jerry Lees " own story " being told by someone else , the choice of author makes perfect sense . Bragg clearly knows how to portray the South , in this case , Ferriday , Louisiana , where Lewis grew up during the Great Depression . That time and that place propelled Lewis to rock and roll superstardom in the 1950s . Nearly everything that happened to Lewis , or that he set in motion , connects back to Ferriday . His bigamous marriage to his young cousin , his reliance on drugs and alcohol , and his attraction to risky behavior of all sorts , they all began in Ferriday . And central to it all is the image of a performer with boundless energy , a man who whipped crowds into a frenzy with a piano playing style entirely his own . <p> Bragg interviewed Lewis extensively for this book , using many of Lewiss own words to craft the story .

The two stories combine well , with both men getting their start at Sun Studios in Memphis , both leading complicated personal and professional lives . Both Bragg and Hilburn respect the depth of Lewis and Cash , going to great lengths to do justice to their complex lives . <p> I found " Jerry Lee Lewis : His Own Story " immensely readable , potentially an excellent nonfiction choice for books groups who usually read fiction .

@@28425195 @2125195/ <p> Lee Childs novels featuring Jack Reacher have touched a popular chord in the reading audience Reacher is something of a knight erranta quiet , thoughtful , highly moralistic man , whose background in the military has left him somewhat jaded , but unwilling to turn a blind eye to injustice . He sticks up for the " little guy " , no matter what the odds are . The Reacher of the novels is a tall , large , big-boned man ( unlike the shorter , lean and tight character as portrayed by the much smaller Tom Cruise in the 2012 movie Jack Reacher based on One Shot , which was the 9th book in the series ) . <p> The books are filled with often brutal violence , although that violence always has consequences , to both victims and perpetrators . Reacher almost resembles a modern day version of the nameless Western hero who would ride into town , fight off the corrupt men threatening the townsfolk , perhaps hook up briefly with the plucky heroine , and then would disappear quietly in the night . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak of " white knight " appeals to you , you might wish to sample some of the authors , series or individual stand-alone novels listed below.The author names ( and titles ) in the list below are hotlinked to their holdings in our catalog , so that you may check on the availability of their titles in print , audio or downloadable formats .

@@28425198 @2125198/ <h> Tag Archives : Firefly <h> " Swamplandia " from the Notables List <p> I finished " Swamplandia " by Karen Russell a couple of weeks ago . It makes me a little nervous to blog about a book that is n't entirely fresh in my mind . <p> Readers may recall that " Swamplandia ! " was part of the drama of the Pultizer Prize for fiction this year . It was one of the three finalists for the prize , but the committee decided that none of the finalists was worthy of the prize itself . <p> I picked it up because its on this years American Library Association Notable Books List , and I continue to read my way through that list , having taken a brief detour through the One Book One Lincoln finalists . <p> In short , its a contemporary story set on an island just off of Florida , about a girl whose left to fend for herself when her family and the family business fall apart . Its a fairly quirky story , with some hilarious parts , and some remarkably sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quirky met evil in this book . <p> " Swamplandia ! " is told by Ava Bigtree , a thirteen-year-old whose mother was a feature performer at the Bigtree business called Swamplandia ! in the nightly finale , she would dive into a pool full of alligators . But her mother dies , Swamplandia loses its audience to an inland theme park , her brother and father go inland on their own pursuits , and Ava takes a dangerous partner in her quest to find her sister . <p> When this book works , its because the characters are so distinctive , and yet they yearn for the usual thingslove , security , and identity . <p> I sense that this is one of those books that most readers either love or hate . I land somewhere in between . I enjoyed reading this , but finished it primarily to check it off of my list . It was toward the end when Ava is looking for her sister that I finally felt a stronger pull . <p> I 'm reflecting on my typical response to novels that are usually described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read like a series of humorous images and characters without the glue of dramatic tension or intriguing relationships . I think that this accounts for my initial lack of connection to " Swamplandia ! " - Even so , I 'll recommend this to readers of literary fiction who enjoy stories of unusual families or situations . <h> " A Death in Belmont " by Sebastian Junger <p> A couple of weeks ago I drove by myself to and from Denver for a short library conference . Along with Diet Coke , pretzel M&amp;Ms , and Twizzlers , I kept myself company with an audiobook on CD , Sebastian Jungers " A Death in Belmont " originally published in 2006 . <p> Every few years I crave a true-crime book , and this one about the Boston Strangler came right out of that Dewey number , 364.152 . <p> Junger is known as a nonfiction writer . He picked up this topic because his own family had a connection to the Boston Strangler . When Junger was a little boy in 1963 , his parents had a studio built in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that job was Albert DiSalvo , who was convicted of the murders attributed to the Boston Strangler . The day before the studio was finished , a photograph was taken of the Jungers and the men who worked on the job . Junger reflects on that snapshot showing his mother holding him on her lap , with Albert DiSalvo standing behind them . <p> Junger clearly places himself in this story , but he does a great job of backing up to describe the context , what Boston was like and how the murders impacted people . <p> He explores a murder done in Belmont at the time that Albert DiSalvo was working on the Junger project just a mile away . A black man named Roy Smith was convicted of that murder , proclaiming his innocence until his death behind bars . In many ways this murder was a typical Boston Strangler job , in others , not . But both Smith and DiSalvo die before full light can be shed on Smiths case . Junger leads one to believe that Smith was very probably wrongly convicted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , without seeming to exploit the victims or the situation . He introduces a wide variety of people at a perfect pace , setting up a sort of chess board of characters . Kevin Conway , the narrator , maintains an even tone in his reading that reflected Junger well . <p> I loved " A Death in Belmont " for a traveling companion . I 've noticed that the books that I most enjoy in audio are those with a strong narrative thread . Junger maintains this well . I was sorry when the book came to an end just before I reached Ogallala . I felt like I 'd learned some interesting history , had reflected on the role of race in the early 1960s , and been told a fascinating tale by a fine storyteller . <p> And then I had to wait awhile because there were ( and are ! ) quite a few holds on it . <p> Cains title tells it allshe supports and values the combination of traits that characterize introversionneeding solitude for recharge , preferring one-on-one conversations over cocktail parties , focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active environments to be overstimulating . <p> She includes research , cultural aspects , advice for romantic pairs and advice for parents. - Cain herself is n't a researcher , but has interviewed many who are , and she has done plenty of homework in seeking out a variety of opinions . <p> An introvert myself , I connected with many of her observations . In particular , I saw myself in her description of the need to gear up for certain kinds of social events , almost as if going into battle . On the other hand , I have n't sensed the scorn or disapproval of the extroverts in my life as much as she seems to have , and sometimes I felt like she " protested too much . " A personal noteI do clearly recall my college boyfriend kindly pointing out that my quietness at parties could be interpreted as my being stuck-up . And he did say so kindly . And I still remember thatit stuck with me . I would guess that quite a few introverts have received similar observations . <p> I 'll recommend this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which personality can be profiled , so that we understand ourselves better , and get along with others better . I 'm finding myself having extended animated conversations with others whove read thisand so far , her audience seems mostlyintroverts . <h> " Inside Scientology " from the Notables List <p> Reitman is a journalist/writer who was inspired to write this nonfiction book after she began writing a feature article on Scientology for the " Rolling Stone " in the summer of 2005 . Her interest had been piqued by the actor Tom Cruise , a prominent Scientologist who often speaks out regarding Scientology . <p> Local readers may recall that Scientologys founder , L Ron Hubbard , was born in Tilden , Nebraska , in 1911 . <p> Reitman describes the evolution of Hubbards concept of " Dianetics " to the church of Scientology that exists today . I hesitate to attempt a brief description of the framework of Scientology . Foundational ideas include a belief that people are immortal souls who come back to the earth over and over . A practice known as auditing leads people to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential . Scientology holds strong positions against much psychiatry and the prescription drugs it uses ; they consider their own processes as much more successful . As people progress through auditing into upper levels of the church , they typically pay more and more money to move forward . Reitman sees money as central to the story . <p> Reitman seems less interested in the belief system behind Scientology , and more interested in the structure of the church , the personalities who run it , and how it raises money . <p> The view that she presents is primarily from outsideScientologys leaders did not speak with her . She relies heavily on former Scientologists , those who have left the religion , to get inside views of the structure of the church . She describes people who left the church having been treated shabbily or worse , detailing in particular the death of Lisa McPherson in 1995 . <p> She gives an overall picture of a " church " in quotes , which she implies is actually a business that uses the cover of religion to shelter money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first Hubbard , and now David Miscavage , shape the church in sometimes bizarre ways . She presents Miscavage as a sheltered young man who came to lead the church in his 20s , ill prepared for the job . She details many ways in which his direction seems irrational . <p> Yet she concludes with optimistically-toned interviews with young people currently engaged in Scientology . <p> I expect that the Notable Books committee chose this title because it brings forward information on an important topic of interest to many readers . I would point out that Reitman sometimes employs language that seems biased , describing Hubbard as a huckster , and using terms such as " concoction " that carry laden meanings . I would have preferred more measured reporting . <p> Even so , I 'll recommend this to readers who prefer nonfiction and who like to read about current events and issues . I was struck by the parallel stories of a belief system on one hand , and the personalities behind it on the other . That is where much of the energy in this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here are the basicsMira Bartok and her sister ended up changing their names and moving to cities away from Cleveland to separate themselves from their mother , who was seriously mentally i 'll . Bartok became an artist and writer . After a serious car accident and traumatic brain injury as an adult , she decided to take a few steps toward reconnection with her mother who by then was homeless as well . <p> This book stands out from the others because Bartok includes excerpts from letters that her mother wrote , and she includes pictures of her own art . These deepen her story . Her telling is n't chronological , but it does make sense somehow , as she describes the reconciliation , and then backs up to tell what came before . <p> Bartok employs the image of the memory palace partly because she had to reconstruct her own ability to remember . She suffered a traumatic brain injury in 1999 at age 40 , and lost much of her short term memory . She describes the memory palace as a way of remembering by creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something one wishes to remember , an apt description of her writing here . <p> As I look back on the reading and reflect on what images I will keep of this book , I will recall Bartoks description of when she first saw her mother behaving oddly in a way that was seriously wrong , and her immediate understanding that it was something to hide . The saddest to me was that Bartok seemed to show great talent at the piano ; her mother had been a prodigy . But the disorganization of the entire household kept Bartok from continuing with lessons just as she was progressing to serious music . <p> Bartok struggles with guilt and shame . Yet there is also a sense in which she and her sister keep their eye on the light at the end of a tunnel , knowing that their only hope is that light . Nothing here is easy , but much of it is richly focused on life and hope . <p> I confess that as I read this , I often silently thanked my parents for being so by-the-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three square meals each and every day , and insisting on a sense of order . I chafed at that , but " The Memory Palace " reminded me that there 's nothing lovely about the kind of mental chaos that puts children in true danger . I 'll recommend this to readers who love memoirs , who seek stories of resilient children , and who want to know more about families without bedtimes.

@@28425200 @2125200/ <h> Tag Archives : Firefly <h> " The Snow Child " by Eowyn Ivey <p> I 'm happily in the midst of my " open season " for reading , now that I 've finished up with the 2013 American Library Association Notable Books List . <p> - I 've been using Pulitzer Prize lists , both winners and nominees , for my recent reading choices . This is how I happened upon " The Snow Child " by first-time novelist Eowyn Ivey . <p> - Set in Alaska in the 1920s , its the story of a married couple trying their hand at clearing land and farming . In their 50s , they 're hoping for a new start , away from their New England families , and away from whispers and pity about their childlessness . <p> - For the most part , the book is about Mabel , who fears that the move to Alaska has been a big mistake , that it simply reinforces the chill in the distance that has developed between her and her husband , Jack . Then a remarkable thing happensa girl appears at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong ? How does she survive in the brutal Alaskan landscape ? Is she real ? <p> - The novel parallels the folk tale of the snow child , in ways that on the one hand seem exciting and hopeful , and on the other , strange and heartbreaking . The symbolism of the girl , and ice , and animals , creates a strong psychological undercurrent . Yet , Ivey crafts this story in ways that become compelling . <p> - This is a great choice for book groupsI was dying to discuss it with someoneand thank my friend Shari for meeting me for coffee to talk it over , and for pointing out some aspects of style that provide intriguing clues . <p> - I 'm recommending this to a wide variety of fiction readersits fascinating combination of marriage story , adventure , and magic , holds broad appeal . As we enter winter , this is a perfect choice for a cold-but-cozy evening . <h> Its Notable " The Round House " by Louise Erdrich <p> - One sentence summaryAn adult Ojibwe man looks back on his youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother . <p> - One sentence evaluationThis is classic Erdrich , excellent writing and even better character development , all wrapped up in contemporary Ojibwe culturea great book group book . <p> - I find something especially compelling in novels about how crime impacts people . I recently finished another Notable , " Canada " by Richard Ford , with a similar construction of a man looking back on how crimes committed by his parents pulled his family apart . <p> - In " The Round House , " Joe tells the story of events that happened in 1988 , his mother not coming home as expected , and then finally arriving home with awful injuries . Watching his parents floundering in response to the attack , he relies on his strong ties with friends and extended family . LIttle by little he comes to understand what happened to his mother ; his fathers role as a tribal judge pulls in further information , and interesting aspects of tribal law . When Joe puts in place his response , its in the full context of all of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Erdrichs fans , and because it has few of the fantastic elements of some of her other books , I think it might work for people who have n't taken to some of her previous work . I think itd also be of interest as an outlier for people who read traditional mystery seriesa different slant on a crime novel , with an ending that is n't formula , but is expected in the best storytelling sense of tightening and sharpening the telling toward a dangerously pointed end . <h> " The Sense of an Ending " by Julian Barnes , another Notable <p> I 'm slightly sheepish in saying that I was happy about " The Sense of an Ending " by Julian Barnes because its just 163 pages . As I work my way through this years Notable Books list , a shorty is a relief . <p> Barnes is a British writer , and here presents a British story . Its told by a middle-aged man , Tony Webster , who looks back on his boarding school friendships and early love life . <p> Tony describes how his school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adrian , who is especially smart and who sees the world a little differently than the others . When Adrian takes up with Veronica , a girl who Tony dated , Tony writes them an ugly letter.Tony heads off for an adventure in America , Adrian commits suicide . Eventually Tony marries Margaret , they raise a daughter , and then divorce . Tony feels himself going along and getting along . Then Veronicas mother dies , and leaves something to Tony , and this brings back the past . It also brings Veronica back into his life . <p> Tony wonders what his role was in Adrians suicide , in the unhappiness that led to his death . HAD he done something terribly wrong as a youth ? Was he responsible forsomething ? <p> I confess that when I got to the end of this book and to the revelation regarding this mystery , I had to re-read the ending , and I wished that I had the gumption to re-read the whole book . I went to amazon.com to read what people had written about the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution seemed confusing and underwhelming , given the lead-up . <p> And that may be what is genius about this bookhow remarkably realistic for Tony to look back from the distance of many years , and end up not quite sure . <p> And is that what makes Peter Barnes a genius writer ? That he can get us inside of this mans head , for good and for i 'll , and engage us in these reflections ? Barnes is known for elegant writing , directing the readers attention to the correct place , using just the right word , and yet also shining a glaring light on peoples weakness . I 'll recommend this to my reading friends who are good with a literary novel , good with what is not expected , and good with Barnes particular " sense of an ending . " <h> What a Notable " Unbroken " by Laura Hillenbrand <p> Finally , I 've read " Unbroken " by Laura Hillenbrand . I 've heard so many people comment on this nonficiton story of Louis Zamperini , a runner on the US Olympic team who became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life raft , and months in Japanese Prisoner of War camps . <p> And it was good , one of the titles on this years American Library Association Notable Books list . <p> Laura Hillenbrand ( who has an interesting story of her own ) follows up her stellar " Seabiscuit " with this compelling story . She tells it straightforwardly and chronologically . Hillenbrand has that gift for telling the story in a way that is clearly shaped and considered , for example , in how people are introduced and then brought back into the story , and yet her style gets out of the way of the story . <p> What I 'll remember from this book is both the evil behavior of many of the Japanese captors , and the survival of the prisoners . How DO people maintain their dignity and selfhood in the face of so many attempts to break them ? In Zamperinis case , he was made a target of beatings and cruelty because of his fame . Yet he survived . I knew that the sections set in the POW camps would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zamperinis return to home . He was beloved , a hero , and yet he was falling apart , drinking himself nearly to death , before he turned himself around at a Billy Graham event . <p> I noticed how Hillenbrand goes out of her way not to judge the behavior the men who were stranded , or were prisoners . She works hard to set a context where every rule and every expectation are turned upside down , where people survive by doing things they never thought they could do . She also makes a point of developing characters , not allowing all Japanese or all American people to be presented a certain way . <p> I finished this book on Independence Day . It seemed an especially fitting day to reflect on the people who have been called the " greatest generation . " I 'll recommend this to a lot of peoplefiction readers will appreciate the strong story , history fans will find sound information , and people who enjoy " extreme " stories of survival certainly will find much to value . I think that many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depictions of the camps , and I understand that . And yet I 'd still encourage people to read this with open eyes and mind . The books subtitle , " A World War II Story of Survival , Resilience , and Redemption " reflects Hillenbrands success in showing that even out of this horror , goodness survived . <h> " The Sisters Brothers , " from the Notables List <p> Last week , I finished " The Sisters Brothers " by Patrick DeWitt , a novel from the American Library Association Notable Books List . <p> Charles and Eli Sisters are hired guns from the Gold Rush era of the 1850s . Eli tells this story of their final job for a man called The Commodore . As the story progresses , Eli makes up his mind to leave the killing business . <p> I 'm trying to find a way to describe the tone of this bookits picaresque , in introducing a series of odd somewhat shallow characters . Its often droll . And it is full of killing . I had to move my mind into a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eli clearly has a bigger heart than his brother . Eli reflects on how he might want to find a woman to marry and love , might want to return to see their mother . Charles seems not to reflect much at all , he thrives on heavy drinking and the adrenaline of taking a good shot . <p> Why is this notable ? DeWitt creates clever scenes and dialogue , and he gives us a whole new sense of the Gold Rush . There 's an inherent irony in a hired killer pining for love and a comfortable home . The stark heartlessness of lives lived solely in pursuit of gold remains visible behind the humor . Hired killers see many people face their final moments , DeWitt makes the most of that opportunity . <p> My reservation is thisI do n't  think that DeWitts idea for the Sisters Brothers story creates enough momentum to propel a whole novel . Itd be a brilliant short story , and perhaps overall more effective as a short story collection . I 'm open to the idea that this may simply be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finished " The Sisters Brothers , " it never deeply resonated with me and seldom had me laughing out loud . And yet , there 's something about it that I respect . I expect that I 'll recommend this to people who seek something that is unusual , edgy and clever , and that points up peoples foibles while it reveals their behavior under pressure .

@@28425231 @2125231/ <h> Tag Archives : Firefly <h> Jhumpa Lahiris " The Lowland " <p> I made the mistake of allowing some time to pass since I finished " The Lowland " by Jhumpa Lahiri . I much prefer writing immediately after finishing a book . <p> I chose this book because I so enjoyed Lahiris lovely writing in " Unaccustomed Earth " several years ago when it was part of the 2009 American Library Association Notable Books list . That collection of short stories captured so well how people want to do the right thing , want to love each other well , and so often fall short . Yet hope remains . Lahiri has mastered the art of revealing big issues through small observations . <p> What I recall from " The Lowland " is that same yearning , and the authors continued kindness in drawing attention to good intentions and honest personal assessment , even when the reader can clearly see that behavior falls short . <p> This is the story of two brothers , Subhash and Udayan , born in Calcutta just before Indian independence . Subhash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulsive . Born barely a year apart , they seem separate parts of one personality . Subhash ends up pursuing an academic career in the United States . Udayan remains in India , living with his parents , engaging in dangerous politics , and marrying for love . Udayans untimely death ( in the lowlands behind their house ) shapes the novel , both in the time leading up to it , and in the subsequent passage of time for Subhash , Udayans widow , and others who follow . The background of Indian culture and the period following independence provide a distinct backdrop for the general themes of sibling bonds , family ties , finding ones way in a new country , forgiveness , and the balance of individual dreams with social responsibilities . <p> I recommend this heartily to fiction readers , with an especially strong nod toward book groups . <h> " Life After Life " by Kate Atkinson <p> Recently two or three friends whose opinions I trust recommended " Life After Life " by Kate Atkinson . Its been a popular book group selection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in the first half of the twentieth century in England and Germany . For me , its the third book I 've read in a very short time span that addresses the Nazi era . <p> In the books opening scene , Ursula Todd enters a bar and shoots Adolf Hitler . In the second , she is born and dies immediately . In the third , she is born and lives . As Ursulas story moves along , she is reincarnated several times and is able to avert tragedies that happened in previous lives . She always feels somewhat apart from others , experiencing fierce deja vu and vivid premonitions . <p> In Kate Atkinsons capable hands , this works . Much of the story centers on Ursulas family and a small circle of friends . Her relationship to them seems not to evolve significantly with each new life . A second aspect of the novel involves Ursula and World War II , when she experiences some lives in London before and during the Blitz , others in Germany in Hitlers social circles . <p> An omniscient narrator tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " darkness fell . " The distance of the narrator contrasts with the intensity of Ursulas unique experience . <p> Although I absolutely believe that this novel works well , I 've been slightly reluctant to recommend it to others , partly because the whole reincarnation idea seems too fantasy-like , too made-up . Perhaps I 'm not willing enough to follow a novelist down the path of " What if the world were different in THIS way . " <p> Even so , I see this as an excellent book group choice . It covers so many basesfamily relationships , the World War II era , the role of women , and the meaning of mortality . " Life After Life " invites readers to reconsider a basic idea of how our world works , and then to ponder how countless ways of thinking , feeling , and behaving , rest on that one idea . <h> " Hitlers Furies " by Wendy Lower <p> I 'd just recently finished the novel , " HHhH " by Laurent Binet , also set in the Eastern European areas taken over by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned a good deal from " Hitlers Furies " and found it readable despite its serous subject matter . <p> Wendy Lower is a professor of history at Claremont McKenna College , and a consultant for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum . Here she digs more deeply into the general understanding the the Final Solution depended on the participation or cooperation of the general German population . Half of that population was female , and yet the role of women has been seldom explored . <p> In " Hitlers Furies " she tells the stories of particular women who fall into the categories of witnesses , accomplices , or perpetrators . Typically , these women were teachers , nurses , camp guards or wives of German officials . Many of them had moved to the countries to the east , where Germany was clearing space for the German people to live . <p> Lower begins with a chapter called " The Lost Generation of German Women " to set the context for the behavior she describes . This was keylooking back on this time we wonder how it ever could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period before the Nazis rose to power , before Germany was defeated , when the Nazis seemed to offer the redemption of the country . <p> The narrative is steeped in the ongoing role of anti-Semitism . Lower describes how the existing prejudice was drilled and shaped into a pattern of brutal behavior . Also not be to ignored is the contrasting societal expectation that all women should be natural nurturers who would unite in their opposition to this behavior . Lower probes the intersection of these forces . <p> Lower writes as an academic . Shes careful to use reliable sources , and careful as well to draw limited conclusions . While she sometimes describes unbelievably violent behavior , she does so in exploration of understanding , not for sensation . <p> I 'll recommend this to readers interested in this era , or in the role of women , or those seeking a sense for how a country can create such an effective and horrific organization of death . <h> " HHhH " by Laurent Binet <p> The New York Times " 100 Notable Books " list each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 list included " HHhH " by Laurent Binet , a novel originally written in French , describing the actual events leading up to the 1942 assassination of Reinhard Heydrich , known as " the Butcher of Prague . " <p> - The intriguing title refers to the first letters of the German words in the phrase , " Himmlers brain is called Heydrich . " Indeed , as Himmlers protege Heydrich had risen in power to be a man much feared . His brutal treatment of the Czechoslovakians , for whom he was named " protector , " typified Germanys harsh conduct in the countries it took over to the east . <p> Binet details the steps in Heydrichs rise to power , which is quite well chronicled . He does his best to note how the group of assassins came to this place and time , where there is much less information . I found myself wrapped up in the suspense of their all coming together , knowing the stakes for the " guilty " as well as the- " innocent . " <p> - As I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write an account that would be considered nonfiction . A distinctive aspect of this novel is that Binet often inserts himself directly into the story , describing quandaries of missing information , or how his book compares to others , or how to portray the reliability of someones story . I sensed his concern for creating an account that was truthful , and found these insertions intriguing . What was n't clear was the degree to which his reflections were actual descriptions of his thought process , or to which they were simply a writers technique . <p> - The story is told in 327 pages , 257 sections varying in length from a short paragraph to several pages . At the point when the assassins attack Heydrich , I expected several short descriptions of action . Instead , Binet provides a four-page paragraph of chronology . <p> - The outcome is horrificreprisals for this act were extravagantly brutal . It took several days for the assassins to be tracked down , and even longer to be nearly flushed out of their hiding place before they committed suicide . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act was worthwhile . <p> - The Nazi era continues to provide fodder for thoughtful writing , and the size of its reading audience seems to hold steady . There 's something about this book that had my thoughts returning to it much later , long after I 'd moved on to my next book . I recommend this to those who are interested in the era , who appreciate unusual novel styles , and to people who tend to prefer nonfiction to fiction . Although it may not present the usual themes that many book groups seek , it begs to be read , and then it begs to be discussed . <p> - Before he became a Supreme Court justice , and before he brought the landmark Brown vs . Board of Education case to the Supreme Court , Thurgood Marshalls work at the NAACP took him all over the southern United States where race was a factor in court cases . A general pattern in his work was that the goal was to set up a successful appeal of a conviction . An acquittal was an impossible dream in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strategy in the case of the Groveland Boysfour black men accused of raping a young white woman near Groveland , Florida , in 1949 . King introduces a host of characters in setting the stage for this storyfrom the remarkable Sheriff Willis McCall to a woman reporter for a local newspaper to the four accused black men to the governors of Florida to members of the Ku Klux Klan to members of the local NAACP . King works hard to place the actions in the context of the time , where one foot is squarely in a system that as a matter of course denies justice to black people , and the other is stepping toward landmark decisions such as Brown vs . Board of Education . <p> - He traces a chronology of beatings , shootings , and palpable danger for the men in custody , and- for the outsider attorneys who arrive in Florida in their defense . In the end , what justice looks like seems pretty unimpressive . What does impress is Kings ability to maintain the connection to context , and to weave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> - Kings focus on Thurgood Marshall further highlights context , knowing what we do of his later Supreme Court career . In terms of how the story works , the immense scope of his personality and impact balance the intensity of what happened at Groveland . From my vantage point in 2013 , continual questions arose regarding how things have changedor notsince 1949 . <p> - I 'm a nonfiction fan generally , and especially seek well-told stories of American History . Ive been recommending this to others who seek such a book , and especially to people with an interest in justice . I think this could be an excellent nonfiction choice for book groups who typically choose fiction . There is much to learn , and to discuss , in " Devil in the Grove . "

@@28425245 @2125245/ <p> Once we get past the irony of Jerry Lees " own story " being told by someone else , the choice of author makes perfect sense . Bragg clearly knows how to portray the South , in this case , Ferriday , Louisiana , where Lewis grew up during the Great Depression . That time and that place propelled Lewis to rock and roll superstardom in the 1950s . Nearly everything that happened to Lewis , or that he set in motion , connects back to Ferriday . His bigamous marriage to his young cousin , his reliance on drugs and alcohol , and his attraction to risky behavior of all sorts , they all began in Ferriday . And central to it all is the image of a performer with boundless energy , a man who whipped crowds into a frenzy with a piano playing style entirely his own . <p> Bragg interviewed Lewis extensively for this book , using many of Lewiss own words to craft the story . Bragg succeeds in creating a compelling sense of Jerry Lee Lewis in his seventies , looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never admits regret , and often notes where he deserves more credit .

Both Bragg and Hilburn respect the depth of Lewis and Cash , going to great lengths to do justice to their complex lives . <p> I found " Jerry Lee Lewis : His Own Story " immensely readable , potentially an excellent nonfiction choice for books groups who usually read fiction .

The people closest to Cash testify to his artistry , his addictions , the immense physical pain in his final years , and his remarkable love for June Carter Cash .

As I 've stated before , I 'm enjoying the reading immensely. - These are excellent books . They tell fascinating stories . I find it very interesting that all five of the titles , fiction as well as nonfiction , are based on actual events . I think its fair to say that all five books grew out of the authors fascination with a particular story that actually happened . They wanted to tell the story . <p> I became intrigued by what each author said about why he/she wrote . <p> Of " What is the What , " Dave Eggers said of Valentino Achak Deng , " He had been pushed , ignored , disrespected . And each time he would think , silently , " If only that person knew what I 'd already been through " He would direct his thoughts to whoever had treated him less than humanely , and hope for a day when his story was known far and wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " <p> Robert Hicks , who wrote " Widow of the South " said in an interview , " That was the kind of story I wanted to tell how epic circumstances would transform the characters of the story as the characters , themselves , transformed each other . " <p> Of writing in general , James McBride , the author of " The Color of Water , " said this in an interview , " If you 're not going to say anything to people that gets them through the day and comes from your heart and has some kind of spirituality , you shouldnt do this . You have to live honestly . When I run out of good things to say to people , that 's when I 'll stop writing . " <p> The comments that Geraldine Brooks made regarding " People of the Book " echo the sentiments that Hicks described , when she said , " I think its no coincidence that all three of my novels basically are about how people act in a time of catastrophe . Do they go to their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't  stopped intriguing me , exploring how people are when they 're confronted with the choice of who to be in a hard time . " <p> Similarly , when Candice Millard spoke about " The River of Doubt , " she said , " The more I learned about this expedition , the more fascinated I became . I knew very quickly that this was a story I wanted to tellFor me , what was most interesting about this expedition was the opportunity to get a very intimate picture of Roosevelt , to see him simply as a man a leader not on the scale of nations and armies but among this small group of men who are fighting for their lives . What was striking on this expedition was Roosevelts unshakable devotion to his men and to his principles . Even when he was so sick he could barely lift his head from his rusting cot , Roosevelt was concerned about the other men in the expedition and did what he could to help them . He tried to give them what little food he had , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his physical weakness would not endanger their lives . Roosevelt showed remarkable strength of character on this expedition , and every man who survived it admired him deeply . " <p> Since I gathered up these authors observations about their writing , my thoughts have returned several times to authors fascination with certain stories , and our own response as readers . As a reading geek , I love knowing what 's behind a book . <p> I applaud the One Book One Lincoln selection committee for choosing these compelling stories . No wonder the authors felt so inspired to write them . I 'm eager to learn how readers respond . <p> Pollan explains how decades of nutrition science , as covered in the media especially , have confused us about how to eat healthfully . Pollan wants people to eat food , and by eating a variety of food , they will receive the nutrition that they need . <p> I probably agree with his advice overall .

In the time since I read this , Ive thought of it often . <p> This years Notables List includes a couple of titles about everyday thingseating and driving , for instance .

Its a novel about a New England veterinarian whose son is shot while hunting . <p> Its format was a tad off-putting to me at first . Its told as if in notes regarding the calls that the veterinarians receives . For instance , from page one : <p> Call : A cow with her dead calf halfborn.Action : Put on boots and pulled dead calf out while standing in a field full of mud.Result : Hind legs tore off from dead calf while I pulled . Head , forelegs , and torso are still inside the mother.Thoughts on Drive Home While Passing Red and Gold Leaves on Maple Trees : Is there a nicer place to live ? <p> Once I got used to the rhythm of the format , I enjoyed the story , and even began to like the distance that this structure provided . The entries are a mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veterinarians son is shot , the format keeps the action from being overwhelming , somehow . The obsession he develops for learning who shot his son is entirely believable , even as it mixes in to his wry observations about the households and animals he visits . Events turn once again when a young man shows up who is his son , via a sperm donation he made in his college days . <p> The one quibble I have is that when the son must be in the hospital following the shooting , I felt an inadequate connection to everything medicalall of the decisions , the instruments , the machinery , the weirdness of time in the hospital . His thoughts did n't  leave his son often , but I did n't  sense the way that a hospital often becomes a familys hearth when a child is in a coma . <p> Looking back on this story , it strikes me as " old fashioned " in these waysthe veterinarian is someone who wants to be a good man . He loves his family . He works hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could happen to anyone . They shake him up . He does a few silly things , but all in all , he behaves in ways that make perfect sense , and that underscore a basic decency about him . His ability always to see something a little differently and often without judgment , to find humor and happy irony , create a distinctive tone . And make a clear contrast with his focus on the shooter . <p> I 'll recommend this to people as a quirky but satisfying read . It probably requires a slightly quirky reader , too , but I predict that once people get accustomed to the rhythm of the language , they will take to the people and the place .

@@28425288 @2125288/ <h> Firefly <p> I 'm just returning a copy of " The River of Doubt " by Candice Millard , subtitled , " Theodore Roosevels Darkest Journey " . Its one of the nominees for this years One Book One Lincoln ( OBOL ) program . <p> Theodore Roosevelt lived this adventure down a river of the Amazon Basin in 1913 and 1914 , shortly after his defeat as a third-party candidate for president in 1912 . <p> Interesting story ! The expedition began as a fairly mild trip down previously-charted waters . It became a life-and-death struggle down a river full of rapids , without adequate equipment or provisions . Roosevelt became seriously i 'll with an infection in his leg that had been injured years earlier . <p> The rainforest of the Amazon becomes almost another characterit is so full of life that the team of adventurers cant begin to understand . They can barely see the world of plants and animals that have adapted to the ecosystem there . Millard describes too how the people of the rainforest have also adapted , and how they let this group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have killed the whole group relatively easily . <p> My experience of this book was that I enjoyed it as I read it , but I did n't  find it more compelling than gardening or a delicious supper . I did enjoy reading how the people on the expedition interacted , and how they dug into their reserves of strength and resilience . <p> This book would likely appeal to people who enjoy reading about history , or adventure , or South America , or the lives of the presidents . <p> My annual reading of the Notable Books list over the years has shifted my preference toward nonfiction . Every year the nonfiction section of that list includes- titles that are true pleasures to read , with the added bonus of imparting information . I 've re-structured my former reading groove of choosing fiction almost exclusively . I appreciate the way that nonfiction sometimes reads differently . I so admire writers who take technical information and make it available and meaningful to non-experts . <p> In the arena of youth reading , some experts have pointed out that many boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction for recreational reading . Michael Sullivan refers to this issue in " Connecting Boys with Books 2 . " We need to recognize the diversity of reading tastes in young people as well as adults . School Library Journal devotes a monthly blog and column to highlighting nonfiction reading for children . <p> What 's your preference ? Do you lean strongly one direction or the other ? What have you learned from going outside of your usual reading groove ? And what inspired you to do so ? <p> Briefly , its a novel set during the siege of Leningrad , of two men who meet when they share a jail cell one night . Instead of being executed the next morning as they expect , they receive a chance to live , IF they bring the colonel a dozen eggs for his daughters wedding cake . This in a city where people are cooking down the glue in book bindings to have something to eat. - What an idea . <p> As I read this , I was reminded of a pattern that I 've noted in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds great promise , but the follow-through disappoints . " City of Thieves " lived up to its potential , and grandly . <p> The two men , Lev and Kolya , set out on their way . The banter between the two of them stays lively . Their quest is absurd . On the one hand is this silliness , but in the other is the drop-dead seriousness of the time. - Starvation visits every home . Nazis kill and torture on a whim . <p> When I read these Notable books , I try to find excerpts that I can share later with a wide range of audiences . I had a hard time finding good excerpts that werent full of coarse language , but I had n't  been aware of that as I read. - Instead , I was aware of the growing friendship and respect between Lev and Kolya . I tend to want to get books finished and marked off of my list . I was sorry when I got to the end of City of Thieves . <p> This book was also on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for older teens . I think " City of Thieves " would also satisfy readers interested in the historical time period , in books about buddies , and in the yin and yang of funny and serious . <p> I know that the people in the wonderful Friday morning Bethany Library book group have had lively discussions of this one . I 'm going to suggest it as a great title for book groups . <p> I enjoyed reading it ( which surprised me a little ) , and learned a lot about the recent history of Saudi Arabia . <p> Coll describes Osama Bin Ladens story , but takes pains to provide a broad picture of the family . He begins by tracing Mohamed Bin Ladens beginnings as a humble Yemeni , growing a remarkable fortune due to his savvy leadership of his construction firm . Mohameds children include Osama , but Coll spends possibly more time describing the older " first among equals " of that generation who were expected to take leadership of the family business and fortune . The family remains closely allied to the Saudi royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune of the Bin Ladens . <p> I enjoyed Colls skill at describing the various personalities , and placing them into context . He explores the differences between male and female roles , as well as the range of experiences that people have with the West . Many Bin Laden sons and daughters were educated in America and Europe , and many live at least part of the time outside of Saudi Arabia . <p> I redrew the mental picture that I had of Osama Bin Laden going into this book . Coll shows how the prominent Bin Laden family distanced itself from Osama , essentially disowning him , using the courts to demonstrate their lack of financial support for him and his work . <p> I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it because I expected that it might be a little dry. - Colls storytelling ability kept me engaged . <p> I 'd recommend this to people interested in the current situation in the Middle East , to those interested in other cultures , and to people who enjoy well-written and researched exploration of contemporary issues . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , this year chaired by Donna Marvin and Mary Jane Humphreys . <p> In addition to reading many nominated titles , the committee discusses whether particular books offer enough in " meat " for discussion and consideration for the whole community . <p> This leads to an ongoing question about book groupswhy are some books so great for promoting discussion , when other perfectly good books fall flat ? I ran into my friend , Barb , at Leons this week , and this was the question on her mind , too . <p> A few years ago , as part of my Notable Books reading , I read Jon Krakauers " Into Thin Air . " - I loved the story , but put it down and did n't  think much more about it . Then , as I ran into more and more people whod read the book , I could n't believe all of the different ways in which people thought about it , and wanted to talk about it. - And then I had plenty to talk about , too ! - My theory is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their intense interactions during the blizzard on the mountain kept us talking , and talking , and talking . <p> Sowhat books have you found to be great at promoting discussion ? - Any books that YOU loved that fizzled when it came to kindling a conversation ?

@@28425307 @2125307/ <h> Tag Archives : fiction <h> An Interesting Notable , " The Convalescent " <p> In a nutshell , " The Convalescent " by Jessica Anthony is a remarkably absurd novel , alternating the contemporary story of Rovar Pfliegman with the history of his ancestral Hungarian people . Rovar is an outcast living just outside a small town in South Carolina . He sells meat ( his people are butchers ) from an abandoned school bus which doubles as his home . He develops a relationship of sorts with Dr. Monica , a pediatrician who is willing to explore Rovars various ailments . These include some fascinating dermatological symptoms . The history of his people includes generations of failure , remarkable feats of magical proportions , and some spectacular liaisons . <p> In some ways , " The Convalescent " has much in common with other novels of outcasts , such as " A Confederacy of Dunces " by John Kennedy Toole . I loved that book when I read it years ago . I confess that I respond to these characters with a little impatience . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how someone quite outside the mainstream interacts with " regular " people . On the other hand , their continued isolation is sadand I realize that I want them to Get Better , whatever that means . In this case , I did n't  sense my interest in Rovar growing once he was introduced . Sometimes a book like this just asks the reader to suspend expectations and enjoy the ride . <p> Why is this on the Notable Books list ? Its creative . Anthony uses words well . She seemed to have a great time creating Rovar and placing him in remarkable situations . <p> Ill probably recommend this to only a few people . Although it is n't for the mass of readers who expect a novel with a linear plot from introduction to conflict to resolution , it IS for those who prefer to have it all turned upside down from time to time . <h> " Little Bee " from the Notables List <p> I have a new way of evaluating how well a book is working for medo I find it engaging when I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a morning person , and if a book does n't  make it for me around 5 a.m. on Saturday morning , it never will . Conversely , if I find a book compelling after dinner , well , THATs a good book . <p> " Little Bee " by Chris Cleave came from the fiction portion of this years American Library Association Notable Books list AND I enjoyed reading most of it in the evening . I had n't  exactly been looking forward to reading it . I knew that it involved a girl whod been chased and I was n't sure what in Nigeria before ending up in England . <p> As it turns out , I enjoyed reading this , despite the intense Nigerian scenes of Little Bees sisters death , and a British womans violent act to save Little Bee . The story is told in the alternating voices of Little Bee and Sarah , that woman. - Part of the effectiveness of the story lies in the contrast between Little Bee as a traumatized and marginalized undocumented alien and Sarah , a stylish magazine editor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won my sympathy . I admire the way that Cleave doles out pieces of their stories and weaves secrets together . Sarahs story is that of a regular person who finds herself in the midst of a bewildering and dangerous situation . She wants to rise to that , despite her clear shortcomings . Now that I think of it , Little Bee , too , is a regular person who finds herself in the midst of a bewildering and dangerous situation . <p> I 'll recommend it to readers who appreciate a fine sense of plot and timing and who are willing to work through difficulty to consider how the human spirit responds to evil . <h> " Brooklyn , " another Notable <p> In my continuing project of reading the Americian Library Association Notable Books list , I finished up the novel , " Brooklyn " by Colm Toibin a few weeks ago .

Once in America , she stands out by doing a good job and minding her own business , both at work and in the boardinghouse where she lives with several Irish women. - She enrolls in business school . Things become especially interesting when she becomes attached to a young man . <p> But then , she is called back to Ireland , and must decide where her home truly is , and face her own lack of clear intention .

What he does especially well is to observe the social interaction between people , and to get inside Eiliss thoughts and feelings . Sometimes I had to wince on her behalf , she seemed not to see what was coming . <p> I 'd recommend this to fiction readers who enjoy coming-of age stories , themes to do with immigration and cultures colliding , and stories of women who strike out on their own . <h> Another from the Notables List " The Vagrants " <p> I was in the midst of reading " Columbine " by Dave Cullen as I read my way through this years American Library Association Notable Books list . Its a good book , but intense . After a nightmare involving a Columbine-like incident at the Omaha Public Library ( remember , just a dream ! ) , I realized that I needed a break .

It feels like nobody has a haven , either in a place , or in a persons arms . <p> And I think that 's the authors pointthat things became so crazy in China that the bonds that hold people together in the best ways , through family , friendships , and rewarding work , are broken. - And " The Vagrants " leads us to face the dismal result .

That is where I spent a recent weekend , reading Edwidge Dandicats " Claire of the Sea Light . " <p> Set in the authors native Haiti , this contemporary novel begins with Claire at seven , visiting her mothers grave on her own birthday . Her mother died giving birth to Claire , and so this day establishes the pattern of the story , life and death side by side . Eventually her father makes the difficult decision to give Claire up to a woman in town , and that is when Claire disappears . <p> It is also when Dandicats storytelling genius emerges , backing away from the intensity of the disappearance , using each of the next six chapters to tell the story of someone whose life connects eventually to Claire . After that series of flashbacks , the story returns to Claire herself . <p> Dandicats writing includes just what it needs to , homing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed , and almost nothing more . <p> When I started this book I knew it was about a girls disappearance , and I worried that it would be too dark , too intense , and too hopeless . Without stooping to cheap hopefulness , Dandicat weaves in the sea light of Claires name . Hope is not too bright , and despair not too dark , when they remain so close to each other . <p> I 'll recommend this to people who love a good story , well told . No wonder its on the American Library Association Notable Books List . <h> " Johnny Cash : the Life " by Robert Hilburn <p> I enjoyed it immensely , and found myself losing track of time while I read it . Hilburn crafts a compelling story . From Cashs upbringing in Dyess , Arkansas , to his drug-drenched superstardom to his final days as a national icon , Hilburn keeps the storys thread strong . <p> Hilburns reliance on extensive interviews brings many voices into the narrative . The people closest to Cash testify to his artistry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and his remarkable love for June Carter Cash . A music critic , Hilburn gives frank assessments of Cashs performances , puts them into context , and keeps the music central to the story . <p> I grew up in a home where we seldom missed " The Johnny Cash Show .

Peopleall kinds of peopleloved that song . I kept humming it as I read this book . <p> I 've recommended this to several readers who are interested in popular music generally , or country music more specifically . I see it having ample appeal beyond that , because Hilburn weaves plenty of insight into this portrait of a complicated man who become an American icon . <h> " Americanah " by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie <p> I read much of " Americanah " by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie while on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of some family time to dip back into this novel of a contemporary womans journey from Nigeria to the United Sates , then back . <p> Much of the story is framed as flashbacks while Ifemelu is having her hair braided for her return to Africa .

Ifemelu follows soon after . Ifemelus initial depression , and resorting to performing sex acts for money , contrast with her later success . To her great good fortune , she lands a nanny job with a rich family . She becomes involved with rich and educated men .

I keep returning to the image of hair braiding as I consider how she does it , weaving together people , places , and politics . I tend to prefer novels that are pared down to just a very narrow chute . Adichie introduces all kinds of minor characters to push the story along . They leave as quickly as they appear . She also provides remarkable detail about clothing , about hair , especially African hair , and about food . It all seems a little messy , maybe too untidy , and yet it works . <p> I 'll recommend this to book groups who do n't  shy away from 500-plus pages .

I certainly sensed this in " The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards " by Kristopher Jansma , which I started and finished during a recent trip to Chicago for a library conference . <p> - It makes a perfect example of why I love reading the titles from the Notable Books List each yearI come across fabulous books that I would have missed otherwise . <p> - Basically this novel circles around an unnamed narrator and his two most important friends . The story opens as the narrator describes how his mother , a flight attendant , often left- him in the care of vendors at the airport . His ability to fit in , especially to mix among wealthy people , leads to a lifelong pattern of dishonesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their college English class . That friend soon writes a fabulously successful novel , though his life is shadowed by addiction and mental illness . Through that friend , the narrator meets the woman he loves but can never marry . Much of the energy in this novel is generated as the three of them come together , then fall apart . <p> - Each of the ten chapters could stand alone as a short story , focusing on a particular time and place . Jansmas genius is how he uses these pieces to pull the whole story together , how an image introduced in one place returns in another . <p> - How does a writer avoid revealing what others do n't  want shared ? When should a writer betray a friend to further success ? What are the chances for success when relationships are built on lies ? How can broken friendships be mended ? When is honesty required ? <p> - I was surprised by how readable this book was , given those heavy questions . I credit Jansmas clever eye for detail and ability to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East Coast to New York City to India to Africa and many places between . Part of the pleasure in the reading was just learning where it would take up next . Meg Woltitzer aptly used the phrase , " playfully weird " about this book . I would add " playfully smart . " I know that I missed many well-placed literary allusions . <p> - I have confessed before to my Pollyanna-ish hope that at last one person will learn and grow in a novel , and end up a better person . That happened here , though it was n't easy or pretty . <p> - I 'm not aware of many- people whove read this. - I 'm hoping a few of my friends will do so soon , so that we can discuss it . I 'll recommend this to people who like literary fiction , especially if they do n't  insist on the work being too dark and pessimistic . In the heart of this story of friendship , betrayal , and love , stands that critical questionCAN a leopard change its spots ? <p> - Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team from the University of Washington . Brown extensively interviewed rower Joe Rantz not long before Rantz died a few years ago , and it is Rantz who stands at the center of this story . Around him are his crewmates , his remarkable coach , Al Ulbrickson , and George Pocock , a boatbuilder and rowing guru . As as a group they exemplified how a successful team far exceeds the sum of its parts . <p> - Brown creates the context of America in the Great Depression , and more specifically , the lives of working class people at that time . Rantz and several teammates worked back-breaking jobs to afford their classes , and Rantz was often teased about his ratty clothes . In addition , Rantz was abandoned by his father , learning to make his own way . Brown contrasts their situation with that of teams from the Ivy League or Europe . <p> - The strong narrative thread of " The Boys in the Boat " helps it cross over for people who typically read fiction . Brown incorporates information about rowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot . He builds credible characters from interviews and contemporary articles . This book employs a rhythm typical of sport stories , with background information framing descriptions of contests . <p> - This team became magical at crucial moments , when all nine men in the boat pulled together , worked together , and won together . Brown explores Rantzs decision to trust , truly trust , that his teammates would do what needed to be done even though his own family life taught him reasonably to trust only himself . <p> - I 'll recommend this to a variety of readers , both of fiction and nonfiction . Fans of strong sports stories should dig into " The Boys in the Boat , " especially readers interested in the storied 1936 Olympics in Berlin . This makes an excellent book group choice , with its universal themes of history , purpose , and success against great odds .

They rose to prominence beginning with grain futures in the mid-1800s and rose to wealth and prominence , to have businesses in Odessa where they began , then Paris and Vienna also . De Waal looks back on their social prominence , the impact of their being Jewish , and how it all came crashing down with the Nazis .

What 's different here is that Didier Lefevre was a photographer , and so photographs are included as well as drawings . This book describes a trip that Lefevre took in 1986 to Afghanistan with a French Doctors Without Borders group that was to treat people caught up in the war there . As a photographer , Lefevre is n't really part of the group . But photography became the skill that he offered to this intense work , his ability to document what happened . <p> There 's so much to say about this book . <p> Lefevres emotional upset at what he witnessed was intensified by his ability to DO nothing for the people , beyond documenting their situation . His keen visual sense increased that intensity , including is respect for the doctors work . <p> The landscape of Afghanistan is almost a character in itselfboth the remarkable scenes of mountains and dark interiors . <p> The newness of the experiences leads Lefevre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain . The groups encounters with local people , especially with warlords and other leaders , demonstrate how different this place , this culture , and this situation are from what he s known . The brevity that captions enforce keep him from philosophizing much . Instead , he describes what he sees , what he learns . <p> He does a crazy thing at the end of the trip , taking off on his own to go back to Pakistan . He nearly dies , is taken advantage of by some people , and then kindly rescued by others . <p> Some of the photographs , such as those on page 258 just before his return to Paris , are just drop-dead fascinating . <p> One quibble I 'd make is that my 50-year-old eyes required an awful lot of light to get full advantage of the small photographs .

@@28425336 @2125336/ <h> Firefly <p> Today and yesterday , I met with the people who supervise classified staff at Lincoln City Libraries . They came from all of our locations , including the Bookmobile . There 's something about these mixed-up groups that creates good energy . <p> Among our discussion points : motivation . I asked group members to review the Gallup Q12 information available via our very own library books and the Internet , or to learn about " Drive " by Daniel H. Pink via reading the book , or taking a look at his website and other information . <p> I find both of these sources optimistic . From time to time , I 've heard library people bemoan our lack of money to use for motivational rewardsand Ive probably bemoaned that , too . What I found positive in the information in both of these sources is that money is n't that much of a motivator , when it comes right down to it . <p> But having a purpose IS motivating , its intrinsically rewarding . That 's apparent both from what we 've learned from Gallup , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly to our purpose is key . The library is a place where staff hold some pretty disparate points of view about the best ways to serve our community . But where there 's usually fundamental agreement is that the Library Is a Good Thing . Were united about serving our customers well , and being part of an institution that springs from one of the very best ideasthe importance of educated citizens in a democracy . <p> Ive been thinking lately about how we all make reading choices . In the library , we realize that a LOT of our circulation comes from the items that we have out on display . Those book jackets that are displayed face-out provide all kinds of enticement and advertisement . Several people have mentioned to me that they seldom get beyond the displays and into the stacks ( librarian lingo for shelves ) . <p> Earlier this month , though , I found myself in the fiction area , deep into those shelves because I had a yen to re-read an old favorite author , Dorothy L. Sayers. - I took home " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls for his true love , the wrongly accused Harriet Vane , and " Murder Must Advertise , " which I remembered enjoying some time ago . These are classics of the mystery genre . Lord Peter is an amateur detective , a high-class Lord with stellar upbringing , kind heart , and impeccable manners . His experience of the world leaves him never completely surprised . <p> These stories were written in the 1930s , and that era combined with their British setting creates some excellent escapist reading . <p> Dorothy L. Sayers wrote so well . Many selections deserve to be read aloud just to savor her rich vocabulary and sense of the droll . As I 've confessed before , I seldom try to work out a mystery as I read , but I had a strong sense of her weaving a web of clues and red herrings . <p> I noticed that the copies of these books that I checked out were added to the Lincoln City Libraries collection in 1968 . I find myself wondering who else has read these copies , wondering what was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timelessness of this excellent writing . <p> As the saying goes , " So many books , so little time ! " - For many of us , those displays at the front of the library are all we need , and may be all we have time for . However , my happy reacquaintance with Lord Peter reminds me to remind you to consider what gems may be awaiting- you just a little farther into the library . <p> Just before the holidays , I enjoyed reading the novel , " Bellwether " by Connie Willis . This was published in 1996 ; I came across a recommendation for it in Library Journals " Dusty Books " blog dated December 8 . In the blog , it was described as " adorable , smart , Gen X chick lit . " <p> In 1998 , Connie Willis also wrote , " To Say Nothing of the Dog , " which was so highly recommended to me by a friend that she gave me a copy of itand it did n't  work for me . I just couldnt get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleverly hilarious scenes . <p> " Bellwether " takes place in a 90s think tank where Sandra Foster studies fads . Aspects of the story are like a time travelgoing back to when fancy coffee was just taking off . Of course , Sandra has her antennae out for anything that may be an incipient fad. - She begins collaborating with another researcher , using sheep . And in the process , they learn the importance of a bellwether . Of course , Sandy and her fellow researcher fall in love , and even win a big though mysterious prize . <p> This is n't a science fiction book , though that 's what Connie Willis typically writes . It is a workplace story , complete with crazy corporate campaign and crazy-making colleagues . <p> I read this book through to the end , and at certain points , I was n't sure why . I told my husband several times that I was waiting for the real story to start . Even so , I found Sandra intriguing , and will recommend this book to those who like sassy- heroines and clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some of our website informationtake a look at " Books Movies &amp; More !

I refer to this feature often for great ideas , and I love how the lists connect directly to our library catalogkeep in mind , too , that our libraries offer free holds , so place a hold if you need a copy sent from one library to another for you to check out . <p> I 've also recently been perusing Library Journals " Dusty Books " feature , part of its " Shelf Renewal " feature . One of the strengths of the public library is our collection of older books . While its true that we depend on new and popular titles for much of our circulation , many of our customers love finding something a little older , a little less known , and yet very rewarding . <p> Due to a " Dusty Books " recommendation , I just read " Learning to Fly " by April Henry , a novel about a young woman who takes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a hitchhiker , Lydia , and then drives into a dust storm on the Interstate that results in a multi-car , multi-death pileup. - In the immediate aftermath of the accident , Free tries to help a badly injured young man by finding a Nike athletic bag that he s fixated on retrieving . He dies , and Free realized that this bag contains nearly $750,000.00 . Lydia dies , and Free decides to become Lydia , using the found money to support a new life . This is her opportunity to ditch her upbringing by two hippie counterculturalists and become something she 's cravedbecoming a conforming member of society. - What she does n't  know is that Lydias psychopath husband will come after her , and so will the drug kingpin seeking all of that money . <p> Henry sets up great suspense .

Bartok became an artist and writer . After a serious car accident and traumatic brain injury as an adult , she decided to take a few steps toward reconnection with her mother who by then was homeless as well . <p> This book stands out from the others because Bartok includes excerpts from letters that her mother wrote , and she includes pictures of her own art . These deepen her story . Her telling is n't chronological , but it does make sense somehow , as she describes the reconciliation , and then backs up to tell what came before . <p> Bartok employs the image of the memory palace partly because she had to reconstruct her own ability to remember . She suffered a traumatic brain injury in 1999 at age 40 , and lost much of her short term memory . She describes the memory palace as a way of remembering by creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something one wishes to remember , an apt description of her writing here . <p> As I look back on the reading and reflect on what images I will keep of this book , I will recall Bartoks description of when she first saw her mother behaving oddly in a way that was seriously wrong , and her immediate understanding that it was something to hide . The saddest to me was that Bartok seemed to show great talent at the piano ; her mother had been a prodigy . But the disorganization of the entire household kept Bartok from continuing with lessons just as she was progressing to serious music . <p> Bartok struggles with guilt and shame . Yet there is also a sense in which she and her sister keep their eye on the light at the end of a tunnel , knowing that their only hope is that light . Nothing here is easy , but much of it is richly focused on life and hope . <p> I confess that as I read this , I often silently thanked my parents for being so by-the-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three square meals each and every day , and insisting on a sense of order .

@@28425356 @2125356/ <h> A Notable Novel , " The Cats Table " by Michael Ondaatje <p> This novel takes place on a ship traveling between Sri Lanka and England in the early 1950s . Its narrator , Michael , is eleven and traveling without supervision . He befriends two other young men on the ship and the three of them engage in the kinds of adventures one would expectsneaking into the first class areas , filching food , sneaking a dog aboard . <p> The books title refers to the table in the ships dining room where the passengers with the lowest status were assigned . That is , of course , where one would expect to find the most interesting peopleand Michael does . <p> About a third of the way through the book , I began to wonder where it was heading . At that point , it seemed much like a romp of a book , the mood overall light , a quirky cast of characters introduced in succession , with no sense of a narrative trajectoryno problem to solve . <p> And then Ondaatje introduces some evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaks aboard bites and kills a seriously i 'll passenger . A prisoner tries to mount an escape . Michael takes all of this in , only later figuring out how some of the pieces fit together . <p> At about the same point , the narrator moves away from the voyage to tell some of what happened after . He remains friends with one of his ship buddies and eventually marries that boys sister though the marriage does n't  last . Decades after the voyage , he meets up with a cousin who had been aboard , a pretty young woman who at the time seemed to be involved in some mystery all her own . These time shifts continue until the novel ends with the ships arrival in England . <p> I sensed that the novel lost energy when it left the ship itself . There 's something about a ship story , a group of people confined together , that when written well becomes a delicious soup of humanity . <p> Each time that I read a book from the Notables list , I reflect on why it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elegant writing , of the effective turn of phrase . The narrator that he creates here strikes a perfect balance of a youngsters point of view with an older mans wisdom and regret . Reviewers often use the word " elegant " to describe Ondaatjes writingfine choice of words , observations that are spot on , and that sense of writing so well done that it calls no attention to itself . Applying such elegance to so quirky a group of characters as in " The Cats Table " is a lovely irony . <p> I 'll recommend this to readers who often choose more literary novels , seeking the qualities that Ondaatje weaves into this fine sea story . <p> The basic story is that Goldman was an established writer in his early 50s when he fell in love with and in 2005 married the emerging Mexican writer , Aura Estrada , who was in her mid 20s . Just short of their second anniversary , she died following a swimming accident on a beach in Mexico . <p> Goldman casts the story of their courtship and marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections that move in time and in place . It has the sense of how one would expect such a story to be told , with one memory providing a nudge that reminds the author of something else that seems unrelated and yet highlights or foreshadows what will come . This backing and forthing continues until finally at the end of the book , Goldman describes what happened on the beach that day and just after . <p> I was interested in why Goldman chose to tell this story in a novel instead of as a memoir . What he said in an interview in the Paris review , " I have never liked the memoir form because I tend to think that memory fictionalizes anyway . Once you claim that you are writing a narrative purely from memory you are already in the realm of fiction . " <p> What a perfect book for book groupsthere is the marital relationship made more interesting with the difference in their ages , the intense relationship between Aura and her mother , the striving of Aura as a writer with a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of course the exploration of grief and loss . I doubt I 'm the only reader who takes a little too much interest in what writers are like , and so book groups can add the added incentive of looking into these closets and cupboards . <p> I 'm reflecting on my own internal score for this bookGoldman writes so well , well enough that this tribute to Aura is worthy of her , and I sensed that he was honest about himself , even when being honest meant revealing things that I did n't  much like . Thinking a little more about it , I see that this book grew on me in a way that I admire . I was n't instantly pulled in , but Goldman managed to make me want to know more , to continue to read about Aura , and to fathom and face his loss . <h> An Especially Good Nonfiction Notable " Destiny of the Republic " <p> " Destiny of the Republic " by Candice Millard is subtitled , " A Tale of Madness , Medicine and the Murder of A President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells the story of President James Garfield , who was elected in 1880 and died in 1881 . <p> Some readers may recall Millard as the author of " The River of Doubt " which was a One Book One Lincoln finalist a few years ago . That focused on an episode in the life of Theodore Roosevelt . She excels at writing history as story . <p> Millard opens this story with a prologue that introduces us right away to Charlies Guiteau . Guiteau survived a collision between two steamships in 1880 . His own survival when others died led him to believe that he was saved for an important purpose , and when that belief combined with his mental illness , it twisted itself into his intention to kill President Garfield . <p> Chapter One picks up at the United States Centennial Exhibition in 1876 , where James Garfield , a congressman , strolls the grounds with his family . Millard uses this event to introduce two key angles that will be highlighted when Garfield is shotthe work of Inventor , Alexander Graham Bell , and pioneering work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with Garfields remarkable rise from poverty to presidency to set the context of the time , and to tell the parallel story of Guiteaus descent . The events following the shooting take up a good deal of the book , yet she does n't  lose the narratives momentum . <p> I appreciated how much I learned in the course of this book . This takes several forms . The sense of the United States shortly after the Civil War , the personalities engaged in politics , the dirtiness of the politics , and the lack of cleanliness as it impacted Garfield , are staying with me . <p> This may not be the book for serious students of American history , but for readers who have a general interest in the time and who are unfamiliar with James Garfield , Millard unrolls a fine story . I 'll recommend it both to those with that interest in American history , and also to fiction readers who are willing to try nonfiction " when it reads like a story . " <h> A Notable Novel , " The Art of Fielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fielding " by Chad Harbach . Its a fine book with a fabulous first half . As a reader and evaluator , I 'm so overwhelmed by the unfulfilled promise of that first half that I may be underestimating the second . <p> But to back upthis is a baseball novel combined with a coming-of-age story . Its focus is Henry Skrimshander , a remarkable shortstop . Henrys fielding ability is witnessed by a catcher who is able to wangle Henry a place at Westish College . Henrys magical talent transforms the teamuntil he loses it . And then his friends , his teammates , and all who have been introduced in this novel adjust their orbits around his misery . <p> Other aspects of the story include the life of a small liberal arts college , the first motions toward a gay relationship by the college president , the return of the presidents prodigal daughter , and the coaching brilliance of that catcher . <p> Harbach is a wonderful writer , combining a sense of Henrys transcendent talent with the everyday details of college , of roommates , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as he describes scenes artfully , maybe wistfully . I thought to myself that he strikes the tone that I sense Jonathan Franzen going for , of telling a story with a clever voice , from a perch that allows the teller to know an awful lot , when the teller honestly likes the characters , warts and all . <p> I absolutely loved the first half of this book , with Harbach introducing characters in lovely order and a perfect pace . This part of the story seemed so clean , so lusciously straightforward and true . What happens after that just did n't  live up to the promise . The drama of sexual betrayal , the ongoing suspense of Henrys inability to play , the awkward introduction of a counselor who untangles Henrys issues , they seemed like too many condiments on a perfect hot dog . <p> I cant bring myself to dislike " The Art of Fielding , " and I do think its fair to describe it overall as a good book , a fine baseball story . I 'll recommend this to fiction readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans , and certainly to book groups . Its easy to see how it earned its place on this years Notable Books list . <h> From the Notables List , " Turn Right at Machu Picchu " <p> Adams alternates chapters of his own recent trek to Machu Picchu with chapters describing the travels of Hiram Bingham , the Yale professor who " discovered " Machu Picchu in 1911 . <p> Adams travels to Machu Picchu via the ancient Inca Road , using routes that allow him to see what Bingham saw . He includes himself very squarely in this story , offering many personal opinions , observations , and conversations with his guide and the Peruvians who manage the donkeys , food and gear . This works . As a travel writer , Adams achieves that delicate balance where his own personality enlivens the story with overpowering it . <p> There 's something about Machu Picchu that remains eternally interesting . Recent developments regarding the ownership of many Inca items that Hiram Bingham transported back to Yale have added an additional measure of interest to Binghams portion of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machu Picchu , describes well the mountainous area where it is , and draws connections among stories , geography , and personalities . He deepens his own experiences with deft study of others , including those who have always lived in the area , the early white explorers who sought the Lost City of the Incas , and the thousands who visit the site each year . <p> Although this is not a deep academic study , I 'll recommend it to people with an interest in this area . In particular , I will mention it to those who have visited or intend to visit Machu Picchu , to readers who enjoy travel books generally , and to fiction readers who will enjoy a nonfiction book of its " a good story .

He says , " Jack was killed tonight . We were ambushed in a jeep patrol in Gia Dinh . " Soli then writes , " The holiday mood destroyed , the host clapped a hand on his back then poured him a drink .

" It is important to have a thorough debate on what we as a community want for Lincoln 's libraries . But it is essential that everyone has the same understanding of the issue . " <p> The central library project has been in the City 's Capital Improvement Program ( CIP ) since 2006-2007 , when it was listed as a $47.4 million bond project . In the ten years since then , the total estimate cost has been listed between $40 million and $50 million . " Because it costs money to hire a professional consultant to give an estimate , we went with rough numbers in earlier CIPs to plan for the future , " Leach said . " Over time , the estimated cost has changed as we have received updated information .
