Due to his hyperlexia and autism , we have to teach him directly about social skills concepts that develop in most kids naturally . So to make sure we do n't miss anything important , I put together this list of 50 essential social skills to teach your kids . <p> I hope to share resources eventually for each one of these social skills , but I hope you find this list of social skills helpful ! I 've also included a free printable cheat sheet . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> 50 Social Skills to Teach Your Kids <p> When we discuss social skills with my son , we like to work together through the Social Thinking curriculum and its accompanying Thinksheets . I really love the terminology that they use , especially the concepts of expected and unexpected behaviors as an alternative to saying good or bad behaviors . So some of the social skills listed below borrow ideas and wording from the Social Thinking curriculum . 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 
@@23062060 @3062060/ <h> Wednesday , May 24 , 2017 <p> One of my favorite things about my son J is his brutal honesty . He always tells us exactly what he is thinking , which is a great . We know we can count on him to tell the truth when needed . And we always know when he does or does not like something . <p> But sometimes , his comments can be inappropriate or hurtful . <p> Like when he said , " that guy has a really big tummy " while passing the receipt checking employee on the way out of Canadian Tire . <p> Or that a loved one has a big butt right to her face . <p> Or the time he made a comment about a little person , one I 'm sure that person has heard many times before . <p> He has absolutely no filter , like many kids on the spectrum . Okay , like most kids in general . So we are constantly working on teaching him when to think it or when to say it , especially when out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been working on teaching kids the social skill of think it or say it . <h> My Favorite Ways to Teach Kids When to Think it and When to Say it <p> When it comes to teaching the social skills of think it or say it , books have always been the best method for us . My hyperlexic son obviously loves to read and it is his strength so naturally we use it to work on other skills . <p> However , with regards to working on think it or say it ? , I like to use a lot of books that use thought bubbles and speech balloons to reinforce this particular skill . We also love to use these types of books to work on comprehension so you can already find a list of picture books to start with there . You can also read comic books and graphic novels to further help with teaching this social skill . <p> The other thing we like to do is model language that is helpful for teaching the difference between thinking it and saying it . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is best to teach them directly and give them the scripts and phrases they need to be successful . For instance , in the privacy of our own home or in the car , I will frequently ask J to share what he is thinking about and encourage him to use phrases like " I am thinking about ... " or " I wonder if ... " Then we will discuss whether it should remain an inside thought ( something to keep to himself ) or an outside thought ( one that he can share with others by saying it to others ) . This practice will help him become more proficient at filtering out what he can say and what he can not say to someone else . <p> 2 . Thinking &amp; Talking Bubble Visual Posters - You could print these off as small cue cards to keep handy with you while out and about or hang them up as posters to reinforce the important difference between when to think it and when to say it . <p> 3 . Brain Social Filter &amp; Thinking and Talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help kids work on when to think something or when to say it instead . Just scroll through the list until you find the printables called " Brain Social Filter " and " Thinking and Talking Bubbles . " <p> 4 . Comic Book Templates - Drawing and writing your own comic is a great way to reinforce this skill as it encourages your child to think about whether a character would be saying or thinking something in particular . I personally love these free templates . I also really love these social emotional comic strips , although they are not free . <h> Social Skills Video to Teach Kids When to Think it and When to Say it <p> Video modeling is especially helpful for kids with autism so I highly recommend watching the following social skills video with your child . You could also pair it with the printable resources found above to further discuss the distinction between when to think it and when to say it . 17095 @qwx217095 <p> This post is part of a monthly series called Parenting Children with Special Needs .

At 13 , he 's still working on it but he is much better than he was 5 years ago . Like you , I 've had a few rather awkward moments over the years ! 
@@23062061 @3062061/ <p> I 've already revealed that my oldest son has hyperlexia and hypernumeracy and that I was disappointed in the lack of resources for parents dealing with a new diagnosis . Since publishing my This is Hyperlexia post , I 've been trying to collect resources for parents like myself and for educators who will be working with a child with hyperlexia . Just like myself , my son 's teacher had never heard of the term before either and as a result , she was unsure of how to help him be successful in the classroom .

@@23062062 @3062062/ <h> Tuesday , March 28 , 2017 <p> Back when my kids were about three and one , I made this printable visual schedule as a way to build routine and structure into our day . I was hoping it would also help us deal with transitions because back then , our day-to-day life was tough , filled with meltdowns and tears . Little did I know that that visual schedule would have such a tremendous impact on our daily life ! <p> Since then I have been a big fan of using visual schedules and routines for kids , especially those with special needs like autism or hyperlexia , like my oldest . <p> Here are 12 benefits of using a visual schedule with kids who have with autism and/or hyperlexia and why you should be using one , if you are n't already . <h> Reasons Why Using a Visual Schedule is Important for Kids with Autism <p> I remember when we first started implementing and using a visual schedule in our house . It was simply life changing for us ! Here are some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with autism and/or hyperlexia. <h> 1 . Provides organization , structure , and predictability to the day <p> Visual schedules are a great way to build routine and inform kids about the expectations for the day . <h> 2 . Supports literacy development <p> Since visual schedules often incorporate words with pictures ( at least my free printable visual schedule does ! ) , it aids in comprehension , recognition of words , and the relationship between words and pictures . <h> 3 . Reinforces &amp; supplements verbal instructions <p> Many kids with autism and/or hyperlexia struggle with expressive and receptive speech so verbal instructions can literally go in one ear and out the other . Using a visual schedule with these kids reinforces those verbal instructions . <h> 4 . Teaches time concepts &amp; sequencing <p> Even if you do n't use specific times alongside your visual schedule ( we never did because that would have been a disaster with J when he was younger ! ) , the format of a visual schedule clearly illustrates the sequence of events for the day . These kids can literally see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach abstract concepts such as first , next , last or before and after . <h> 5 . Teaches responsibility &amp; planning <p> Kids can take part in planning out their day by helping their parents or teachers build the visual schedule or routine for the day . Doing so allows them to think about and plan out tasks in an appropriate sequence , helping to build strong executive functioning skills . Kids also learn to move onto the next task or activity on the schedule on their own after completing the previous one . Visual schedules can also be used to break down tasks into smaller steps , allowing these kids a better way to master basic life skills . <h> 6 . Eases transitions <p> Switching tasks can be extremely tough for kids with autism or hyperlexia , especially if they are unexpected changes . A visual schedule , however , reduces meltdowns and struggles about moving to the next task because the schedule visually depicts what comes next . As a result , the schedule helps kids anticipate any changes . <h> 7 . Reduces anxiety <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids do n't always know what comes next , causing anxiety . However , as pointed out above , visual schedules ease transitions . As a result , anxiety can be reduced too . <h> 8 . Provides independence <p> Kids can check the visual schedule when they want and move onto the next task by themselves by referencing the schedule to see what comes next . Also , visual schedules reduce the need for students to ask teachers or parents what they can do next or what time a particular activity is happening at . They can simple check the schedule independently . <h> 9 . Builds self-esteem <p> Since visual schedules allow children to develop responsibility and independence , kids ' self-esteem can also be strengthened . Kids can see the progress they make by checking off things on the visual schedule and feeling a sense of accomplishment. <h> 10 . Plays to the strengths of kids with autism <h> 11 . Allows change to be introduced easily <p> A new task or activity can easily be introduced into a visual schedule by placing it between two items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new change visually and where that change takes place , they can adapt better to those changes . See benefit #6 for more information about this benefit . <h> 12 . Available for referencing throughout the day <p> Many kids with autism and/or hyperlexia struggle retaining and/or comprehending verbal information . Using a visual schedule at home or in the classroom allows for these kids to check the schedule whenever they want , without having to rely on memory of what was spoken to them earlier . Visual schedules are not fleeting like language is. 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 
@@23062064 @3062064/ <h> Thursday , April 27 , 2017 <p> When I first starting writing about hyperlexia , I was hesitant to explain what hyperlexia was because , to be honest , I was n't sure I completely understood what it was . Yet , as soon as I looked up hyperlexia , I knew , without a doubt , that that is what my son has . <p> Yet , after reading various articles about hyperlexia and its signs , I 've come to the conclusion that there is one thing missing from that list .

They 'll gracefully glide their fingers through the air as if conducting some grand symphony , scribbling out words or math problems or maybe some country 's name . <p> I can fondly recall many times watching in awe as J would scribble his thoughts in the air or on his leg . Sometimes I would catch him off guard by saying what he wrote and he would instantly light up . <p> Other times , I would have difficulty deciphering his air messages and ask him about what he was writing . Sometimes he would tell me . And other times , he would quickly air erase his message , giggle , and say , " Oh nothing . " <p> It appears J is not alone in this air writing .

He could n't honestly be reading , could he ? <p> So I started spelling random words before him and he would read them back to me time and time again . <p> I remember thinking , wow , this kid is really something special . <p> And he is , but as he grew older and other issues started appearing , I started seeing a gap between his amazing ability to read and his speech . <p> I searched and searched , to no avail .

It was his security item ! " We had similar experiences as J would play and carry around letters everywhere he went . His security item was an English/Spanish ABC flashcards book that he carried everywhere ( until it was beyond recognizable ) ! <p> 2 . Significant difficulties with verbal language <p> Kids with hyperlexia struggle with verbal language , both understanding it and speaking it themselves .

I do n't recall him really regressing , but after speaking with other families , they did notice a period of regression with their children during this time . For instance , Chelsey shared in our hyperlexia support group that her son " regressed at 18 months and lost all of his words , except for numbers , by 2 years of age . " <p> 4 . Awkward social skills <p> Hyperlexic kids are awkward socially , which is n't surprising since most of these kids also receive an autism diagnosis alongside the hyperlexia label .

@@23062067 @3062067/ <h> Monday , June 20 , 2016 <p> As I continue to dive deeper into the ABCs of hyperlexia series , I am amazed and surprised by how many subtle characteristics of hyperlexia other parents can relate to , the characteristics that you likely wo n't find on a hyperlexia fact sheet . For instance , I recently mentioned how my son J gives a canned response of " I do n't know " when answering a WH question in this conversation skills post and it turns out it might be kind of common with these kids . Many parents in my support group told me that their hyperlexic children do it too ! How interesting ! <p> I remember when I first blogged about my son 's hyperlexia that a huge hyperlexia advocate , Dr. Treffert , reached out to me and told me how valuable it was to listen to parents of hyperlexic children because we are the experts . At the time , I hardly felt like an expert on anything , but I can see what he means . Us parents of hyperlexic children have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hyperlexia looks like . So in preparation for this post , I reached out to fellow hyperlexic parents to find out more about what their kids are fasincated by . <p> It 's no secret that kids with hyperlexia have an intense fascination with letters , numbers , logos , maps , or visual patterns . <p> But what do those fascinations look like in daily life ? <p> And what do those fascinations turn into ? <p> And what other things do these kids become fascinated with ? <h> The Intense Fascinations of Kids with Hyperlexia <p> I think for most parents of hyperlexic children the first thing they notice is the intense fascination with letters . These kids look for them everywhere , point them out everywhere , play with alphabet toys constantly , and turn practically every object possible into a letter . Here are some examples of how this fascination with letters plays out in day-to-day life : <p> Looking at license plates and reading and/or tracing the letters and numbers on the plates <p> Watching all of the credits at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie itself <p> Playing with alphabet magnets constantly and arranging them into alphabetical order or writing words <p> Singing ABCs both forwards and backwards <p> Preferring to watch TV and movies with the closed captions or subtitles turned on <p> Reading signs around the neighborhood and/or tracing the letters on the signs if within reach <p> Making letters out of any material possible such as crayons , cars , rocks , sticks , etc . <p> Fonts - J loves to write in fun fonts , trace his fingers over fancy lettering , and even taught himself cursive handwriting in less than 20 minutes last summer . <p> Numbers quickly became the next fascination for my son with hyperlexia , but he also has hypernumeracy so obviously his fascination is really intense . And trust me , it is some days , but definitely not as intense as it was when he was about three years old ! Here 's how this intense fascination with numbers can look in these kids : <p> Calendar and important dates , such as holidays and birthdays - In fact , J usually reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Time and clocks , including learning to tell the time at an early age <p> Temperature and thermostats <p> Calculators - We never left the house for years without a calculator or two in our hands ! <p> Page numbers and table of contents - J never asks about the title of book . He always wants to know how many chapters and how many pages the book has ! <p> Large numbers like zillions , trillions , and all the way up to a googol <p> Counting to large numbers over and over <p> Counting backwards <p> Skip counting , forwards and backwards , at an early age <p> Money <p> Watching movies or TV with timers showing - J used to refer to movies that he wanted to watch by their total length in hours , minutes , and seconds versus saying the title of the movie . <p> Roman numerals <p> Dot-to-dots <p> Tally marks <p> Another fascination common in kids with hyperlexia is with maps and geography . These kids love to learn about countries , capitals , and more ! I suspect my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading at a super early age , he knew some of the most ridiculous facts and information about every single country in the world when he was little . Here are some of the topics that kids with hyperlexia often get fascinated with : <p> States/provinces and capitals <p> World capitals <p> Studying and reading atlases <p> Kids with hyperlexia also love to doodle . Like all the time . I 've shared some of our favorite doodling materials before , but J 's favorites have always been drawing with chalk , drawing on his Magna-Doodle , and doodling non-stop on paper . And actually , letting these kids doodle is a wonderful strategy to implement at home and/or in the classroom . <p> The periodic table is also extremely appealing to kids with hyperlexia . Why would n't it be with all of those letters and numbers all over it ? ! <p> Another fascination of kids with hyperlexia is space and planets . J absolutely loved learning everything he could about planets and space from about age 5 to 6 . He would create constellations and planets out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cold each planet is with their temperatures . <p> I also polled other parents of hyperlexic children in my Facebook support group about their children 's intense fascinations and here were a few other topics that came up : <p> Mazes <p> Checklists <p> Flashcards <p> Polygons and shapes in general <p> Building signs <p> Logos <p> Atoms <p> Human body parts <p> Encyclopedia type books <p> Traffic lights <p> Famous people like presidents or composers <p> Fruits and vegetables - Chelsey shared how her son possesses " an encyclopedic memory of each and every one from around the world . He still likes to carry fruit everywhere and will often sneak it in to bed so he can cuddle it throughout the night . " <h> How to Use These Fascinations to Help Kids with Hyperlexia <p> Sometimes it seems these kids can get stuck on one topic for a long time and I know how tiresome it can be to hear about the same things over and over again . Trust me , there are days when I cringe a bit when I hear J say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I hear it approximately eleven billion times per day . Or how he lives and breathes all things traffic light related . But here 's the thing ... I will never ever try to discourage his fascinations . They are the key to engaging and connecting with him . I have already talked about how important obsessions in autism are for that reason . <p> So how does that translate into everyday life ? <p> Well , here are a few things that I have done using J 's fascinations : <p> To encourage him to eat his lunch at school , I use a lunch box with a chalkboard in it . He can feel free to doodle if he likes , but I use it as a checklist of his lunch . I always write the menu down for him in order of importance . He always eats the food in the order it is presented in the checklist . Then he checks off the item once he finishes eating it . <p> J goes through periods of time where he is absolutely terrified of bath time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have solved our bath time troubles ( at least for now ! ) by handing him a translucent ruler and telling him to measure the bath water . Once it reaches the desired measurement , then I shut the water off . So we do n't have bath time at our house we have 5 inch baths or 3 inch baths . <p> To encourage my son to tell me about his school days , I ask him to list three things he did during the day instead of asking him a WH question . He loves lists so much that he is always motivated by them ! <p> Read books and come up with activities based around their fascinations . For instance , to tap into J 's fascination with traffic lights , we do traffic light activities such as this suncatcher craft . <p> When J started kindergarten , he still struggled with getting dressed by himself . Not because he did n't know how , but because he would not be motivated to do it . So I fixed that issue by timing him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 15 seconds or his shirt on in less than 30 seconds . Works awesome ! And works great for almost anything he resists wanting to try . A point system also works well ! I like to give him random points for trying new things and new foods . <p> The bottom line is this ... use their fascinations to encourage exploration of new topics or to work on new skills . Use them to develop social skills or speech or any other area that they may be struggling with . Use their unique ability to their advantage . <p> And always embrace their quirkiness . Our kids are incredible ! 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

@@23062071 @3062071/ <h> Sunday , April 12 , 2015 <p> Well , that is a question that I first asked myself back in November when my son was first diagnosed with it . Since that time , I have been busy trying to learn as much about hyperlexia as I can . When I first wrote about my son 's hyperlexia , I did n't feel like I had an adequate grasp on the concept . Sure , I knew what it looked like . But I really did not feel confident in my ability to define it . I 'm definitely still learning about hyperlexia and will continue to do so , but as I share more and more photos on Instagram , it has become evident that other people are fascinated by hyperlexia and would like to learn more too . <p> Most people are n't aware of what hyperlexia is , let alone that there are potentially three types of hyperlexia . Gee , I did n't know myself until November . So I will describe hyperlexia in detail , including the signs of hyperlexia and the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printables on hyperlexia as well . <p> By following some of the Facebook groups on hyperlexia ( see the resources here for more information ) , I have discovered that there is one other unique sign that does n't seem to be listed anywhere . I refer to it as " air writing . " My son loves to use his fingers to draw letters and write words in the air , on the table , and even on my leg . It looks like imaginary writing , but when I catch him doing it , I always ask , " What are you writing ? " And he always gives me a specific word , number , or math question that he was writing . If you watch closely enough , then you can actually see him writing the shapes of those letters . Perhaps that 's why I love this quote so much . It fits with my son 's hyperlexia perfectly . <p> Three types of hyperlexia have been proposed by Dr. Treffert . Type I is the bright , neurotypical children who learn to read early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have hyperlexia as " a splinter skill . " That 's where my son falls . Type III includes children who read early , do not fall on the autism spectrum , and show autistic-like symptoms that they eventually outgrow . For further information on the three types of hyperlexia , I suggest reading this thorough article . <p> When I first began researching hyperlexia , I was surprised to learn about the possibility of three types of hyperlexia . In particular , I became fascinated with the third type . I believe my son truly falls into this category because he has had autistic-like traits that have disappeared ( such as flapping ) . I wonder if the psychologist who diagnosed him is even aware of these three types . Regardless , my son 's diagnoses place him as Type II and we , of course , are embracing it as such . 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <h> 6 comments : <p> What 's important about Dr. Treffert 's " 3 types " paper , I think , is to realize that a lot of kids with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , and affectionateness are some encouraging signs that they will have an easier road . Whether to call this autism or what , I do n't know . <p> For what it 's worth , I think I seemed sort of like " hyperlexia 1 " as a child and my son seemed sort of like " hyperlexia 3 " but I 'd generally feel that we also meet modern autism criteria and that there were/are social skills issues worth addressing for us . <p> I take Dr. Treffert 's " 3 types " paper with a grain of salt . It 's one theory by one person . There 's no research in the paper ; it 's anecdotal impression from kids he 's worked with . While that 's interesting and I 'm glad to read the paper , it 's not the same as research that can be reproduced by someone else . Rather than " there are three types of hyperlexia " I would say " one person has theorized that there are three types of hyperlexia . " There 's no official definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types . : - ) <p> Every paper that uses the term " hyperlexia " has to include the working definition they made up for their research purposes . It is n't like autism which has an official DSM meaning ( vague and problematic as that official meaning is , at least it exists ) . <p> I think Dr. Treffert 's paper is outside of the current clinical mainstream because he says that autism-like is distinct from autism , and draws bright lines among the types . The more common way to describe autism traits fading is to talk about " optimal outcome " for autism ; there are a couple studies that use the phrase " optimal outcome " for kids whose autistic traits fade over time . There are also studies like this one about " Six developmental trajectories characterize children with autism " : LONG ... where some of the trajectories involve fading traits . I think it would also be more common these days to believe that autism shades into typical on a continuum , and that there 's no bright line between autism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Treffert mentions for hyperlexia 3 mentioned elsewhere as " positive signs " in autism . Reading , **30;0;TOOLONG behavior , and intelligence are all signs that a child will have an easier time and that autistic traits will be less disabling . However , I think it 's sort of a matter of how you choose to look at it whether this means it is n't autism , or whether it means that it 's autism that has been compensated for by strengths , or I 'm sure there are other ways to look at it . <p> The definition of autism is super problematic in its own right ( see LONG ... for example ) , so layering hyperlexia types over it gets messy . <p> I think you raise some very valid points and I will have to change my wording in a few spots in the post because I do agree with you that I should write about the three types being a theory . <p> But at the same time , you are implying that anecdotal evidence has no merit . I think having anecdotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone to doing further research on the topic . However , research on hyperlexia is challenging in of itself because of the limitations on finding research participants , especially if researchers are wanting to target a specific age range with hyperlexia . So I do think anecdotes are important to gaining a better understanding of what hyperlexia is , what it looks like , and whether there really are three types . And since Dr. Treffert has experience working with a group of children with hyperlexia , then I trust his professional opinion . My personal experience with hyperlexia is obviously quite limited so I appreciate his insights . <p> I will have to look out for this " optimal outcome " phrase . That 's the first I have heard of it so I am happy to go and do some research on this topic . Thanks ! <p> Again , thank you for all of your comments . You have raised some important points . I appreciate the feedback ! <p> Hello to you , i have a 3,6 y son , diagnosed at 2,3 y as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal , lot of meltdows , hand flapping , tip toe walking , sensitive isques ( auditiva and tatcile ) and a lot of asd carcteristics . A month later he started his first words , few days Before we were schedule for starting our early intervencion programam based on ABA ( aplyed behaviors analisys ) , for my surprise , less than 15 days of his first words he just started to read some words at 2,5 y , them i just realized that he was identifying and obssesed by letters and number many months after that , he could n't verbalize it but he used to point for me on his iPad a to a letters and number 1 to 100 , without talking . <p> I emailed his doctors and therapists right away , it was february 2014 , but they said that it happened sometimes on the spectrum and i did n't  have to worry , that there was nothing else different to do . <p> Ok , i just relaxed and wait , in june 2014 , i started to worry about it , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea or age to know and some foreign words ( english , we are brazilians and speak portuguese ) he know the entre alphabet in portuguese and english , just playing with his iPad . Than i started to Google it ant hyperlexia come to the screen , very few articles and information , and i discovered that the main information site AHA ( american hyperlexic association ) no longer exists . <p> Well i started to dig it , because my son was improving with the therapy and i could not bellieve that he was on autism spectrum , so , like i did with asd i tried to look for cient+fic papers , not blogs or opinions , i came across D. Traffert paper and emailed him right away , he was just very polite and helpful and told me about his theory by the experience . I found very interesting , felt that my son fita type III , but not enough . Next step was to find information about Phyllis Kupperman , that in the question and experience in HYPERLEXICS therapy , is undoubtedly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that was even more helpful , and since then have contact with me ( july 2014 ) helping me and even providing some material that allows parents that go to Csld his speech therapy center . <p> although I think the Dr Traffort article is one of the most direct and accessible on Hyperlexia , I think everyone should know a researcher who has many articles on the subject and on subtypes has not an opinion but a scientific research , Dr. Noel Kok Hwee Chia , from Singapore , published in 2009 in the Journal of the American Academy of Special Education Professionals a summary of 32 pages of his survey of 53 children which included hyperlexics with and without ASD and dyslexics , is by far the best and most complete research on hyperlexia I read , ranging from the ability to read and understand by age group and to the IQ of each , in addition it does a passage by virtually all existing literature on Hyperlexia , even before this name in 1967 from the Silberberg research . Follow the link when you click the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG ... <p> he added more subtypes on his research , and its not a opinion this is scientific evidence of those in groups with different developmental delay conditions , there are differences in the frames of Hyperlexia and skills , that can be grouped on this subtypes or types that Treffert sugest . <p> I came across that research from Dr. Noel Kok Hwee Chia recently , but have not had the chance to read his papers yet . I have it on my to do list , so I 'm definitely bumping that up further on my list . Thanks for the reminder to read those . And thank you so much for your comments ! <p> Confession : I was reading through your blog and browsing your Instagram all last night . Your Emmett definitely seems to fit the description of hyperlexia . I can only imagine the sense of relief you are feeling at discovering hyperlexia !

It is because I let down my guard down and missed the signs . I then also remembered that I had forgotten the essential oils that day . If I had remembered the oils , then things may have ended differently . I know they would have ended differently . <p> Yes , essential oils have become that important to our daily rhythm . <p> Ever since my son 's diagnosis in November of 2014 , I have gathered a set of tools that help him to have better days : a visual schedule , social stories , fidgets , oral motor sensory tools , and homemade sensory tools . But prior to his assessment , I dabbled and experimented with essential oils for our family and they had such a positive impact on our daily life , that I was instantly converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippy ! <p> Essential oils have become an integral part of our daily life . As such , I thought I would share what I think are the best essential oils for autism . The essential oils on this list would also be great for any child with sensory processing issues . Actually , for any child in general . 17101 @qwx217101 <p> Just to be clear , I am not a trained aromatherapist . I am just passionate about essential oils because they have worked for my family . The information presented here is merely an introduction to the topic of using essential oils to reduce anxieties , improve sleep , and calm meltdowns in autistic individuals and is not meant to replace traditional medical advice . It is also , by no means , thorough . <h> Why Essential Oils for Autism ? <p> There are many reasons why you might be considering using essential oils with your autistic child , including : <p> Looking for practical solutions to use on a daily basis and without a big time commitment <p> Want to have some tools that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The list could go on and on . Our decision to try essential oils was based on a few factors . First , we were faced with the first of many wait lists and needed something that we could try right away . We were also hoping it would help with my son 's anxiety and sensory issues , while helping him to better regulate his emotions . <p> The upfront cost of using essential oils can be as much or as little as you 'd like . And the oils and supplies that you get will last you a long time , like years . <p> Essential oils can be used every day unlike other therapies where you have an appointment scheduled once a week or once or month . There is also no huge time commitment . Simply apply or diffuse as needed . <p> You can also take essential oils with you everywhere you go . I always keep a roller bottle with our DIY essential oil blend in my purse . <h> Which Essential Oils are Good for Autism ? <p> This list of essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as we find new favorites . There are plenty of essential oils that may be beneficial to kids who have autism and sensory processing issues , but these are our absolute go-to oils ! These essential oils are what we have found to be the most helpful and effective for my son who has autism and sensory issues . <p> Vetiver - Of all the oils on this list , vetiver is my favorite and the most important . Vetiver has a sedative quality that can help sedate emotional outbursts such as anger , anxiety , and hysteria . It calms the nervous system and stabilizes emotions . I like to apply vetiver , diluted with a carrier oil , to the base of the neck and the base of the spine . I think vetiver was the first oil I ever tried with my son and saw immediate results . <p> Texas Cedarwood - This oil has a soothing and calming effect on the mind , helps with sleep , and helps to balance emotions . <p> Frankincense- An effective sedative , frankincense lowers anxiety , anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sense of peace and calm . <p> Lavender- Lavender is great for promoting sleep and for reducing anxiety and stress . A must have oil ! <p> Happy Kids Blend- A blend of lime , tangerine , cardamom , and benzoin , the Happy Kids Blend is seriously the most amazing smelling essential oil blend that I 've ever encountered . More importantly , it is an uplifting scent that keeps my kids ... well ... happy . Just like the bottle 's label says . I like to diffuse it at home during the day and add it to our DIY calm &amp; focused child blend . <p> Other Oils to Try <p> There are lots of other essential oils that may be good for autism , including the following . We have not yet incorporated these particular oils into our routine , but I 'm sharing them in case you are interested in exploring them further . <p> Ylang Ylang - This essential oil strengthens the nervous system , making it great for relieving stress , anger , and anxiety . <p> Bergamot - This essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stress . It would be a lovely oil for kids with autism. 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <p> I 'm trying to find the right oil to try with my oldest . First time user , here . My oldest was diagnosed with Disruptive Behavioral issues , EDS ( Ehlers Danlos Syndrome , Connective tissue disorder that also aids in developmental delays , bruises easy , cuts open easy , will always be in pain for the rest of his life as he gets older ) , Global Developmental Delays , Borderline Autistic . He definitely has anger issues , screaming bouts , and ADHD . Have n't had his tested for Bipolar or for any mood disorders . <p> We refuse to go to medication , and truly want to try essential oil , but it can be costly , especially those level marketing companies . I 'm looking for a company that is pocket and budget wise , but at the same time , do its job . Anyway you could help ? ? <p> Yeah cost is just one of the reasons I avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have heard really great things about Rocky Mountain Oils as well . So you could try one of those brands to start since they are cheaper than Young Living or DoTerra . As for the right oil to try first , I always suggest lavender because it is so versatile and easy to use : add a few drops to bath water , put a drop on a cotton ball and put it inside his pillow for sleep , mix it with coconut oil and make a massage lotion , etc . Vetiver , mandarin orange , and texas cedarwood are other good ones for calming emotions . Actually all three combined together smell amazing ! Hope that helps ! <p> I have a seven year old son with autism non-verbal and I 'm new at the essential oils . I have heard about it from Autism Conferences I have attended out of town , but until one parent from my son Horse Therapy told me that she uses essential oils on her nine year old son and has been amazed with the positive changes . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils that you advise in your website from that brand ; Aura Cacia on Amazon ( I 'm Prime Amazon Lover ) but i was reading from your other replies that you find the essential oils more better in using it with a diffuser , than body contact . I 'm little bit confuse I have heard from other parents that they use the rollerball essential oil to their children in their back of their neck and also in the spine ? I wanted to ask what will you advise as a parent ? Thank you for your blog.I will like to mention that I also tried the diffuser with Lavender at night two hours before my son will go to sleep , and I noticed a calmness but also attentive and alert.I also purchase the book that you informed on your blog about essential oils and read everything ( GREAT BOOK ! THANK YOU ) <p> Spine and neck are wonderful and I use a calming body spray on those locations regularly , usually on school days . I just prefer the diffuser because it 's easy . Absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It really just comes down to personal preference . <p> Hello , thought I would share my experience with what has worked for my son so far . We are only about 6 months in to using EOS and I also stay away from the MLMs mainly because of the price . I did lots of researched alot before making my first purchase and I decided to go with Edens Garden as well Aura Cacia since I can get lavender , Tea Tree &amp; Eucalyptus at my grocery story in that brand . Thank God for these smaller/direct companies without them I would have never gotten into the world of essential oils . Anyways my son is almost 5 and I started out with using just Lavender &amp; Cedarwood however the lavender seemed to have the opposite effect on him which I later read is pretty common . I still use it for him but only when it is in a blend of several oils . He has done GREAT with Vetiver , Cedarwood &amp; Ylang Ylang . Lately he s done so good at night with the combo I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden called Good Night &amp; Relaxation and I also add Vetiver making it a combo of those 3 . I recently tried a new combo to use before school to help him focus and be calm at school and that was a combo of Mandarin , cedarwood , lavender , Bergamot , vetiver &amp; Petitgrain . I just started that so do n't  have any opinion on how it works yet ! My son goes to bed good on his own but the oils help get tired earlier . I apply them about a half hour to an hour before Im ready for him to go to sleep . I also use that blend if he has any tantrums or if he gets hyper and I swear within 15 minutes he s calmed down . He is very low on the spectrum and high functioning , alot of people cant tell he has it . Its almost like he has autism just a little bit If that was possible . But the oils work forsure , I use them on myself and my three children . They have done wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils with your little ones Mommies , I hope they work as well for you as they do for me ; ) <p> We use a similar homemade blend of mandarin orange , cedarwood , lavender , vetiver , and frankincense every single day and it makes the difference between a good day and a bad day . I have never heard of petitgrain , so I am going to research that particular essential oil . Bergamot is a new favorite to me , mostly because I LOVE how it smells on its own . <p> I also came up with the perfect bedtime blend for our diffuser about a month ago . It smells heavenly and has dramatically improved sleep for my boys ( especially paired with our Himalayan salt lamp ! ) . I hope to write about it on the blog soon ! <p> I 'm so glad I stumbled onto your blog . I am also a full-time mom and teach piano lessons ! My friend just had a Young Living fb party . While it was very informative , I chose not to purchase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and learn as much as I can before jumping into anything ( plus it 's pricy ) . I started to wonder if essential oils could be helpful for my 10 yr old who was diagnosed with autism 1 year ago . He functions very highly but struggles with anxiety , focus , and sometimes trouble sleeping . He is not currently on any medication and I 'd like to avoid if possible . There is so much information out there that it 's quite overwhelming . Right now we 're dealing with some anxiety about going back to school . He 's more irritable and having a harder time going to sleep at night . Does it matter if you diffuse the oils or apply to the skin ? Does one method have more benefit than the other ? Thanks ! <p> We currently use the oils for the same things that you mention : anxiety , focus , and sleep time . I really like the website learningabouteos.com and I suggest reading through their website carefully as the writer is a certified aromatherapist . You can likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each method of application ( diffusing or applying directly to skin ) has different results and benefits .

She is 13 years old now . As she 's getting older , her symptoms got worse . She is angry , sometimes violent . My friend as very tight budget , so I 'd like to make the blend she can try . Your blend seems to have everything I 'd like to use . Could you please give me the ratio you use ?

@@23062084 @3062084/ <h> Thursday , October 13 , 2016 <p> I 've mentioned many times that J is an avid chewer , frequently chewing through what are supposedly the toughest chew necklaces in just a matter of hours or days . We 've definitely tried a variety of chewies and necklaces over the years , so , at this point , I feel like we are experts on chewelry . <p> I also get asked all the time for suggestions on the best chew options for oral motor sensory seekers , like J. So here are our top picks and favorites for the best chew necklaces for kids who chew on everything . <p> One reason I love this set of necklaces is because of the price . They are so affordable ! I also love that they do n't have clasps because , let me be honest , J ends up chewing on clasps and breaking them all the time . But the main reason I love these necklaces for J is that they are indestructible . They show no wear and seem next to impossible to chew through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year and they have stood up to his avid chewing . <p> Now for the downsides ... They are not good for kids with long hair . Hair can easily get tangled in them . Not a problem for us since J has super short hair . <p> The other negative is that J spends a lot of time fidgeting and playing with these necklaces while he chews on them . He stretches them around his body . Not a huge issue , except for when he is sitting on , say , the school gym floor during assemblies and the necklace is constantly touching the floor . Gross , right ? But as long as this necklace stays around his neck or in his mouth , we have had no issues with these necklaces . <p> This chew necklace has lasted forever at our house ! There is no texture to this necklace and the long narrow shape of it is perfect for kids who like to really chew with their back molars . <p> I love that ARK 's chew necklaces come in a variety of toughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I do , then you will definitely want to purchase the extra extra tough version . I do n't , however , recommend the textured chew necklaces for avid chewers . They did not hold up at all for us , but the plain , smooth ones are definitely fantastic ! <p> We have multiple colors of these cookie chewies and I must admit that I was hesitant at first about them . They are bulky , so definitely not discreet . However , I was more concerned about the texture of these cookies since J , in the past , has chewed textured bits off some of the extra extra tough chewies in less than 24 hours . So the fact that J has n't destroyed any of these cookies in the almost 12 months that we 've had them is astounding . And we have like four of them ! <p> The white band around the cookie ( the cookie 's stuffing ) does get pulled off all the time . J has n't chewed through it yet , but if anything were to get broken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it could easily be removed if you think your child may chew right through it . 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 
@@23062085 @3062085/ <h> Tuesday , March 29 , 2016 <p> My son with autism needs to keep his hands busy quite often . They 're always fidgeting or touching something . Or he has them in his mouth . So waiting in line or for appointments can be a bit of a challenge for him some days . Whenever we go out and about , my purse is usually filled with fidgets , chew necklaces , snacks , a calculator , and more . But sometimes they do n't cut it or sometimes I just bring my wallet and keys , leaving my purse at home . That 's when I usually need to suggest one of these easy hand games for kids to keep his hands busy . <p> These hand games are great boredom busters and brain break ideas for kids with autism , SPD , or ADHD . However , all kids will love them ! The best part is that these games require nothing more than two sets of hands , making them the perfect games for on the go ! <p> All ten of these games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just their hands to play . No fancy materials required ! They 're perfect to play with fidgety kids while waiting in line , waiting at the doctor 's office , riding in a shopping cart , etc . They make great boredom buster activities while out and about or great brain breaks while at home or in school . <p> 1 . Hand Stacking Games <p> You can play this game with as many kids as you 'd like . Simply take turns stacking a hand on top of the other person 's hand higher and higher . Whoever 's hand is on the bottom of the stack goes next . Keep stacking hands until you can no longer reach the top . <p> You can also play the game backwards . The hand on top of the stack goes next and adds their hand to the bottom of the stack . <p> Or try stacking your two hands at the same time , alternating turns with the other player(s) . <p> 2 . Fist Stacking Games <p> Similar to the hand stacking games , you can stack your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacking their fists higher and higher . Again , the fist at the bottom of the stack goes next and play continues until you ca n't reach any higher . <p> You can also try playing the game backwards by stacking downwards . Or try stacking your two fists at the same time ( just stack your own fists on top of each other ) . <p> 3 . Secret Handshakes <p> My kids became obsessed with secret handshakes quite a few months ago and they are such a fun hand game to play ! You can either come up with your own secret handshakes or try some of the ones found in these awesome videos . Our personal favorites are ice cream , the big A , jazzy jeff , and the lumberjack . You can also find these secret handshake videos on my brain break videos for kids playlist on YouTube . <p> 4 . Rock , Paper , Scissors <p> No list of hand games for kids would be complete without rock , paper , scissors . Pretty sure this game does n't need any explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3 , 4 , I declare a thumb war ! " Simply link same hands together in a fist with the other player and have your thumbs wrestle . The first one to pin the other 's thumb wins ! <p> 6 . High Five Games <p> One person holds up one or both hands in different positions and encourages the other person to give them a high five ( or high ten ) . Possible positions include a high five , low five , high ten , low ten , one hand high and one hand low , two hands really far apart , crisscross high tens , or crisscross low tens . Be creative and see if you can come up with different positions ! Do n't forget to try " down low ... too slow ! " <p> When I play these high five games with my kids , I try to do them rapidly . As soon as they high five or high ten , I switch to a new position . And usually the more ridiculous positions the better as it really gets them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten where I stretch both of my hands out as far as possible . Obviously , my kids can not reach both hands at the same time since they 're still little , so they end up laughing hysterically when I do that . <p> 7 . Stella , Ella , Ola <p> We play the two player version of this game , the same one that I played as a little girl . Both players hold their left hands up and then join their right hands together . As you sing the song , you move the joint right hands back and forth , slapping against the left hands with the beat of the song . At the end , you have to try to slap the hand that lines up with the final word of the song while the owner of that hand has to avoid getting their hand slapped . The words that I sang as a child are different from what I could find on YouTube , but you could really make up any chant you want . <p> 8 . Multiplication Game <p> To play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paper , scissors . However , instead of picking rock , paper , or scissors , you display any number of fingers that you want ( anything from 0 to 10 ) . The other player picks a random number of fingers to display as well . Then you try to multiply the two numbers together as fast as you can . So if person A holds up five fingers and person B holds up two fingers , then you have to shout ten as fast as you can . This game is a hit with my six year old with hypernumeracy . <p> 9 . Addition Game <p> Similar to the multiplication game , except that you add the fingers together . We usually call this game " 1 , 2 , 3 , add ' em up ! " So if person A holds up two fingers and person B holds up all ten , then you have to shout twelve as fast as you can . This game is a hit with my six year old with hypernumeracy . <p> 10 . Hand Slap Game <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other player places their hands with palms facing down and hovering slightly above the other person 's hands . The player with their hands on the bottom tries to pull their hands out and gently slap the top of the other player 's hands , while that player tries to move their hands out of the way before getting slapped . The key is to slap gently ! <p> 11 . Sign Language Spelling <p> If your kids know some sign language , then you can ask them to spell words using alphabet signs . I taught both of my kids how to sign when they were babies , a skill that came in handy with my hyperlexic son 's speech delays , so every so often we like to play this game to keep our ASL signs in tip top shape ! 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

I , too , was once overwhelmed with all of the possibilities and that was before I even used Pinterest to find sensory ideas for my kids ! <p> Regardless of whether you are new to sensory play or not , I want sensory play to be stress-free for you and fun for your child . So here are my sensory play tips that will help you and your child get the most out of sensory bins , while minimizing messes. 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Tips for Making the Most Out of Sensory Bins <p> Here are my tips for making the most out of sensory bins with your child : <h> 1 . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious , I know , but it is the most important , especially if your child is a baby , toddler , or young preschooler . Many sensory bin materials present choking hazards so I can not stress enough that you should supervise your children while they are playing with a sensory bin . Always . <h> 2 . Take sensory play outdoors <p> If you anticipate things getting messy , then take the sensory bin outdoors . You can always use the hose for easy cleanup. <h> 3 . Start with something simple <p> I think one of the first sensory bin materials that we tried out with J was water beads . I literally offered him a container of water beads and some scoops . It was super simple and stress-free for both of us . It was n't overwhelming with the bells and whistles of some of our other sensory bins that we have done over the years , but sensory bins were new to him and to I at the time . So if you are new to sensory play , then start simple . Plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to start . <h> 4 . Set basic rules for sensory play <p> Be sure to set some ground rules for your child when they are playing with a sensory bin . For instance , if it is something that is inedible , then be sure to let your child know that they should not put the objects in their mouths . Usually our only rule for sensory play is to keep the materials limited to the bin and the shower curtain splat mat we use underneath the sensory bin . <h> 5 . Use a splat mat <p> A splat mat is a must for us ! It helps to contain the mess and makes clean up so much easier . You can use a sheet , tablecloth , shower curtain , or traditional splat mat . We personally use white shower curtains because my parents own a motel and gave us a bunch of retired shower curtains . They are waterproof too , making them perfect for water based sensory bins too . If they get dirty , then no worries . Simply toss it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time you need it . <h> 6 . Embrace the mess and prepare for cleanup <p> When I first started introducing sensory play to my kids , I really struggled with the messiness factor . However , I slowly became more comfortable with it . Establishing sensory play rules and using a splat mat are two simple ways to contain the mess . I also like to keep baby wipes , a bowl of water , vacuum , towels , etc. ( it really depends on what sensory bin fillers are being used ) handy for easy cleanup. <h> 7 . Play alongside your child <p> Bond with your child by joining in and playing alongside them , especially if they are a bit hesitant to try it out . Show them different ways that they can play or ask them to describe what they are doing as they play . <h> 8 . Pick materials that are suitable for your child 's age , abilities , and skills <p> This tip is super important . For instance , if your child is still mouthing objects , then avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or if you are wanting to encourage fine motor skills development , then offer materials that will help build those skills . <h> 9 . Consider your child 's interests <p> Take your child 's interests and make a themed sensory bin . It is one of the easiest ways to get your child interested in the sensory activity . <h> 10 . Consider your child 's sensory preferences <p> If your child is a sensory seeker or a sensory avoider , then it is important to consider these sensory preferences . <h> 11 . Dress accordingly <p> If things are apt to getting messy , then wear old clothes . Or , if the weather is appropriate , then wear a swimsuit and hose off after playtime. <h> 12 . Opt for washable coloring <p> I highly recommend using liquid watercolors instead of food coloring when it comes to dyeing sensory materials . Unlike food coloring , liquid watercolors are washable and will not stain clothing or skin . <h> 13 . Do activities that fit your space <p> If you are tight on space , then you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as doing sensory bins in the sink instead of a large container or using an under-the-bed storage container and storing all materials inside . Just simply slide the container under a bed when not in use . <h> 14 . Reuse sensory bin materials <p> Be sure to store sensory bin materials in an airtight container or zipper seal bags as many , if not most , sensory bin fillers can be reused over and over . 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

Or maybe it 's your child 's first year in school , which means you likely have even more work ahead of you ! Do n't worry . To ensure your child gets the support in school that they need , I have created a free printable hyperlexia handout for parents that can be given to your child 's teacher . <p> I 've also included some common classroom supports and accommodations for kids with hyperlexia that you can use as a guideline with your child 's school support staff to make sure that your child gets the help that they need . <h> Classroom Supports &amp; Accommodations for Kids with Hyperlexia <p> As a parent , the first step is to make sure your child 's teacher learns what hyperlexia is .

However , it is best to use their strength ( i.e. , their amazing ability to decode written language ) to their advantage .

He was also sometimes quite difficult to get to sleep because he would be so fidgety and fired up before bedtime . However , once he was asleep , he was asleep for the night . <p> So over the years , we have come up with a pretty solid list of sleep time strategies that work for him , as well as for our youngest son , K. The sleep strategies for kids with autism below are things that we do to target a variety of sensory systems : visual , olfactory , proprioceptive , tactile , and even oral motor . They address his specific sensory needs , which is why I think they are effective for him . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Sleep Strategies for Kids with Autism or Sensory Needs <p> These are the strategies that we use and implement for bedtime success . They work for us . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family , but instead , they may give you ideas of things to try . <p> 1 . Create a Bedtime Routine <p> We have a set routine that we follow for bedtime and it has been the same since my kids were newborns . I know this strategy seems like common sense , but I 'm always surprised to learn of families who do not have a regular bedtime routine . Our kids thrive on routine , as do many other kids , because it teaches them to know what comes next . There are no surprises . They know that sleep time follows reading books . <p> If it is bath night , then the routine is as follows : <p> Bath <p> Get dressed <p> Brush teeth <p> Go pee <p> Read books for about 30 minutes or until child falls asleep <p> Sleep time <p> If it is not bath night , then the routine is as follows : <p> Get dressed <p> Go pee <p> Wash face , hands , feet , etc. with a cloth <p> Brush teeth <p> Read books for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We also use an electric toothbrush to provide oral motor sensory input before bedtime as a way to reduce chewing on books or toys during the bedtime routine . <p> 2 . Use a Visual Schedule to Reinforce the Bedtime Routine <p> We do n't use our visual schedule as much as we used to when our kids were toddlers . The visual cues helped J tremendously when he was little , especially since our visual schedule used written words and pictures . You can grab a copy of the exact visual schedule that we use here . It is a free printable ! <p> Proprioceptive sensory input is calming for kids and can help energetic kids settle down into a slower rhythm . So if your kids are a bundle of energy before bed , then try squishing them with a body pillow , using a weighted blanket while reading , or encourage them to crawl under a lycra bedsheet ( see our DIY stretchy sheet tutorial ) while reading . <p> We have noticed a huge difference in J 's ability to settle during bedtime since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . He crawls underneath and the light pressure is enough to keep him from wiggling and fidgeting during story time . <p> We started off using Momo the Monkey sleep training clock and J used to carry that clock everywhere with him . He never did use it the way it was intended and it eventually it was dropped one too many times and would no longer open and close its eyes . <p> However , when we received Gro-Clocks one Christmas , J was more interested in using it to help him know when it was time to sleep . He still does n't use it as a visual aid for when it 's time to wake up though and likely never will since he 's such an early riser , but it has definitely been a great help for settling to sleep . <p> Again , this strategy is kind of obvious , but mentioning it because it is still important . We like to jump on a trampoline , go for a bike ride , or even go for a walk before we do our bedtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess energy before bed and really wear out the kids . The fresh air always helps them sleep soundly for the night . <p> When the kids are wound up before bed , even after some fresh air and exercise , sometimes they need a little extra help to settle down for the night . A bit of essential oils in the diffuser helps them settle down for the night and even helps them sleep better . You can do something as simple as a drop of lavender on a cotton ball and place it in their pillow case . Or you can try our DIY bedtime blend , which smells amazing ! 17095 @qwx217095 <p> This post is part of a monthly series called Parenting Children with Special Needs .

I wonder if you could consider trying the stretchy sensory bedsheet for the summer months ( I have a DIY tutorial for it ) , which would provide similar input , but is much lighter in terms of fabric and warmth . Otherwise , maybe you could try making a weighted lap cushion that he could have on his lap . Since it would only cover a small portion of his body , he should n't get too hot .

Having these sensory therapy tools and toys available at home is a great way to provide J with the sensory input that he needs , when he needs it . <p> We can also use these tools to help him build new skills and strategies in the comfort of our own home , saving us some money in the long run because we do n't have to book as many occupational therapy appointments . <p> Here is our favorite vestibular and proprioceptive sensory therapy tools and toys for doing therapy at home . I 've also included why we use each of these items and how we use them for doing therapy at home . <p> This list of vestibular and proprioceptive sensory therapy tools and toys are our must haves . We use a combination of DIY options and store bought items from this list and use the items for a variety of activities and ideas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own therapy at home program , then there are lots of things to consider .

You must also consider how much space you have to dedicate to this equipment . Finally , your child 's age and abilities are also important to consider . <p> So , in no particular order , here are what we use and love and why we include it in our home for therapeutic purposes . <p> Before we knew J had sensory issues or autism , I bought a mini trampoline as a way for him to burn off energy during our long winters . Jumping provides great proprioceptive sensory input and J has always been a proprioceptive sensory seeker . He would jump on beds , couches , or really anything that he could . The mini trampoline saves our couches from getting damaged . We do now have a large trampoline in our backyard as well , but the mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The exercise ball is a great thing for J to sit on while playing since he needs to constant move and wiggle .

With that kind of temperature , going outside to play was not going to be an option . So to burn off their excess energy , they spent hours hopping around on their hopper balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K loves ! <p> If there 's one thing that I splurge a lot on , it 's sensory swings . J is a vestibular sensory seeker and craves the swinging motion . So I have invested in a lot of sensory swings and have even made quite a few . <p> There are lots of different ways to use the sensory swings for therapy , but we usually use it to help with self-regulation , vestibular sensory input , and for increasing focus and attention . Seriously , start pushing your child in a swing and start up a conversation ! We always get amazing back and forth exchanges with J when he push him in a swing . <p> I seriously can not live without our gymnastic mats ! Thank goodness we have connections so we got these for an amazing price !

We also like to use these two types of tunnels together because J sometimes gets freaked out crawling through our homemade sensory tunnel . So I usually like to connect it to the IKEA tunnel to help keep the homemade sensory tunnel open for him to see through . <p> I considered weighted blankets for my son , but the price really was a big deterrent for me . Instead , I made our homemade stretchy sensory sheet for $15 and have had positive results . This bedsheet never leaves J 's bed , except for when it 's time to wash it . So our main use for it is sleep . <p> Scooters are great for providing vestibular sensory input and my boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestibular input while outdoors ! That 's really all we use our scooter for : outdoors as an alternative to walking or biking . <p> Okay , if you have not heard of a balance bike before , then listen up ! Balance bikes are AMAZING !

No training wheels were ever required in this household and my back was never sore from having to bend over and help them balance . <p> So skip the training wheels and tricycles and get a balance bike instead . You wo n't be sorry that you did ! <p> We no longer use our balance bikes as both boys ride regular bikes now , but we used them from ages 2-4 for both boys .

One of the benefits for nursing mothers , that stands out for me , is a decreased risk for ovarian cancer . Ovarian cancer . Two very simple words with a huge impact , at least for me . I have seen what ovarian cancer can do to a person and their family . So if I can decrease my odds against the disease , I will . Here is why ... <p> Today marks five years since my aunt lost her battle with Ovarian cancer . Sure , I am incredibly sad , but at the same time I am proud and humble . She was like my second mother , especially during the summer when I worked 6 hours away from my own parents . She treated me like her own daughter . She was an incredible person . Overly direct sometimes , but still someone I admired . Someone I loved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She was always there for me . When I was younger , she used to send me beautiful journals at Christmas to encourage my love of writing . She also helped me and my husband get a mortgage together for our first house almost 8 years ago . While I attended Queen 's University , she was always an instant message away . We used to spend many hours chatting away on MSN Messenger ( BTW , I wonder , does anyone still use that anymore ? ) . I miss those conversations terribly . And she was one of the few people , other than my husband , to know that I was planning on transferring universities before I worked up the courage to tell my own parents of the decision ( Mom and Dad , if you are reading this , surprise ! ) . And , of course , she made sure I always had someone to talk to or a good meal or even a ride to my grandparents ' house when I lived and worked at the lake all summer . <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am particularly reflective today . I keep thinking about the last time I saw her . It was the weekend before she died and my mom , my husband , and I made a road trip to see her . My dad was already there with her , helping take care of her during those last few weeks . He had stressed to me that it would most likely be my last chance to see her since her condition was deteriorating rapidly . And he was right . She passed away two days after I last saw her . <p> My dad tried to prepare me as best he could for my visit with her because frankly , I used to be an emotional train wreck . Honestly , anything would make me cry . He warned me that she looked a lot different . I tried to brace myself for the worst . I remember when I tried to go into her bedroom to see her . I was not prepared at all . I saw her and absolutely panicked . I had to turn around . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfamiliar . I needed more time to prepare myself . I absolutely hate that my first reaction was to turn around . And I am sure it would have been heart breaking for her to see my reaction , which I am not sure if she did or not . My dad stopped me . Hugged me . He reminded me that she was still who I remembered . He probably made a stupid corny joke too . I do n't really remember . I just remember that minutes later I went into the room , determined to get past the shock and fear I was feeling . Soon , we were chatting and things seemed almost normal for a bit . <p> The next night after having supper , she wanted to see me . Just me . I did n't know what to expect , but I knew I had to tell her the most important things : one , that I loved her and two , I had to thank her for being , well , just her . She had her own agenda as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me the background behind it . I am embarrassed to say that I do n't remember anything she said to me . It is all a blur . And I do n't remember the background story for the ring at all ( I am sure my family will fill me in after reading this ) , but I remember what I was able to say to her and I remember how she made me feel during our last visit together . She made me feel loved and special . I knew how proud she was of me . I think it is that feeling alone that made her passing that much more manageable . <p> Looking back , I realize how fortunate I was to be able to tell a person everything you want to before they pass . I am grateful for that opportunity . It gave me closure , knowing that she knew how I felt and , in turn , how she felt . We exchanged our I love you 's and our goodbyes and never turned back . <p> Just two weeks ago I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the guestbook she made for my wedding . I forgot about the message she had written in the back . Just seeing her handwriting makes me tear up . <p> And do n't get me started on what hearing certain songs does to me . I was asked to play the piano for her funeral . I thought it would be impossible for me to follow through with her wish of me playing that day , but I did . However , the songs " Hallelujah " and " Bless the Broken Road " tug at my heartstrings . Every . Single . Time . <p> And then I thought I would have a difficult time when I helped to spread her ashes . I did n't . I was helping to set her free . <p> I have these random little reminders of her throughout my house , including the ring she gave me and the Dr. Seuss book with her handwriting in it that I found in a box of books my grandparents sent me . <p> I wish she was still here . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet my boys . <p> I miss our hilarious conversations and her helpful advice . <p> I think of how her struggle with ovarian cancer has taught me to take any necessary precautions to avoid that disease .

These strategies , as well as hundreds of others , can also be found in my Beyond the Letters book . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Mealtime Strategies for Kids with Hyperlexia and/or Autism <p> It is important to note that the strategies below are ones that we have personally tried and/or had success with at some point . They work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hopefully it can give you some new ideas to consider . <p> 1 . Let your children help with the meal planning , preparation , and/or cooking . They are more likely to eat what they picked out for lunch or supper if they are involved in the process . <p> 2 . Let your child assemble their meals with build your own supper ideas such as make your own pizza night or build your own salad night . <p> 4 . Keep food items separate to encourage kids to explore foods and textures at their own pace . Divided plates work great for this , but offering pasta sauce on the side , for example , can help kids to not get overwhelmed by combining sensory textures . <p> 7 . Offer utensils at every meal , even if they do n't end up using them . Gently encourage them to try using them too . See tip #12 about investing in alphabet cutlery too as a way to entice them to use utensils . <p> 8 . Model how to use utensils to cut food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social stories about current mealtime struggles from how to use utensils , trying new foods , not eating with your hands , cleaning up , washing up before eating , etc . <p> 10 . Sneak foods they do n't like into other items on the menu that they do like . I personally love to add things like hemp seeds , nuts , avocados , etc. to smoothies . Or I add extra veggies and puree them into pasta sauce . <p> 11 . Make letter and/or number shaped foods . Or if they are into planets , then make planets ! Basically , use their interests to entice them to eat their meals . Thank goodness for cookie cutters in basically any shape possible ! <p> 12 . Invest in some fun bowls , plates , cutlery , place mats , cups , or napkins that reflect their current interests . Ideas include : ABC plates , planet place mats , etc . Something similar to these alphabet dishes will work awesome ! <p> 13 . Make checklists of foods to eat during meals . Kids with hyperlexia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they eat as they go ! This strategy works really well for lunch boxes too ! Better yet , invest in a lunch box with a chalkboard . Here 's a pro tip : put the most important foods to eat first because guaranteed your child will eat things in the order they see them on the checklist . <p> 14 . Use a visual schedule to guide kids through the routine of mealtime from washing up , eating , cleaning up , and helping with dishes . <p> 15 . Write out what is expected of them . Kids with hyperlexia thrive with written visual instructions so do n't be afraid to write down explicitly what is expected of them like " use a fork to eat your pasta " or " stay seated while eating .

A big old blur of letters , singing the ABCs , and reading the same books over and over . He would sit for hours playing , organizing , and rearranging his different letter toys , while naming those letters out loud in the sweetest little toddler voice . Dubba-dubba ( what he would call the letter W initially ) was always my favorite to hear him say . That and his pirate-esque letter R sound . <p> Those days seem so long ago , yet I am thankful to relive those early moments of his letter fascination through videos . <p> A few months ago I began to wonder what other parents ' experiences were like during the toddler years .

Here 's the thing , though , hyperlexia seems to present itself differently for different kids , much like autism does . <p> When did you first notice your child 's interest in letters ? <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in books around the age of five months . He sat up independently unusually early at only 4 1/2 months old . It was around that time that he would spend hours upon hours sitting and quietly flipping through books of all sizes , including chapter books that I was reading . He flipped the pages so carefully too ! However , it was n't until he was about 18-19 months old that his interest in letters became fully apparent to us . <p> Here 's what other parents shared : <p> Amy : " 1 year old " <p> Olive : " 16 months of age " <p> Sarah : " Alex was 18 months when he grew incredibly fascinated with foam letters we had on a mat . He continued to show us the letters and started to say letters . He also loved reading Dr. Seusss ABCs and his first pointing was at the letters in the book .

" <p> Kirra : " My son Rylen was about two when I realised he was unusually fascinated with words on receipts , books and especially the credits on movies he would stand there after the movie finished and just watch the credits roll down , he showed more interest in them than in the movie itself ! " <p> Tonya : " When he was one he was so focused on the number 7 . By 18 mo he would have us count to him and sing ABC 's .

We tried " O " again . Then " T " again . We got adventurous and grabbed a " B " and were rewarded with a clear " B " . " <p> Annette : " By 18 months he loved to sing the alphabet .

" <p> Roslyn : " One day , when Zane was 18 months old and knew the sounds of the letters , we were walking through a vacant parking lot and he insisted on stopping , crouching down , and sounding out the letters " no parking " on the curb at the edge of the lot . " <p> Dhivya : " I noticed only 6 months back . He is almost 3 and a half now . He knew his numbers and letters a year or so back . " <p> What toys or books were your child 's favorites when you first noticed their interest in letters ? <p> Goodness , the book that was most loved in our house during this time period was Dr. Seuss ' ABCs .

@@23062139 @3062139/ <h> Sunday , June 05 , 2016 <p> Carrying a conversation with my son with hyperlexia is often short and sweet or , for a long time , it was nearly non-existent . Filled with speech errors , pronoun reversals , and echolalia , the conversational skills of kids with hyperlexia can be a bit awkward at times . So I 'm going to give you the low-down on what their speech skills look like during conversation . I 'm also sharing 10 tips for improving conversation skills in kids with hyperlexia. 17101 @qwx217101 <h> What Conversation with Hyperlexic Kids is Like <p> One of the biggest red flags for me when J was younger was the lack of conversation . When he was almost four and K was almost two , I could hold a better back and forth exchange with K than I could with J. And when I could get a little bit of a conversation going with J , it was echolalic in nature and usually ended quickly . <p> It was frustrating to know that my son who could read and spell practically anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept wondering why the huge disconnect ? Once I learned about hyperlexia , though , then it all made sense . <p> Keep in mind though there seems to be a lot of variance in the conversation skills of kids with hyperlexia , much like how autism is a spectrum . However , here are some typical features of a hyperlexic child 's speech and communication skills : <p> You can see why carrying on a conversation with a hyperlexic child would be difficult when there are all of these issues in their language skills . I will address a lot of these issues in further detail through The ABCs of Hyperlexia series , but I will give you some practical strategies to start implementing at home and/or in the classroom . <p> Now , J is obviously the only hyperlexic child that I have personally known and/or spoken with , so I wanted to include a separate section dedicated specifically to his speech skills . I 'm not entirely sure whether this unique characteristic is specific to hyperlexia or if it is specific to him , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait ( and research just has n't mentioned it yet ) . <p> One of the most recurring " issues " ( I use the word issues loosely here ) that we deal with is J 's canned response of " I do n't know . " Whenever J is asked a WH- question , he automatically responds with , " I do n't know . " Most people assume he genuinely does not know the answer , but that 's incorrect most of the time . I have to frequently remind all the teachers , family friends , and professionals in our life that J struggles with WH- questions and as a result , requires extra time to process the question . So when he answers immediately with " I do n't know , " it 's not that he does n't know the answer . It 's just that he needs a few extra seconds to process and comprehend what he was asked . So if you wait a few seconds after he responds with his canned response , then he does answer almost always with an appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself some time to process the question . <p> We are currently working on encouraging him to say phrases such as " let me think about that " or " give me a second to think " instead of his normal " I do n't know " response to avoid the confusion during conversation with others . <p> But until then , please give him those few extra seconds that he needs . <h> Tips for Improving Conversation Skills in Kids with Hyperlexia <p> **Please keep in mind that I am not a speech therapist . These tips and ideas are ones that we have had personal success with and/or I have learned about through my research on hyperlexia. ** <p> 1 . Give them time to respond . <p> First and foremost , give your kids a chance to respond ! Remember that WH- questions are particularly challenging for hyperlexic kids , so they may need the extra time to process what you were asking . <p> You 're more likely to get a conversation going with a hyperlexic child if you rephrase your WH- questions as a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , instead of asking , " What did you do at school today ? " , I could say , " Tell me three things you did at school today . " It 's way more effective ! You can use these free printables to practice basic questions and prompts : <p> Kids with hyperlexia have to be taught social and speech skills very specifically . So if you want them to be a good conversationalist , then you 'll need to teach them exactly what to say when someone asks them a question . You can write your own speech scripts for practically any situation . <p> For instance , today we set up a lemonade stand with my boys . Before we set up , we reviewed common questions and answers that they may encounter and practiced them . We practiced things such as : <p> " How much does a glass of lemonade cost ? " - " It costs $1 . " <p> " How are you going to spend the money that you make ? " - " I 'm going to buy Pokemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ) . <p> " I would like one cup of lemonade and one rice krispie square . How much would that cost ? " - " That would cost $2.50 . " <p> etc . <p> 4 . Practice knock-knock jokes . <p> This one may seem a bit unusual , but if you think about it , knock-knock jokes follow a predictable pattern and require two people interacting back and forth in order to make the joke work successfully . So even if the jokes are formulaic in nature , these kids learn to exchange words back and forth and even practice WH- questions , two skills important in having an actual conversation with another person . <p> 5 . Read books that use speech bubbles . <p> I 've discussed this topic before , specifically as it pertains to comprehension , but books such as Elephant &amp; Piggie books visually displays a conversation . Kids with hyperlexia can see how pronouns are modified between person to person and how to answer WH- questions appropriately , among many other things . <p> Read these types of books out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . <p> Alternatively , you could read play scripts together with older children as it would have the similar effect of teaching the back and forth nature of conversation . <p> 6 . Use an interesting tone while speaking or even sing the questions . <p> Kids with hyperlexia appear to listen selectively , so sometimes you need to get their attention first before you dive into conversation . Plus , kids with hyperlexia tend to listen to the tone of your voice over the actual content of your speech . You could try whispering in their ear , singing really loud or goofy , or even talking with a song-like , high-pitched voice . Sometimes even singing the question helps tremendously ! <p> 7 . Write it out ! <p> It 's no secret that these kids can read and love to read , so use that to your benefit . While asking your questions verbally , write them on a white board or chalkboard or piece of paper . That way the kids can read and hear what you are asking . <p> 8 . Expand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child does say in response to your questions , even if it 's echolalic in nature . So if I ask , " What do you want for lunch today ? " and they respond with " Sandwich " , I can expand on that by saying , " Sandwiches are my favorite things to eat for lunch . Let 's find some bread . Where can we find some bread for our sandwiches ?

@@23062144 @3062144/ <h> Wednesday , June 08 , 2016 <p> One of the most frequent questions that I get asked about hyperlexia is regarding the diagnostic process . Who can diagnosis hyperlexia ? How can I get the hyperlexia diagnosis ? And so on . Important questions , yes , but it is n't that simple . <p> Because hyperlexia is currently not a standalone diagnosis . That makes things tricky for parents like myself trying to get help for their child . <p> So I thought I would cover as much as I can about the " diagnostic " process regarding hyperlexia . <h> The " Diagnosis " of Hyperlexia <p> Hyperlexia is not a diagnosis by itself and , as such , does not appear as an official diagnosis in psychiatric and psychological diagnostic manuals . <p> Instead , hyperlexia is a practical label . That means , the label of hyperlexia gives parents , professionals , and educators a better understanding of how the child thinks and learns . Having a label of hyperlexia also makes it easier to find , develop , and use strategies that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three types of hyperlexia proposed , most children will usually receive just the general label of hyperlexia . They will usually not be officially labeled as hyperlexia type I or type II or type III . Mostly because the research does n't necessarily support these types yet as it is just a proposed theory . However , I find that most parents know which type their child fits into , if that is something that they find useful . For me , the type does n't matter so much as the actual label of hyperlexia . <p> Often , hyperlexia is diagnosed alongside other diagnoses , which can further help determine which " type " of hyperlexia your child has . Hyperlexia is often diagnosed alongside an autism diagnosis.However , it can also be identified alongside other diagnoses such as pervasive development disorder or expressive language disorders ( see more on page 3 here ) . But not every child with hyperlexia will have one of these other diagnoses . <h> Who Can " Diagnose " Hyperlexia ? <p> In my experience from talking with other parents of hyperlexia children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ways : <p> From a psychologist , usually during an autism evaluation <p> From a speech therapist , usually after the parent raises the possibility of hyperlexia <p> Self-diagnosed and confirmed by professionals <p> Since hyperlexia is not an official diagnosis , you will likely not receive a " diagnosis " on paper . However , many professionals will either introduce you to the label of hyperlexia or will confirm your suspicions . <p> For us , we learned about our son 's hyperlexia during his autism evaluation when the psychologist introduced us to the labels of hyperlexia and hypernumeracy to describe his skills and abilities regarding superior decoding of language and math . I am still so grateful to the psychologist for introducing us to hyperlexia and hypernumeracy because it certainly made everything so clear ! We finally got the answer that we needed and were able to find appropriate strategies to help J succeed . <p> Quite a few speech pathologists that we have interacted with have n't heard of hyperlexia or know so little about it . So I do n't think we would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . Other parents have had varied experiences with this avenue . <p> However , had I been aware of hyperlexia when J was a toddler , I am positive that I would have self-diagnosed him with it and then raised my suspicions with professionals to confirm the " diagnosis . " Many parents seem to find themselves in this position . They learn about hyperlexia , cry with relief , and push professionals to confirm their suspicions . <p> To me , you know when your child has hyperlexia when you see pictures and videos of other kids with hyperlexia acting exactly like your child . I know that when I finally googled hyperlexia and watched some videos , looked at photos , and read about hyperlexia that I had finally found what J had .

I really do because up until late 2014 , I had never heard of it either . However , the lack of awareness and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my son 's needs met at school or by a speech therapist or by any other professional that he comes in contact with . <p> So how do you advocate for your child when no one has heard of the diagnosis ? These tips that I 'm going to share are n't just relevant to the diagnosis of hyperlexia ( which I remind you , there is no official diagnosis for it ) . These tips can be used for other rare diagnoses that your child may have . <h> Tips for Advocating for Your Child When No One 's Heard of the Diagnosis <p> 1 . Educate yourself . <p> Make sure that you stay up to date with all the latest research and information regarding the particular diagnosis . The more you know about the particular syndrome , condition , label , diagnosis , or whatever you want to call it , the better . Read up on the strategies that work . Connect with other parents to find out what is working or is n't working for their children ( you can join my Hyperlexia + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what does and does not work for your child . <p> One of my favorite ways to educate the professionals involved in my child 's life is to hand them the information that they need . You can even highlight the most important parts to make it easily digestible for busy teachers and professionals . Here are my favorites to give to J 's teachers : <p> When J started grade one , the teacher encouraged all parents to write a short letter or email about their child , including their strengths and weaknesses . Pretty sure she was expecting a short paragraph with about 4-5 sentences . I practically sent her a novel ! But , I think she appreciated it ! So even if your teacher does n't request this kind of letter upfront , I think it 's a great habit to get into . It 's a great way to introduce your child 's complex needs and abilities to them . After all , they will be spending a lot of time with your child over the school year . 4 . Educate those around you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate for a diagnosis no one 's hear of is simply because , well , no one has heard of it . The only way for it to become a known diagnosis is to talk , share , and educate those around you . Explain hyperlexia ( or whatever your relevant unknown diagnosis is ) to those around you . You 'd be surprised at how well word of mouth works ! <p> For instance , my blog is obviously my platform for spreading awareness about hyperlexia and I have a friend who is a special education teacher at a school nearby . She passed my blog along to the parents of a little boy fitting the hyperlexic criteria . Then when our children were paired in a program some time later through Autism Services , the mom asked if I happened to be the mom behind this blog . She told me how wonderful it was to read about my son 's hyperlexia because it was like reading about her very own son . <p> 5 . Do n't let other diagnoses overshadow any others . <p> One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperlexic label . They try to work with him based off of his autism label alone instead of considering what his hyperlexia might offer in terms of therapy and treatments . I believe that his hyperlexia diagnosis is just as important in the therapeutic process as his autism one , so to disregard that , is to disregard his overall being . Progress will never happen if you can not tap into his strengths . 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

@@23062159 @3062159/ <h> Saturday , September 10 , 2016 <p> I have always been good at math and I love a good math game myself . So when J was diagnosed with hypernumeracy and showed a particular fascination with numbers and math in his early toddlerhood , I was thrilled to finally find someone who would happily play math games with me on a regular basis . <p> So when I got an iPad back in May , I was determined to find some awesome math apps for kids so that both J and I could have some fun games to play ! This list of math apps also includes fun number games that do n't necessarily focus on answering equations , but instead focus on having fun with numbers . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Math Apps for Kids <p> We were first introduced to this game at our local library . They have an expanded version of the app version on the computers in the library and my kids always loved playing this game . Basically , this game makes math fun . You can also customize each mini game to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tally marks , and at different levels . Definitely a must own math app ! <p> I love , love , love this app for working on multiplication , especially for visual learners . It 's part puzzle game and part math game . You can work through the times tables progressively or combine all the times tables into a random grid . Such a great app ! <p> Another app from Math Doodles that makes learning math fun . Not that my kids think that math is boring . This app focuses on attributes , categorizing , and classifying objects . You can work on Venn diagrams and patterning , among many other things . Really great app ! <p> J was introduced to this game by his grade one teacher and he loves it ! It works on addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , or a combination of all of those . I like that it keeps track of his scores and that you can have different player profiles ( i.e. , it 's good for a classroom setting if you are a teacher ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers together that equal 10 , but without blocking other numbered tiles . The sound effects and music are kind of annoying in this game , but J loves this app . There is also a 10 Junior app ( perfect for younger kids ) and 9 app by the same developers . Both apps are just as great ! <p> I like that you can customize this app to target your child 's age or level in school ( goes from preschool up to grade eight ) . It targets things such as geometry , fractions , division , decimals , equations , addition , subtraction , and more ! It is sort of a fancy , dressed up version of mad minutes ( or at least from what I remember of mad minutes from elementary school ) . <p> With a name like Greg , it does n't sound like a math game , does it ? You are given a random sum and you have to click on numbers that are beside each other until you reach that desired sum . However , you have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " extreme " and " olympic , " this game gets hard ! <p> This app makes me think of an abstract version of connect the dots . You have to tap numbers in order as quick as you can . Comes with four levels of difficulty , so the game can be quite challenging , but it is fun ! <p> This is n't necessarily a math game , but it is an awesome app for kids who love numbers , like J does . Combine the same numbers together to turn them into the next number ( so if you combine twos you get a three ) . Keep going until you can get 13 . Sounds easy , but it really is n't ! It 's a super fun app that even I love to play ! There are a lot of ads in this app though , just as a heads up . <p> Just like Math Buzz , you can select your level from preschool up to grade eight and target skills like properties , addition , multiplication , fractions , estimation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . <p> Another app that reminds me mad minutes from elementary school . This app just asks math questions that you have to answer quickly . It starts with simple addition and subtraction questions , but then eventually adds in some multiplication and division questions . But you have to answer them quickly ! <p> Of course , a Sudoku app has to make this list because it is a perfect game for number loving kids , even if it is n't a math game per say . This particular Sudoku app that we have also allows you to play alphabet Sudoku , color Sudoku , and logo Sudoku . So this app is absolutely PERFECT for kids with hyperlexia since it 's no secret that they love letters , numbers , and logos. 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

Well , after cleaning off the hutch in my dining room for the first time in months ( yes , there may have been stuff from August and Halloween on that hutch ! ) , I came across a bag full of cotton balls . So I decided then and there to whip up our very first batch of baked cotton balls . 17100 @qwx217100 <p> I was inspired to do a music variation on the classical baked cotton balls because of accents found in music . I wanted to show the boys that with some extra force from the arms , music notes can have more emphasis . Hitting the note with the hammer was our way of simulating those accents found in music . When the boys would hit the baked cotton ball music notes , I would reinforce the music terminology with words like " emphasis " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baked cotton ball music notes was a way to reinforce what music notes look like . <p> Once the cotton balls are cool , let the kids assemble them into music notes !

Or to use music terminology , it was time to put some accents on those notes ! <p> For this part , I highly recommend using a hard surface and a cloth or shower curtain for easy clean up . You will also need a hammer . Now , before the angry mobs start attacking me , please use your discretion . We did use a real hammer . I am confident in my children 's abilities to use real life tools , but it is not for everyone and that is okay .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J 's turn " or " K 's turn , " so that no little fingers were harmed in the process . I encouraged the boys to do a safety check before using the hammer .

They also used positive words to encourage each other , which was really cute . <p> That was it !

@@23062162 @3062162/ <h> Wednesday , January 20 , 2016 <p> One of my blogging goals for 2015 was to diversify my blog 's income streams by creating paid products . Specifically , I wanted to generate more passive income streams by pushing myself to write and publish one eBook or paid printable per month . <p> Say what , crazy lady ? ! Yes , in March 2015 , I decided it was time to start selling my content and knowledge by creating eBooks and printables to sell on my blog . Especially after seeing the success of 99 Fine Motor Ideas ( my first published book that I co-authored with some amazing blogging friends of mine ) , I knew it was time to try my hand at self-publishing myself . Another reason why I decided to challenge myself - or perhaps , exhaust myself - was due to the announcement of ad blockers coming to Apple mobile devices . With ad revenue potentially decreasing , I wanted to be prepared with other ways to earn income from my blog . I wanted to diversify my income sources . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of hard work and I learned a ton ! And yes , the hard work is paying off because I am getting a regular passive income from writing and selling eBooks through my blog. 17101 @qwx217101 <h> What Books and Products Did I Create ? <p> An upcoming new SEO update from Google prompted me to write this how to guide for Blogger users . It was super easy to put together and was done in about 1.5 days . Since I used screenshots , no photo editing was required , which is always the slowest part of the whole self-publishing process for me . I knew it would n't be the next bestseller , but I have sold enough copies to make it worthwhile . <p> This short eBook is more of a printable planner than an eBook and it is free , so not a passive income source really . However , I designed it as a subscriber freebie . The sole purpose of this product was to attract loyal readers . My subscription list exploded with the introduction of this planner , so it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two days to create , mostly because I had to learn how to use Microsoft Publisher at the same time . <p> This book is my pride and joy ! I absolutely adore how it turned out . It was also my first time self-publishing on Kindle and in print using CreateSpace . Once I created my book 's template in Microsoft Publisher , it was pretty quick to put together . I think it took about 4-5 weeks total to put together all three versions ( print , eBook , and Kindle ) . I went in with a clear vision of creating a book that centered around one material ( kinetic sand ) , used only two other additional materials , and would have three color photographs for each activity . So that 's exactly how the book turned out . Sales started off slow , but I get a decent amount of sales every month , primarily from the print copies . I have n't sold many eBook versions . <p> PS : I do have an affiliate program for the eBook version ! Contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eBook . Its purpose is to redirect readers , who are interested in learning more about hyperlexia , to the variety of my blog posts on the topic . So it 's indirect passive income through increased ad revenue . <p> I also helped edit and format my friend Sarah 's lovely book A Year of Educational Quiet Bins for eBook , Kindle , and print . <p> July was the busiest month because of a vacation planned for August , so I had to work my butt off in July to make sure I did n't miss any months ! In June , I had pitched the idea of Pop ! Squirt ! Splash ! to my blogging tribe . Twelve authors in total , it was a bit hectic at times to manage , but I did ! Six weeks later , the book was available in eBook , Kindle , and Print versions . However , sales have been disappointing , but I think it 's because of the timing . Summer was nearly over by the time it was released . I suspect it will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return . I sure hope so because the book turned out GORGEOUS . <p> Meanwhile , I started putting together the How to Self-Publish a Book eBook + Workbook , mainly because my co-authors for Pop ! Squirt ! Splash ! wanted tips on how to self-publish . So I documented the whole process and turned it into a workbook that will help others self-publish on their own . I wrote this book from start to finish in just three days . I pushed myself to do a three day challenge in order to get this eBook done . I do n't recommend doing that again as it was tiring ! <p> We were away on vacation so I did n't publish anything new . However , I made up for it in July . And I also spent the beginning of August helping edit and format the book When Your Child Hates Handwriting for another blogging friend . I was also working on submitting all of my activities and photos for the second installment of 99 Fine Motor Ideas ( which will hopefully be released in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles published <p> Nothing new was published in September as I was having a hard time returning to my blogging rhythm after our vacation in August and the usual busyness that early fall brings . <p> October : No new titles published <p> Nothing new was published in October as 99 Fine Motor Ideas 's follow up was originally tentatively planned for October . However , I started working on my next big project , which was going to make up for no new titles in September or October . <p> Making quiet book patterns to sell has been on my to do list for an extremely long time . I finally sat down and just did it ! I released three packs that could be bought individually or as a bundle . So it is technically three separate eBooks . See , I told you I made up for nothing new in September or October ... <p> Anyway , making the patterns themselves was the easy part and I can make the patterns in about a day or two . However , to really sell the patterns , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page idea in these packs . That is the time consuming part ! <p> The hard work was definitely worth it though because these patterns sell like hot cakes ! I still ca n't believe how well these are doing . They rivaled my ad income for December and I hardly promoted them ! <p> There 's also an affiliate program for these patterns . Again , contact me for more information . <p> To follow up the success of the original quiet book patterns , I put together this Christmas pack in about four days or less . That includes assembling the physical quiet book itself ! However , I ran into issues along the way ( craft store had zero felt in stock , issues uploading to ejunkie , etc. ) so it was released later than I had hoped . Sales were still great , but I imagine it will sell amazing in October-December 2016 as people whip up DIY gift ideas for their kids . <h> What Did I Learn Through this Process ? <p> Obviously , I learned a lot about how to format books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned quickly about what does and does not sell well for my audience . Or , at least , I learned what sells without me actively promoting or without me creating a big fancy book launch party . <p> I also learned that I can make a whole lot of extra income by selling these eBooks and printables ! So yes , I will be continuing this challenge of publishing one eBook or paid printable per month for 2016 . <p> Now that I have learned how to self-publish by myself , I need to start learning about how to better market my products . I did n't do any fancy book launches for any of the books nor did I actively promote them beyond the initial week launch . My goal for 2015 was simply to create the products . I figured that I could always figure out the marketing of those products afterwards . And I will . That 's what I want to do in 2016 . I want to figure out how to best sell my products now that I have the products available . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenge <p> I have had numerous people inquire about how I managed to pull this crazy goal off . So I 'm going to share my tips on how to do it , in case you are courageous and brave enough to join me on the dark side . <p> 1 . Start by learning one book format first . The first book that I launched was solely an eBook . I was able to learn and ( sort of ) master how to create an eBook and sell it through ejunkie . Doing one format at a time is a good way to learn all the ins and outs about it so that follow up books will go more smoothly . Maybe you want to try a Kindle book first or a print book first ? Just pick one format and try to learn as much as you can about it . Then as you write more books , you can explore other formats . <p> 2 . Pick a topic and just get it done ! I am easily distracted so if I do n't finish a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time soon . That 's why I find it best just to sit down and just write . Or photograph lots of projects or activities for the book in one day . Try a three day challenge ( or not because it 's crazy to do with small kids in the house - so go with a five or seven day challenge ) . Plan a weekend getaway so that you can just write without distractions . <p> 3 . Prepare to let other commitments slide . You might have to reduce the number of times that you post on your blog or ignore social media for a bit while you work on writing your book . <p> 4 . Ask for help . Hire a virtual assistant to take over your social media while you work on your book . Or hire someone to format or edit your book , like Sarah and Julie did with theirs . I did all the grunt work of formatting and they just simply had to upload and launch . Or ask for help on tasks such as editing , creating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Go in with a plan . Be specific about your idea for the book . For example , when I was doing my kinetic sand book , I knew that I wanted three good quality photos for each activity in the book . Once I knew I had those three photos that I needed , I stopped taking photos . Less photos to filter through later . <p> 6 . Outline , outline , outline ! This goes along with tip #5 . Make sure you write an outline for the book and use it to help you accomplish it . In fact , this eBook and workbook should help you plan and outline your entire book from start to finish . <p> 7 . Change your schedule . I stayed up a lot of extra hours to get some of these projects done . I also woke up earlier to sneak in some writing and formatting before the kids would wake up . You may have to make some slight changes to your schedule as well . <p> 8 . Create strict deadlines for collaborative eBooks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . However , I found it went pretty smoothly because I set easy to manage and strict deadlines . Then I bugged the co-authors until they delivered what was due . Worked great ! I 'm also in the final stages of creating a blogging eCourse , that I 'm creating with two other bloggers , which will cover this tip in much more detail . <h> Was it Worth It ? <p> Yes . A million times yes . <p> The income that I am generating from my quiet book patterns alone is wonderful . It definitely makes up for all the lost hours of sleep over the past year . It wo n't be long before these eBooks and paid products are the main source of income from my blog . Especially once I figure out how to better market the products ... <p> So what do you say ... want to join me for the one eBook a month challenge for 2016 ? 17098 @qwx217098 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <h> 10 comments : <p> This is something that I have been rolling around in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting distracted . At the moment , I am still looking to get my writing mojo back after my very long Christmas break . I think , like you said , I just need to get in and get it done ! <p> I think that 's the hardest part of juggling blogging with motherhood . It 's so easy to get distracted by other things and then never actually finish writing a book . So yes , set aside some time and just get it done ! Make it your priority for a few days and I bet you can get it all ( or close to all ) written . <p> Love seeing how you 're able to take your talents and put them into tangible things to provide for sale for others through ebooks .

Try to add at least one affiliate link to every blog post that you write . The best example I have is : Free Printable Daily Visual Schedule . I sell at least one pocket chart every day because of this post . <p> 4 . Make your posts shareable by including a variety of images : square , landscape , portrait , long pin images , etc . You can also have some images with text and some without . <p> 5 . Write better headlines . Not click bait ones , but ones that are interesting . Ones that will entice people to click . The better your headline is , the more clicks you will get . You can use this free headline analyzer to see how strong your headlines are . <p> 6 . Write blog posts that are sticky . That is , write better , tell more stories , and create posts that people will want to share and comment on . I highly recommend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stickiness . Here 's an example of a sticky blog post : Why I Use Math to Connect with My Son . <p> 7 . Update old posts regularly by adding affiliate links , updating the photos ( either editing current ones or taking new photos entirely ) , rewriting with SEO in mind , filling in alt text for the photos , writing a better headline , etc . It can give an old post new life ! <p> 8 . Fill in the alt text for every single photo used in a post . Pinterest pulls this alt text for its pin descriptions . Make sure the alt text has lots of keywords to maximize your chances of being found in Pinterest searches . You can see how it works in step four here . <p> 10 . Set a featured image for your posts . Featured images will help improve the way your links appear on Facebook . WordPress users can do this through Yoast ( I believe from what I have read . I do n't use WordPress so I have no idea ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How to Get Your Blog 's Newsletter to Work Harder for Your Blog <p> 1 . Create a drip campaign for your newsletter subscribers that highlights popular posts and products that you offer . Check stats regularly and tweak if needed to boost open rate , engagement , etc . I use MadMimi for my newsletter and their drip campaigns are super easy to set up ! I have seen a dramatic increase in my daily pageviews since I started my drip campaign . <p> 4 . Install Hello Bar or similar to highlight your newsletter , products , or social media . <p> 5 . Create an email signature for your blog 's email account and include : a link to your blog , links to all social media links , a link to subscribe to your newsletter , and/or a link to a product on your blog . <p> 6 . Create a landing page that new subscribers are directed to after subscribing that highlights popular blog posts , products you sell , social media links , etc . I also have a reader survey on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my subscribers , what they 're looking for , what their biggest parenting challenge is , and more ! I get so many ideas for future blog posts from this survey . <p> 7 . Include your social media links or a popular post in the footer of your newsletter . Your newsletter subscribers are going to be your most loyal readers , so encourage them to follow you on social media as well . <h> How to Get Your Blog 's Design to Work Harder for Your Blog <p> 1 . Create landing pages for topics that you frequently cover on your blog instead of linking to categories or labels . Be sure to design images for those landing pages so that they can be easily shared on social media . Two examples from my blog : Autism Resources for Parents and Quiet Books . I am currently working on adding more . <p> 2 . Link to landing pages in your blog 's navigation menu instead of linking to categories or labels . Doing so means you get at least one more pageview . And it 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . Have a search bar on your blog . I highly recommend using a Google Custom Search for your blog so that you can promote your own content in your search bar . Certain keywords can trigger certain search results depending on what your reader typed in the search bar . Find out how to promote your blog posts in a Google Custom Search bar . <p> 4 . Add related posts to the end of every post . Or at least link to a related landing page on your blog . You can use a widget , add in manual text links to the end of each post , or provide clickable images to related posts . <p> 5 . Create a shop page for all of your freebies , books , and other products . Make it easy to find all of your products in one spot ! I actually have a few different pages since I have so many varied topics on my blog : Free Printables , Our Books , &amp; Printable &amp; Sensory Shop . I do plan to merge all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been redesigned . <p> 6 . Create a landing page for your newsletter subscription and subscriber freebie .

@@23062167 @3062167/ <h> Thursday , March 16 , 2017 <p> Everyone enjoys being praised for doing something well . Whether it is for working hard on something , achieving some new milestone , or just being praised for being kind to others , kids and adults alike enjoy hearing that they are , essentially , being awesome . Teaching kids how to praise others is quite easy , I think in comparison to other social skills , since it can easily be incorporated into everyday interactions right from birth . <p> However , kids with autism and/or hyperlexia might need additional support to master this social skill . Here are 7 ways to teach kids how to praise others . <h> Strategies for Teaching Kids How to Praise Others <h> 1 . Be an example &amp; model <p> The absolute best way to teach kids how to praise others is by being a good example yourself and modeling how to praise others . That includes praising your child for their accomplishments , whether big or small , and even praising the efforts of others that you interact with . Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say so if they regularly see us praising others , they will pick up on it . And keep in mind that you do n't have to praise your child for everything they do . <h> 2 . Be specific when praising <p> Avoid non-descriptive phrases like " good job " or " way to go " or " you 're so smart " when praising others . You should be specific about why you are praising your child so that they can learn and internalize what it is that they did that was praise-worthy . The praise should be related to something your child has the ability to control . Phrases such as " good job " fail to tell the child what it is that they are being praised for . Besides , it is an abstract phrase for literal thinking kids with autism or hyperlexia so means little to them . For example , you might say , " I like how you put your dirty clothes away all by yourself ! " instead of just saying " good job . " <h> 3 . Model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when praising others . Show your child how you can clap , give a high five , smile , or give a fist bump as a way to encourage and praise others without using words . <h> 4 . Teach empathy and compassion <p> This strategy is so important and can be the hardest of all these strategies listed here to master , especially in younger children . Teaching kids to think about how others might be feeling can help them be better at praising others because then they are capable of understanding what the needs of the other person might be and can praise accordingly . <h> 5 . Give them scripts for how to praise <p> Teach your child some specific phrases or templates for praising that they can use when trying to praise others . I know my son often has a tough time phrasing his exact thoughts , so simple social scripts are a way to give him the foundation he needs to word his praise in an appropriate manner . Eventually the scripts can be phased out as the child learns to create their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hidden rules of praising others . <h> 6 . Teach your child to be observant <p> Help your child learn to be more observant by pointing out things that are praise-worthy . Encourage them to look around them and see how people are acting and feeling . You can also ask your child questions to encourage them to observe what is happening around them . <h> 7 . Practice praising others <p> You can practice praising others through play and role playing . Or you can prompt your child to praise others when you are pointing out praise-worthy behaviors to them . Finally , be sure to give your child plenty of opportunities to praise others in your everyday interactions . 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

@@23062171 @3062171/ <h> Tuesday , October 29 , 2013 <p> We 've been redoing our play room ever since we built the light table , including a toy purge that was long overdue . So we ended up with a bit of a blank space on one wall and I was looking for something to put there . I decided that it would be a great space for a large sensory board of some kind , but I just did n't know what . <p> Then inspiration struck . <p> I decided to make this car themed sensory board for kids by upcycling various items from around our house . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> The Inspiration for our DIY Sensory Board <p> It started with a hideously faded yellow plastic steering wheel similar to this one . <p> A neighbor down the street from us was cleaning up their backyard toys , giving a bunch away for free . Among the toys for free were some swings and a steering wheel that were previously part of a play structure . As soon as I saw the steering wheel , I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me to come up with this car dashboard sensory board . <p> As a side note , we also took the swings ( one of which hangs in our basement and the others outside on the play structure our other neighbor lent to us ) . <h> How to Make a Car Themed Sensory Board for Kids <p> This project was n't overly time consuming nor did it cost us a lot of money . I paid $2.25 for the two round tap lights , $1 for the mirror , approximately $2-3 on hardware like nuts , and $5 on a can of glossy black spray paint . Everything else used for this project was either upcycled from something else or we already had it on hand . <p> The main board was part of the same entertainment center that we built our light table from . We did n't have to cut it as it was already the perfect length . Score ! <p> We ( and by we , I mean my wonderful husband ) used a jigsaw to cut the gear shift section ( pictures below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire board , as well as a smaller piece of wood and a wood handle , white using the paint we had leftover from our light table . <p> He also spray painted the steering wheel black . Then it was time for assembly ! <p> The center of the sensory board features a gear shift and a stereo . A couple of years ago we installed a new CD player in our car , so we attached our old one to the sensory board . The boys love that they get to play with real buttons ! <p> The knob for the gear shift is from an old elliptical machine that broke a few years ago . It is attached with a nut and some washers and slides easily through the slots that my husband cut . The numbers on the gear shift are cut from black vinyl using my Silhouette Cameo ( PS : that thing is awesome ! ) . <p> On the right side of the dashboard is the glove box or in our case , the glove flap . Lift up the door to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dashboard . Again , the door was made with recycled wood and the hinge is one that we had on hand . I wish that we had two hinges so that the door would open better , but alas , we had one , so we used one . The cool thing about this part is that within two days , K not only learned the name of where we live , but can point it out on the map . He also tries to point out where my parents live , but points to the wrong area . Ah well , he 's only just turned 2 ! <p> By far the coolest feature , in my opinion anyways , are the gauges for the dashboard . I purchased two round tap lights from The Dollar Tree . Then I used black vinyl and my Cameo to make the features for a speedometer and gas gauge . The gas gauge was simple , but I had a lot more trouble making and sticking the vinyl down for the speedometer . I think that painting or using a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out amazing ! And they light up when pressed . <p> Between the lights , we mounted a mirror . This mirror caused many problems . It was originally hung as a rear view mirror closer to the stereo by mounting it through the handle . However , J was admiring himself in the mirror and pulling on it . Needless to say , the handle snapped off and he smacked himself in the face with the mirror . So we looked for a new way to hang it . We popped out the mirror , screwed the plastic backing to the board , popped the mirror back in , and voila ! Okay , not voila because the mirror ended up cracking while my husband put it back in . Nothing a bit of clear tape did n't fix ! <p> We mounted the newly painted steering wheel below the mirror . Just behind the steering wheel is a small odometer made from black vinyl ( you can sort of see it in the picture above ) . The numbers on the odometer are 0102013 , which stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's an overview of the dashboard when the lights are on . <p> And here 's a picture of the boys enjoying their new " car .

@@23062174 @3062174/ <h> Tuesday , March 07 , 2017 <p> Personal space is something my son really struggles with , as do most kids with autism . It 's like he needs to be touching me at all times with his hands and feet or standing so close to me that I have to refocus my eyes . He basically touches shoulders with people when sitting next to them , simply unaware that he is too close and causing the person to feel uncomfortable . <p> However , with these 9 simple tips for teaching kids about personal space , he will be a rockstar at understanding personal space in no time and then we can check it off of our massive list of social skills to work on . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Tips for Teaching Your Kids About Personal Space <p> There are lots of different ways to teach kids about personal space . And let 's admit it , most kids could use a bit of help when it comes to personal space , right ? Here are 9 ways to teach kids about personal space . This tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 1 . Use a social story to explain personal space <p> When it comes to teaching social skills to kids with autism , I 'm a firm believer in a good social story . Write a social story , or at least find one , about personal space . It should outline what personal space is , what good personal space looks like , social cues for your child to look for to determine whether or not they are personal space invaders , and what to do when they need personal space . <h> 2 . Use visual cues to illustrate personal space <p> Visual cues are super helpful for kids , especially those with autism and/or hyperlexia . You can use a visual clue like a hula hoop to demonstrate the invisible personal space bubbles that we all have . Or try holding a beach ball between you and your child to show how much space is needed . <h> 3 . Let them feel " too close " <p> Have your child slowly walk toward you , describing how he is getting closer , just right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each distance . When you find a distance that your child finds uncomfortable , or " too close , " then explain to them that that is what others feel when he/she stands too close to them . <h> 4 . Teach social cues for body language <p> Make sure your child knows what to look for to determine whether they are too close or just the right distance from another person . Teach them to look for social cues such as : <p> The person 's face looks mad , confused , annoyed , or uncomfortable <p> The person backs away <p> The person puts their hands up with palms facing out <p> The person avoids eye contact or starts to look elsewhere <p> The person moves over or adjusts their position <p> The person turns away <p> The person starts to fidget or squirm <p> The person 's body looks stiff <h> 5 . Model personal space and good body language <p> Video modeling is one great option ! You can simply record you and your child standing too close , just right , or too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss what is expected and unexpected about each video clip . <p> You can also model good personal space in your everyday interactions . Remind them that they are standing too close or saying things like , " You look uncomfortable and stiff . I must be standing too close to you right now . " <h> 6 . Provide a safe space and/or breaks when they need personal space <p> Come up with a plan for your child so that they know what to do or where they can go when they feel like they just need some space . A calm down corner or a calm down kit may be helpful for this situation . These free printable visual calm down strategies would be a helpful tool as well ! <h> 7 . Practice personal space <p> Practice makes perfect , right ? Kids can master the rules of personal space simply by practicing and repeating the skills over and over . Teach your kids the one-arm rule . That is , keep one arm length between you and your friend to maintain good personal space . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kids . You could even use their favorite toys or stuffed animals to demonstrate the concepts of personal space ! <h> 8 . Look at pictures to explore personal space concepts <p> Spend some time looking at pictures of people with your child . Talk about the body language the people are showing and whether or not good personal space is being observed . <h> 9 . Teach personal space language <p> Be sure to not only model personal space language , but to teach your kids some helpful personal space related language .

But keep in mind the following : <p> TheseReads is new and in beta so things are changing constantly <p> I have never used the app so I can not answer any questions pertaining to the app <p> I am still learning how to use TheseReads myself so I 'm far from an expert . I just happen to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , do n't overthink it . <p> I think many bloggers have gotten into the habit of trying to over-analyze everything because of the annoying algorithms on Facebook and Pinterest lately . TheseReads is simple to use as long as you do n't overthink it . <p> I repeat ... do not overthink it . <p> Ready to learn how to use TheseReads to boost blog traffic part 2 ? You can read part 1 here . <p> Where can I sign up for TheseReads ? TheseReads is currently invite only so go request an invite . <p> Can I get an invite to TheseReads from someone who 's already on TheseReads ? They do not have this feature available . So just request an invite and be patient . <p> How long does it take to get in after requesting my invite ? Be patient ! I know that I already showed you how exciting TheseReads can be for a blogger , but lots of people have been requesting invites . So much so that two days after my blog post , TheseReads was temporarily broken while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JQ and his team added a handy dandy timer to the TheseReads main screen so you can see how long it will take to be accepted . <p> Do not - I repeat - do not email JQ to ask to be approved quicker . Remember that the site is in beta and is new . Besides , he 's already dealing with an onslaught of emails so hang tight until you get approved . There 's no need to clutter his email with silly inquires like , " When will I get in ? " <p> The wait is worth it ! <p> I 've been accepted . Now what ? First , read their FAQ and the rest of this post to learn as much as you can about the platform . <p> Next , go to the settings section and fill in every single part . <p> Finally , apply to be an approved publisher . Go to Settings &gt; Publisher and fill it in . In order to be approved as a publisher , you must install their badge widget somewhere on your blog . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Clipping is like tweeting on Twitter , sharing a link on Facebook , or pinning something to Pinterest . It 's simply a way to share a piece of interesting content with your followers . <p> Do they have an app ? They currently only have an iPhone app , but an android one is in the works . I 'm really hoping the android app gets done soon because I would LOVE to have it ! <p> Can I use my business Facebook page to log in ? No . You have to log in with your personal Facebook account . <p> How can I clip to the new TheseReads categories ? Clipping to categories like homeschooling , kids activities , parenting , etc. is new . When browsing through the different feeds that you follow , click clip on an interesting clip . A box will pop-up giving you the option to tweet , share on Facebook , and clip to a category . <p> How can I clip my own content to the categories ? Go to your blog account and click clip . Check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip from my bookmarklet toolbar , how can I clip it to the categories ? At the moment you ca n't . <p> Which photo does TheseReads use when an article is clipped ? It seems to be a bit random . Some WordPress users have been saying it 's either a random image or the featured image from Yoast . For Blogger users , it appears to be the first image in the blog post itself . So I guess the moral of the story is this : make sure all the images in your blog posts are bright and beautiful . <p> And of course , the day after I write this blog post , things changed ! You can now change photos and titles of your posts . Just go to your blog account profile and click the Edit link for each clip that you want to change . <p> Can I clip my own blog posts ? Yes , but do n't clip just your own content as you will get banned . Nobody likes a spammer . They even say so in their FAQ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media platform : share others ' content and mix your own content in at a small ratio . <p> Can I edit my blog account ? They just added an edit feature so that you can edit the photo and title of each clip from your blog . Just head to your blog account 's profile , find the clip you want to change , and click Edit . <p> If you do n't like the image associated with your blog account 's profile , then simply contact them and ask them to change it . <p> Otherwise , there 's not much else that you can change . <p> Can I clip to my blog account ? No . Your blog account is entirely RSS based . So when you publish a new post on your blog , it will automatically appear on your blog account . That 's currently all you can do . <p> What 's the difference between the personal and the blog account ? Think of it this way ... you likely have a personal Facebook account and a Facebook page for your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pinterest profile , correct ? Do you have a board dedicated solely to your own blog posts ( tip : you should if you do n't ! ) ? People choose to follow your blog board because they like your content ( just like they can follow your blog account on TheseReads ) . People can also choose to follow your entire profile because they like the wide range of content you are sharing , which likely includes lots of things outside your blog 's niche . <p> Same idea here ( with the exception that you can not edit your blog account ) . Your personal account is where you share interesting content from others , as well as yourself , while your blog account is solely to highlight your blog content . <p> How can I get my brand 's logo on my blog account ? Simply contact them and ask to have it changed . <p> How do I become an approved publisher ? Install the badge widget somewhere on your blog . Then go to Settings &gt; Publisher to apply . <p> Why do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I use a badge for my blog account ? While you wait to become an approved publisher , you will have to install the badge tied to your personal account . It 's really no different than installing a follow me on Pinterest widget for your profile . <p> Once you are an approved publisher , you will be able to swap the personal badge with a blog badge . <p> How do I know when I am an approved publisher ? Just go to Settings &gt; Publisher and scroll to the bottom . Next to the " Publisher Verification Status " you should see " Approved as a Publisher " <p> How come my blog account already has followers when I just joined TheseReads ? Other users have already clipped your content and when people clip your content , they automatically follow you . So it 's entirely possible to join TheseReads and already have a couple of hundred followers on your blog account . <p> How do I find people to follow ? Apparently there 's a search function on the app ( I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a search like feature is coming to TheseReads as well . Just click the " see all " link next to explore in the right sidebar . However , you will also be shown related users when visiting other personal profiles on TheseReads . Also , keep in mind , any time you clip from a blog , you will automatically follow them and they 'll appear in your left sidebar . <p> So honestly , do n't worry too much about looking for people to follow . <p> How can I see how many followers I have ? In the left sidebar you 'll see your profile picture . Click your name underneath the picture to be taken to your personal account . You can find the number of followers there . <p> As a blogger , what are the best ways to use TheseReads ? 1 . Do not do follow threads . They 're watching for that and could ban you . 2 . Clip lots and clip often , just like you would pin a lot and often on Pinterest. 3 . Clip unique and interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content as you will get banned . 5 . Share your clips on Twitter and/or Facebook . I personally just do Twitter because it automatically shares a large photo and link on Twitter for me. 6 . When you publish a new post , you share it on all of your social media platforms , right ? Start clipping it as well ! 7 . Install the bookmarklet toolbar to your web browser so that you can clip interesting content as you find it . It works just like a pin or stumble toolbar. 8 . You could also experiment with pinning your clips . The only way I have found that possible is to find a tweet of a clip , click the link , and then it gives you the option to pin it on Pinterest. 9 . Finally , experiment and play around with it ! 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

I just model different ways of solving a problem or show them how to use objects in novel ways , hoping that one day they will emulate me . <p> For those that do not already know , J is a bit gifted when it comes to the written word . He could name and identify the entire alphabet , upper and lower case , by 20 months . As a result , he began to read , by sight , and spell words correctly before age 2 .

Regardless , the point is that he can spell and read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He never misses an opportunity to read and spell , no matter what medium he may be presented with .

We use it in everyday conversations , while waiting in line to purchase something at the store , when playing games , etc . Like many social skills though , kids with autism and/or hyperlexia need to be taught these skills directly as they do not develop them innately . <h> Strategies for Teaching Your Kids Turn Taking Skills <p> There are so many opportunities throughout the day to work on turn taking skills , so you will find that these strategies are quite easy to implement . <h> 1 . Use a visual cue to indicate whose turn it is <p> For kids with autism and/or hyperlexia , visual cues are extremely important . You can use any kind of item you 'd like as a visual cue and pass it from player to player as it is their turn . Something like a talking stick would work , but can be as simple as handing the dice or spinner to whoever 's turn is next . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip #2. <h> 3 . Model turn taking <p> Modeling is such an effective way to teach turn taking skills ! Kids always pay more attention to how we act or what we do versus what we say anyway , right ? Show your child how you are taking turns when holding a conversation with someone or while playing a game . <h> 4 . Play games <p> Board games and card games are one of the best ways to work on turn taking skills ! Here are some of our favorite board games from a couple of years ago . However , my kids are a bit older now so they currently enjoy the following games : <p> I also like to incorporate games that challenge the stereotypical way of taking turns . Specifically , games that can randomly switch the order of the turns part way through the game like Uno or games that allow you to skip turns or force another player to take two turns like Exploding Kittens . <p> You might find it helpful to start a family game night to focus on helping your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to try and play two or three board games every night after supper . <h> 5 . Use a social story to explain why and how to take turns <p> Social stories are such a great way to work on a variety of social skill concepts . You can either write your own social story about taking turns or look for example stories on Pinterest or Teachers Pay Teachers . The social story should include expected and unexpected behavior when taking turns with others . It should also include the turn taking language mentioned in tip #2 ( my turn/your turn ) . Read through the social story together before engaging in an activity or game that requires the child to take turns . <h> 6 . Use a timer to indicate how long each turn will be <p> We use this technique a lot when it comes to sharing electronic devices like my iPad . We set a timer for five minutes and when the time is up , it is time to pass the device to the next person . You can certainly use a timer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take turns . <p> A timer is also a good way to reinforce being fair and letting everyone have an equal chance to play with something since each person will receive the exact same amount of time . Furthermore , a timer acts as a visual and auditory cues for turn taking with kids . <h> 7 . Communicating and describing turns ( first it is A 's turn , then it is yours ) <p> Be sure to outline or describe how the turn taking will occur . For instance , if you are going to use a timer , then tell the kids that each person will get exactly five minute turns . Or if multiple people will be taking turns with something , then be sure to explain who 's turn is first , second , third , etc . You can phrase it like " First it is person A 's turn , then it will be your turn . " <h> 8 . Use a fidget between turns <p> Many kids struggle with waiting for their turn .

It will make you angry at times and probably make you feel relieved to live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , but definitely a must read for anyone interested in the history , rights , and advocacy of autism . <p> This book is a must read if you are interested in learning more about hyperlexia . It 's a beautiful account of a mother 's journey with her son who has autism and hyperlexia . Naturally , I could relate to so much of this book as my son has the same diagnoses . Highly recommend this book ! <p> Temple Grandin is invaluable to helping us understand the autistic mind . Early in 2015 , I had an opportunity to see her speak and then she signed my copy of this book . Anyway , this book is a great read , although a little science heavy ( so definitely not for everyone ! ) . <p> This book is more of an illustrated poem or picture book more than anything , but it 's beautiful . It explores the beauty of autistic obsessions , which I found interesting and insightful . It takes only a few minutes to read , so it might be a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regardless , it is definitely worth the read . <p> I just recently learned of the Anat Baniel Method as a therapy/treatment option for autism , so I bought her book to find out more . I was instantly fascinated by her approach , regardless of whether or not we try this type of therapy , because it gave me great , practical tips to try . The method itself is about awakening your child 's brain , as opposed to trying to fix it , which is something I really appreciate . I also appreciate the idea behind brain plasticity since I wanted to be a neuropsychologist before I had children . Anyway , it 's a fascinating read ! <h> Social Skills &amp; Communication Books <p> My son loves reading this book . In fact , he told his first successful joke because of this book ! Each social skill is accompanied by text instructions and pictures that demonstrate the skill , so it 's perfect for kids who are visual and literal learners . There 's even a social skills book for high school and beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect guide to understanding everyday expressions like " It 's raining cats and dogs " and " You took the words right out of my mouth .

The tips are designed to help you encourage and motivate your child with autism to communicate . Still , to this day , my favorite tip is to do something silly like getting into a bathtub with socks on . My son always giggled and told me that , " We do n't wear socks when having a bath ! " whenever I would do that . It definitely got him talking ! <h> Picture Books for Children with Autism <p> A cute story for kids who have autism with adorable illustrations that shows how Zane the Zebra does things differently ( example painting with a paintbrush versus painting with his hooves ) .

@@23062205 @3062205/ <h> Tuesday , June 14 , 2016 <p> It 's one thing to be able to advocate for your child with hyperlexia when no one has heard of the diagnosis , but I find it is even trickier to explain hyperlexia to other parents . And trust me , other parents do take notice of your child 's hyperlexia . <p> But before I discuss how to explain hyperlexia to others , I want to tell you three recent stories . <p> Let me backtrack to the fall of 2015 , when I was talking with J 's teacher . She was telling me that J had been writing in another language during school . He 's in French Immersion so for him to write in another language other than French or English would be worth noting . Well , that and he 's in grade one . The teacher was n't 100% sure what language he was writing in , but it appeared to be similar to Italian or Spanish . Regardless , I told her it was n't unusual for him to write in other languages or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mom of one of J 's classmates overheard the conversation and eventually shared it with her husband . Later that week , the husband approached me and asked me , " Can J speak or write in other languages ? " <p> To which I responded that it was a bit more complicated than that . So I mentioned that J had hyperlexia and hypernumeracy , explaining that J had a precocious self-taught ability to read and started reading before he turned two . The husband than asked , " So he 's gifted ? He can help me predict lottery numbers or something ? " <p> Then a few weeks or a month later , the grandmother of one of J 's classmates asked me similar questions out of the blue . She said that she had " noticed J 's superior reading ability " and asked , " Is J gifted ? " <p> Again , I explained that he had hyperlexia and hypernumeracy by using the precocious self-taught ability to read definition , only to be cut short with stories from the grandmother about how her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish adequately explaining hyperlexia , which frustrated me . <p> Finally , sometime during the early part of the school year , I had another conversation with a father of one of J 's classmates . I mentioned that J started reading before age two and that he had hyperlexia . The father then went on about how he knew lots of kids who were really early readers , including himself . But here 's the thing : <p> Hyperlexia is more than just early reading . <p> These conversations left me a bit frustrated because obviously , I was n't explaining hyperlexia adequately enough to them . So how am I to explain hyperlexia in a way that will help others understand what hyperlexia truly is ? <p> And judging by discussions in some of the hyperlexia support groups , other parents encounter similar issues . <h> How to Explain Hyperlexia to Others <p> I 've learned from my mistakes from previous conversations and now I know to try to explain hyperlexia in a particular way . Whenever I discuss my children , it is always in as positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quirks and K is stubborn as they come , but my kids are also witty , kind , and fun to be with . So I keep that in mind while explaining hyperlexia . I always highlight J 's superior ability to decode the written word and his self-taught ability to read at an early age because it is the cornerstone to understanding what hyperlexia is . <p> But I also like to touch on these key points that separate hyperlexia from giftedness and/or early reading : <p> Expressive speech delay <p> Difficulties with oral comprehension and WH questions <p> Awkward social skills <p> Intense fascination with letters , numbers , logos , or maps <p> So if I were to sum up my explanation in one sentence , I would usually say something along these lines : hyperlexia is a precocious self-taught ability to read at an early age that 's accompanied by difficulties in speech and comprehension . <p> Obviously , I also like to mention J 's hypernumeracy when explaining hyperlexia saying that he is extremely good at math and give an example of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people find this part extremely fascinating ! Who would n't ? ! <p> So when people ask , " Is he gifted ? " <p> I respond with , " Well , it 's kind of complicated .... " and then launch into a discussion about hyperlexia . I get a bit passionate about it if you get me going ! <p> But overall , yes , I do think he is gifted when it comes to math and decoding written words . He has a remarkable ability that frankly blows my mind most days . <p> And my response to those people who say something along the lines of " Oh , I was an early reader ! I did n't know it was called hyperlexia ! " is usually this : " Well , hyperlexia is more than just reading at an early age as these kids struggle with comprehension , expressive speech , and social skills . Early readers do n't necessarily have these speech and language difficulties . Also , hyperlexia is usually diagnosed alongside autism . " <p> I hope my explanations are adequate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must admit that I find it odd that people ask questions like , " Is your child gifted ? " But I will have to save that topic for another post ... 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 17093 @qwx217093 <p> Hi , Dyan !

Of course , both boys thought it was hilarious ! Anyway , J pulled the tape off K 's belly and stuck it to the mirrored doors in our dining room .

@@23062209 @3062209/ <h> Monday , May 04 , 2015 <p> I 'm constantly experimenting and trying out new strategies to increase pageviews and boost traffic to my blog . For the month of April , I started experimenting with Reddit . I immediately saw positive results and I thought I would share what I learned about how to use Reddit to boost blog taffic and increase pageviews . <p> Before I signed up for Reddit , I started reading anything I could about using Reddit as part of my blog strategy . Unfortunately , there was n't a lot of information for me to read . On the positive side , though , I figured that that meant most bloggers are n't taking advantage of the platform . So I wanted to experiment to see if maybe , just maybe , it is worth using on a regular basis . <p> Now let meback track a few months to what really triggered my interest in using Reddit as a blogger . Back in December , someone submitted one of my posts . Within 24 hours , I had an extra 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem huge to many ( and it does n't to me ) , but I am not one to complain about 100+ extra pageviews . I kind of doubt you would complain about that either , especially since I had to do literally nothing to get that extra traffic . Also , imagine you are a blogger new to the scene . Those 100+ pageviews could make a huge difference in the beginning . <p> Alright , so back to April when I started experimenting with Reddit . You want to know what kind of results I had . Well , here are my top referrals for April : <p> Twitter only outperformed Reddit by 26 pageviews ! It 's important to note that I did n't start using Reddit actively until mid-April . So Reddit referrals could easily have been in my top 10 for the month of April . <p> Another thing to point out is that I spend lots of time working on Pinterest and Facebook . Like we 're talking hours . Twitter I spend about 15 minutes up to 1 hour on per day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Reddit per day . So less work and a pretty decent return ? I 'd call that a success in my books ! Reddit has been a much better investment than my experimentation with tumblr , but I will save that for another post . <p> Here 's a screenshot of my Reddit referral traffic for the month of April : <p> Have I piqued your interest in using Reddit yet ? Here are my tips for using Reddit as part of a blogging strategy . <h> How to Use Reddit to Boost Blog Traffic <p> Reddit Tip #1 : Join Subreddits Related to Your Blog 's Niche <p> Subreddits are basically like themed groups . I joined these subreddits : /r/autism , /r/hyperlexia , and /r/kidscrafts since they fit best with the topics that I blog about . Look for active groups related to your niche and join them . <p> Reddit Tip #2 : Read the Rules for Every Subreddit You Join <p> Every subreddit has different rules . Apparently it is is really easy to get banned on Reddit . Do n't let it happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , and most importantly , follow the rules ! <p> Reddit Tip #3 : Build Up Karma <p> When you first join Reddit , you are limited to how much and how often you can submit . You have to take it nice and easy . You need to build up karma . Karma is basically a point system where you get rewarded for submitting interesting content . If other users like your posts , they can upvote them , which , in turn , gives you karma . The more karma , the better . <p> How do you build up karma ? Well , by submitting interesting content that fits within the rules of the subreddit . You can also build up comment karma by leaving comments on other posts on Reddit and hoping others upvote your comments . I do n't have much comment karma myself yet because I have n't commented too much yet . <p> Reddit Tip #4 : Do n't Self Promote Too Much <p> Promote yourself too much and you 'll likely get banned . <p> When I first started submitting content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and posts by others and submitting those . I wanted the other users to see me as one of them ( when really I 'm a sneaky , self-promoting blogger in disguise ) . So when I first joined , I would submit one link by someone else in the morning . Reddit would n't let me submit more than that since I was a newbie . Then in the evening , I would submit another link to a different subreddit . Usually I would submit three links to other content and then I would share a link to something of mine next . Realistically I spent a total of 1-2 minutes on Reddit those first few days . <p> As I built up more karma , I was able to submit a lot of links in one visit . Now I like to submit a few links every morning and then a few more in the evening , which literally takes less than 10 minutes to do per day . Usually 1-2 links will be to my own content . I try to avoid sharing two links to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I spread it out between subreddits . <p> Reddit Tip #5 : Be Social &amp; Interactive <p> Reply to comments , upvote other posts in the subreddits , and comment on other posts . 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 17093 @qwx217093 <p> When I submit or have another blogger submit my Disney posts they do pretty well ! I have submitted a cool cupcake design of mine and it did really well ! I wish I was better at figuring out the Subreddits and understanding the rules better of each sub .

@@23062211 @3062211/ <p> But perhaps the most frustrating part of all was dealing with the acrobatic feats that occurred on my children 's chairs . I was tired of eating with upside down children and holding conversations with their flailing limbs . The constant grazing , walking to and from the table to take a nibble of this and then a nibble of that , was driving me crazy . <p> Was five minutes of non-squirmy children sitting on their bums to eat the dinner I so graciously cooked really too much to ask ? <p> Apparently so . <p> But I am not one to be easily defeated . 17101 @qwx217101 <p> Why Sitting at Mealtime is Important to Us <p> Just to be clear , encouraging my children to sit during mealtimes is n't about obedience . <p> It 's about finding time each day to connect and bond . It is about fostering healthy relationships with the people we love . <p> See , I grew up in a small town , living just a few blocks from school . So I was able to go home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those mealtimes were a way for us to connect and enjoy each other 's company . I have always wanted that for my family as well , especially in this digital age where we get sucked into our electronic devices and maintain a ridiculous busy lifestyle . So yes , sitting together as a family at mealtimes is important to me . It 's an important way for us to slow down and connect every single day . <p> Furthermore , sitting at mealtimes is important from a safety perspective . My children were literally hanging upside down while chewing their food . I may as well hand them some uncut grapes while they jump on the trampoline . I need them to sit on their bums , at least while they eat , so that they will be safe . <p> Things That Did n't Work My oldest son has autism and sensory issues , so he rarely sits still to begin with , but there had to be something that would encourage him to sit at the dinner table . <p> We tried visual cues like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have worked . Instead , it stressed him out and then he started playing with timer until it broke . Fail #1 . <p> So we tried a social story . Social stories always seem to work for him , but it did n't this time . Fail #2 . <p> We have tried verbal prompts over and over . Of course , understanding verbal demands are challenging for him due to his hyperlexia . Fail #3 . <p> We have even tried a little game , which worked wonders for a different mealtime issue , but did little to help him sit and eat his supper for any period of time . Fail #4 . <p> Rethinking Our Mealtime Struggles I know my son needs to wiggle and move , so I knew that that was going to be the key to successfully ending our mealtime woes . I needed to tap into his wiggly nature and find a solution that would allow him to squirm , but keep him seated long enough to eat his meal without me losing my voice to my constant pleas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with minimal success . It really only worked for the first day , but failed to provide him the sensory input that he required on subsequent tries . <p> Then one day when I was picking him up from school , I spotted him sitting on the Hokki wobble stool that he has in his classroom . But what I really saw was a child , sitting on his bum intensely focused on his work . He looked calm . He looked still . He looked almost peaceful . I was overcome with pride that my son was able to control his body in such a peaceful manner and it was definitely a light bulb moment for me . <p> I knew that I needed to provide that exact same sensory input at home . <p> But those stools are $120+ to buy . <p> There had to be a more affordable option that would work for this scenario . Then I recalled my days of working as a nanny for a boy who had sensory processing disorder . He had a bright blue slanted wedge cushion to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that before ? <p> But again , those wedge cushions are n't cheap either . <p> So I started exploring other options that were similar in design , but perhaps were n't marked as an occupational therapy tool or sensory tool , until I found the perfect compromise . <p> And I did . <p> But more importantly , it has revolutionized our mealtimes . He sits for long periods of time and eats his supper . I no longer have to eat alongside those acrobatic gymnasts who loop their legs around the table 's wooden frame or who dangle their bodies sideways and upside down on their chair . I no longer have to see patterned socks fluttering back and forth in the air . Instead , I see my children 's beautiful faces , smeared with sweet and sour sauce or a pink-hued smoothie mustache . I get to actually hold conversations with them while they eat and my husband and I finally get to relax , even just for a few minutes , without having to remind the children to sit on their bums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mealtimes Now this idea itself is n't revolutionary by any means , but it has made a huge difference in our daily life . And I know others may be in the same situation as us , especially if you have fidgety , sensory seeking kids like my son . So you may be searching for a quick , practical solution to your mealtime woes and this tip may be just what you need . <p> This balance cushion provides the exact sensory input he needs , letting him wiggle and squirm all he wants , while staying seated in his chair and eating his meals . It worked from day one and has continued to work since then . <p> Not only did we end our mealtime battles , but we did it without spending a lot of money . The balance cushion cost us less than $20 CAD versus the $35-45+ we would have spent on a sensory cushion ( likely more like $50+ here in Canada because there are so few places to actually buy these kinds of sensory tools from ) or the $120+ on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurdle : encouraging the kids to try new foods . <p> Hahaha ... good luck , right ? 17098 @qwx217098 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

Not just because it 's such a great art activity , but also because it 's part of the new Light and Reflections series . Today 's topic is art ! <p> We have been using our light table for so many different types of explorations , but we have yet to really focus on and explore art . Despite my mom being a professional artist , I really struggle with coming up with art projects to do with my boys , especially when they 're still so little . However , I think that I have managed to come up with a very awesome ( and somewhat clever ) art project for the light table .

Of course you are , you 're still reading my post , are n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J set out to create some art . He selected one roll at a time and with some assistance from me , started cutting and sticking pieces of washi tape to the transparency . He cut the tape to various lengths and happily layered them . He was quite purposeful with the tape placement . J was insistent on using a set amount of tape pieces from each roll he selected and carefully placed them until they were just right . <p> J also eventually figured out a way to cut the washi tape without any assistance from me .

Since I wanted to present the art in the best way possible , I taped it to the window in our living room so that the natural light could filter through the transparency and its multiple layers of washi tape .

Some are hard to find copies of too , so you might need to check your local library for a couple of these titles . <p> The first book that I ever read about hyperlexia was this one . I downloaded it on my kindle the night of J 's diagnosis and quickly read through it , digesting as much information as I could handle . It 's really a book that I should reread again to see if there 's anything I might have missed the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of your hyperlexia reading list . <p> This book is beautifully written and is a wonderful read for parents of hyperlexic children . Although , I do admit , I got choked up quite a few times while reading it because it was like reliving J 's toddlerhood . That and I decided to read this book around the time my grandpa died so I was an emotional mess . Definitely worth the read though ! <p> Written by yours truly , this eBook is a practical guide to everyday challenges and issues common in children with hyperlexia . Loaded with easy strategies that you can implement today , Beyond the Letterstackles 30 different challenges and issues , including social skills , WH- questions , pronoun reversals , and more . <p> This book has been highly recommended to me numerous times . Yet , I have n't been able to get my hands on a copy . Of course , my local library does n't carry it . But the reviews for this book are fabulous and numerous parents in the hyperlexia support groups recommend it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then definitely check it out ! <p> One of main researchers and key advocates for hyperlexia is Phyllis Kupperman . Lots of parents have worked with her personally and she has done lots of research and writing about hyperlexia . This reading comprehension kit would be a great practical solution ! Lots of parents recommend it . I personally have n't checked it out yet due mainly to the price . <p> A practical curriculum for working on reading comprehension , this book has fabulous reviews . Again , I have not personally checked it out , but one of the reviews on Amazon loved it for her hyperlexic son . <p> This book is quite different from all the others on this list . Instead of offering practical suggestions and information about hyperlexia , this book explores the world of numbers as Daniel Tammet sees it . He has hypernumeracy and this is the only information that I have come across that really touches on the topic . An interesting read nonetheless ! 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

@@23062220 @3062220/ <h> Thursday , November 05 , 2015 <p> Essential oils seem to be the " in thing " lately , popping up everywhere . You probably have a friend ( or two ! ) who sells them . And you probably have a hippy friend who 's been using them for decades . Or maybe that 's just me . <p> But , regardless , here 's the thing . Essential oils are trending because many families , like mine , have seen dramatic improvements in daily life thanks to them . <p> I first became interested in using essential oils when I found out the wait list to get my son assessed for autism would take anywhere from 12-18 months . I needed some strategies and tools to make his life - and ours - easier as soon as possible . I did n't want to have to struggle for another year or longer . We needed help . <p> It was at this point that I started searching for natural alternatives to help with his sensory issues and anxiety . We started trying things like fermented foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy . I also invested in some essential oils to try . <p> My son was more focused . His emotional outbursts and sensory meltdowns were less intense and less frequent . He started tolerating and trying new things . Things that , in the past , were simply too overwhelming for him . A dab of vetiver helped him enjoy his dad 's weekly basketball games , even if he had to hug his ears with his elbows to dampen the noisiness . Some drops of lavender in the bathtub helped him relax and sleep better . <p> Simply put , essential oils are working for us . So I 'm not giving them up any time soon . <p> Perhaps you have been curious about all this essential oils buzz , but just do n't know where to start . Thankfully , I have more than one hippy friend who could guide me when we first started using essential oils , so I could ask them millions of questions in the beginning . Maybe you do n't have one of those hippy friends .

Educate Yourself About Essential Oils <p> Just to be clear , I am not a trained aromatherapist . I am just passionate about essential oils because they have worked for my family . The information presented here is merely an introduction to the topic of using essential oils and is not meant to replace traditional medical advice . It is also , by no means , thorough . It 's just basic tips and suggestions to help you get started on your essential oil journey . The items below are what we use and love . <p> Okay , with that disclosure out of the way , let 's continue on . <p> I knew that essential oils had powerful healing benefits , so before I purchased any essential oils , I set out to educate myself . I wanted to know everything I could about essential oil safety , applications , and the types of essential oils available . <p> These two books were invaluable resources ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our essential oil journey . <p> This book is like the essential oil bible ! It includes over 600 recipes to use around the home , for beauty routines , and for boosting your own health . The DIY blends in this book are amazing ! So before you buy or use any essential oils , I recommend reading through this book to help familiarize yourself with essential oils . If you have an interest in using essential oils for autism , then I highly recommend skipping the section on autism in this book as the information is extremely dated . Instead , read about the best essential oils for autism here . <p> If you are wanting to use essential oils with your child , then this book is a must have . It describes , in detail , how to use essential oils safely with children and even includes a nice table of what essential oils are good to use for certain ages . But what I love most about this book is that I can look up a condition in the book 's " A-Z of Conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to croup , this book covers everything you need to start using essential oils for a healthy child . <p> Another fabulous resource to check out is the Organic Facts Essential Oils database .

So ask yourself : <p> Do you want to replace chemical laden cleaners with essential oils ? <p> Do you want to swap your traditional beauty routine for something more natural ? <h> Essential Oil Safety : Learn About How to Use Essential Oils Safely <p> Have you wondered , " Which essential oils are safe for children ?

So always research the safety of oils that you are interested in before using them with small children . Here are some good resources to check out regarding the safe use of essential oils with children : <p> I personally avoid multi-level marketing companies , especially the essential oil ones , for a couple of reasons . First , I dislike their marketing approach . Second , A lot of the reps for these MLM companies are uneducated about essential oil safety and therefore , spread a lot of misinformation . Third , they are unnecessarily expensive . That 's my personal choice . You can decide for yourself whether or not these brands are right for you and your family . <p> When I was deciding on a brand , I researched online about specific brands and companies . I also asked my aromatherapy friends which brands they use and enjoy . Armed with that knowledge , I was able to make an informed decision about what brands to try . I primarily use Aura Cacia essential oils . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety until you find the ones that work best for you and your family .

But , if I had to pick just three must have essential oils ( or the essentials - ha ! ) , then I would suggest picking up the following . These three oils are safe for all ages , have a variety of uses and applications , and will be the most used oils in your house . <p> Lavender is an absolute must have and safe for all ages . It can be used to treat cuts , scraps , and burns . It calms kids and promotes better sleep .

I also like to diffuse it when anyone in our house shows signs of getting sick . <p> Lemon is great for adding to blends ( to make them smell nice ! ) and for using as a cleaner . It is also a wonderful oil to use to treat common cold symptoms . I also like to add a few drops to our foaming hand soap in the kitchen . <h> Must Have Essential Oil Supplies <p> There are a few items that I suggest you purchase to start enjoying your essential oils , including a diffuser , carrier oils , and glass containers to store homemade essential oil blends in . <p> Investing in a diffuser or two is a good idea since diffusing is the easiest way to get the benefits of essential oils . We use this color changing mist diffuser nearly every day , sometimes multiple times per day if someone is on the verge of getting sick . <p> If you plan to apply essential oils on the skin , then you will need some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your skin . We like to use sweet almond oil and coconut oil as our carrier oils , but you can use vegetable oils or olive oil as well . <p> You will want to get dark glass bottles , either amber or cobalt blue in color , to keep the essential oils from spoiling . <p> I always have a glass roller bottle , premixed with my DIY calm and focused child essential oil blend , stuffed in my purse for when it is needed or when we are traveling . You can also premix blends for cuts and scrapes in roller bottles ( diluted in carrier oils of course ! ) so that when your kids get hurt , you can quickly apply some essential oils to help with the healing process . <p> As with the roller bottles , use either amber or cobalt blue glass bottles . <p> We use our spray bottle filled with the DIY calm and focused child blend every single morning .

And trust me , this type of xylophone will be your favorite as it makes no noise . <p> To make the page , I sewed two strips of brown felt to make the base .

To make the mallets , I cut a rectangle piece of grey felt . I then folded it in half , hot glued it , and then repeated . The hot glue helped to make the mallets sturdy . During the first hot glue stage , I also glued a long piece of ribbon to each mallet so that the mallets could be attached to the quiet book page . I then hot glued a large white pom pom onto the end of each mallet . <p> As you can probably see in the pictures , I cut a slit for the ribbon to go through at the bottom of the page .

It was hard to find bulbs for it so it was quickly retired . However , I kept the pegs , saving them for some future project . So when we designed our light table , I always imagined making a light bright tabletop for it . Well , it finally became a reality ! Cue the excitement because it is AWESOME ! 17101 @qwx217101 <h> How to Make a Giant Homemade Light Bright for Kids <p> So I sent my husband to Rona with the dimensions of the light table and one light bright peg . His mission was to test out the light bright peg in a piece of peg board that could be purchased . If it did n't fit , which I figured it would n't , he was to purchase some hardboard so that we could design our own . He ended up coming home with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dimensions of our light table . <p> Using the width of my level as I guide , I drew a frame around the hardboard . I then started measuring a grid of 1/2 " x 1/2 " squares . It was a tedious , tedious task . I then marked off alternating intersections so that we could achieve that staggered look of the original Lite Brite . I apologize for the not so great picture . I 'm still trying to figure out how to work this new DSLR camera of mine . <p> Then my husband set off to drill all the spots marked with an x . Yes , all 1430 of them ! Did I mention he was doing this in the garage when the temperatures were lower than -40 C ? I love my husband ! He informs me that he used a 11/64 drill bit to drill the holes . He suggests going the next size up to compensate for paint build up , which I will explain in a bit . <p> Once the board was drilled and sanded , I gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint . I then gave it two coats of Mod Podge to seal it up good . However , lots of the holes ended up covered with paint and/or Mod Podge . So I poked every single hole with a toothpick until they were all opened up . Yes , all 1430 of them ! <p> Then I tried a light bright peg . Oh no ! It did n't fit very well . We had forgot to compensate for the paint when my husband drilled the holes . How disappointing ! <p> So my husband offered to redrill all the holes . Yes , all 1430 of them again ! PS : My husband is awesome . <p> It was a long tedious process , but it was so worth it . It looks absolutely incredible . I am so excited to show it off .

Just thinking that it may be harder to gain perspective of what one is making w/ the pegs since you 're looking down on top of it instead of being able to step back from it for viewing ( and the kids ' height puts them much closer to the working surface ) . Does that deter the kids at all do you think ? <p> Interesting question .

@@23062240 @3062240/ <h> Tuesday , July 29 , 2014 <p> So I recently claimed that rainbow shredded coconut was my favorite sensory bin filler ever . I take that back because I had not yet discovered the awesomeness that is rainbow dyed chickpeas . There are so many reasons why these rainbow chickpeas are now our new favorite sensory bin filler . First of all , they are simply gorgeous . But they are also ridiculously simple to make since there is practically zero drying time involved . <h> Rainbow Dyed Chickpeas Sensory Play Idea for Kids <p> But these are n't edible . However , you can make them edible . Although , still do n't let your kids eat them . <p> Let me dazzle you with a few more pictures before I spill the beans ( ha ! ) on how to make these rainbow dyed chickpeas . As you can see , little hands could not resist touching them . First , there were two hands . <p> For each color of the rainbow , I put 1.5 cups of chickpeas and about 5-8 squirts of liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys shake and mix the contents until the chickpeas were well coated . You may need to add more liquid watercolors to get complete bean coverage . I highly suggest adding a few squirts at first and then adding one additional squirt at a time until they are well coated . <p> Now here 's the magical thing about dyeing dried chickpeas . They dry almost instantly . Seriously . Within minutes , the chickpeas were dry to the touch . That means you do n't have to wait for hours for them to dry . Yay ! <p> The other reason why rainbow dyed chickpeas are simply the best sensory bin filler : their weight . Since chickpeas are heavier than dyed oats or salt or rice or coconut , they offer a lot more tactile input to sensory seeking kids . That means they are also a lot more noisy than other sensory bin fillers , but my noisy boys enjoyed that part too ! <h> How to Make Rainbow Chickpeas Video Tutorial <p> Here 's a video tutorial showing just how easy they are to make : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 19 comments : <p> With liquid watercolors , yes , the color would come off on wet hands . These chickpeas are still sitting in our sensory bin as the boys have been playing with them for about 10 days straight now . However , come storage time , I will just put them in one bag with all of the colors mixed together . Leaving them mixed together is a great invitation to sort by color the next time we play ! <p> I have never worked with gel food coloring before , but I bet it would work . You will likely have to add a touch of water or vinegar ( kind of like dyeing rice with food coloring ) to get a good color distribution . Try it out and let me know ! <p> Too Funny , did you see that your post posts in a column , and your responses print one letter at a time in a column ?

@@23062241 @3062241/ <h> Saturday , July 23 , 2016 <p> However , sometimes simple day to day activities like leaving the house or bath time can be particularly challenging for these kids . <p> So I asked other parents in my hyperlexia Facebook group what some of their current struggles are and paired them with some of the struggles that we have encountered with J to compile a list of common daily life challenges . I 've also included a detailed list of strategies to try for each of those issues so that you can hopefully find a strategy or accommodation to help you and your child . <h> Challenge #1 : Expanding Play Beyond Letters <p> I remember when J 's hyperlexia first became apparent to us it was because he would play with his letters all the time . ALL . THE . TIME . Alphabet magnets , alphabet puzzles , alphabet cookie cutters ... alphabet , alphabet , alphabet . He would never build towers , play with LEGO bricks , color and draw , or drive cars around like other kids would . Instead , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So how can you encourage your child 's play beyond the letters ? <p> Well , I am not one to discourage fascinations or take away toys that are obviously used for stimming for J. Instead , I focused on tying those favorite toys into new and novel ways to play with other materials and eventually those toys could be gently phased out of the play . Basically , I would take his interest and use it to get him interested in something new . Or to at least try something new ! <p> Strategies to try : <p> Combine new toys with old favorites ( e.g. , stamp alphabet magnets into play dough , but first encourage your child to touch , pinch , and roll the play dough ) <p> Create alphabet themed sensory bins that include lots of different items that relate to the letter and encourages kids to explore the different materials <p> Bury alphabet toys in a sensory bin and encourage them to excavate their letters out of the sensory material then try again using another type of sensory bin fillers <p> Introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , history dates , periodic table , etc. that include a lot of letters , numbers , or symbols <p> Label toys with written words , letters , or numbers to encourage initial exploration of the non-alphabet toys <p> Use a label maker , dry erase markers , or even tape and markers to label the toys <p> Do a scavenger hunt and have your child help you label things that you find <h> Challenge #2 : Poor or Awkward Conversation Skills <p> Poor and awkward conversation skills were the huge red flag for us and the main reason we knew something was going on with J. How could our child read so amazingly well , but could n't carry on a conversation with us ? And when he did try to engage in a conversation , why was he always out of context or saying really random things ? <p> Having a conversation with him was difficult and awkward . I 've already covered this particular topic in more detail in the post Conversation Skills in Kids with Hyperlexia , where I shared a majority of these strategies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pronoun reversals are common in kids with hyperlexia . J still mixes up his and her occasionally , but he was 5 1/2 before he started using the correct pronouns for himself and using he/she correctly . Up until that time , he would say things like , " J have a try " instead of " Can I have a try ? " <p> So if your hyperlexic child is still mixing up pronouns , then no worries . It is common and eventually gets sorted out , but there are definitely lots of different things you can do to work on pronouns . <h> Challenge #4 : Sensory Issues <p> Sensory issues are extremely common with kids who have hyperlexia , especially those that have an autism diagnosis as well . <p> As a parent , it is important to have a strong understanding of the different sensory systems so that you can better target your child 's sensory issues . So I highly recommend reading some books about sensory processing . Your child 's occupational therapist ( if applicable ) can also help highlight your child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child with lots of sensory input throughout the day ( there are lots of ideas to be found on my blog so just use the search function to find something that may suit your child 's needs and interests ) <p> Try to decide if there is a sensory need that is causing unexpected or inappropriate behavior ( often there is a sensory need underlying the issue and not a behavior problem ) <p> Create a travel sensory kit with fidgets , chew toys , etc. in case your child gets anxious or overwhelemed while out and about <p> Invest in some quality fidgets and stims that fit your child 's sensory needs <h> Challenge #5 : Leaving the House <p> Leaving the house was certainly difficult for us most days between the ages of two and four and a half . Our struggles usually revolved around clocks and the time never being exactly the same time on each clock . Or we were only allowed to leave the house at a precise time as defined by J. It was definitely a big challenge for us ! 17094 @qwx217094 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My son is on the spectrum but I suspect there 's an element of hyperlexia there too as he ticks all of these boxes .

But , while they may be temporarily dazzled by my son 's brilliance , it is quickly replaced by judgment , assuming I must spend hours upon hours drilling my son with math flashcards . But that 's simply not the case . <p> See , my son has hypernumeracy , which is a fancy term for saying he 's ridiculously good with numbers . <p> While most two year olds are starting to assert their independence in everyday tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell time and skip count by obscure numbers . Somewhere between ages three and five he mastered multiplication , adding and subtracting fractions , percents , and a whole bunch of other math concepts . This past summer , for instance , at age five , he taught himself ( and me ! ) Roman numerals . It was never my idea to help him learn what three million in Roman numerals is , but he learned it . And he drew them . And he lived and breathed them . Every loose part , toy , or crayon suddenly turned into Roman numerals . <p> Now that he is six , I 'm not sure what kind of math he will be learning next , but it excites me . Not sure when I will be dusting off the good old calculus textbook , but I 'm hoping it wo n't be for a few more years . Hopefully . <p> So yes , it appears like I am asking my son inappropriate math questions for his age , when his typical peers have just mastered things like counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond that and has been for years . <p> But there 's another reason why you will find me asking him these kinds of math questions . <p> He has autism . <p> As a result , he withdraws into his autism bubble frequently , where he quietly scribbles endless sequences of letters and numbers onto his Magna-Doodle , while simultaneously chewing on the string that attaches the pen to the Magna-Doodle . Or he escapes with chalk . I 'm not saying there is anything wrong with letting him seek the comfort of his own little world as I think we all benefit from seeking solace in our own ways , but there are times when I need him to be alert and focused on his surroundings . <p> In order to pull him out of his autism bubble , I need to connect with him through his love language of sorts . That love language being the concreteness of letters and numbers . He just thinks in numbers . They give J comfort because they never change . <p> Letters , symbols and signs are my closest allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , fixed in my memory . And whenever we 're lonely or happy , in the same way that you might half hum a song to yourself , we summon up our letters . When I 'm writing them out , I can forget everything else . I 'm not alone when I 'm with letters . Letters and symbols are much easier for us to grasp than spoken words , and we can be with them whenever we want . - Naokie Higashida , The Reason I Jump , p. 49 <p> So when you see me asking what appears to be inappropriate math questions for his age to my six year old , you are actually seeing me , a tired mom , trying desperately to connect and engage her son with the world around him .

I always try to enter his world and see things from his way , but I was afraid I was setting him up for failure by encouraging the math and number skills . Thank you again for posting this . <p> You 're welcome , Michael ! I 'm so happy you to connect with you through this post and make you and your son feel a little less alone .

As a bonus , I 've included a free printable cheat sheet for writing social stories . <h> What is a Social Story ? <p> A social story is a simple and effective tool for teaching kids how to do certain things , handle problem behaviors , master social skills , and navigate new or unfamiliar social situations . Social stories can be written about practically anything that your child may be struggling with from problem behaviors , such as anger or biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush your teeth or use the potty , to unfamiliar events , such as how to act at a wedding . <p> A good social story teaches the child what the expected behaviors are , as well as the expected responses . It also describes , in detail , what the situation , event , or skill requires . <p> Social stories are written to : <p> Describe an unfamiliar situation or event <p> Explain social scenarios and the expected behaviors involved <p> Help with transitions , especially into unfamiliar situations or events <p> Break down a target behavior or skill into easy to follow steps <p> Address a wide variety of problems , events , behaviors , etc . <p> Teach routines <p> Simplify goals , skills , events , or behaviors so that they can be easily learned and generalized <h> Why Should I Use a Social Story ? <p> Social stories are great for kids with autism or hyperlexia because it is a visual tool . They break complex situations and behaviors down into simple , easy-to-follow steps and increase success at mastering the skill . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responses for unfamiliar situations . They have helped my son sit quietly through a funeral , master toilet training , understand the timeline of family trips , including who we would be visiting and when , and so much more ! Even before we knew of J 's hyperlexia , social stories were instrumental in his success and mastery of a wide variety of concepts and skills ! <h> Who Can Write a Social Story ? <p> Anyone ! Yes , even you . Actually , I strongly suggest you write your own for your child because then you can personalize the social stories with details that are specific to your child . You can include your child 's name , specific dates , names of other people that will be participating , names of buildings or places you will be visiting , etc . You can also include photos of all of those specific details too ! <h> Tips for Writing a Social Story <p> Writing a social story is quite easy . All you need is a word processing program , Powerpoint , Google Docs , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have used Microsoft Word in the past . Then you just need to follow these simple tips to create your own . <h> 1 . Identify the target behavior , skill , or event in the title <p> Make the title of the social story clear and concise . It should specify exactly what the social story is about . <p> Example : How to Tie My Shoes or Wearing Glasses Social Story <h> 2 . Focus on one thing or event at a time <p> Only write about one topic per social story . You do not want to overwhelm your child . So pick one topic , such as visiting the dentist , for your social story and write only about that particular topic . <h> 3 . Use pictures to support the text <p> Most kids with autism or hyperlexia benefit from a visual support to accompany the text . Pictures aid in comprehension and help the child see what certain things about the event or thing look like ( e.g. , a picture of a dentist chair can show the child what the dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own photos , make your own drawings , or search free stock photo or clipart websites . I like to use Pixabay or Canva for finding photos to use . <h> 4 . Keep the format of the social story simple <p> Use a simple format for the social story by limiting the text on each page and by using simple colors and fonts . <p> I prefer to use simple white backgrounds for my social stories to eliminate extraneous visual distractions . Using a white background also allows for the text and accompanying photo to be the main highlight of each page . <p> I also try to keep text to a minimum on each page by trying to use only 1-2 sentences per page . <h> 5 . Break down the event or thing into simple steps <p> Try to think of every step possible involved in a certain event or skill and try to include each step in the social story . Since kids with autism or hyperlexia are literal thinkers and struggle with abstract concepts , it is best to even include the hidden implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , when using the potty , specify that we have to pull down our underwear and pants and then when we are done , pull up our underwear and pants . <h> 6 . Include exact phrases or scripts for the child to say <p> Use the social stories to teach your child expected responses for the situation . For instance , in my trick-or-treating social story , I include what a child should say ( i.e. , " Trick or treat ! " ) when at a house so that the child can repeat that exact phrase correctly while actually trick-or-treating. <h> 7 . Be descriptive and answer the WH questions about the event or thing <p> Social stories should always include descriptive sentences , which answer the WH questions like when , who , what , where , why , and how . <p> Example : I brush my teeth twice a day . Once in the morning and before I go to bed . That helps keep my teeth clean . ( These sentences describe how often , when , and why a child needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free printable brushing teeth social story while you 're here ! <h> 8 . Describe how the child , and others , should feel or react <p> Social stories should also describe how the child should feel or react to the certain event or skill . <p> Example : It is okay for me to cry at a funeral . <p> It is also important to include perspective sentences in a social story . Perspective sentences describe the feelings , thoughts , or moods of someone else . <p> Example : My parents will be so proud of me for learning how to tie my shoes by myself ! <h> 9 . Describe exactly what the child should do <p> Social stories should describe exactly what behavior is expected of the child by writing directive sentences . These directive sentences describe what the child should do during the situation or to master the skill . These directive sentences should always be written in a positive manner ( i.e. , try to avoid the words " do not " ) . <p> Example : When I watch a movie at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( A negative example would be : When I watch a movie at the movie theatre , I do not jump on my seat. ) <h> 10 . Keep the language simple and positive <p> Avoid metaphors , idioms , or other abstract concepts . Kids with autism or hyperlexia are literal thinkers so try to keep the language simple to reflect that . As mentioned earlier , the language should always focus on the positive . The social stories should focus on what the child should or can do and not on what the child can or can not do . Or , at the very least , reword any negative or unexpected behaviors as positively as you can . <h> 11 . Write the social story in first-person <p> Write it from the perspective of the child . It will help them relate to the story ! <h> 12 . Write the social story in present tense <p> Always write the social story in present tense . <h> Bonus tip <p> Social stories should include 2-5 descriptive or perspective sentences for each directive sentence .

@@23062251 @3062251/ <h> Friday , January 08 , 2016 <p> Sometime last year I had a Tweet go viral . I saw a steady stream of traffic from Twitter for the first time ever and it was crazy awesome . It was then that I realized that Twitter could possibly be a good source of traffic for me if I put in a little effort . <p> So in September 2015 , I decided to start actively growing my Twitter account . At the time I had less than 900 followers . I just passed 5000 followers today ( YAY ! ) . <p> Here 's how many new followers I got per month : <p> September = 469 <p> October = 1740 <p> November =1142 <p> December 1157 <p> Then in December , I had two semi-viral Tweets . Here 's a look at how my daily Twitter traffic was for most of 2015 . You can see the nice viral spikes . You may have to click on the photo to see a larger version of it . <p> Now let 's take a closer look at how my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing Twitter " time period . You can see a steady growth in my traffic referrals . <p> In September , Twitter did n't even make the top 25 referrals list . Yet , in October and November , it was number 10 . Then in December , it was my sixth highest source of referral traffic . Sixth ! <p> So what did I do to suddenly rock my Twitter ? Here are some of the Twitter strategies that I used to grow my Twitter account and increase my traffic referrals . <h> Twitter Tips for Bloggers <p> 1 . Include a photo ( when possible ) with every tweet . Tweets that use a photo consistently get more engagement than those without . My top tweets for the last few months ( according to Twitter analytics ) have been a tweet with a photo . Here 's a screenshot from my Twitter analytics for September-December 2015 . Note the pic.twitter.com URL . That means a photo was included . <p> 3 . Use hashtags with every tweet . Hashtags make it easier for people to find tweets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it harder for people to find you . How many hashtags you include is really up to you . I like to max out all 140 characters in my tweet by sneaking in as many hashtags as I can . <p> 4 . Create and use the Twitter lists feature . Twitter lists are a great way to find great content to retweet , like , and comment on . It 's also a great way to find new followers . So when someone adds you to a Twitter list , check out the list . Guaranteed you will be able to find some new people to follow from the list because they obviously tweet content similar to you . You can also subscribe to other people 's lists . To find the lists that you have been added to , click the lists tab and then click " Member of " <p> Here 's a screenshot of my lists . That first list is the one that I use every single day because those tweeters use a lot of photos when tweeting , which is precisely the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tweet a lot . Twitter moves extremely fast . So feel free to tweet a lot . Personally , I schedule 16 tweets per day with Buffer . Then I pop over to my Twitter lists at least once a day and retweet some things from there . So I probably tweet over 20 times a day , at the minimum . <p> 6 . Engage your followers in conversations . There are many bloggers who just automate their Twitter accounts and you can tell which ones they are ( they are likely also the ones spamming your Twitter messages inbox ) . There is zero interaction on their account . Do n't be one of those tweeters , please . Instead , comment on tweets you like and carry on conversations with your followers by asking questions , saying thanks , or whatever . <p> 7 . When sharing other 's content , tag them . Whenever I get tagged by someone who shares any of my blog posts , I always like it . I even retweet and comment occasionally . I like to know when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tag them too . Also , when you tag another person , there 's the likelihood that they will retweet your tweet . That means you get shown to their followers , which could mean a few new followers for you as well . <p> 8 . Do n't just share your own content . Nobody likes a self-promoter . Just like any other social media platform , tweet other 's content as well as your own . I do n't follow any particular formula , I just try to intersperse my content with other 's . <p> 9 . Take advantage of Twitter tools . My favorite tools for Twitter are Buffer ( I use the paid plan ) and Crowdfireapp ( again , I use the paid version ) . <p> Buffer has this awesome optimized schedule feature , so I can tweet at ideal times . Times when my followers are online and likely to engage . I also love their analytics . I can sort my past tweets by popularity , best clicks , etc. and easily reschedule them . I primarily focus on resharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to get more traffic to my blog . <p> Crowdfire is what I use to find new followers . I also use it to unfollow those who are n't interested in following me . This app is what helped me grow quickly from 900 to 5000 in just over 3 months . <p> 10 . Use your Twitter analytics . You can find all sorts of great information in your analytics to help you get more followers , increase engagement , and find out what is and is n't working . <p> 11 . Add your Twitter handle to Shareaholic . Shareaholic is a popular social sharing widget . Did you know that you can set it up so that when someone clicks the Tweet button , it tags your Twitter profile ? Yep ! Find out how to set it up here . <p> Oh and I should also note that I was also trying to grow my other Twitter account at the same time . It grew rapidly as well considering it was created only a few months ago . 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

@@23062259 @3062259/ <h> Friday , July 24 , 2015 <p> We recently borrowed a trampoline from my brother-in-law . My husband has been wanting to get a trampoline for the kids for awhile , but I have been resistant simply because the kids are still so young . But I knew that a trampoline would be perfect for my oldest who jumps on everything constantly due to his proprioceptive and vestibular sensory seeking needs . So last weekend , my husband spent hours setting up the trampoline and just recently I did a quick dollar store hack to make the trampoline safer for the kids . 17100 @qwx217100 <p> While setting up the trampoline , I opened what was supposed to be a sealed plastic container holding all of the springs . Instead , I found about two inches of water in the bottom of the container . That means a majority of the springs were rusty . We cleaned off the rust as best we could with some CLR , but we definitely needed to add some extra protection . I certainly did n't want the kids to possibly scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me of this simple trampoline safety hack using pool noodles . I remember seeing it all over Pinterest before and I 'm not sure who came up with this genius idea , but it is brilliant .

I then used an utility knife to cut the pool noodles to the appropriate length . Then I made a slit on one side so that the pool noodles could slide right over the springs . My kids helped out by putting all the pool noodles on the springs . They even arranged the pool noodles into a colorful pattern . <p> Once all the springs were covered , we pulled the mats back over top and secured the mats to the frame of the trampoline . Double protection , no exposed springs , and yet , such a super easy and inexpensive hack ! <p> **And as always , please supervise your children on the trampoline at all times. ** 17098 @qwx217098 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

I particularly loved the bright , whimsical illustrations . They are quite different from other books . Both boys loved this book and often fought over who could read it for a bedtime story . <p> This book shows the relationships between letters , words , and sentences and I think it would make an excellent activity for the felt board .

K made me read this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree " until I started reading it . <p> My weekly book lists are n't complete until there is at least one ABC book on it .

It 's also available as a book on CD at our library . <p> We are most likely sending our boys to French immersion school when the time comes and so we have been exposing our boys to the French language off and on for some time . This book has simple animal pictures with the English and French words underneath . Both boys enjoyed looking at this book . <p> J loves the TV show Dinosaur Train so when I found this opposite book at the library , I just had to sign it out .

@@23062262 @3062262/ <h> Monday , October 17 , 2016 <p> If you think teaching idioms to your kids is like pulling teeth , then you 're probably right . However , it 's even more interesting with hyperlexic and autistic kids because of their literal thinking . <p> So bear with me here as I teach you the bread and butter of how to teach idioms to kids , with or without hyperlexia . I certainly hope you 're all ears because I have been bending over backwards to put this post together . In fact , I 've worked my butt off to write this post and my head was spinning with all of the possible ideas for teaching idioms . <p> And as you can tell , I 've got some time on my hands if I am willing to cram in as many idioms and metaphors as I can into this introduction . It was really a piece of cake though and I 'm quite over the moon about it . <p> I guess you could say I 've gone bananas ! So I will put my foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idioms might not be terribly exciting for most kids . However , I know my hyperlexic son finds them hilarious and entertaining , especially when we learn about them through play . You can find tons of printable task cards , games , and more on Teachers Pay Teachers , but here are a couple of free games to practice idioms . No TPT account required either ! <p> I usually try to avoid using idioms and metaphors in my everyday conversations with the kids , but sometimes they slip out . Just like a good cliche slips out occasionally when writing . When I do say an idiom during conversations , I usually pause and explain the idiom directly to the kids . For instance , if I say something like " when pigs fly , " I can point out to the kids how unlikely and impossible it would be for pigs to fly , meaning " it will never happen . " <p> 5 . Have Your Child Draw the Idioms <p> Give your child an idiom and challenge them to draw the literal translation of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous these sayings are and how they can not possibly mean what they say , if translated literally . After they 've drawn the literal translation , encourage them to draw the courage meaning of the idiom . <p> 6 . Write Scripts to Practice Idioms <p> Kids with hyperlexia benefit from social and speech scripts . You could encourage them to practice using idioms and metaphors in their conversations by writing examples of how and when to use the idioms . For instance , you could write a social script about having a scratchy , dry throat using sentences like , " Wow , my throat is dry and my voice is all hoarse . I have a frog in my throat !

That young woman seriously missed out on a fantastic presentation by Dr. Grandin . <p> Anyway , as an autism mom , Dr. Grandin was a delight and an inspiration to listen to .

The link to download the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx217100 <p> 1 . Teach Social Skills Like They 're Living in a Foreign Country <p> Social skills are something kids with autism struggle with . My son certainly does . Dr. Grandin emphasized that we have to teach these kids social skills as if they were learning the rules and norms for a foreign country . We have to physically teach them these social skills . <p> 2 . Stretch These Kids ! <p> We 're not talking about doing stretches to warm up your body for exercising here . Instead , Dr. Grandin stressed the importance of stretching the kids to do things outside of their comfort zone . Pushing them to try different things . Dr. Grandin shared a story about how her mother was going to take her to her aunt 's ranch . Dr. Grandin did n't want to go . So her mother gave her a choice : go for one week or go for the entire summer . Not going was not an option . <p> This concept of stretching is something my husband and I discuss a lot . We love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him outside of his comfort zone before ( see here for an example ) . I have to admit though , that before J received the hyperlexia diagnosis , we struggled finding appropriate ways to stretch him . Now I know to use his hyperlexia to our advantage and help us guide him to try new things . <p> 3 . To Touch is to Perceive <p> Dr. Grandin also emphasized hands on sensory experiences for kids . I could feel her passion about this topic when she spoke and , obviously , sensory play is something I am passionate about too . Kids need to touch , feel , and experience objects in order to truly understand what they are . <p> 4 . Wait ! Give Them a Chance to Speak <p> " Wait ! " Dr. Grandin shouted . She said that waiting is one of the best things you can do to help your child learn to speak . You have to give the kids a chance to express themselves . <p> I like to think that I already do well with this point . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wait for him to say something , even if it 's not an appropriate response , because it is giving him the confidence he needs to learn how to have conversations . And it shows that I do value his input . And it shows that I will wait for him to try expressing himself on his own . <p> After the presentation , I had the chance to meet Dr. Grandin . I waited patiently to buy a copy of one of her books and I waited patiently again to get it signed by her . But what I was really hoping for was a chance to pick her brain , no matter how briefly , about hyperlexia . A few times throughout her presentation , Dr. Grandin made references to kids with dyslexia . References to dyslexia always seem to agitate me . Probably because in my head I am shouting , " And what about hyperlexia ? ! " Anyway , I was really hoping she could offer some insight into working with hyperlexic kids . <p> So I asked her , " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very precise , textbook definition of hyperlexia . Then she went on to explain the importance of short , concrete narratives for these kids . She told me to avoid the abstract questions and focus on asking concrete and specific questions to help with comprehension .

@@23062273 @3062273/ <h> Wednesday , September 21 , 2016 <p> When I first learned about hyperlexia , all I wanted to know was how can I use this knowledge to help my son ? I knew WH questions were hard and I knew pronouns were confusing for him , but what could I do to actually help him improve these areas of speech and language ? <p> There are tons of great ABC games and apps that would certainly appeal to hyperlexic kids , but that is not what I want to cover here . Instead , I want to focus on the best types of games and apps to help kids with hyperlexia improve their comprehension , speech , and social skills . <p> The suggestions below focus primarily on improving their language skills so that these kids can express themselves better , answer WH questions with confidence , and build conversation skills . <p> Playing games with your hyperlexic kids is not only good for social skills , but they can be a great way to improve their speech skills as well . You can also modify games that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like your child 's speech therapist likely already does . As an example , you can see how we modified Guess Who to target WH questions using this free printable . <p> However , I wanted to focus on specific types of games that are really good for kids with hyperlexia . <p> 1 . Barrier Games <p> Barrier games are one type of game that are perfect for kids with hyperlexia . Barrier games are a great way to target expressive speech , vocabulary , following directions , prepositions , and more ! I highly suggest reading this article about how barrier games are great for language enrichment . <p> You can use two whiteboards to play your own barrier games , taking turns drawing and describing what you are drawing . You can also buy a magnetic barrier game set or you can try one of our free printable barrier games below . <p> I spy games are also great to play with hyperlexic kids . If you play the verbal version , then be sure to use WH questions similar to " I spy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see ? " That encourages them to learn the differences between you and I and that some times those two words can refer to the same person . It is also a way to model a small conversation , encourage your kids to be descriptive and look at the parts of objects , and increase vocabulary . You can read more about the benefits of playing the verbal version here ( see point #1 ) . <p> However , playing visual I spy games is great too ! I have made a ton of free printable I spy games for kids that my son loves to do . The written word is paired with a visual picture to aid in comprehension and to introduce new vocabulary . <p> I also encourage you to play these printable I spy versions alongside your child and ask WH questions as they search . For instance , you can ask how many of one object they find , what color certain objects are , what shapes certain objects are , etc . <p> 3 . Hangman <p> Another game that is great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards anything that involves lots of letters , so hangman is a great game to play with them . <p> The reason why hangman is helpful for them is because it 's formulaic and encourages them to ask and answer questions .

Something like " Is there a letter ? " and " Yes , there 's a letter " or " No , there 's no letter . " <p> Your child will also enjoy being the person who fills in the blanks and comes up with the word or phrase for the game . If so , then they have to practice answering verbal questions , which is something they find tricky . <p> 4 . Dress Up Games or Paper Dolls <p> Games such as Raccoon Rumpus and toys such as the Melissa &amp; Doug Magnetic Dress Up Sets are a great way for kids to work on pronouns , which if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how problematic pronouns can be .

I can not emphasis enough how important it is to practice WH questions with these kids as it aids in comprehension , as well as conversation skills . Here are a few fun games that target WH questions . <p> Apps are a great way to help hyperlexic children improve their comprehension , language skills , and social skills .

Add 4-5 drops of lavender essential oil and some purple liquid watercolors ( how much you will use depends on the size of the container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> You can include scoops and spoons with this sensory bin , but both of my boys really enjoy just playing with the texture of the soap foam , swishing the bubbly mixture back and forth between their hands . Soap foam on its own is extremely calming and relaxing to play with , but the added olfactory component is a nice touch ! <p> Just look at all those wonderful bubbles ! <p> Here 's a sample of my four year old playing with the lavender soap foam , complete with some bubble popping at the start : 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

@@23062285 @3062285/ <h> Tuesday , October 01 , 2013 <p> Winter is just around the corner for us and I am trying to prepare myself ( and my sanity ! ) for what could be another long winter . So we installed a swing in our basement quite a few weeks ago . We have a few different swings that we can switch between , but we do n't yet have a good sensory type swing . So after supper one evening , I thought about whether or not a woven wrap could easily convert into a sensory cuddle swing . Turns out , it works awesome and the boys are addicted to it ! <p> Babywearing has been a huge part of my life , especially since K was born . One of my favorite baby carriers is the gorgeous Ellevill Zara Deli woven wrap that you can see in the pictures . I converted it into a swing without having to make any modifications to the wrap itself . <p> However , before I show you how I set up this swing , I need to include a disclaimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not , I repeat DO NOT , substitute a sheet , blanket , or stretchy wrap for this swing . They do not function the same way as a woven wrap . Also , always be sure to test the swing yourself , ensuring the wrap is well knotted , before putting your child in it . I sat on the swing once I set it up and it held me up . There . Glad that 's off my chest ! Now on to the fun part ... Update on December 4 , 2013 : I have successfully tied a homemade stretchy wrap into a sensory swing . It is strong enough to hold me and has been in use for over two months straight now for multiple hours . It has not come undone . So the tutorial is doable with a stretchy wrap using more knots , but please use your discretion . Thanks . <p> Our swing is set up in a wide doorway by screwing two eye bolts ( sorry , do n't recall the size off the top of my head ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can each hold up to 300 and some odd pounds . You can see the set up below . <p> I knotted my woven wrap around the carabiner hooks . Make sure the knot is nice and tight . Be sure to test the swing after it is hung . <p> Like I mentioned , the boys are loving this new swing . They have tried sitting in it in various ways . I have also tried tying the wrap in different ways to make different " seats " for them to sit on . For instance , J enjoys using it like a hammock , but also enjoys sitting it in and spinning around . <p> K , on the other hand , likes to use it to fly like an airplane or sit in it like a jolly jumper . 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <p> Hey I just wanted to let everyone know that making a hammock with a bed sheet is amazing and requires no eyelits .

@@23062286 @3062286/ <h> Tuesday , February 16 , 2016 <p> I 'm making 2016 the year of the quest for a million monthly pageviews . It is my hope that by the end of the year , my blog will be getting one million pageviews per month . Although I 'm nowhere close to reaching that goal in the next month or two , I do think it is possible . <p> Here 's why : I have already dramatically increased my pageviews in just the past 5-6 weeks . January 2016 was my highest traffic month to date , but February is already on pace to beat that high by almost 40,000 extra pageviews . In fact , if February stays on the pace it 's at , then I will have grown my blog by 100,000 pageviews since December . <p> How ? <p> Just by making a few simple changes to my blog using Google Analytics . <p> I took a free video class on how to skyrocket your blog pageviews with Google Analytics and was quickly fascinated . So I bought the accompanying eBook Skyrocket Blog Pagviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've only done a few of the challenges , but within a few days , my traffic was increasing dramatically ! <p> This eBook showed me how to link to exactly the right content instead of just picking random things that I think would fit and I think that 's why traffic has gone up so dramatically ! <p> However , I found a few challenges in the eBook just did n't fill in the gaps that I needed so I started exploring other sections of the Google Analytics dashboard . While doing so , I discovered an amazing navigation summary section ( see the screenshot below ) . The idea is to link the previous page path posts to the post you are looking at and then link that post to the ones under next page path . It 's very similar to challenges #15 , #25 , and #29 from Skyrocket Blog Pagviews Using Google Analytics , but this screen allows you to focus on more than just your most popular posts . So definitely a section to check out if you are trying to improve any posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can scroll to the bottom of this post to see exactly how I am linking related posts without a fancy widget or plug in . <p> The eBook that I mentioned above uses Google+ for a lot of the challenges , so I started using Google+ smarter by using my top keywords from Webmaster Tools . You can find some keyword information in Google Analytics , but it is n't as comprehensive as what you 'll find in webmaster tools . <h> Blogging Tip #3 : Write new blog posts based off of popular keyword searches <p> There 's so much useful information in webmaster tools about my most popular keyword searches including their current page rank and click through rate . So I started building off of those most popular keyword searches by writing new blog posts related to those keywords . For more ideas on how to use these top keywords , check out challenge #6 in Skyrocket Blog Pagviews Using Google Analytics . <h> Blogging Tip #4 : Decrease bounce rates of popular posts <p> You can find your bounce rates for any of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly in finding the popular posts that had really high bounce rates . There 's lots of great bounce rate challenges , such as challenge #21 , in Skyrocket Blog Pagviews Using Google Analytics to try . And I have reduced my overall bounce rate from 74% to 72% in just a short period of time thanks to the tips in the book . <p> Specifically , I wanted to fix those popular posts by decreasing the bounce rates . Unfortunately , no matter what I try on Edible Sludge Sensory Play , I just can not get the bounce rate down . Although it has moved from 86% bounce rate to 82% , but it 's still way too high . So obviously , I need to keep tweaking it since linking to related posts at the bottom does n't seem to be working as well as I had hoped . <p> Another popular post on my blog is the Free Printable Visual Daily Schedule . I considered making this post a subscriber freebie , but really I just want to help out as many autism families as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subscriber freebie . However , the bounce rate was way too high . At the beginning of January , the bounce rate was 78% . Now six weeks later the bounce rate is 45% . Woah , right ? <p> I have been in the process of building a shop for my blog - from scratch , nonetheless , because I refuse to pay for a service - so I moved all the links to download the printable schedule cards to a page in the shop ( see it here ) . Now I get extra pageviews and a lower bounce rate . PLUS , when I finally get around to making a paid version , readers will already be funneled into my shop , which will hopefully lead to conversions on the paid version . Now I just need to get that paid version done . I also plan to implement this strategy with other popular posts that have free printables. 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

They already show a strong interest in music and love listening to music , doing music activities , and dancing to the various rhythms around us . Simply put , it has been easy and natural for me to encourage a love for music in my children . <p> Yet , I know there are lots of parents who struggle with this area . And the benefits of music are well known . So how can someone who is self-proclaimed as " unmusical " encourage their kids to love and appreciate music ? Well , worry no more ! I 've got you covered with these tips that will help you explore and encourage a love for music with your kids , starting right from infancy . 17100 @qwx217100 <h> 1 . Listen to Music <p> Okay , this tip probably seems extremely obvious . However , there is a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what or what not to listen to . Well , my general rule is to listen to music that you enjoy listening to because you will likely have to listen to certain music over and over . So it definitely helps if it 's something you already enjoy . <p> However , one genre of music that most people struggle with is classical music . Classical music can be overwhelming as there is so much to choose from . So if you are unsure where to start in your classical music journey , I would start with these : <h> 2 . Move to Music <p> Encouraging your child to move to music can help them explore and learn about tempo and rhythm . And dancing to music is one great way to do so . Even infants can take part . Simply pop them into a baby carrier , then snuggle and dance away ! <h> 3 . Sing Songs &amp; Rhymes <p> It is so easy to incorporate music by singing songs and doing rhymes together . You do n't have to be a great singer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're awesome anyway . Trust me . And the sillier the better . Both my husband and I will make up silly songs throughout the day and it always makes the boys happy . You can check out some of the songs and rhymes that we love here . <h> 4 . Play and Learn Using Music Toys <p> There are lots of toys available that can introduce your children to music , but my absolute favorite music toy is the Symphony in B. It 's great for learning about instruments and what they sound like , as well as for learning about instrument families , conducting , tempo , and so much more . You can read my full review here . I can not recommend this toy enough . It is AWESOME ! <p> I will also include toy instruments or instruments designed for kids here , even though they might not necessarily be " toys .

Fill some plastic eggs with rice , beans , or even bells to make some shaker eggs . Then seal with glue or tape . You can see two of our homemade shaker eggs below . <h> 6 . Read Books About Music <p> Probably one of the easiest things that you can do to encourage a love for music in your kids is to read to them about music . So here is a list of music books to check out : <h> 8 . Take a Music Class/Lessons <p> Of course , you can always sign your child up for music lessons . Lots of places even offer baby friendly music courses . So it is possible to expose the littlest ones to music right from the beginning , you just have to look and see what 's offered in your area . <h> 9 . Attend Live Music Performances <p> Depending on where you live , you can take your child to live music performances ranging from a night at the symphony to a local band concert to the free stage at the jazz festival . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children !

Let Them Make Noise ! <p> Singing loudly , banging pots and pans , clapping , shaking containers , etc. are some of a toddler 's favorite past times . Sure it can often be headache-inducing , but I say , " Let them make noise ! " Doing so allows your child to explore the following things : <p> Cause and effect ( e.g. , hitting pot with a spoon makes a cool sound ) <p> Volume and dynamics ( e.g. , hitting the pots harder makes the sound louder versus small taps making a small sound ) <p> Tempo ( e.g. , hitting fast versus slow ) <p> Pitch ( e.g. , singing high versus low or water volume and its relation to pitch in a water xylophone ) <p> Creativity through songwriting <p> Imaginative play ( e.g. , pretending pots are drums ) <h> 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can look at pictures and listen to audio clips to see what the instruments look and sound like . But , my boys ' personal favorite , is to actually try playing the instruments . You can start with simple instruments like a triangle or tambourine or recorder , but your kids will love to play around on a piano or guitar or trumpet or whatever real instrument you might have access to .

I was still trying to get used to using it . <p> So I decided to make a homemade book filled with quotes and positive affirmations about giving birth . And the goal was to use my Cameo to make it . I knew it was going to be the perfect gift since my friend was feeling nervous about the upcoming birth . She had had a difficult and traumatic first birth and really needed the support and encouragement . She needed to be reminded that this birth would be different and could be a positive experience .

I dictated and he typed . As an aside , it 's funny to read any book together now since he will often say " space " when he sees the space between the words . <p> J also helped with a lot of the gluing and loading the paper into the Cameo to be cut or drawn on . <p> K spent a lot of time rearranging my craft supplies , making it difficult to locate things I needed . That was his primary mode of " helping . " <p> K also loved playing with the scraps of paper and cardstock after I cut out the shapes I needed . Sensory play right there what with all the different textures , colors , and designs the paper had to offer . <p> J and K also enjoyed reading through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun pointing out specific letters and colors , describing what words meant , and looking at the pictures that were drawn . <p> Craft time does n't have to be just for the kids .

It is moldable like play dough , but snaps cleanly like silly putty . It is super simple to make , uses only two ingredients ( or three if you want colored dough ) , and takes only a few minutes to prepare . It uses ingredients you likely already have on hand , requires no cooking , and is easy to clean up since it just melts when water is added to it . Intrigued yet ? I know you are . 17100 @qwx217100 <p> This soap foam dough is just one of the beautiful activities you can find in the brand new book Pop ! Squirt !

Slowly add the cornstarch . Mix and knead the dough until it is smooth . You may need to sprinkle up to 1/2 tbsp more cornstarch into the dough or add extra soap if needed .

Here 's a video tutorial for making the dough : <p> My three year old wanted to make red , purple , and green dough . Is n't it lovely ? <p> But what is really neat about soap foam dough is that it snaps cleanly like silly putty . <p> Since soap foam dough can snap in half like it does , it makes it the perfect sensory dough for exploring fractions .

So not only did J practice his scissor skills , but he learned about music while he cut away . <p> Okay , so I know the title of this post says cutting tray . As you can see in the picture above , I did n't use a tray at all . I just did n't know what else to call it . Therefore , the real title of this post is , " Music Themed Strips of Paper Laying on My Not-So-Clean Carpet Cutting Practice Activity . " Whew , that 's long winded ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up first is the grand staff cutting sheet . I drew green dotted lines to show where I wanted J to cut . J had the chance to practice making long cuts by cutting the grand staff into separate lines of music . While cutting , I reinforced the music terminology by explaining that he was cutting strips with the grand staff on it . You can easily find blank grand staff paper just by doing a simple Google search . I , on the other hand , found this in the back of one of my harmony books in my piano studio . And I only came across this book from way back yonder because K knocked my old piano bench over ( and broke the lid off in the process ) . Turns out , there was a gold mine of my old theory texts and workbooks in there . <p> J spent the most time on these musical notation strips . I cut cardstock into 1 inch strips and drew various music symbols on each strip using a permanent marker . I drew half notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bass clefs . However , you could include rests , repeat signs , dynamics markings , or really anything you 'd like . J 's task was to cut the strips so that only one symbol would remain on each piece . He loved this activity because he would also count . Again , I reinforced the music terminology as he cut the paper , which eventually lead to him saying , " 1 half note , 2 half notes , 3 half notes , etc . " <p> Here 's some of J 's cutting results . <p> The third part was to cut along the bar lines to divide the music up into measures . You can find tons of sheet music for free to print off , but the song I used was a leftover Christmas song from Making Music Fun that I found in my piano studio .

@@23062299 @3062299/ <h> Monday , March 25 , 2013 <p> My boys love parachutes . And now I am pretty sure they think know that I am a genius after making a parachute of our own . If you look online , large parachutes that are 10 ' -12 ' can retail for $25-50 or even more . And who knows how much a custom-made parachute would cost . I 'm frugal so I decided to make my own . And I ended up making one for only $6 using shower curtains found at the dollar store . Yes , $6 ! ! <p> The inspiration came to me a few months ago . We have a shower curtain that we use as a splat mat for K when we eat in the dining room as we have light colored carpet in there . I was attempting to fold the shower curtain when K started lifting it and wiggling it . So I started moving it up and down like a parachute . He thought it was awesome and could n't stop laughing . And that 's when I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to make a play parachute using dollar store shower curtains . The final diameter is approximately 10 ' . <h> What You 'll Need to Sew a Homemade Play Parachute <p> Materials <p> 4 shower curtains ( not fabric ones ) - I paid $1.50 for each one . <p> Scissors <p> Sewing machine <p> Thread in a coordinating color <h> How to Sew a Homemade Play Parachute <p> Tutorial I should mention that I am terrible at taking photos while I make any project so I do not have pictures for every step in the tutorial . So hopefully I can describe the process clearly enough . <p> It took me about 2 hours to make the entire parachute . <p> Step 1 : Find the top of the shower curtain where the curtain hooks would go . Cut that part off . Repeat for all four shower curtains . <p> Step 2 : Lay the shower curtain on the floor and fold diagonally ( i.e. , match top left corner with bottom right ) . Cut along the fold . Repeat for all four shower curtains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 : Lay out all the pieces on the floor ( or outside if you need more space ) . Be sure to organize it in the order that you want the final parachute to be . When all the pieces are laid out , it should form a rectangle . <p> Step 5 : Find the next piece and sew right sides together . Repeat until all eight pieces have been sewn together . It should form the large rectangle that you had laid out back in step 3 . It was at this point that I realized that my crazy idea was actually working out ! <p> Step 6 : Fold the rectangle until it forms a large diamond , with the center of the parachute at the top . Try to flatten the material as best as you can . Cut the top of the diamond in a semi-circle shape . <p> Step 7 : Unfold the diamond so that you return to your rectangular parachute . There should now be a circle in the middle of the parachute . Sew a hem along this inner circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle . This step took a few practice cuts on a piece of folded paper before I figured out the easiest way to cut the parachute . I did n't want to screw it up , so that 's why I practiced with paper first . I suggest you do the same . Or lay the parachute out fully and cut it in a circle that way . Do whatever is easiest . <p> Step 9 : Hem the outer edge of the parachute . I made a really huge hem so that the kids would have a better spot to hang onto when playing with the parachute . <p> Step 10 ( OPTIONAL ) : Make handles using the scraps and sew them onto the parachute . I did not make handles and the kids have had no problem hanging onto the parachute so that 's why this step is optional . <p> That 's it ! <p> The Finished Product The parachute ended up being approximately 10 feet in diameter , so it is quite large . We can play with it in our basement ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but I ca n't wait to use it outdoors . Now if only the snow would go away ... <p> I tried numerous times to take a picture of the parachute in action , but the kids ended up all blurry and I had to help hang onto the parachute . Regardless , here are a few pictures to show you what it looks like . <p> Here is how large the parachute is in comparison with a large 18 month old . <p> Here 's the parachute , folded in half , laying on my couch . <p> I love how well this parachute turned out . It 's so bright and cheery ! And the fact that it 's translucent is a bonus because I can always tell where a child is underneath it . It 's homemade and inexpensive , which are two more reasons to love it . <p> I happened to finish making it before picking my niece up from school , and she was sleeping over for the weekend , so we had plenty of opportunity to try it out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and the kids have LOVED it .

If you cut the curtain ( rectangle ) in half , from corner to corner , would n't that give you 2 triangles ? Do you think you could draw how to cut and lay it out and post it as an image ? I 'm usually good with visualizing this kind of stuff but for some reason , just ca n't see it . : P <p> Hi , this is a brilliant idea ! I 'm off to Sri Lanka this year as a volunteer with college and we were looking to buy one of these but then saw the price so I 'm going to make one and hopefully the kids out there will love it ! Great idea , thanks ! <p> I am not sure if it 's normal per se , but I like having the hole for two reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids underneath . Second , you can use it for parachute games such as bouncing a ball on the parachute to try and get it through the hole . You could always leave that step out as it is n't necessary . Hope that helps ! <p> It is normal to have the hole in the middle . It may have something to do with air flow as the parachute is moved up and down . Also with enough kids they can create a dome and sit inside the dome if the fabric is ideal . To make the dome , have the kids grab hold of the parachute as usual , stand facing away from the center of the parachute ( backs to each other ) . The kids will raise the parachute together to get air flowing underneath ( use a 123 count ) . When the parachute comes down have the kids to lower it all the way to the ground stepping backwards a bit toward the center . They will have to squat or lower to their knees . Secure the parachute as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . When the kids are just the right distance apart from each other and from the center of the parachute and if the parachute fabric is ideal it will make a dome with them on the inside . You can also position them to be on the outside of the dome , but to be underneath is much more fun ! The distance apart will depend the arm length of the children . I have done this before and it is simple , but amazing for kids . However , the parachute I used was purchased not a DIY so it may not work with a shower curtain , but I do live this idea ! <p> As I mentioned in my disclaimer at the end of this post , never leave your child unattended with the parachute as it is like a giant plastic bag . <p> Having said that , please always do what you are comfortable with . You know your children and yourself best . Use your own discretion . My children are always fully supervised during all activities found on my blog , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you have it all folded up to cut the center circle you could use a string and pen to create a perfect circle . Before cutting the center circle just secure a string at whatever length you choose with a thumbtack or clip to the point , then attach a marker to the other end of the string , stretch the string out and draw your circle line . Same idea as a compass . Then you can cut both ends while it 's all folded up . I 'm definitely going to try to make one of these ! ! Thanks ! ! <p> Question- I have the 4 curtains cut into the 8 triangle pieces , but I just ca n't figure out which tip is considered the top or center of the parachute . I have laid it out on the floor but it is puzzling me . Can you help explain ? The fold line that you cut the curtain in half with is the longer of the 3 sides . At least mine are . Are the 2 equal sides considered to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you just have to cut it into a circle and hem the bottom ? I just keep placing it out on the floor and trying to analyze it too much I guess . I 'm anxious to start sewing . Hope to hear from you soon . Char Hawkins <p> Goodness , it has been so long since I made this that I am trying to remember exactly what I did . I *think* the longer of the 3 sides is what I matched up to sew with another triangle . I remember that once I had all the triangles arranged that it ended up looking like one gigantic rectangle that I then cut into a circle and hemmed . <p> If it helps , take a look at the first photo in the blog post and notice the triangle that has the stripes . Those stripes ran vertically on the original shower curtain . So if you can use that visualize how I arranged the triangles , then maybe that will help ? ? If only I had taken more step by step photos while I made this !

And I do n't particularly like the tutorials that show how to convert a train table into a light table . Probably because I do n't even have a train table . But I wanted to make one for J and K for their birthdays ( their birthdays are 5 days apart ! ) since they constantly fight over our small light box . Plus , we have an abundance of scrap wood in our garage from various past outdoor projects and a retired entertainment center . So we made our own from scratch and it turned out FANTASTIC ! <p> Here 's how to make a DIY light table for kids from scratch ! 17101 @qwx217101 <h> DIY Light Table Tutorial <p> This project was pretty straightforward and relatively easy to do . It only took us one afternoon to build it , but we had to wait for paint and caulking to dry . So it is more of a weekend project . <p> Okay , that 's fine and dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you ? <p> However , please note that we did not have to purchase wood for this project as we repurposed an old entertainment center and used scrap pieces of wood from previous projects .

So browse the clear acrylic sheets at Home Depot to figure out what size you want to build yours . <p> As a disclaimer , I did not take pictures at the beginning despite my husband urging me . Why ? Because I assumed , like most of our projects , that it would n't go as planned and we 'd be required to make some changes along the way . <p> Well , it turns out this project was so easy .

Okay , they were n't really helpful per se , but K 's pretty cute . <h> How to Make a DIY Light Table <p> For those of you who like simple instruction : build a box . You are now done ! Hahaha ... that is really all we did , but here 's the more detailed step by step . 1 . Make a frame for the acrylic to sit on using 2x4s . The outside of the frame should be the exact same width and length as your piece of acrylic . So our acrylic was 28 " x 30 " , which means the outside dimensions of the frame were also 28 " x 30 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin piece of MDF , add a brace in the middle of the frame . Make sure it is level with what would be the top of the frame so that the acrylic will be level when it is set on top . We used a piece of MDF from the entertainment center . This brace will just add extra support to the acrylic in the event a child climbs on top because you know that 's bound to happen ! Both of my boys have been found sitting on the light table , so I 'm so glad we added this support brace in . <p> 3 . Cut the wood for the sides and back . We used MDF pieces that were once the sides of the entertainment center . They worked perfectly ! As you 'll notice in the picture below , we did not use a solid piece for the back of the table . Instead , we used two braces . One brace is level with the top of all the sides . The lower brace is just slightly off the ground . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of the table up . <p> The dimensions of the boards are as follows : <p> Front : 29 5/16 " L x 14 10/16 " H x 10/16 " W <p> Sides : 30 " L ( so same length as the acrylic ) x 14 10/16 " H x 10/16 " W <p> Back braces : 29 5/16 " L x 2 3/4 " H x 10/16 " W <p> 4 . Attach side pieces to the frame from step 1 , leaving a small 10/16 " lip . You can see in the picture below that we had the sides come up just slightly above the frame . The acrylic will just sit inside the outer edges and rest on the frame inside . <p> 5 . Decide where you want to attach your power bar . Use a jigsaw to cut an opening for the button . You 'll notice that we had to add a small piece of 2x4 to adhere our power bar the way we wanted it . This 2x4 support is screwed onto the underside of the frame that we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lights to sit on . We used a sheet of plywood and a scrap 2x4 to do this part . The base of the table is n't as wide the the finished table because we wanted the table to be well ventilated to prevent overheating . The scrap 2x4 should be the same width as you cut the plywood . Attach the 2x4 to the inside of what would be the front of the table . It should be level with the lowest brace on the back of the table . This 2x4 will be used to hold the plywood ( and lights ) in place . You can see how wide our base is in the following picture . <p> 7 . Paint everything . We decided to paint the inside as well to help reflect even more light . <p> 8 . Once dry , mount the lights to the plywood base . We played around with different light configurations and decided that making a rectangle with the lights was the optimal positioning . Some configurations left dark spots . Slide the plywood onto the 2x4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Plug all the lights into the power bar . You can also tidy up the cords at this point with some zipties . We have all the cords running underneath the plywood base . Remember that the base is not screwed to the braces . Instead , it just rests on the braces . Doing so allows us to slide the plywood out when we need to replace the light bulbs . <p> 9 . Apply double sided tape to the top of the frame that you made in step 1 , including on the middle brace . This will be used to temporarily hold the parchment paper in place until the acrylic sheet is placed on top . <p> 10 . Cut the parchment paper to size . I used two long pieces , overlapping them slightly on the middle brace . Be sure to pull the parchment paper as tight as possible so that there are minimal creases and wrinkles . You can always unstick and readjust the parchment paper until it 's as smooth as possible since it hardly sticks to the double sided tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To add a waterproof seal to your table , you can add some caulking along the edges of the acrylic . <p> 12 . Plug it in and play ! <p> Looks awesome , right ? !

Also , it seems like it would be much less expensive to get two longer lights ( say , two fixtures that are 23 " , rather than four that are 14 " ) .. I wonder if you think that would work ok , or if you think the four lights were critical to getting a nice even lighting . Obviously , you would n't know for sure , not having used 2 , but the price difference is kinda critical for our situation . <p> Great questions ! We only have the 2x4 on the front because if you recall , we left the back open . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit on . You can see the support it sits on in step 5 ( second picture ) . <p> For the sliding question , we just did n't attach the plywood to anything so all we have to do is pull the light table away from the wall , pull the plywood straight back , and it comes right out . Hope that makes sense . <p> As for the lighting , we priced out different lengths in the store and the four lights were actually cheaper than buying two longer ones . I think the lighting would be fine with two longer ones . We just played around with the placement of lights , plugged them in , and kept adjusting until we found the ideal light distribution before mounting them . I 'm sure you could try the two lights and if they do n't work , return them and try something different . <p> If you have any more questions or would like some additional photos to help you out , by all means send me an email .

Another possibility is that you had too much liquid for the oats . Hope that helps ! <p> It could be either that you are using a different type of oats than I did or the liquid watercolors that you are using are n't as vibrant in color . Of all the colors , my green oats are definitely not as vibrant as the other colors . <p> If you do n't mind the colors being premixed , this instantly reminded me of fruity pebbles in color and shape .

@@23062316 @3062316/ <h> Tuesday , October 20 , 2015 <p> Even before I became a parent , I imagined family board game nights with my kids . I loved playing board games as a child , and still do , so I could n't wait for my boys to be old enough to play board games with me . At ages four and six , they are the perfect age for family board game nights ( or game time during the day is probably a more accurate description ) . So here are some of our favorite board games to play with the kids . These are the games that have been the most played and well-loved in our house . They are all boy-approved ( as I 'm a mother of only boys ) and they are great for working on social skills , language skills , and fine motor skills . <p> We were first introduced to this game by a speech pathologist and by subsequent speech pathologists as well . It 's a great game for working on fine motor skills and both of my boys love how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Raccoon Rumpus is another game that was introduced to us through speech pathology , as it is an excellent way to work on pronouns . It was also a great way to push my oldest son to think less literal and more abstract by dressing the raccoons in silly outfits . This game requires no reading skills and focuses on color learning . <p> My youngest son loves this game ! It 's a great way to work on colors , counting , and listening skills . Another game that was introduced to use through speech pathology ( seems like a common theme so far , right ? ) . <p> We have played this game more than I care to admit . My kids can not get enough of this game . You have to protect your chickens from Louie who flies around in his airplane . Yet another game we discovered through speech pathology . <p> We just recently purchased Zingo ! and we instantly fell in love with it . My youngest son particularly loves the Zingo ! dispenser . This game is also available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Definitely a must have game for kids ! <p> This game is like a combination of Tetris , word search , and crossword puzzles . And it 's definitely a great game for letter lovers like my son with hyperlexia ! Although , at age six , this game was almost too simple for him and his hyperlexic mind . However , my four year old can easily complete all the easy puzzles in this game by himself . So it definitely suits a variety of ages . I love word games too , so I got hooked and now I want the regular version for myself . <p> There 's just something about being six and Pokemon ! Over the summer , just before my oldest turned six , we started to learn to play Pokemon together as a family . Well , when he returned to school for grade one , I discovered that nearly all the boys in his grade had developed an interest in Pokemon as well .

@@23062334 @3062334/ <h> Monday , June 30 , 2014 <p> In our backyard , we keep a variety of loose parts , including paving stones and scrap wood , for building all sorts of things . We have made elaborate balance beam obstacle course , ramps for cars , a giant rainbow , and roads for cars , just to name a few . The latest creation , however , was inspired by marble runs . We have some colorful bocce balls that , unfortunately , were left in the cold and cracked ( they were water filled bocce balls ) . Regardless , the boys love to play with them . One particular day , they were rolling the bocce balls down some wood pieces . Soon my husband and the boys were building a giant outdoor ball run . <p> It took a little bit of tinkering to get the bocce balls to run down the course ( and stay on ) properly . The paving stones were used to prop up the scrap wood , as well as make little walls to keep the balls on course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final design of the outdoor ball run looked like this : <p> And I promise my grass is a lot greener now than in the pictures .

Anyway , J requested a start line and a finish line , so my husband kindly obliged . <p> Then once the scrap wood was also adequately decorated with sidewalk chalk , it was time to let the good times roll ! Yes , I 'm so witty , are n't I ? <p> Lots of turn taking was involved and eventually J and K had specified who could roll which color of bocce balls . <p> Naturally , there were lots of other shenanigans that went on during the course of the ball run play , including lining up all the balls to create a bocce ball train down the ball run course . Wow , how many times can I use the word ball in one sentence ... 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

So while he 's been learning the names ( and weights and types and heights and attacks ! ! ) of every single Pokemon character , I have been as well .

So in case you missed out on the excitement that And Next Comes L brought your way in 2014 , then here 's a handy dandy recap ( along with some ever-so-delightful commentary ) of the ten most popular activities for kids in 2014 . <p> 1 . Quiet Books : A Guide to Making One of Your Own - This post has been , and likely always will be , the most popular post on my blog . It provides lots of tips on how to make your own quiet books , including links to all of my quiet book pages . If you 're more of a visual person , then check out my Quiet Books Landing Page to see all the pages at a glance . <p> 2 . Simple Toddler Busy Box Idea - Ah yes , the choking hazard activity that soared into the top 10 just in the month of December ( thanks to Toddler Approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people being respectful of my ability to know my children best , this activity caused people to state the obvious ( " CHOKING HAZARD ! " ) multiple times or to turn just plain harsh and evil . I was called a " dimwit , " told that social services should be involved , and a bunch of other delightful comments . So if you are concerned about the materials used , then obviously pick something that you would be comfortable with . No need to judge my parenting skills . And besides , this busy box has entertained both of my children for multiple hours while they were toddlers . A complete win in my book ! <p> 4 . Sensory Play Guide : How to Dye Sensory Bin Materials - Who does n't love a good , colorful sensory bin filler ? ! I know that I ca n't resist them myself . Oh yeah , the kids love them too ! Well , if you have ever wondered how to dye rice , oats , beans , eggshells , barley , and more , then this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . DIY Color Blocks - Oh , my beloved DIY color blocks . Sigh . I 'm terribly proud of these color blocks and I love them to pieces . Unfortunately , this tutorial is also the most copied and stolen . The tutorial has been stolen numerous times and reposted elsewhere without permission . It has caused a fair share of heartache and frustration . However , the other day I came across a quote that I like to remind myself of when it comes to this color blocks tutorial : <p> " I do n't care that they stole my idea ... I care that they do n't have any of their own . " - Nikola Tesla . <p> But still , how hard is it to credit the original tutorial with a link back to the post .

Homemade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever tackle are these homemade stretchy bands . Ridiculously fun to play with too ! J and K will show you the many ways in which we play with them . <p> 8 . Edible Sludge Sensory Play - I 'm actually surprised to see this edible sludge in the top 10 of 2014 . At the same time , I 'm happy to see it here because it has some of my absolute favorite photos ever ! That 's why the post itself is a little picture heavy . Ha ! This sensory play idea was also huge for me because it was the first of many messy posts to push me outside of my comfort zone . <p> 9 . Four Music Games for Toddlers &amp; Preschoolers - Another year in the top 10 posts , this list of music games for toddlers and preschoolers continues to be popular . My favorite is the xylophone color matching game . Which one is your favorite ? <p> 10 . Free Printable Daily Schedule - This printable schedule sure changed our daily life when we first introduced it in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made it into the #10 spot of 2014 's most popular posts . <h> Sunday , December 28 , 2014 <p> A few months ago we tried this Scrabble addition activity from The Measured Mom . I knew that my five year old would love that game , and he certainly did , so I created a special New Year 's themed Scrabble math activity for him . It 's a great way to introduce him to new vocabulary and practice some math skills . <p> How it works is the child spells the words using the Scrabble tiles , putting the individual letters into the appropriate squares below the word . Then add up the numbers on the bottom of the tiles and write the answer . <p> Five year old J is a pro-star at math , so these ended up being way too easy for him . He did , however , find ways to extend the activity on his own . First , he noted that a lot of the words had the same score , so he graphed them . Then we did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then told me which words had the most points and which one the fewest . Lots of math learning went on ! <h> Saturday , December 27 , 2014 <p> For 2015 , I want to encourage my five year old to start a journal . However , I could n't quite find the right journal prompts for his particular skill set and interests ( i.e. , a five year old that has been reading since before age two and does math at least three grade levels above his age ) . So , naturally , I created my own set of journal writing prompts , tailored to his skills and interests . Here are 31 math inspired journal writing prompts that are perfect for kids who love numbers , clocks , money , and math in general . <p> When I first started searching for journal prompts for his age group , I noticed that they were either too abstract for him or too boring for him . Since he is fascinated with numbers and math , I set out to find math based prompts for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I ended up with more math problems than a writing exercise . He certainly does not need extra practice answering math problems considering he 's already too far ahead in that department . He does , however , need practice writing complete sentences . He also needs to practice answering " wh " questions appropriately . Due to his hyperlexia and hypernumeracy , answering " wh " questions orally usually results in a generic response of " I do n't know " or " That 's tricky . " I am hoping that by practicing appropriate written responses to these " wh " questions that we can reinforce what he needs to work on in terms of speech . <p> These math inspired journal writing prompts are not math problems that ask for the child to answer addition questions , for example . Although you will find a few that do . Instead , these prompts encourage creative , abstract thinking using numbers and math as the basis . I target my son 's interest in money , clocks , fractions , and more to encourage him to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage some drawing . <p> How We Use Our Math Inspired Journal Writing Prompts <p> To encourage extra fine motor skills , my five year old picks a prompt , cuts it out , and then glues it onto a piece of paper . Then he reads the prompt out loud before writing his answer . <p> We 've tried out a handful of these prompts so far with great success . I have found out that my five year old would like to be the fraction " 10/5 or two wholes " or that if he were a shape , then he 'd like to be a 23-sided red shape . And apparently if he had $1,000,000 , he would buy himself a giant trampoline and that he " would buy mommy a laser gun because she wants one .

So I decided to make him a Christmas themed one for his stocking this year . With 26 Christmas words to find , this free printable word search should keep him busy on Christmas morning . <p> We are n't religious so I stuck to words that would be familiar to my kids , including things like Santa and reindeer . Here 's a preview of what you get when you download the printable word search . <p> Opening and closing the empty wipes container is great fine motor practice , as is putting those jingle bells into the small hole in the container .

" <h> Tuesday , December 16 , 2014 <p> Here 's a Christmassensory bin that I put together for my preschooler K , while his older brother was at school . It 's inspired by the song " Silver and Gold , " which always makes me want to watch that classic Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer movie . I love that movie ! Anyway , here 's how we took the metallic colors of Christmas and turned them into a simple preschool sensory bin . <h> Monday , December 15 , 2014 <p> Playing with ice on the light table is a fun way to explore . Colored ice is even better ! So I made some frozen Christmas shapes to melt as part of a sensory science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way to work on fine motor skills ! My kids loved this Christmas light table science activity . <p> The next morning I placed one tree and one bell in a glass dish . I set one up for both boys so that they would each have one tree and one bell . I placed the glass dishes on the light table , along with red water , table salt , eye droppers , and some clear plastic spoons . <p> The colored ice looks so magical on the light table . Although if I were to redo it , I would skip the gold liquid watercolor and use yellow instead . The gold did n't work as well as I had hoped on the light table . <p> The boys used the water and salt to try and melt the frozen Christmas shapes . All that scooping with the spoons and squeezing of the eye droppers is great fine motor practice . <p> J also liked to pick up the frozen shapes , which is a great sensory experience on its own . <h> Thursday , December 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looking for fresh new piano music for my students , either to spice up a recital or to encourage a student who may be starting to lose interest in piano and/or practicing . Well , not only did I find a collection that I love , but , more importantly , I found a collection that my students love ! Even my own children love listening and dancing to it . My three year old happens to know the names to most of the songs in this collection now because he likes the songs that much . <p> If you are a fellow piano teacher and are looking to add to your music library , then you will want to check out Supersonics Piano ! Or perhaps you are a parent struggling to encourage your child to practice ? Or maybe you are a parent looking for a great gift for a piano teacher ? Well , then Supersonics Piano is going to be a great fit for you too ! <p> I also have a pretty big giveaway to further entice you . Read on ... you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your convenience . I was provided with music from Supersonics Piano in exchange for a honest review . All opinions are mine and were not influenced by the free goodies . <p> Supersonics Piano Review <p> The first thing that I noticed about Supersonics Piano 's website was how well organized it was . Not only can I preview all of the songs , but I can actually listen to them beforehand . How handy is that as a piano teacher ? It sure beats ( pun , intended ! ) picking up a piece of music at the music store and looking at it , wondering what it may or may not sound like . <p> Once I printed off my copies of the Supersonics Piano Books A , B , and C , I was excited to try them out before giving them to my students to try . What I noticed right away was the variety of music in the collections . There are slow songs . There are really fast songs ( the song " Furioso " for example was a favorite for my three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spooky songs . There are jazzy songs , which in my opinion , is where the composer Daniel McFarlane really shines . His jazzy tunes were definitely my favorites as a teacher , and were the favorites among my students . Some of our favorite songs ( and the ones that I recommend you must buy ) are : <p> " Off the Beat , " " Keep in Time ! , " " Furioso , " and " I 'm Grumpy " from Book A <p> As a teacher , I loved the variety of technical aspects presented in the songs throughout all three books . From fun glissandos to odd time signatures to tricky rhythms , there is certainly enough to challenge piano students . But since the songs are so fun to play , the students are easily motivated to practice them , despite their technical challenges . If you are a non-musical parent that just said , " Ummm ... what ? " , I 'm basically saying the songs are fun to play , teach lots of cool things , and your kids will actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Piano pieces with catchy tunes and fun titles that capture the mood of the piece . <p> A handy-dandy website that let 's you preview and hear what the song sounds like before you purchase . <p> Music that is easy to teach and that kids will actually enjoy practicing . <p> Books that present a wide variety of songs , rhythms , and technical demands . <p> The option to purchase a studio license that allows me to print off as many copies as I want for my students . <p> Also , the studio license gives you the option to get customized song titles to further motivate students . So " I 'm Grumpy " could be changed to " Dyan 's Grumpy . " <p> And finally , the big reason that I love Supersonics Piano ... I actually enjoy playing the pieces myself . I just find Daniel 's jazz-inspired songs so much fun to play . You know it 's got to be good when the teacher wants to play it and keep it all to herself , right ? Yeah ... definitely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license so that I can keep a copy for myself and share other copies with my students . <p> Supersonics Piano Giveaway : A Great Gift Idea for Your Piano Teacher ! <p> Looking for a great gift for your piano teacher ? Ditch the gift card to a coffee shop idea . Instead , consider purchasing some individual songs from Supersonics Piano . Or better yet , how about winning the entire value pack to gift to your teacher this Christmas ? !

An idea could be to put a clothes peg on the side of the top card in the morning ( or after bed time ) , then get the child to move the peg to the next card as they move from one activity to the next through the day . This way they can track where they are in their day , and see exactly what 's coming up next . <p> I have " Reading Time " and " Watch TV " or " Watch a Movie " in the playtime set of cards . I have one called " Tablet Time " that would work for iPad , but I ca n't seem to find it ... hmmm . Unfortunately , I do n't have a " clean up toys " card , but that 's a great suggestion .

Thanks for the suggestions ! <p> I love these cards ! We have been using them for months now , and I can tell how much they help my kids , and my sensitive son specifically , with patience and participation throughout the day . On the days when I forget to set up our schedule , things get harry real quick , lol . You asked for feedback , so here is what I would think could be helpful : 1 . Have different pictures for each different card type . For example , all activities water related have the same graphic , and my kids get confused about what water activity they are doing that day ( which I love water activities , so we do a lot ) . I do n't think we would need a graphic that is an exact match to the activity , but just something different from the other water play cards would be helpful for them to recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your two-year-old thinks they are going to the water park , but you are really only setting out the kiddie pool in the backyard. ) 2 . Our family does n't live close by , so we set up Skype dates with them on a regular basis . Adding a Skype card would be nice . : ) 3 . We do n't need it as much now , but when we were potty training our kids earlier this year , more potty cards would have been nice ... like a whole page of just them , lol . Because we took potty breaks every couple hours and the kids did n't want to go as much if it was n't scheduled in , so I had to keep moving the one card I had around . So that 's what I think , hope it is helpful ! Thanks so much for doing this work for so many of us and sharing so generously ! <p> Although , the free clipart I was using is no longer free so I wo n't be updating or adding to these cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will write down in the event I do update them . : ) <p> Just click the download now buttons below the images of the ones that you are interested in on this page : LONG ...

We are also using a " this week " with a list of the appointments , activities that are unusual , etc , so they know those are coming up too .

He started off by drawing happy . Like seriously , how cute is this little squished happy face ? <p> Then he went through the rest of the cards , talking about little details like the eyebrows of the LEGO heads , while copying the expressions onto the LEGO heads . Drawing those details is a great way to work on fine motor skills while exploring and learning about emotions ! <p> Then he also explored his own emotions and experimented with drawing sharp pointy teeth on the LEGO head .

@@23062363 @3062363/ <h> Tuesday , January 20 , 2015 <p> I made a homemade " taco " sensory swing for my boys for Christmas and I have been so excited to share the tutorial with you . The actual sewing and assembly of this swing went so smoothly that I actually impressed myself by how well it came together . From start to finish , this DIY sensory swing took me about a hour to make . And I was hoping to do it for under $50 . Well , not only does the final product look and work amazing , but I made it for about $25 . How much does a store bought one cost , you ask ? Only a whopping $175-300 ! <p> Yeah , so how about that tutorial then ? 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Materials for Making a Homemade Taco Sensory Swing <p> Here 's what we used to make this gorgeous DIY sensory swing : <p> 1.7 metres ( 1.9 yards ) of canvas or other non-stretchy fabric - I found this beautiful striped fabric on clearance and paid $10 . I did not end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huge scraps for another project ! <p> 1 " thick wooden dowels - We used two that were 36 " long and paid $5 in total from Michaels using two 50% off coupons . More details to follow . <p> Carabiner hooks - We used ones that could hold 100+ lbs each . I think we paid around $8 for two hooks . <p> We went fabric hunting as a family hoping to find a perfect fabric for our swing on clearance . We lucked out and bought some pretty striped fabric . Ooh , aah ! And it 's not even hideous fabric or a plain boring color ! However , if you ca n't find any fabric you like to fit your budget , then why not try using canvas drop cloth as an alternative . It 's 100% canvas and is fairly cheap to buy . It was going to be our back-up plan until I found the striped fabric . <p> When I originally priced out wooden dowels at Rona , it was going to cost me $20 just for that part . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dowels ? " I knew that I had seen them before , but I had never looked closely at them . The answer is yes . Michaels had 1 " wooden dowels precut to 36 " long . And to make things even sweeter , their coupon for the week was 50% off an original price item . So we ended up buying our wooden dowels for $5 , plus we did n't have to worry about cutting them ! <p> Okay , okay ... on to the tutorial so you can finally make a pretty little sensory swing like ours , but first ... <h> Important Safety Precautions &amp; Reminders <p> I know some of these seem obvious , but I will state these reminders clearly . <p> Do not use stretchy fabric for this swing . <p> Make sure the thread strength matches the fabric used . Also , make sure you use the appropriate needle on the sewing machine ! <p> Always test homemade swings first before letting children play with them . <p> Do not leave children unattended in swings . <p> Put swings away when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a clear , unobstructed space . <p> I am not responsible for injuries or damage pertaining to or caused by this homemade swing . <p> Please use at your own risk . <h> How to Make a DIY Taco Sensory Swing <p> 1 . Our dowels were much shorter than the width of our fabric . So I cut the fabric to be about 40 " wide , just slightly larger than the length of the dowels ( 36 " ) . <p> 2 . Fold the edge of the fabric along the long side of the fabric and tuck the raw edge inside . You 'll likely use about 2 " -2.5 " worth of fabric for this hem . Pin and sew . This edge will be the front ( or back ) of the swing . <p> 3 . Repeat on the other long edge , making sure that the finished rectangle is shorter than the length of the dowel . <p> 4 . Now we need to make pockets for the wooden dowels . Fold the fabric around the wooden dowel , tucking the raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the pocket too tight ! Pin into place . Remove the wooden dowel . Then sew . <p> 5 . Repeat step four on the remaining edge of the fabric . <p> 6 . Drill two holes in each wooden dowel , about 1 " in from each end . <p> 7 . Determine the length of rope you will need . This step depends on the height of your space . Our swing hangs in an extra-wide doorway so we used about 70 " of rope per side . You will use one solid piece of rope per side . <p> 8 . Put a piece of tape on the end of a piece of rope . It makes threading the rope so much easier ! Plus it keeps the rope from fraying . Tie a knot or two on the underside of the dowel . Repeat for all four holes . See picture below . <p> 9 . To attach the carabiner hook , locate the middle of the rope for each side . Loop the rope around the carabiner hook . See picture below . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to install some hardware to hook the swing onto ( if you do n't already have a swing set-up in your house ) . You can get a better view of our swing hooks here . We use two eye bolts ( about 18 " apart ) screwed into the frame of a large doorway . Swing hooks should always be installed into a ceiling joist or door frame . <p> 11 . Test it out ! Before I ever put my own children in a homemade swing , I always test the weight limit myself . The swing held me comfortably . I also had my husband try it out , but he was definitely just too much for our swing to hold . He 's roughly 175 lbs . <h> Storing &amp; Playing with the DIY Taco Sensory Swing <p> The wooden dowels make this swing easy to roll up for storage .

Headphones &amp; Earmuffs A set of good headphones to listen to music on a MP3 player or iPod is a great auditory sensory tool . My youngest loves to listen to music and audiobooks on his MP3 player and it is calming for him . Or , in contrast , a set of hearing protector earmuffs are perfect for kids who need help blocking out loud noises , staying focused , and reducing background noises . My oldest could certainly benefit from them , but he is also really good at covering his ears by himself . <p> 3 . Musical InstrumentsMusical instruments are fabulous for providing auditory sensory input . Anything from tambourines to jingle bells to drums to the dreaded recorder are great choices for kids . Another fun idea for auditory sensory input is an echo microphone . I remember loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were younger ( it eventually got chewed to death by my oral sensory seeker and never replaced ) . You can even pick up a lot of musical instruments from the dollar store these days , making them wonderful stocking stuffer ideas for Christmastime . <p> 4 . Sound Machines Soft , background noises can be comforting and calming for kids . We use humidifiers and/or air purifiers as background noises for my kids while they sleep , but you can also invest in a sound machine . I recommend getting a portable one ( so one with batteries ) so that you can bring it with you when travelling . <p> Board games with an auditory component can be a great sensory toy for kids . We regularly like to spend a weekend morning at Toys R Us just letting the kids play with the toys ( we never rarely buy anything ) . One toy that the boys play with every single time we go is Bop It ! They love trying to play it and it provides lots of wonderful auditory input . <p> 6 . Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will love making and exploring sound with sound tubes or groan tubes . Other ideas to try are thunder tubes or pop toobs . Lots of party favors , especially around New Year 's , would also provide great auditory sensory input for some kids . Things like clappers or party horns , for instance . <p> 7 . Auditory Fidgets You can even buy auditory fidgets that make sounds when you squish them . <p> 8 . Relaxation Music &amp; Classical Music Keep the kids calm and relaxed with some relaxation music ! Classical music also works great for this purpose . We personally love the CDs from the My First collection , such as the My First Classical Music Album.9 . Metronome <p> This idea may seem a little unusual at first , but really , a metronome is a fantastic auditory sensory tool for kids . The tick of the metronome is steady and even .

They seem like a lot of work to make and polyfill pellets are expensive here . So I wanted to try a different solution : stretchy lycra sheets . They provide the same kind of proprioceptive sensory input , but also allow for fidgeting . Plus , I figured that I could make one for super cheap . <p> Before I splurged on some fabric for making some homemade stretchy sensory sheets , I wanted to make sure my son would actually like the idea of it . I took our homemade sensory tunnel , which just happens to be the same length required to wrap around my son 's mattress , and tried it as a temporary sensory sheet . It worked really great , especially during bedtime reading . Finally , my son was n't rolling around and doing somersaults while we read together . Instead he would lay calmly underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip to the fabric store and finally making a legit stretchy lycra bedsheet for him . <p> The inspiration for this project is this stretchy lycra sheet that costs $70 ! Thankfully , my final price tag was $15 . <p> First , I measured the entire dimension of my son 's mattress , top , bottom , and sides included ( it was 120 inches ) . Then I converted it to metres so that I knew how much fabric to purchase . I needed the exact same amount of fabric that I used to make our sensory tunnel : 3 metres ( which is about 3.3 yards ) . <p> However , in the end I had to cut off about a foot to a foot and a half off to make it tight enough to provide good sensory input to my son . <p> So K and I headed to the fabric store to look for something in the clearance section . I was looking for stretchy and cheap . I did n't care what color it was as long as the price was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretchy fabric would work . I ended up searching and searching and finally found this peach cotton spandex blend for 70% off . So I paid $15 for 3 metres of fabric and I was happy as a ... wait for it ... yes , as happy as a peach . <p> At first I thought the color was hideous , but it 's kind of grown on me ! <p> To sew the stretchy sheet , it 's just like sewing the sensory tunnel or stretchy resistance bands . Take the two ends of the fabric and zig zag stitch them together to create a giant sleeve . That 's it ! Remember , you can use any kind of lycra or spandex material for this project as long as it 's stretchy . <p> Slide the stretchy sheet onto the mattress . That was challenging since my son sleeps on the bottom of a bunk bed . <p> Then climb in underneath for a calming night of sleep ! <p> Now I said sliding the sheet on was challenging , but honestly , photographing this sheet was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's closet or in the hallway in order to photograph it because of the bunk bed 's frame .

Also , J 's feet are nowhere close to the end of his bed so his feet do n't peek out . You certainly could sew it like a potato sack though .

I 've spotted a few of his classmates carrying homemade Pokemon cards around , which inspired me to make a template for J to use . I was hoping that the template would encourage him to explore art more , since he really does n't do much for art and has n't since he was a fingerpainting toddler . It 's probably because art is usually too abstract for such a literal thinker like him . Well , these free printable DIY Pokemon card templates certainly fueled his creativity and had the whole family creating , drawing , and playing together . 17101 @qwx217101 <p> Pokemon is all the rage in our house !

J really became quite the storyteller with these homemade Pokemon cards ! <p> This activity really was perfect for everyone in our family . However , the small templates were just too small for four year old K. So I redesigned the template to make jumbo sized Pokemon cards ( 8.5 " x 11 " in size ) for him and they worked perfectly . I have included both the regular sized and jumbo sized templates in the free template ( link to download is at the bottom of this post ) .

It 's recommended for age 8+ , but I generally disregard most age recommendations on toy boxes since I know I will be supervising them anyway . Basically , you build a project ( there are 101 to chose from ) following the color coded instructions , using a variety of different pieces that just snap together .

The foam shapes will stick to the tub when wet . Read the story to your child while they are in the tub .

Then have them use the pipe cleaner as the caterpillar , guiding it through the holes in the different foods . <p> The Invitation to Play ( Option #2 ) <p> F was over for the afternoon . She happened to spot the food sitting on top of the deep freeze and asked if she could check it out . Of course , I obliged , but not before reading the story to her . <p> F has the caterpillar eating the apple . She even madea chomp sound as the caterpillar went in . I was also surprised to learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pears ... <p> J participated by helping her locate the different foods , especially the oranges .

Your child can also practice their counting skills as each day of the week has a set number of foods ( e.g. , Monday had one apple and Thursday had four strawberries ) . You can also discuss the concept of weeks and days with your child . <p> Regardless , I think that the kids will enjoy bringing this classic story to life with this play set . 17098 @qwx217098 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

@@23062391 @3062391/ <h> Thursday , November 12 , 2015 <p> Back in the spring or early summer , I bought my boys an amazing round platform swing from Costco.ca .

And any other platform swing that I 've come across has been around $100 US or more . Platform swings are certainly not cheap . <p> Well , shortly after we got the platform swing , I came up with an idea for making a DIY platform swing . This idea has been floating around in my mind for a few months now . It was only recently that I actually decided to try it out though . <p> I think it took me less than ten minutes to put this DIY platform swing together , so it 's easy . Really easy .

Repeat until you have 4 pieces of rope . OR Double the measurement from step 2 and add an extra 12 inches or so . Cut 2 pieces of rope that length . There are two different ways to hang the swing . I went with two long ropes for our swing . <p> STEP 4 : Tie the ropes onto the mini trampoline either by tying each of the 4 ropes to the frame of the trampoline OR looping the rope around the frame on two ends and then tying the rope at the top to form a triangle .

There are lots of non-food sensory bin fillers that you can use ( see 50 here and 50 more here ) , but sometimes nothing beats the sensory exploration of rice , oats , or beans . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that it is not wasteful and will reuse the same sensory bin fillers over and over . So here are my 8 tips for using food for sensory play that are n't wasteful . 17100 @qwx217100 <h> Sensory Play Tip #1 : Use expired food items <p> Raid your pantry to see if you have any food items that have expired . They 're no longer good to eat and you 're liking considering tossing them out for good anyway , but wait ! Those expired food items are the perfect items to use for sensory play . <p> Have a bag of expired oats ? Dye them ! Have a bag of expired rice ? Dye that too ! Those dried chickpeas that are a few months old ? Dye them too ! <p> By repurposing expired food items for sensory play , you are saving yourself from purchasing a bag of rice solely for the purpose of sensory play . You are also avoiding wasting food by simply tossing it out because it has passed its expiry date . <h> Sensory Play Tip #3 : Involve them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is a perfect way to use food for sensory play . Buying a watermelon ? Have them use their nose , hands , and eyes to pick the perfect watermelon . Need a jug of milk ? Let them open up the cooler section to feel the cold air in this section . You can even give the kids some proprioceptive sensory input by having them lift heavy objects or bringing the bags of groceries into the house . Or if you are at a store that does taste tests ( like Costco , for example ) , then let them sample the food items to engage their sense of taste . <p> Gardening is also a great way to encourage sensory play , so be sure to let them dig in the dirt alongside you . <h> Sensory Play Tip #4 : Let them play with their food at mealtimes <p> We all know that saying , " Do n't play with your food , " but I do n't really pay attention to it most of the time . Why ? Because I frankly do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands vs. utensils ) as long as they 're eventually eating it . So try skipping the utensils at mealtimes and letting them use their hands to explore the different textures and smells while eating . Offer them a variety of finger foods with a variety of textures like dry crackers , slimy kiwi slices , mushy banana slices , or sticks of spicy pepperoni . Encourage them to smell the different food items before tasting them too . <h> Sensory Play Tip #5 : Reuse sensory bin fillers over and over <p> We use the same sensory bin fillers over and over , sometimes over the course of months or even years . So those dyed chickpeas we made ? We still play with that exact same batch over a year later . And that dyed coconut ? Again , over a year old . <p> To reuse sensory bin fillers , we simply store the materials in an airtight container or in a zipper seal bag . Then we store in a dry , cool place until the next time we want to use it . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stored ( or perhaps they do n't even like the texture of a particular material ) , then consider donating and sharing it with others . Donate your unused sensory bin fillers to a preschool , a daycare , a friend , or any other early childhood facility to reuse . Recycle that sensory collection ! <p> There 's no need to create a sensory stash of dyed oats and chickpeas , etc. because you can easily incorporate sensory into cooking , baking , and meal prep times . For example , your children could knead pizza or bread dough . Or they could lick the spoon after making chocolate cake . Let them smell spice containers as you cook . Or they can scoop and measure the flour for a recipe . You likely know how messy scooping flour can be with little kids and they will inevitably get some flour on their hands or arms . That right there is sensory play . <h> Sensory Play Tip #8 : Use a splat mat to reduce waste <p> When we play with sensory bins , I always use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It not only helps to protect the floor or carpet if we are using something really messy and colorful , but it also catches and contains any sensory bin fillers that may spill out during sensory play . When the kids are done playing , I simply pick up the shower curtain and shake the items back into the sensory bin before putting the materials away for storage . <h> Monday , September 14 , 2015 <p> Have the leaves started changing colors where you live ?

So one morning , the boys and I started exploring making numbers in the natural light that came streaming into our living room .

After all , he spends a good portion of his day ( probably 90% ) saying , " I have a math question for you .

Banana man returns ( see reference ) ! And sometimes the boys will climb into different ends to make a double body sock . <p> We also like to use it as a sensory swing .

So I think it 's time I tell you a few things . <p> First , I wish you were better understood . I wish there was more awareness so that parents like myself would n't have to fumble for years , trying to figure out what is going on with their child . And where are the resources for parents ? I honestly feel like I was pushed out of the door with a message of " good luck and see you in a few years " after my son 's diagnosis . It left me even more confused .

After spending the past few months immersed in reading everything I can about you , which I must admit , is n't much to begin with , I feel like you deserve to be free from other diagnoses . Besides , I have even seen the autistic like symptoms in my son " disappear , " so does the autism diagnosis really fit him ? I feel like it was slapped on him simply because he fit the description of hyperlexia to a T ( pun intended ) and because hyperlexia often diagnosed alongside autism . <p> I find you isolating , hyperlexia .

To see a small child decode written words like he does , makes me pause and wonder . It makes me realize how special he really is . You alone make me realize how different he sees the world than I do and I think that 's really awesome . I appreciate his literal view of the world . I appreciate his honesty .

What 's particularly awesome is that TheseReads grabs a photo for you and links it directly to the source . So you literally click clip and that 's it . Easy peasy ! <p> To clip directly from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Add Link " feature in your dashboard ( it was called Bookmarklet up until a few days ago ) . You 'll be taken to a page like below . Simply drag the button to your bookmarks toolbar of your web browser and then you can click anywhere on the internet . <p> Here 's what the dashboard looks like . You can see a list of feeds that I follow in the left sidebar , my profile with all of my clips in the middle , and a trending/recommendations sidebar on the right . <p> Every time you clip an article from a blog or website , their RSS feed gets added to the left sidebar , making it even easier to clip articles from the blogs you love ! Just click on one of the feed names on the left to pull up their most recent posts . Then clip any that interest you . You 'll also be prompted to share that clip on Twitter or Facebook , which is optional , BUT ... <p> Check that Twitter box . Just DO it ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TheseReads on Twitter , it automatically shares a photo in the tweet . It has been proven many times that tweets with photos get way more engagement than text only tweets . And my followers engage with these tweets a lot ! So you can also grow your Twitter account with minimal effort , which is an added bonus . <p> TheseReads is really just that easy to use . Seriously , go join and see what happens . <h> Setting Up Your TheseReads Account <p> TheseReads is currently invite only so you have to request an invite to join . I was in within an hour , but there has been a lot of variation for my blogging friends who have joined . Head to TheseReads to request that invite ! <p> When you join , you 'll likely encounter two accounts tied to you . One is your personal account and one is your blog account . You can not do anything on your blog account ( and not sure if you ever will ) because it is your blog 's RSS feed . You can only control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly talk about the followers feature . I have been using TheseReads for just under a month and I have 1.43K followers at the time of publishing this post . You can not see who follows you ( although I do get email alerts of who does ) , which means TheseReads does not promote the whole follow/unfollow strategy that you often see on other social media platforms . It 's kind of refreshing ! <p> In your settings , there are a couple of things to be aware of . Under Settings &gt; Profile , you will want to make sure the box " On the website , open links in pretty page " is unchecked . That way you will be directed to the actual blog post instead of viewing the clips in a plain , uncluttered RSS feed style manner . <p> Also , you will want to get approved as a publisher . To sign up , go to Settings &gt; Publisher and fill that page in . Check the box shown below . Getting approved as a publisher will increase your chances of getting featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can also get a custom web address in your settings , which I highly recommend doing as well . <h> Follow Me on TheseReads <p> Since I 'm giving you the scoop on how to use TheseReads , I would love it if you followed both accounts of mine . <h> Still Confused About TheseReads ? 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <p> I was just thinking this past week that I needed to do a TheseReads tutorial .

Glad to hear you are getting similar results ! <p> Hi ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have one question , though . When I add the badge to my blog , do I have it linked to my personal TheseReads page or to my blog 's ? I was wondering if you knew which one would be better or if there was even a difference . Right now I have it set to send traffic ( potential followers ) to my personal page . <p> It really depends on your goal . If you want people to visit your blog , then go with your blog badge , but if you want others to see what other interesting content that you have to share , then the personal one might be better . Think of it like promoting your Pinterest profile ( personal badge ) versus your Pinterest blog board ( blog badge ) . So I think it 's a personal preference .

It also happens to be my best social media platform for driving consistent traffic to my blog . Here is how I got 200,000 Pinterest followers in less than two years . In the summer of 2014 , I did a lot of experimenting with Pinterest to see what would and would not work for me . In the fall of 2014 , I was chosen as a featured pinner and my following exploded . Today , I am just shy of 200,000 Pinterest followers . That 's 200,000 followers in less than two years ( I joined in either June or July of 2013 ) . Sure I got featured by Pinterest , but I also spent months building , tailoring , and experimenting with my account to prove to Pinterest that I am indeed an awesome , authentic pinner worthy of being featured . So here are my tips for building a Pinterest strategy that works to drive consistent traffic to your blog. 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Pinterest Tips for Bloggers <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top referral sources of all time and how much traffic they provide : <p> Pinterest : 36% <p> Direct : 27% <p> Facebook : 16% <p> Organic Search Results : 6% <p> When I first joined Pinterest , I basically pinned everything and anything that I saw . Growth was slow , but I also had no idea what I was doing . And some of those early pins were ... umm ... embarassing , to say the least . As a research driven person , I decided to do some Pinterest research of my own to see if I could determine a pattern at all . After conducting my research , I started experimenting . Here are 10 helpful tips that you can use to help grow your Pinterest following based on what I discovered . <p> Pinterest Tip #1 : Study &amp; Analyze Top Pinners in Your Niche <p> Since I am in the kid blogging niche , I started off by studying the profiles of the top pinners in that niche . I was particularly interested in all pinners with over 50,000 followers . Things I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> How many boards did they have ? <p> What kind of boards did they have ? <p> How many collaborative boards did they have ? <p> After studying about 10 different big pinners in my niche , I noticed that : <p> All the top pinners in my niche ( with the exception of one ) had less than 100 boards . Most of those big pinners hovered around 80 boards . <p> All the top pinners in my niche had less than 15,000 pins . <p> A majority of the top pinners in my niche had more general boards like food , math , activities for toddlers , etc. vs. cake recipes , a specific board for numerous preschool themes , etc . <p> My findings suggested that less was more . Fewer boards with a more general theme and fewer better quality pins seemed to be the answer . Depending on the niche you are in , you may find different results . <p> Pinterest Tip #2 : Delete Things That Are n't Working <p> After discovering common patterns in my niche , I did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do this purging process every couple of months . I started leaving collaborative boards that either were n't performing well or that I was n't pinning to that often . I left all seasonal collaborative boards too since they were only beneficial to me for 1-2 months before the particular holiday . I needed boards that would be performing well all year round . <p> I started merging related boards by moving pins to one board and deleting the now empty board . I lost a lot of followers in the process , but it was worth it , for me . I also scrolled back ( like all the way back to the beginning ) and started deleting pins . I had so many broken pins in those early days . And I had some really ugly pins too . They all had to go . I also deleted all pins that had less than 10 repins because clearly , they were not performing well . It was also at this point that I started to be more picky about what I was pinning . <p> Pinterest Tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boards like I mentioned in tip #2 , I started to be picky . I refused to pin round-ups . I never clicked on them , personally , so why would I pin them ? Please note that I do pin some from time to time , but they have to be pretty spectacular round ups to be worthy of my repins . <p> I also started focusing on image quality . I wanted to pin the best and brightest ideas that I could find . If I liked the idea , but the image was n't the greatest , then I simply clicked the like button instead of the pin button . See , I 'm showing Pinterest that I 'm social ( see tip #7 ) . <p> I also started pinning clean images . I stopped pinning really cluttered pin collages . They were not aesthetically pleasing , so why would I want that on my boards ? <p> I also took the time to edit the pin descriptions of things I was repinning . If they had hashtags , then I removed them ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I removed the tag . Did it have a keyword friendly description ? If not , then I made it keyword friendly . The new Pinterest smartfeed thrives on keywords so make sure your pins are search friendly ! Oh and if it had one of those " OMG I must try this ... blah blah blah " kind of description , then I changed that too . I hate those cheesy descriptions . Besides , those cheesy descriptions usually are n't keyword friendly . <p> Bottom line : I wanted to pin the best ideas with the best images . I wanted to curate a beautiful gallery of images and ideas . <p> Pinterest Tip #4 : Switch Up Your Look Occasionally <p> Another thing I started experimenting with was moving boards around , changing board covers , and trying out different collaborative boards . <p> I always have my blog board first , followed by my best performing boards . After that , though , I like to move seasonal boards near the top a couple of months prior to the upcoming holiday or season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , just before all of my collaborative boards . Nearly all of my collaborative boards are at the bottom of my Pinterest profile . I like to highlight a few of my own collaborative boards near the top , but , otherwise , all other collaborative boards are at the bottom . In the picture below , you can see my blog board is first . I then have my most popular boards next ( quiet books , music activities , light table play , food , sensory play , and fine motor activities ) , followed by a couple of seasonal boards . <p> I like to change board covers quite regularly too . Again , I am picky about what I choose . I avoid text based images for the board cover . Instead , I try to pick bright , well-lit images that really showcase what kind of pins will be on that board . <p> Going back to tip #3 of deleting things that are n't working , I try out new collaborative boards quite often too . If they just are n't resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one to try instead . <p> Pinterest Tip #5 : Limit Hashtags <p> Unless you are required to include a hashtag for a sponsored campaign , just stop using hashtags on Pinterest . Yes , stop altogether or at least limit them to a tasteful amount . <p> " The same is true for hashtagshaving too many of them in your descriptions may negatively impact your ranking . " - via Pinterest blog <p> Pinterest Tip #6 : Fill Out Your Profile Completely <p> Click the " Edit Profile " button and fill in all the relevant information . See the picture below . <p> Did you know that for every single Pinterest board you have , you can select a a board category and write a description for the board ? Well , do it ! Select a board and then click the " Edit Board " button . See picture below . Make sure to use keywords in your boards ' descriptions . Avoid hashtags in the descriptions ( see tip #5 ) . <p> Pinterest Tip #7 : Be Social &amp; Be Authentic <p> Pinterest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , follow people , repin things from other users , and even comment on pins . I hardly ever comment on pins myself , but I think it 's likely one of those things that I should experiment with to see what happens . <p> Pin often and pin a lot . Pin organically versus using a scheduler . Pinterest wants , and will reward , organic , social pinners . At least , they did for me . Although as of January 2016 , I have switched to primarily scheduling pins . <p> I like to go on pinning sprees , pinning dozens of things in a span of a few minutes . I also probably do n't pin my own content enough . But you know what ? Pinterest sees me as an active , social user and that 's exactly what I want . <p> Also , be authentic . I could log into my Pinterest analytics and see what other interests my followers pin , but creating a board dedicated to hair styles or fashion just is n't me . I want my boards to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a reflection of things that I would actually make or do myself . So yes , I pin only the things that interest me . I do n't pin things I think my followers will like . I do n't create boards that I think my followers will like . I just pin what I truly love , kind of like I 'm pinning as a non-blogger . <p> Pinterest Tip #8 : Create Pin Images for your Own Blog <p> Ultimately , the goal is to get more traffic to your own blog , right ? So create pin images for your own blog posts that you would pin yourself . Make pretty , vertical images that do n't give away everything about the post . Remember , you want people to click on that image and visit your blog . Important point to remember is that Pinterest prefers vertical images . Vertical images take up more space in the newsfeed , making your image dominate the newsfeed . Look at the picture below . Notice how that coffee cake muffins pin takes up a good chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! <p> Pinterest Tip #9 : Leave a Breadcrumb Trail <p> I have a board dedicated solely to my own blog posts . So when I want to pin my posts to other boards , I always go to my blog board , find the pin I want to share , and click repin from there . Basically , I am leaving a breadcrumb trail . You 'll see when I repin my own pin , I get a " via Dyan ( And Next Comes L ) " message at the bottom of the pin . That leads back to my account . Breadcrumbs , I tell you . Breadcrumbs . <p> Pinterest Tip #10 : Get Rich Pins <p> If you have n't already done so , then get rich pins ! I 'm a busy person ( are n't we all ? ) . So when I find a few minutes to pop over to Pinterest , I am more likely to pin something that has rich pins . Why ? Because I know it leads to the correct source . What if the pin does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do n't have time to click over and check the source . Remember , I 'm busy ( and lazy too ! ) so I want to skip the extra step if I can . See the picture below to see the difference between rich pins and non-rich pins . Find out how to get rich pins for your blog here . <p> Conclusion : Tips for Building Your Pinterest Following <p> I know that was a lot of information , but here are the takeaway points : <p> Study &amp; analyze top pinners in your niche <p> Experiment <p> Delete things that are n't working <p> Be picky about what you pin <p> Make sure your profile is complete <p> Avoid hashtags <p> Make your pin descriptions search friendly with keywords <p> Be social <p> Be authentic <p> Create beautiful pin images for your own blog <p> Dedicate a board to your own blog <p> Leave a breadcrumb trail to that blog board of yours <p> Get rich pins <p> Schedule pins via Tailwind App if you do n't want to or ca n't keep up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , great tips ! ! ! I have a question about the rich pins . Do I have to insert the metatags for every pin I do ? Or do I just do one , apply , then all my other pins become rich ? I 'm trying to think how doing the metatags on each pin will save me time ... or maybe I miss the point ? Thank you ! 
@@23062443 @3062443/ <h> Wednesday , December 04 , 2013 <p> J and K have really been into making funny faces themselves , all thanks to my adorable niece who showed them how to pull their mouth wide with their fingers and stick out their tongue . Good old fun I tell you ! So I took that love for funny faces and put it on the light table . Yup , it 's like Mr. Potato Head on the light table ... just without the potato-shaped head . <p> And , seriously , how can you not giggle when you see fun cartoon faces like this ? <p> I drew a face shape , freehand of course because that 's how I roll , and you can see it 's kind of weirdly proportioned . Whatever . Like the boys even noticed . Then I drew some face pieces and accessories : eyes , glasses , bow , mustaches , mouths , hair , etc . Draw whatever you 'd like . Make it fun , colorful , and most importantly , goofy . There may be a pig snout nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of time for the boys to check out , which made them giggle hysterically . And honestly , I giggle every time I look at the picture below . I think it 's the mouth that does it . <p> Then J started making some faces of his own . I particularly like how he is putting a mustache on the chin and that the nose is upside down . Insert giggles from me . Yes , I am a child at heart and things like this amuse me . <p> But the plump red lips just did n't work with what J had in mind . So bucktooth smile it is . Oh and some red glasses look pretty fine dandy too ! <p> Now to pick out some hair ... what will he choose ? <p> Nope , no hair . Bald it is . Looks great , does n't it ? As for K , he enjoyed giggling while J assembled some funny facial masterpieces . 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 
@@23062444 @3062444/ <h> Friday , September 18 , 2015 <p> We like to use food items for sensory play in our house . There are lots of non-food sensory bin fillers that you can use ( see 50 here and 50 more here ) , but sometimes nothing beats the sensory exploration of rice , oats , or beans . However , we try to use food items in such a way that it is not wasteful and will reuse the same sensory bin fillers over and over . So here are my 8 tips for using food for sensory play that are n't wasteful . 17100 @qwx217100 <h> Sensory Play Tip #1 : Use expired food items <p> Raid your pantry to see if you have any food items that have expired . They 're no longer good to eat and you 're liking considering tossing them out for good anyway , but wait ! Those expired food items are the perfect items to use for sensory play . <p> Have a bag of expired oats ? Dye them ! Have a bag of expired rice ? Dye that too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Dye them too ! <p> By repurposing expired food items for sensory play , you are saving yourself from purchasing a bag of rice solely for the purpose of sensory play . You are also avoiding wasting food by simply tossing it out because it has passed its expiry date . <h> Sensory Play Tip #3 : Involve them in the grocery shopping or gardening <p> The grocery store itself is a perfect way to use food for sensory play . Buying a watermelon ? Have them use their nose , hands , and eyes to pick the perfect watermelon . Need a jug of milk ? Let them open up the cooler section to feel the cold air in this section . You can even give the kids some proprioceptive sensory input by having them lift heavy objects or bringing the bags of groceries into the house . Or if you are at a store that does taste tests ( like Costco , for example ) , then let them sample the food items to engage their sense of taste . <p> Gardening is also a great way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them dig in the dirt alongside you . <h> Sensory Play Tip #4 : Let them play with their food at mealtimes <p> We all know that saying , " Do n't play with your food , " but I do n't really pay attention to it most of the time . Why ? Because I frankly do n't care how the kids get the food into their mouth ( hands vs. utensils ) as long as they 're eventually eating it . So try skipping the utensils at mealtimes and letting them use their hands to explore the different textures and smells while eating . Offer them a variety of finger foods with a variety of textures like dry crackers , slimy kiwi slices , mushy banana slices , or sticks of spicy pepperoni . Encourage them to smell the different food items before tasting them too . <h> Sensory Play Tip #5 : Reuse sensory bin fillers over and over <p> We use the same sensory bin fillers over and over , sometimes over the course of months or even years . So those dyed chickpeas we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year later . And that dyed coconut ? Again , over a year old . <p> To reuse sensory bin fillers , we simply store the materials in an airtight container or in a zipper seal bag . Then we store in a dry , cool place until the next time we want to use it . <p> When your children outgrow the sensory materials that you have collected and stored ( or perhaps they do n't even like the texture of a particular material ) , then consider donating and sharing it with others . Donate your unused sensory bin fillers to a preschool , a daycare , a friend , or any other early childhood facility to reuse . Recycle that sensory collection ! <p> There 's no need to create a sensory stash of dyed oats and chickpeas , etc. because you can easily incorporate sensory into cooking , baking , and meal prep times . For example , your children could knead pizza or bread dough . Or they could lick the spoon after making chocolate cake . Let them smell spice containers as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a recipe . You likely know how messy scooping flour can be with little kids and they will inevitably get some flour on their hands or arms . That right there is sensory play . <h> Sensory Play Tip #8 : Use a splat mat to reduce waste <p> When we play with sensory bins , I always use a shower curtain as a splat mat on the floor . It not only helps to protect the floor or carpet if we are using something really messy and colorful , but it also catches and contains any sensory bin fillers that may spill out during sensory play . When the kids are done playing , I simply pick up the shower curtain and shake the items back into the sensory bin before putting the materials away for storage . 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

He reads my blog everyday and happily listens to me as I rave about my latest milestones or go on and on about my disappointments . He also helps me go through photos for the blog when I just ca n't decide which images to keep and which ones to get rid of . And he has been a trooper , helping me out with my crazy wild ideas . The most crazy of all being the homemade light bright tabletop . So to thank him I am going to fulfill my promise of writing about something extremely important to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bacon , BACON ! Love you . <p> Of course , I should thank Randi and Sheila for pushing , prodding , bugging , encouraging me to just jump on in and write a blog . I 'm so glad that I listened to you . <p> Then there 's my best friend , Lisha . She 's my biggest supporter on my Facebook page , which I am grateful for . In case you did n't know , Facebook is a jerk . Facebook likes to show my posts to only a very small percentage of my Facebook fans so every single like and comment that she has given me has been greatly appreciated . <p> Then there 's the amazing women behind the following blogs that have been there to support , encourage , work together with , and laugh together with .

Do n't make me celebrate alone ... please . <h> Wednesday , February 26 , 2014 <p> Yes , I , Dyan Robson , sometimes struggle to come up with creative ways to bond as a family through play . <p> Phew . I said it . <p> And sometimes browsing Pinterest does n't help either . I either end up completely overwhelmed or find nothing that fits what I am looking for . <p> I 'm also willing to bet that I am not the only parent out there that has days like this . <p> Well , that 's where something like the Together Box can be an invaluable resource for parents . The goal of the Together Box is to " make family together time easy . " Basically , you sign up to their subscription service and they send you a box filled with great stuff to do together as a family based on a theme . Crafts , activities , games , and more ! All in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , I was pleased to see that the theme of the box was balloons ! <p> Balloons are awesome . Balloons are fun . And more importantly , the boys love balloons ( see here ) .

Yes , tape , markers , food coloring , and even flour for the craft are included ! I was particularly drawn to their beautiful instruction booklet . It is well laid out , easy to follow , and even includes a page for other fun balloon play ideas . <p> The first thing we did is the same thing we do every single time we play with balloons . We blow them up and make noise with them ! J spent a good thirty minutes giggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd like to try the balloon ninja game . So I blew up five different colored balloons and drew some ninja faces on them . <p> J also drew one of his own . It 's such a super cute ninja what with its button nose and all . Aw ... <p> Daddy 's job was to hang the balloons . The only problem was finding the right place to hang them . Unfortunately , our ceilings are primarily popcorn ceilings so tape does not stick to them . Luckily , our basement does not have popcorn ceilings so we were able to hang them there . Once the ninjas were happily lurking in our basement , I assembled the balloon marshmallow shooters for our ninja hunting . The boys , however , found them challenging to operate so it was on to plan B. <p> Since the balloons were hanging low enough for the boys to jump and hit them with their hands , my husband and I would call out a color of a ninja and they would run and hit the corresponding ninja . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in sweat ! <p> The boys also played hide and seek with the balloon ninjas later that day . My husband hid them throughout the house and the boys had to search for the hidden ninjas . <p> There were also two balloon science activities included in this box , including balloon rockets ... <p> ... and a balloon water fountain ! K thought that the balloon water fountain was especially entertaining . <p> There are still many more ideas left to try out from the balloon box with lots of extra supplies to do so . We were able to spread the activities contained in the box throughout a week and the boys certainly did not get bored and that 's saying something because , well , they 're two and four years old ! Attention spans of young kids are often fleeting . <p> The balloon box was a hit . Here 's what I liked about our Together Box : <p> It came with all the materials ( and lots of extras ! ) needed for the activities and crafts . <p> The instruction booklet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide variety of activities to try , ranging from active indoor activities to crafts to science experiments . <p> The activities can easily be tailored to a wide range of ages .

J had the right idea . <p> K , on other hand , liked to play the French horn backwards and hands-free .

My boys just love adding these DIY road signs to their car play . They 're also a great way to work on fine motor skills . And I love that the signs are interchangeable . <p> If you have a color printer , then you could simply print out the road signs that you want to use . I , however , do not have a color printer , so I chose to make my own from scratch using cardstock and permanent markers . I decided to make speed signs , stop signs , yield signs , road signs , and traffic lights . You can make any sign you want really . The traffic lights were made a little bit differently . I used cardstock and colored dot stickers to make them . <p> To make the signs more durable , I ran them through the laminator . Then I reassembled the clothespins and let the kids add the signs that they wanted ! The signs look great on our homemade road tabletop , especially next to our homemade wooden trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more fun ways to play with cars ? Try out these other fun DIY car ideas ! <p> One particular evening , one of the clear paint cans was lying empty on the floor . K picked it up and started banging on it like a drum . That 's when the rainbow drums were created ! <p> I took all of our paint cans filled with glass stones , ensuring that the lids were on tight , and put them on the light table upside down . I decided to put them upside down because then the surface of the drum would be slightly bigger and not indented . I also did n't want to risk having the boys dent the lids so that I could n't open the paint cans afterwards . I arranged them in a rainbow order and set out some wooden spoons . The rainbow drums looked so magical ! <p> You 'll notice that the number of glass stones varies from paint can to paint can . That 's the science part of this activity . The sound of the drums varied depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each paint can ended up having a slightly different tone . <p> To set the mood for some music fun , I put on J 's favorite song , which at the time was " Eraser " from the Barenaked Ladies ' Snacktime album .

He substituted a tablespoon for the wooden spoons and drummed away as fast as he could . <p> The boys had a blast and only one paint can ended up with a few small dents in it . <p> Here are some more fun drum activities or other ways to explore music using light : <h> Monday , February 17 , 2014 <p> I think this light table idea may possibly be my most brilliant idea to date .

What kid does n't love to play with balloons ? ! 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Light Table Activity for Kids Using Balloons <p> To make this light table activity just that much better , I turned our light table into a sticky light table using contact paper . Okay , actually I did n't have any contact paper on hand at the time , so I had to substitute strips of clear packing tape , which worked just as well . So I taped strips of clear packing tape on the light table , sticky side up . Then I blew up six balloons and placed them on the sticky tape . <p> The boys were surprised to find balloons on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glow of the light table through the balloons . <p> But , wait ! What 's this ? The balloons are stuck ? ! <p> Well , the boys certainly did not expect this twist , but I think that 's what made this activity so much fun . The boys had a blast pulling the balloons off the tape and then placing them back on . Over and over . Sometimes they would count the balloons as they put them back onto the light table . Other times they would name the colors of the balloons . They also enjoyed ripping the balloons off of the tape as fast as they could and would laugh hysterically as the balloons popped up into the air , like below . <p> Like I mentioned , this light table activity kept the boys busy for an entire morning . It had them counting , naming colors , running , making patterns on the light table , and so much more . It has easily been the best and most enjoyable light table activity we have ever done . <h> Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play on the light table , but you may have already figured that out . They have created with cups and stones and have made monsters and robots from loose parts . This latest invitation to play with loose parts on the light table got a little bit colorful , but was nothing but fun for the boys . It 's the perfect STEM engineering light table activity for preschoolers. 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Simple STEM Light Table Activity for Kids <p> After a couple of failed attempts to balance a clear plastic plate on two tube shots , J eventually figured out that three or four tube shots might be a better base for his colorful tower . And in case you are wondering how his feet are on the table , it 's because lately , he likes to sit on an exercise ball while playing at the light table . <p> J soon declared that his tower was actually a birthday cake and that the tube shots on top were birthday candles . And I absolutely love that I was able to capture this amazing photo of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday cake crashed down , the boys started building with the colored CD cases .

We have two different sizes of tube shots so the kind from the dollar store end up fitting inside our Target tube shots . It 's a great way to explore color mixing too . So we were able to discuss and see how the colors changed when different tube shots were inserted into other tube shots .

@@23062469 @3062469/ <h> Friday , June 26 , 2015 <p> Summertime is a great time to do blog maintenance and it is usually when I decide to do something completely drastic on social media . Last summer , my focus was Pinterest . I started doing lots of experimenting , deleting of pins , deleting of boards , and that sort of thing . Shortly after , my Pinterest following exploded ( you can read more about that here ) . This summer I have decided to focus on Instagram . I have n't been enjoying Instagram , even though I love photography and I am capable of taking beautiful photographs . So why did I hate it so much ? What was I doing wrong ? <h> Why I Needed to Change My Instagram Strategy <p> I can not seem to get into Instagram no matter how hard I try and despite everyone I know declaring their love for this social media platform . I love taking photos . And I think that I take beautiful photos . Should n't I love a photography based social media platform then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closer look at what it is about Instagram that I like and what I do n't like . Then I figured out one reason why I might not be enjoying this platform : I was simply uninspired . Nearly everything that showed up in my Instagram newsfeed was lackluster or uninspiring or filled with text . I was hardly ever actually scrolling through my newsfeed and hardly liking photos . I just simply did not like what I was seeing . Then I wondered : do others feel the same when they see my photos ? Obviously , I hope not . <p> A few days after I started pondering switching up my Instagram strategy , I read a post about 10 mom Instagrammers to follow . I went through that list only to be further disappointed . One account was filled with photos of kids crying and throwing tantrums , which I will never ever support ( that 's another story ! ) . Another was basically just photos taken from blogs ( shared with proper credit ) with zero original photos . Oh and then there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the original author . Needless to say , I found only one account to follow in that list and it turns out I was already following that person . So again , I was left uninspired . <p> Then I remembered reading this blog post about using Instagram wrong sometime last year and some of the key points from it still lingered in my mind . I decided it was finally time to take action and come up with some kind of Instagram plan for my blog . <h> What Changes I Made to My Instagram Account <p> STEP ONE : UNFOLLOW PEOPLE <p> The first course of action was to start unfollowing people . And I unfollowed a lot . More than half of the people that I was following were gone just like that . My criteria for unfollowing and not unfollowing : <p> Is this person a Facebook friend who often cross posts to Facebook ? If yes , unfollow . I can like their photos on Facebook instead . <p> Is this person a company that I want to work with who seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think tagging that company in a photo will be a much more effective way to make brand connections . <p> Does this person post regularly ? If no , unfollow . <p> Is this person posting lots of photos filled with text , such as photo quotes or screenshots ? If yes , unfollow . I want to see photos . PHOTOS , people . <p> Is this person a fellow blogger that I simply followed because we were doing a Instagram follow thread in our mutual blogging network group on Facebook ? If yes , unfollow . I want to follow someone because I truly enjoy their photos , not because I feel obligated to follow them . I hope other bloggers follow me because they like my photos and will interact with them rather than follow me out of obligation and never engage . Also , I am not doing fellow bloggers any favors if I am following them , but never engaging with their photos . <p> Is this person a blogger who is part of my blogging tribe ? If yes , do not unfollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogging peeps because I love them to bits ! <p> Is this person a supposed Instagram rockstar and I followed them simply because of their rockstar status ? If yes , unfollow . Most of these accounts were filled with crap I did not enjoy , especially photos filled with text . <p> Does the person post nice clear photos ? If no , unfollow . <p> Before I knew it I unfollowed over half of who I was following . My newsfeed already began to look much better . Do I feel bad for unfollowing family and blogging companions ? Yes , but my ultimate goal is to enjoy Instagram and see beautiful photos . Those people just did n't seem to fit this goal . <p> STEP TWO : FIND NEW PEOPLE TO FOLLOW <p> I started perusing my favorite hashtags and started following new people who had an interest in photography and/or kids activities . Then I would look at who those people were following . Soon I had a whole new crop of beautiful Instagram accounts filling my newsfeed . It was starting to look much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy browsing my newsfeed . <p> STEP THREE : SHARE MORE OF MY DSLR PHOTOS <p> My smartphone is already like four years old and it does n't have the greatest camera , but I kept using it on Instagram because it was easy and convenient . But I knew from the time that I started using Instagram that it was not the quality of photos that I wanted to be sharing . So I have started sharing more photos from my DSLR camera . I have also been deleting photos , on occasion , that no longer fit with my overall strategy . <p> Instagram tip : Email yourself a copy of your DSLR photos . Then you can download them onto your phone and upload to Instagram . <p> I 'm starting to use more photography based hashtags in hopes that I can get featured by one of these larger accounts and/or gain new followers from other Instagrammers who use the same hashtags . I also use these hashtags to find new people to follow ( see Step 2 ) . I also want to start participating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theme and have to share a photo based on that theme . Here is an example of my increase in hashtags . <p> For me , the photos should do the talking on Instagram . I rarely read long blocks of text on any social media . So I am going to keep the text that I use to accompany my photos short . One or two sentences max . Here is an example of my short and sweet text . <p> I rarely shared on Instagram , maybe one photo every other day . And I did so because I felt like I had to share there regularly . Now my goal is to share lots of photos per day , perhaps a minimum of five photos . I never want to cluster more than two together in a short time span because I do n't want to be spammy , but I want to share at more regular intervals . I am sure there will still be days where I post absolutely no photos and that 's okay . I do n't want Instagram to feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instagram Experiment <p> When I first started implementing these changes , I had a lot of people unfollow me . And that 's okay . My goal is to curate a gallery of photos that I love and to also attract followers who are actually going to engage with my photos . No point in having a large following if they are n't going to regularly interact with my photos , right ? <p> I am already enjoying Instagram more because now my newsfeed is filled with beautiful photos . And I hope that people are enjoying my feed more because the photos are carefully selected and carefully edited . <p> And who knows ? Maybe my drastic experimenting will pay off again like it did for Pinterest . Time will tell . <p> Of course , I 'd like you to follow me on Instagram , but only if you truly find my photos interesting and beautiful . 17098 @qwx217098 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

As you can see , little hands could not resist touching them . First , there were two hands . <p> For each color of the rainbow , I put 1.5 cups of chickpeas and about 5-8 squirts of liquid watercolors in a plastic bag . Then I let the boys shake and mix the contents until the chickpeas were well coated . You may need to add more liquid watercolors to get complete bean coverage .

They dry almost instantly . Seriously . Within minutes , the chickpeas were dry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for hours for them to dry . Yay ! <p> The other reason why rainbow dyed chickpeas are simply the best sensory bin filler : their weight .

" It involves moving pennies from one side of the piano to the other each time a child plays a difficult section correctly . Play it wrong and a penny moves back to the original side . Once all the pennies move to the other side , the child not only wins the game , but they get to keep the pennies ( or candies or whatever else you may substitute ) . <p> Record you child playing the piano .

And trust me , this type of xylophone will be your favorite as it makes no noise . <p> To make the page , I sewed two strips of brown felt to make the base . Then I sewed seven white rectangles to make the bars of the xylophone . I then hot glued velcro dots to each rectangle . <p> Then I made the xylophone bars from felt by cutting rectangles out and then hot gluing velcro on the back . I chose to do the bars in rainbow colors as a way to reinforce the order of the colors of the rainbow . I also hemmed and hawed about putting the musical alphabet on the bars of the xylophone as a way to reinforce the letters of the musical alphabet . It would have also been another way for the boys to practice putting the bars of the xylophone in the correct order . However , I decided against the letters since I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regardless , the boys can match the bars by size or use the order of the colors as a guide . <p> And , of course , no xylophone is complete without mallets ! To make the mallets , I cut a rectangle piece of grey felt . I then folded it in half , hot glued it , and then repeated . The hot glue helped to make the mallets sturdy . During the first hot glue stage , I also glued a long piece of ribbon to each mallet so that the mallets could be attached to the quiet book page . I then hot glued a large white pom pom onto the end of each mallet . <p> As you can probably see in the pictures , I cut a slit for the ribbon to go through at the bottom of the page . Just make sure you slide the ribbon through the slit before hot gluing the ribbon to both mallets. 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

These DIY color blocks are just one of the many homemade light table toys that I have made . At just a fraction of the cost , these color blocks can be made in just a few minutes with simple materials from the dollar store . <p> And they 're so pretty ! 17101 @qwx217101 <p> I have always admired color blocks . I think they are gorgeous on light tables and overhead projectors , but even more beautiful in natural light . I just do n't like the price tag that goes along with them .

Mine were $3.00 , but like I said , I found them cheaper at the dollar store . You will also need some colorful translucent duotangs or transparencies ( also found at the dollar store ) . I used the leftover transparencies from my homemade light table manipulatives . Then grab some scissors and your hot glue gun . I promise these are really easy to make .

I did n't take pictures along the way , but here 's a video tutorial for assembling the blocks . <p> Repeat multiple times , using a different colored transparency for each block . I ended up with six blocks in each of the following colors : orange , yellow , clear , green , blue , and purple . <p> The only downside ( or limitation ) to my homemade version of the color blocks is that I could only make little rectangles or squares . No semi-circles or triangles for me , but I 'm okay with that because I love how mine turned out . And more importantly , the boys love them ! 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <p> Holy Awesomeness Batman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 2 small sets of the rainbow/window blocks and I 've been saving up my amazon rewards to get more ( because they are a favorite and we never seem to have enough ) but now I can spend the rewards on something else and make these ! ! ! ! <p> Those store bought ones were a " top-five " on our Christmas list .

A double layer would be a great idea if you think the kids are going to play rough with them .

We do not have light table accessories or color blocks !

@@23062482 @3062482/ <h> Tuesday , March 11 , 2014 <p> Six years ago , an amazing woman left this world way too early . Her name was Janice and she was my aunt . <p> Auntie Jan was always supportive of my love for writing , so I think it 's appropriate that March 11th will forever be dedicated to remembering her . So today I am putting aside all my creative posts to focus on celebrating her . <p> Last year I wrote this particularly powerful post in remembrance of Auntie Jan . It is easily the most heartfelt and personal post on my blog , but it is the one that I am most proud of . I can not read it without ending up in tears . It is raw and emotional . Please consider reading it before continuing to read today 's post . <p> When I wrote about her last year , I mentioned that I have little hints of her hidden throughout my home . Two of my favorite things that remind me of her are the ring she gave me before she died and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I admitted that I did not remember the story behind the ring , but thankfully , my grandpa and his cousin Lloyd were able to fill in the gap . The ring is a family heirloom . Apparently , the ring can be traced all the way back to my grandpa 's great grandmother . For generations it was passed down to the youngest daughter in that family . However , my Great Grandma Bing only had sons , so the ring was then passed down to the youngest daughter of her oldest son . That daughter was my Auntie Jan . Jan also had three sons and no daughters . She was then free to pass the ring down to whomever she chose . Jan had decided to give the ring to me as I am the youngest female in my generation . My grandpa informs me that the ring is probably worthless in terms of monetary value . However , it is a constant reminder of Auntie Jan , which makes it worth something , at least to me . <p> Another constant reminder I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bridal shower gift . More importantly , there 's a handwritten recipe for her delicious chocolate chip cookies in the book . Every March I whip up a batch of these cookies . Okay , I whip up a batch on other occasions too , but I do make a point to make some every March . It is my way of connecting with her , even if it 's just through seeing her words written on the page . <p> In celebration of my Auntie Jan , I am going to share the recipe so that you can enjoy a cookie or two or three of your own . Seriously , these are the best chocolate chip cookies ever . They are moist , chewy , and so fricking good . <p> I have tried modifying the recipe in the past to make them healthier , but after protests from my husband , I now know not to mess around with Jan 's recipe . As my husband says , " If I 'm going to have a chocolate chip cookie , then I do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of sugar . " <h> Remembering Jan : More than the Disease She Battled <p> If you read this post , then you 'll know that my Auntie Jan battled ovarian cancer . Of course , I want her to be remembered for more than just the disease that took her life . She deserves to be remembered for her love , her sense of humor , and her delicious chocolate chip cookies , which you can now enjoy anytime you 'd like . <p> However , I can not carry on her legacy without educating others about ovarian cancer . Breastfeeding can help lower your risk and it is just one of the ways that I hope to protect myself from the disease . I will be celebrating 4 and a half years straight ( or 54 consecutive months , but who 's counting ? ) on March 13th . Each day and month helps to lower my risk . <p> So please educate yourself on the disease . The faces of ovarian cancer are our mothers , grandmothers , sisters , daughters , and aunts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please check out these resources : 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <p> What a wonderful tribute to a wonderful woman !

@@23062485 @3062485/ <h> Saturday , June 07 , 2014 <p> As a piano teacher , I am frequently asked , " What is a good age to start piano lessons ? " Truthfully , the answer is that it depends on the child . Ideally , I prefer to start with kids around age 6-8 due to reading skills , but I have taught quite a few kids younger than this age group as well . <p> Although there is no clear-cut answer to this question , there are numerous signs that indicate whether or not your child is ready to begin piano lessons . <h> 8 Signs That Your Child is Ready for Piano Lessons <p> Here are the readiness signs that I look for when interviewing potential new students : <p> Does your child know the difference between left and right ? Playing the piano requires the use of both hands , so being able to distinguish one hand from the other is an important skill . <p> Does your child know the alphabet , specifically the first seven letters ( A-B-C-D-E-F-G ) ? The musical alphabet is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to identify and name these letters in order to read music . <p> Can your child count to ten ? With really young beginners ( age 4-5 ) , I focus on counting to four . The note values and time signatures in beginner music focus on one count , two counts , three counts , or four counts . However , it is ideal if a child can count to a higher number as music is heavily based in math . Distance between notes ( intervals ) rely on counting the number of notes that separate them . Even the basic scale patterns are mathematically based . <p> Can your child focus and pay attention for 30 minutes ? All of my beginner lessons are 30 minutes in length . However , I usually reserve ten minutes of each lesson to do more hands on music activities , especially for really young beginners . As a result , I need students to be able to focus and pay attention for a minimum of 20 minutes . <p> Has your child expressed an interest in taking music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano are more likely to be motivated to practice . <p> How are the child 's fine motor skills ? Can your child hold a pencil or cut with scissors ? Playing the piano requires a lot of fine motor dexterity , so having well tuned fine motor skills makes a huge difference . <p> Can your child read ? Teaching piano to a child who can read makes a lot of things easier , including practicing more independently and reading practice instructions on their own . Plus , beginner piano music tends to have lyrics for the child to sing while they practice . Being able to read allows the child to sing the lyrics while they play which can increase their rhythmic accuracy and timing . <h> Parents Need to Be Ready Too ! <p> Parents also need to consider the following when assessing whether or not their child is ready for piano lessons : 17095 @qwx217095 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <p> Do n't necessarily turn away a student who is lacking one of these readiness indicators . I taught a child who could not bend his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did learn to do so and then progressed rapidly ! <p> I do n't use these readiness signs as an all or none checklist . They are just general indicators . I evaluate each new potential student on an individual basis and have accepted plenty of new students who do n't meet all of these signs . <p> Great Resource ! I had been wondering about how to incorporate learning music in our lives , since I do n't  play any instrument . I 'm now looking for some class that teach kids as young as 3 years old .

@@23062497 @3062497/ <h> Wednesday , February 04 , 2015 <p> Children with hyperlexia are amazing at decoding text , but understanding the text and understanding speech is another thing . So kids with hyperlexia struggle with comprehension . Pronouns usually cause problems , for instance . That means , kids with hyperlexia will often have pronoun reversals and/or use third person pronouns instead of first person . They also struggle answering " wh " questions . They also struggle with inferences . So what can parents do to improve comprehension ? Here are some of the strategies that we use with our son . <p> Please remember that I am not a speech pathologist . I am simply a parent of a child with hyperlexia . These are the strategies that we have found to be effective with our child . 17101 @qwx217101 <p> 1 . Play I Spy Games <p> To model proper first person pronoun usage , we like to play I spy type games . We play them at home when reading books or while driving in the car or while out shopping . We always phrase it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you see ? " Be sure to point to the object that you are " spying . " There are a few of advantages to phrasing it the way that we do : <p> It encourages our son to pose questions and continue the conversation . <p> It shows that both " you " and " I " can relate to different people . <p> It encourages him to look around his environment and choose something . <p> It encourages turn taking . <p> It introduces and reinforces vocabulary and pairs the visual stimulus with the word . <p> 2 . Describe the World Around You <p> Talk about people running , walking , playing , driving , etc. around you . Model proper pronouns . For example , if I see a person running , then I will point and say , " Look ! He is running . Do you see him running ? " Additionally , I try to pair boy/girl with he/she . So I could say , " Look at that girl on the swing . She is swinging . " <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I was feeling hungry , then I would just go to the kitchen and grab a snack . I would n't typically announce that I 'm feeling hungry or that I want a snack . However , my son needs me to model phrases like " I am feeling hungry . " So I use everyday occurrences to teach speech and comprehension to my son with hyperlexia . Instead of just going to the fridge and grabbing an apple , I can announce , " I am hungry . I want an apple for a snack . " Or when I 'm washing my hands , I will say , " I wash my hands with soap and water . " It seems silly and tedious to dictate my entire day , but it makes a huge difference . The benefits of this approach : <p> It discusses feelings and emotions and shows what I do when I feel a certain way or what I do or say when I need something . <p> It models proper pronoun usage . Most of the time , my son still phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J needs a snack , " but occasionally , he will use the proper pronoun and say , " I am hungry " simply because I have modeled it for him endlessly . <p> It helps teach inference : Mom must be feeling hungry when she opens the fridge and grabs a snack . So if I see her eating an apple , then I can infer that she is hungry . <p> 4 . Use Short Sentences <p> Short clear sentences seem to be the easiest for my son to understand . I like to remind myself of the psychological concept of " 7 plus or minus 2 , " the number of things people can remember in their working memory , when I am phrasing my sentences . So sentences with five to nine words are the best , but I usually stay closer to the lower end of that range . For example , " My feet are cold . I need socks . " works better than " I need to get some socks because my feet are cold . " <p> 5 . Use Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and answering basic questions every day . Things like , " What is your name ? " or " How old are you ? " or " When 's your birthday ? " I initially wrote down the questions and their appropriate answers on a piece of paper . Remember , reading is a hyperlexic child 's best asset ! The script would look something like this : <p> " What is your name ? " " My name is Dyan Robson . What 's your name ? " <p> Be sure to include a question to help keep the conversation going . <p> After practicing with the written script , we would practice verbally . We would take turns asking each other the questions . I usually initiated the conversation by shaking J 's hand and saying , " Hi . My name is Dyan . What is your name ? " He would continue to shake my hand while he answered my questions , but it worked ! <p> The advantages of using speech scripts : <p> It 's a good way to practice asking and answering " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their advantage . <p> It encourages turn taking . <p> It encourages our son to pose a follow up question to keep the conversation going . <p> The disadvantages of using speech scripts : <p> The questions I use in the script wo n't always be worded exactly the same . <p> Sometimes he would read the whole question and answer himself , not realizing that he should ask the question and that someone else would answer it . <p> 6 . Practice " Wh " Questions Through Games <p> The I Spy game I talked about in tip #1 is a great example of this tip . You can also purchase and play this " wh " bingo game . It 's a great way to practice asking " wh " questions and then answering them . And my boys love to play it ! <p> When I hear my son saying things in third person , I will stop him and remind him of how to properly phrase the sentence . The key is to be concrete and literal , but not negative . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will say , " J , you can say ' I want a turn . ' " He will then repeat what I have said . Whatever you do , do not use negative language like , " We do n't say this ... " or " No that 's wrong . " If I want him to repeat a specific phrase , then I give him that specific phrase in a positive and simple way . J is a literal thinker so I have to give him exactly the right words to repeat . Like exactly . Correcting speech errors seems tedious , and it is , but it is effective . <p> 8 . When in Doubt , Write it Out ! <p> Similar to tip #5 , when my son does n't seem to be comprehending things , then I write it out or literally spell it out . I can repeat the phrase , " Eat your supper " over and over until my head explodes , for example , but if I take a moment to write a checklist with specific instructions like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eat your peas . " then it 's much more successful . The same idea applies to new words or experiences . Writing social stories helps to give him the words he needs to understand and explain the world around him and/or describe new experiences . We use these social stories to give him speech phrases we want him to model too ! 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

Many months ago I started writing an ebook on the topic , but it has been put on hold for awhile .

It usually takes the form of , " So I have a light table . Now what do I do ? " or " How do I introduce light table play to my kids ?

Just click the image or the link below the image to read the full details . <p> The easiest way to introduce your child to light table play is to play off of their interests . Take what they already love and use that as inspiration for creating a light table invitation . So if your child is into dinosaurs , then set up a dinosaur small world . Or perhaps your child loves the color green . Then set out a variety of green objects on the light table . <p> Here are a couple of light table invitations that I set up based on my boys ' interests at the time .

Ask open-ended questions , such as the following , to prompt their curiosity and guide their play : <p> What does the object look like on the light table ? <p> How does the object change when on the light table ? <p> What happens if you layer these two translucent items ? <p> Literally show them how the light table works . Show them how two translucent items change color when layered , for instance . Or just play along because it 's fun , like I did for this funny face building activity . <p> Put mirrors near the light table . Children love to interact with themselves in the mirror , so having them nearby may help entice them into playing on the light table . Mirrors can also be used to extend the play ( see an example here ) . <p> Have an on/off switch accessible , if possible . My youngest loves that he can control the light table all by himself .

Darkening the room will help reduce environmental distractions , which is especially important if your child is sensitive to sensory input . <p> Have light table toys and accessories accessible to little hands . Children are then free to choose what they want to bring to the light table on their own terms . <p> Put light table accessories in clear containers so that kids can see what 's inside ! Again , it enables them to choose what they want to bring to the light table . <p> Take their favorite toy or something they love , but have n't played with in awhile and put it on the light table . The light table always transforms objects and can bring new life to something old .

Please note that B. Toys provided me with this product free of charge , but all opinions expressed below are mine and were not influenced by the free product . <p> The Symphony in B arrived at my door , mid-preschooler-meltdown and it was a welcome distraction . I had just pulled it out of the box and J 's eyes lit right up . You 'll notice that he 's checking it out even though it 's still fully covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 brightly colored instruments , including familiar favorites such as the piano , flute , and drums and some different instruments from around the world such as the sitar and koto . J 's favorite is the purple accordion . Each instrument is constructed down to the tiniest of details like the buttons on the accordion or the knobs on the end of the guitar . The name of each instrument is also included on the base . K tried to assist me in getting a close up of the tuba . Instead , you 'll have to settle with a picture of his sweet little face just beyond the blurry orange blob . <p> Each instrument has a different shaped base , which means the Symphony in B doubles as a shape sorter , as K so kindly demonstrates below . <p> There are many other cool features about the Symphony in B , including : <p> A compartment on the back for storing all the instruments when not in use . And , believe me , that sliding door has provided a lot of additional enjoyment to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom to make the toy easier to carry . <p> The whole toy itself is see through , which means you can see all the neat electronic stuff inside . <p> There are many buttons to delight little button pressers like K. There are even specific buttons to help your kids learn which instruments make up which instrument family . For instance , if you press " woodwinds , " the light by flute and clarinet light up . <p> A songbook with the lyrics to all 15 different songs is included in the packaging . So sing along to your heart 's content or as long as your children can stand to listen to you sing . Ha ! <p> Lots of cool features , right ? Now you 're probably wondering how it works . Well , it 's easy peasy ! You get to be the conductor of an orchestra . You pick up to six different instrument and place them in the orchestra pit area . Press play . Then the Symphony in B will play the chosen song using only the instruments that were placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Symphony with just a sitar and tuba ? ! You have n't lived until you 've tried it ! <p> As you can see , choosing the instruments is the hardest part . <p> Hmmm ... what to choose ... what to choose ... <p> There are so many ways to learn about music with the Symphony in B , which is , of course , why I love it , not only as a parent , but as a piano teacher . Here are just some of the ways you can learn about music : <p> Explore the concept of tempo by pressing the tempo buttons up or down . <p> Explore the concept of dynamics by pressing the volume control up or down . <p> Press the melody or accompaniment buttons while a song is playing to find out which instruments play which parts . <p> Learn which instruments belong to which instrument family by pressing the different instrument family buttons . <p> Learn the names of the instruments , including how to spell the names . <p> Listen to the individual instruments to discover what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchestra pit to hear it on its own ! <p> Listen to famous classical music pieces including Brahm 's Lullaby or Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony . <p> You can check out this video below to see how it works . <p> By now , I 'm sure you 've picked up on the fact that I love , love , LOVE the Symphony in B. I want to play with it just as much as my boys do ( read that as the suggested age of 3-13 years should be changed to include 29 year old me ! ) . However , there were only four slight changes I would suggest : <p> The koto instrument piece has a tendency to topple over . I wish the koto stood more upright to counteract this problem . <p> Allow for more instruments in the orchestra pit . Six just is n't enough for J. He always wants to cram as many instruments in there as he can ! <p> Make the demo button smaller . My boys love to press the demo button a lot , often missing out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to get caught in the storage compartment . I guess I 'd like it to be a bit roomier so that the long , skinny instruments do n't get caught . <p> Overall , the Symphony in B surpassed all my expectations . I knew it was going to be a really cool toy , but it is way better than I could have ever imagined . I simply adore it . No wonder it won Toy of the Year . Furthermore , after reading all the little hilarious tidbits hidden throughout the packaging , I wanted to learn more about the company and their other products . Their sense of humor in their marketing definitely made me appreciate their company . <p> " Congratulations ! You read through all of that tiny text ? Your eyes are very good , and your patience is admirable . " - on the boring FCC Rules compliance sheet <p> " Until you find ' toy sunscreen'right next to the ' baby sunscreen , ' please keep this toy out of the hot sun . Symphonies and orchestras really like indoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of Symphony in B <p> That 's not all . When you purchase a B. Toy like Symphony in B , 10 cents is donated to Free the Children . Does n't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy ? And all their packaging is recyclable ! 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 <h> 6 comments : <p> We love their products and I literally almost got this toy today ! I could n't make up my mind , so I decided to shop another day . But now I know for the future and I ca n't wait to pick up this toy . I know my son would LOVE it ! <p> I have never seen any of their products locally , but now that we have two Targets , they might be available .

@@23062536 @3062536/ <h> Monday , July 21 , 2014 <p> I was looking for a quick and easy sensory activity to set up for the boys today when I remembered Fun at Home with Kids ' Polka Dot Soup .

@@23062537 @3062537/ <h> Monday , June 29 , 2015 <p> Summer is in full swing and so is the water play . This pirate themed sensory soup was a great way to turn around a crazy morning . It encouraged lots of fine motor practice , story telling , and exploration of mathematical concepts . And like all of the sensory soups we have done , this sensory soup was quick and simple to set up . 17100 @qwx217100 <p> This sensory soup idea came about after a trip to the bookstore . I was on the hunt for some summer reads about autism and the boys were literally running around and hiding among the shelves . It was hectic and I was getting worn out , so we were about to leave when a staff member flagged us down . She asked if it was okay to give them something that was leftover from one of their weekly story times . I happily agreed since I was so stressed from the experience . She gave them each a bag of pirate loot . Inside the bag were adorable foam pirates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were happy and I was mere minutes away from a quiet car ride . <p> The boys played with pirates and coins in the car and it continued when we got home , so I decided to turn them into a water play idea for the boys . The result : pirate sensory soup ! <p> Kitchen utensils : whisk , ladle , and large spoon , but measuring cups , measuring spoons , etc. would also be a great addition <p> Simply toss everything into a sensory bin and it 's ready for playing ! <p> Sensory soups are great because they encourage fine motor skills like scooping , pouring , and whisking . <p> Sensory soups are also great for encouraging story telling . Obviously , these stories were pirate inspired . <p> Finally , I love sensory soups because it encourages mathematical learning like measuring , estimation , counting , patterning , and more . The boys used the coins and gems to make patterns and count , for example . <h> Friday , June 26 , 2015 <p> Summertime is a great time to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something completely drastic on social media . Last summer , my focus was Pinterest . I started doing lots of experimenting , deleting of pins , deleting of boards , and that sort of thing . Shortly after , my Pinterest following exploded ( you can read more about that here ) . This summer I have decided to focus on Instagram . I have n't been enjoying Instagram , even though I love photography and I am capable of taking beautiful photographs . So why did I hate it so much ? What was I doing wrong ? <h> Why I Needed to Change My Instagram Strategy <p> I can not seem to get into Instagram no matter how hard I try and despite everyone I know declaring their love for this social media platform . I love taking photos . And I think that I take beautiful photos . Should n't I love a photography based social media platform then ? What was the problem ? <p> So I started taking a closer look at what it is about Instagram that I like and what I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might not be enjoying this platform : I was simply uninspired . Nearly everything that showed up in my Instagram newsfeed was lackluster or uninspiring or filled with text . I was hardly ever actually scrolling through my newsfeed and hardly liking photos . I just simply did not like what I was seeing . Then I wondered : do others feel the same when they see my photos ? Obviously , I hope not . <p> A few days after I started pondering switching up my Instagram strategy , I read a post about 10 mom Instagrammers to follow . I went through that list only to be further disappointed . One account was filled with photos of kids crying and throwing tantrums , which I will never ever support ( that 's another story ! ) . Another was basically just photos taken from blogs ( shared with proper credit ) with zero original photos . Oh and then there were three accounts that were basically linked to or had some connection with the original author . Needless to say , I found only one account to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already following that person . So again , I was left uninspired . <p> Then I remembered reading this blog post about using Instagram wrong sometime last year and some of the key points from it still lingered in my mind . I decided it was finally time to take action and come up with some kind of Instagram plan for my blog . <h> What Changes I Made to My Instagram Account <p> STEP ONE : UNFOLLOW PEOPLE <p> The first course of action was to start unfollowing people . And I unfollowed a lot . More than half of the people that I was following were gone just like that . My criteria for unfollowing and not unfollowing : <p> Is this person a Facebook friend who often cross posts to Facebook ? If yes , unfollow . I can like their photos on Facebook instead . <p> Is this person a company that I want to work with who seems to follow no one back ? If yes , unfollow . I think tagging that company in a photo will be a much more effective way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If no , unfollow . <p> Is this person posting lots of photos filled with text , such as photo quotes or screenshots ? If yes , unfollow . I want to see photos . PHOTOS , people . <p> Is this person a fellow blogger that I simply followed because we were doing a Instagram follow thread in our mutual blogging network group on Facebook ? If yes , unfollow . I want to follow someone because I truly enjoy their photos , not because I feel obligated to follow them . I hope other bloggers follow me because they like my photos and will interact with them rather than follow me out of obligation and never engage . Also , I am not doing fellow bloggers any favors if I am following them , but never engaging with their photos . <p> Is this person a blogger who is part of my blogging tribe ? If yes , do not unfollow . I will continue to support and engage with my blogging peeps because I love them to bits ! <p> Is this person a supposed Instagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status ? If yes , unfollow . Most of these accounts were filled with crap I did not enjoy , especially photos filled with text . <p> Does the person post nice clear photos ? If no , unfollow . <p> Before I knew it I unfollowed over half of who I was following . My newsfeed already began to look much better . Do I feel bad for unfollowing family and blogging companions ? Yes , but my ultimate goal is to enjoy Instagram and see beautiful photos . Those people just did n't seem to fit this goal . <p> STEP TWO : FIND NEW PEOPLE TO FOLLOW <p> I started perusing my favorite hashtags and started following new people who had an interest in photography and/or kids activities . Then I would look at who those people were following . Soon I had a whole new crop of beautiful Instagram accounts filling my newsfeed . It was starting to look much more inspiring over on Instagram and I was actually starting to enjoy browsing my newsfeed . <p> STEP THREE : SHARE MORE OF MY DSLR PHOTOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't have the greatest camera , but I kept using it on Instagram because it was easy and convenient . But I knew from the time that I started using Instagram that it was not the quality of photos that I wanted to be sharing . So I have started sharing more photos from my DSLR camera . I have also been deleting photos , on occasion , that no longer fit with my overall strategy . <p> Instagram tip : Email yourself a copy of your DSLR photos . Then you can download them onto your phone and upload to Instagram . <p> I 'm starting to use more photography based hashtags in hopes that I can get featured by one of these larger accounts and/or gain new followers from other Instagrammers who use the same hashtags . I also use these hashtags to find new people to follow ( see Step 2 ) . I also want to start participating more in those photography challenges where you are presented with a theme and have to share a photo based on that theme . Here is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the photos should do the talking on Instagram . I rarely read long blocks of text on any social media . So I am going to keep the text that I use to accompany my photos short . One or two sentences max . Here is an example of my short and sweet text . <p> I rarely shared on Instagram , maybe one photo every other day . And I did so because I felt like I had to share there regularly . Now my goal is to share lots of photos per day , perhaps a minimum of five photos . I never want to cluster more than two together in a short time span because I do n't want to be spammy , but I want to share at more regular intervals . I am sure there will still be days where I post absolutely no photos and that 's okay . I do n't want Instagram to feel like work . <h> What I Hope to Gain from this Instagram Experiment <p> When I first started implementing these changes , I had a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to curate a gallery of photos that I love and to also attract followers who are actually going to engage with my photos . No point in having a large following if they are n't going to regularly interact with my photos , right ? <p> I am already enjoying Instagram more because now my newsfeed is filled with beautiful photos . And I hope that people are enjoying my feed more because the photos are carefully selected and carefully edited . <p> And who knows ? Maybe my drastic experimenting will pay off again like it did for Pinterest . Time will tell . <p> Of course , I 'd like you to follow me on Instagram , but only if you truly find my photos interesting and beautiful . <h> Tuesday , June 23 , 2015 <p> As part of our son 's sensory diet , we incorporate a lot of heavy work activities into his day .

Here are some of our favorites : <p> Spry Natural Chewing Gum - We choose to use natural chewing gum for our kids . This gum has a great flavor and works great ! <p> Jellystone Robot Pendant Chewable Necklace - This robot pendant is super cute and not too clunky . I do not recommend it for excessive chewers , though , as the robot 's feet can be chewed off in less than 24 hours ( not that that happened or anything ... ) <h> Thursday , June 18 , 2015 <p> Soap foam is a favorite go-to sensory activity for my boys . We have tried scented soap foam and tie dye soap foam in the past and they focused solely on the sensory experience . Recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookie cutters so I put them to use with this soap foam prewriting sensory activity . The result is lovely and it was a great way for the boys to work on writing the letters of the alphabet . <p> To make soap foam , mix soap with a splash or two of water using a hand blender , electric mixer , or stand mixer . We like to use castile soap and we have bottles after bottles of almond scented castile soap , which is seriously the most amazing smelling soap EVER . So our soap foam also happens to be scented . Mmmm . Also , we have found that using an empty foaming soap dispenser is a great way to make soap foam . I find that using an electric mixer to make a large amount of soap foam can take awhile . However , using a foaming soap dispenser with 2 tbsp of castile soap , topped up with water , works great . Plus , the kids love to help pump the dispenser . <p> You 'll also need to dilute some liquid watercolors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic applesauce cups for this purpose . We made rainbow colors because , well , life is better with rainbows . <p> Then you just place an alphabet cookie cutter on the soap foam and paint the inside with some liquid watercolors . That 's it ! <p> The painted cookie cutter letters look so pretty . I especially loved the rainbow painted W that five year old J did . <p> When the cookie cutters are removed , you can sort of see the painted letters on the soap foam . <p> Then when the boys were done painting letters , they dumped the remaining liquid watercolors in and used their hands to mix up some really colorful soap foam . <p> Love soap foam ? We do too ! Try out these other soap foam activities for kids : <h> Thursday , June 11 , 2015 <p> It has been awhile since we 've played with our rainbow dyed chickpeas , which is hard to believe because they 're my absolute favorite sensory bin filler ever . The other day I paired the rainbow chickpeas with some alphabet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my three year old . Zero preparation is involved ( unless you do n't have rainbow chickpeas already on hand , but they only take 3-5 minutes to make ) , which makes this a quick and simple activity to pull out when the kids are telling me they 're bored . 17100 @qwx217100 <p> For this simple literacy activity , we used : <p> Rainbow dyed chickpeas - They are the easiest sensory bin filler to make ever and we 've been playing with this same bag of chickpeas for almost a year already . <p> Simply add the two materials to a sensory bin and get playing . When you push the cookie cutter down , it will fill with chickpeas . <p> But three year old K found other ways to play . <p> Then he wanted to spell words . He started with " E-X " and asked me how to finish spelling EXIT . <p> Then he spelled the words IN and OUT all by himself . I really do think he has a bit of hyperlexia himself , but certainly not to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially spelled the word IN in the chickpeas and then OUT outside the chickpeas . <h> Tuesday , June 09 , 2015 <p> There are days were I have zero creativity and ca n't seem to come up with new , fun ideas for the kids . So , on those days , I often ask my husband to brainstorm with me . Well , this painting with dandelions process art idea is all his idea .

And here I thought he was n't listening to all my blog talk ... Anyway , I thought his idea was brilliant and it turned out absolutely lovely ! It 's a great way to explore nature , explore art , and work on fine motor skills . The fact that it is a frugal and simple helps too .

So , inspired by traffic lights , I set up this color matching light table activity . As a bonus , the finished product turned into a lovely suncatcher craft for kids . <p> On the non-sticky side of the contact paper , I drew three circles ( one in red , one in yellow , and one in green ) using the permanent markers . Since I am terrible at free-handing circles , I used a large yogurt container to trace the circles . Then I taped the contact paper , sticky side up , onto the light table and set out the translucent counters . <p> Once the boys felt that they had placed enough counters onto the contact paper , I removed it from the light table and hanged it on our window . And just like that , we ended up with a pretty traffic light suncatcher craft . <h> Saturday , June 06 , 2015 <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I help a child with hyperlexia at home or in the classroom ?

J and K also love playing with the individual letters and numbers as a hands on way to learn the alphabet and numbers . <p> So it turns out that a simple foam mat can be so much more than just a play mat or puzzle .

@@23062569 @3062569/ <h> Saturday , February 07 , 2015 <p> If you 're in my blogging circle and/or happen to chat with me about blogging , then you 'll quickly discover that not only do I love Blogger , but I love to hack and customize my Blogger blog a lot . I also love Pinterest . It 's my favorite of all social media platforms . I think I have been using it for 18 months now ( it 's definitely been under 2 years ! ) , but I have quickly grown to almost 200,000 followers in that time . So here are five ways I optimize and customize my Blogger posts for Pinterest to maximize my repins . <p> 1 . How to Make Vertical Pin Image Appear First in Blogger <p> When people click the pin it button to pin awesome posts ( like mine ! ) , they are more likely to pin the first image that appears . It 's likely due to pinning while mobile , so I like to make sure that my vertical pin image is the first in the list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than horizontal ! <p> To control the order of the photos , you need to rename the image file names before you upload the photos to Blogger . Name the photos in the exact alphabetical order that you want them to appear . Whichever photo comes first alphabetically will be the one that appears first when people click the pin it button , regardless of where the actual photo falls in the blog post itself . So for the kinetic sand post , the pin image has a filename that begins with kinetic . All the remaining images begin with sensory followed by a number . Yet the pin image for that post appears first despite it being the last image in the actual post . <p> 2 . How to Make Images No Pin in Blogger <p> Sometimes I do n't want a certain image to be pinned to Pinterest . For example , say I do a round up of posts and want to use a photo from another blogger . I do n't want their photo to be pinned from my blog . So I make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature is if I have a full facial shot of my children that I do n't want plastered all over Pinterest . <p> To make images non-pinnable , you need to add the following code to whichever image you do n't want pinned : <p> nopin= " nopin " <p> To add this code , flip to HTML in your draft . The button is located in the top left corner right under your blog name and the Blogger logo . Scroll until you find the HTML code for the image you want to add the no pin code to . It should look something like this : <p> &lt;a LONG ... imageanchor= " 1 " style= " margin-left : 1em ; margin-right : 1em ; " &gt;&lt;img alt= " Tips for Blogger users : how to specify photo order for the pin it button from And Next Comes L " border= " 0 " LONG ... height= " 480 " title= " Tips for Blogger users : how to specify photo order for the pin it button from And Next Comes L " width= " 640 " nopin= " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the &lt;img&gt; tags . I 've highlighted it in green above . Now when people click the pin it button , the image with the nopin code will no longer be shown as an option to pin . All the other images will remain available for pinning . <p> 3 . Apply for Rich Pins <p> If you do n't already have rich pins for your Blogger blog , then hop to it ! It makes your pins look more polished and it 's a one time application process . Once you 've applied and been set up , there 's no other work involved . Find out how to get rich pins here , <p> 4 . Fill in the Post 's Search Description with Keywords <p> When you are writing a new post , there is a box called " Search Description " on the right side under " Post settings .

See the image below to see where you can find the search description in the rich pins on Pinterest . <p> 5 . Add Keywords to Every Image in your Blog Post <p> For every image that you add in Blogger , you will want to fill in the alt and title text . Completing this step will also help with search engine traffic . Pinterest pulls the alt text when someone clicks the pin it button . See the image above to see where the alt text appears in rich pins . Make sure that you use keywords in the alt text , especially since the new Pinterest smartfeed relies on keyword searches . 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

I personally can not justify paying that kind of money for a card that most people probably only glance at before disposing of them . Two , I never know what to do with them afterwards . I hate throwing them away since I like reading what people have written inside and because sometimes the pictures on the front are just plain awesome . <p> Well , my husband 's birthday just passed and we were left with some more greeting cards .

And voila ! <h> Tuesday , April 23 , 2013 <p> I have been digging through my felt scraps a lot lately , especially after making a brand new felt board for the boys . So when I came across this adorable owl flannel board the other day , I knew it was what I would be making next for the felt board . <p> As with most craft projects that I do , I just cut it out free hand with no patterns .

Instead , I leave you with some pictures of K making some owls . <h> Monday , April 22 , 2013 <p> This activity was completely child led .

There are plenty of databases to download classical sheet music from since a lot of it is no longer copyright protected . My favorite site can be found here . For this bin , you can print off any sheet music you 'd like . Beethoven and Brahms , however , are two of my favorite composers , so I chose to print off some of their sheet music . I talked about these amazing composers with my boys , albeit very briefly , which paid off though because two days later , J was talking away about Beethoven . Once you pick your sheet music , shred it up . The boys always find paper shredding entertaining . <p> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as maracas , rice filled egg shakers ( I made my own so you could too ) , and a cowbell . I also cut out music notes , rests , and dynamic markings from black felt and black craft foam . These items gave me a chance to talk about what the different musical symbols mean . Staccatos or short notes in music were also included in the form of large black pom poms . Perhaps the most popular item , though , was the metronome . I knew that I had to include it in the sensory bin since the boys frequently steal it from my piano room . My metronome has a name . It 's Mr. 500 ( see picture for why ) . My beginner piano students always get a kick of the fact that my metronome has a name . The metronome is a popular item in our house because the boys absolutely love to adjust the knob to make it click at different speeds . And it 's a perfect tool for exploring the concept of rhythm ! <p> J explored this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pulling out the different music symbols . <p> Then he slowly pulled out all the shredded sheet music . <p> And then he tossed it onto the floor ! <p> When J finally came across the metronome , we started shaking the maracas and egg shakers in time with the metronome . Like I mentioned above , the metronome is an awesome way to explore the concept of rhythm . <p> Later that day , K had a chance to check out the sensory bin . He reached for the maracas first . <p> But who needs a maraca when there 's a metronome ! <p> Then K had to dump the bin and climb on it . Makes sense to me . <p> J joined in alongside K for another round of sensory play . They happily scattered shredded paper everywhere . <p> This picture is perhaps my favorite from this activity . <p> And just so you know how fun this sensory bin is ... everyone and their cat will want to play with it ! See . Even our one cat , Scooter , could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post originally ran as a guest post on House of Burke on May 17 , 2013 .

Or check out the other posts in this series : <h> Monday , August 26 , 2013 <p> After making our adorable pool noodle bees , the boys craved more bee themed activities . So I thought it would be fun to explore the sound that bees make by creating a buzz basket , complete with a buzz-tastic book ( okay , I clearly made up a word ) . 17100 @qwx217100 <p> I came up with the buzz basket idea after reading the Bumblebee Chunky Friend Storybook with the boys . The book is about Busby Bumble , a bee who loses his buzz . I thought we could turn the story into a hunt for Busby 's lost buzz and boy , did J and K ever enjoy this activity ! <p> This activity is a great precursor to studying music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use their ears and listen to what 's around them , even in nature . It engages them to compare sounds and look for similarities . We also imitated the buzz sounds using different " instruments . " <p> To put the buzz basket together , I included two trumpet mouthpieces from way back yonder when I played trumpet . Did n't know that I played trumpet ? Well , shame on you for not reading point #5 here . Anyway , you can always leave the trumpet mouthpieces out if you do n't have any . <p> The last two items in the basket are the Bumblebee Chunky Friend Storybook and a straw whistle . I made the straw whistle by cutting one end into a triangle . Then you simply blow on the triangle end and it makes a loud buzzing/whistling sound . The buzz basket , when put together , looked like this : <p> I started off by reading the Bumblebee Chunky Friend Storybook . Then the boys started experimenting with the different instruments to see if they could locate Busby 's buzz . <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sound , but loved trying . <p> J managed to make some noise and giggled hysterically afterwards . <p> Then I created some buzzing noises using the mouthpiece . It sort of sounded like a bee , but J and K were n't so sure it was the buzz that we were looking for . So we moved on to the straw whistle . It took quite a bit of effort to make some noise with it , so neither boys were successful in making it buzz . Instead , I blew on it for them . Again , not quite the buzzing sound they were hoping to hear . <p> Then it was time for the buzzing noisemaker . I quickly demonstrated how it worked . BUZZZZZZZ ! Then K and J each tried it out . Looks like we found the missing buzz after all ! <p> This activity could be done with babies , only with you playing all the instruments for them . Or you can even make the hunt for the buzz more challenging for older kids by including a wide variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they can play all the instruments until they find the one that sounds like a bee . <h> Saturday , August 24 , 2013 <p> It 's no secret that I love felt . If you 've seen any of my quiet book posts or any of my other felt board activities , then you 'll know how deep my felt obsession runs . Of course , I had to make a dress up activity for the felt board at some point . However , I did n't want to do the typical dress up doll or dress up bears . I wanted something completely different . Something that would really appeal to my boys . Something cute and fun like the Mix and Match Monsters that I made , which J loves , so I came up with this dinosaur dress up play set . <p> Generally , I cut everything free hand when I 'm working with felt , occasionally hot gluing pieces where needed . This play set ended up being a great way to use up some of my felt scraps so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a large green dinosaur , shirts , pants , a skirt , a ballerina tutu , a vest , hats , shoes , a pair of underwear , and some accessories like sunglasses , a tie , and a bow . <p> The pieces can be assembled to make some adorable dinosaurs such as this rockstar ballerina . <p> Or an explorer . <p> Or a " Risky Business " dinosaur wan na be . <p> J loves this play set and quickly mastered the art of layering . Shirt , underwear , and now some shoes . <p> Then some blue pants , which were then swapped for the orange ones shortly afterwards . <h> Thursday , August 22 , 2013 <p> I 've been a little neglectful of Tot Books on Thursdays lately because of a crazy busy month , but , alas , I am here ( perhaps a little late ) with another great list of children 's books to check out . As always , I share ten books that have been in high rotation at our house , as well as some books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you 're familiar with the Tot Books on Thursdays , you 'll know that I always feature some kind of ABC book . Well , here 's a construction themed one . K loved this book and enjoyed saying ZOOM at the end with me . <p> Here 's another music themed book where the zoo animals put on their own musical . I love the illustrations in this book and both boys enjoyed reading it . They especially loved when I sang the suggested songs and rhymes . I recommend checking this book out if you are looking for a music themed book ! <p> Here 's a counting and color book ( bet you did n't guess that based on the title ! ) that J absolutely loved . I do n't really care for the illustrations as they look really antiquated , but the boy likes what he likes ! <p> We have borrowed this book from the library many , many times . Usually it 's J that picks it out , but this time , K found it at the library all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And my husband is a huge basketball fan so he is more than happy to read this book with the boys over and over . <p> I adore Eric Carle books ! I 'm sure that I 'm not the only one who does . His artwork is so bright and lovely to look at . I had never read this book before , but J quickly became obsessed with the translucent seaweed pages and the delightful sea creatures . It 's definitely worth checking out if you 're an Eric Carle fan . <p> This book frequently left my tongue all twisted up ! It 's based on the telephone game where you whisper a secret into someone 's ear and then they repeat it to someone else and so on . Now , imagine that with animal noises and that 's what you have hear . J loved this book . Probably because I sound like a deranged farm animal while reading it . <p> Counting ? Check . Dinosaurs ? Check . Pop-ups ? Check . This book has it all . The best part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger . This book has easily been J 's favorite for about two weeks now . <h> Wednesday , August 21 , 2013 <p> Both of my boys will be celebrating their birthday next month , so I have been trying to figure out what to get them for a gift . Then I came across an amazing music toy while browsing Pinterest one day and I just knew that I had to get my hands on one for them . Trust me , it 's a toy that you will want to add to your child 's hint list for an upcoming birthday or even Christmas ! <p> I 'd like to introduce you to the Symphony in B by B. Toys . Please note that B. Toys provided me with this product free of charge , but all opinions expressed below are mine and were not influenced by the free product . <p> The Symphony in B arrived at my door , mid-preschooler-meltdown and it was a welcome distraction . I had just pulled it out of the box and J 's eyes lit right up . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's still fully covered in plastic . <p> The Symphony in B comes with 13 brightly colored instruments , including familiar favorites such as the piano , flute , and drums and some different instruments from around the world such as the sitar and koto . J 's favorite is the purple accordion . Each instrument is constructed down to the tiniest of details like the buttons on the accordion or the knobs on the end of the guitar . The name of each instrument is also included on the base . K tried to assist me in getting a close up of the tuba . Instead , you 'll have to settle with a picture of his sweet little face just beyond the blurry orange blob . <p> Each instrument has a different shaped base , which means the Symphony in B doubles as a shape sorter , as K so kindly demonstrates below . <p> There are many other cool features about the Symphony in B , including : <p> A compartment on the back for storing all the instruments when not in use . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of additional enjoyment to my mini maestros ! <p> A handy dandy handle on the bottom to make the toy easier to carry . <p> The whole toy itself is see through , which means you can see all the neat electronic stuff inside . <p> There are many buttons to delight little button pressers like K. There are even specific buttons to help your kids learn which instruments make up which instrument family . For instance , if you press " woodwinds , " the light by flute and clarinet light up . <p> A songbook with the lyrics to all 15 different songs is included in the packaging . So sing along to your heart 's content or as long as your children can stand to listen to you sing . Ha ! <p> Lots of cool features , right ? Now you 're probably wondering how it works . Well , it 's easy peasy ! You get to be the conductor of an orchestra . You pick up to six different instrument and place them in the orchestra pit area . Press play . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments that were placed in the orchestra pit . Anyone up for Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony with just a sitar and tuba ? ! You have n't lived until you 've tried it ! <p> As you can see , choosing the instruments is the hardest part . <p> Hmmm ... what to choose ... what to choose ... <p> There are so many ways to learn about music with the Symphony in B , which is , of course , why I love it , not only as a parent , but as a piano teacher . Here are just some of the ways you can learn about music : <p> Explore the concept of tempo by pressing the tempo buttons up or down . <p> Explore the concept of dynamics by pressing the volume control up or down . <p> Press the melody or accompaniment buttons while a song is playing to find out which instruments play which parts . <p> Learn which instruments belong to which instrument family by pressing the different instrument family buttons . <p> Learn the names of the instruments , including how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments to discover what they sound like . Just pop the instrument of choice into the orchestra pit to hear it on its own ! <p> Listen to famous classical music pieces including Brahm 's Lullaby or Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony . <p> You can check out this video below to see how it works . <p> By now , I 'm sure you 've picked up on the fact that I love , love , LOVE the Symphony in B. I want to play with it just as much as my boys do ( read that as the suggested age of 3-13 years should be changed to include 29 year old me ! ) . However , there were only four slight changes I would suggest : <p> The koto instrument piece has a tendency to topple over . I wish the koto stood more upright to counteract this problem . <p> Allow for more instruments in the orchestra pit . Six just is n't enough for J. He always wants to cram as many instruments in there as he can ! <p> Make the demo button smaller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often missing out on the point of the toy . <p> The instruments have a tendency to get caught in the storage compartment . I guess I 'd like it to be a bit roomier so that the long , skinny instruments do n't get caught . <p> Overall , the Symphony in B surpassed all my expectations . I knew it was going to be a really cool toy , but it is way better than I could have ever imagined . I simply adore it . No wonder it won Toy of the Year . Furthermore , after reading all the little hilarious tidbits hidden throughout the packaging , I wanted to learn more about the company and their other products . Their sense of humor in their marketing definitely made me appreciate their company . <p> " Congratulations ! You read through all of that tiny text ? Your eyes are very good , and your patience is admirable . " - on the boring FCC Rules compliance sheet <p> " Until you find ' toy sunscreen'right next to the ' baby sunscreen , ' please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orchestras really like indoor concert halls anyway . " - on the warning label on the back of Symphony in B <p> That 's not all . When you purchase a B. Toy like Symphony in B , 10 cents is donated to Free the Children . Does n't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy ? And all their packaging is recyclable !

How easy is that ? <h> Monday , December 19 , 2016 <p> We 're always on the lookout for different ways to provide oral motor sensory support for my kids , especially my oldest son who chews on literally everything . But oral motor sensory races , such as this Christmas themed oral motor sensory game using jingle bells are also great for working on breathing control .

Or , for another fun variation , make designs like zig zags or snowflakes with the tape and encourage your kids to blow their jingle bells along the tape designs . <p> At first , five year old K wanted to try blowing the jingle bells without the straws . However , he found it extremely challenging to get the jingle bell to move even just a few centimetres . <p> So he opted to use a color coordinating straw instead to send that jingle bell across the finish line .

If I had a chance to go back and redo this cake , then I would splurge on the sugary store bought jello packages rather than attempting to make my own jello again . I still cringe thinking about how terrible that coconut water jello tasted ! Shudder ... it 's like it haunts me in my dreams now . Seriously , it was that bad ! <p> Toothpicks and glue ( needed only if using printable Minecraft figures ) <p> I opted to use a cake mix to streamline the cake making process , especially since this was a last minute request . However , I always , always , ALWAYS make my own buttercream icing because store bought icing is just gross and does n't compare . It really does n't . <p> Having said all that , use what you prefer . <h> How to Make a Minecraft Cake for a Minecraft Themed Birthday Party <p> 1 . Bake the cake as the recipe calls for . Let cool completely before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ krispie squares . For the best rice krispie squares ever , substitute coconut oil for butter/margarine . It makes the squares irresistible and amazing .

Again , I used coconut water jello and I 'm choosing to NOT give you the recipe I used because it was terrible . Horrible . Absolutely disgusting . Ick ! <p> 4 . After the cake has cooled , remove it from the pan . Hopefully your cake does n't break like mine did during this step ... sigh . Then cut a piece off to make the upper level of the Minecraft landscape . I cut the cake as if I was cutting a staircase into it . <p> 5 .

First there were some amazing comments , along with some thought provoking questions , on our hyperlexia story blog post . <p> Then the National Autism Association shared an image on their Facebook page about hyperlexia . It was so refreshing to see hyperlexia highlighted in such a manner ! And not by me for a change ! All I could think was , " It 's about time ! " <p> Then later in the evening , a blogging friend sent me a message about a mother in her support group looking for more information about hyperlexia as her child was just diagnosed . This one definitely hit me hard .

We use our LEGO emotions chart regularly and we play the LEGO emotion speech game often as well . And we 've even searched for emotions with this free LEGO emotions I spy game . <p> But there has been this one idea floating around in my mind for quite a few months now .

He started off by drawing happy . Like seriously , how cute is this little squished happy face ? <p> Then he went through the rest of the cards , talking about little details like the eyebrows of the LEGO heads , while copying the expressions onto the LEGO heads . Drawing those details is a great way to work on fine motor skills while exploring and learning about emotions ! <p> Then he also explored his own emotions and experimented with drawing sharp pointy teeth on the LEGO head .

It 's fun and the kids adore the finished results ! And I get to eat copious amounts of icing and cake scraps once per year , without feeling guilty . <p> The cakes that I have made over the years have varied .

But he has always been an early riser , regardless of what time he goes to bed . He was also sometimes quite difficult to get to sleep because he would be so fidgety and fired up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asleep for the night . <p> So over the years , we have come up with a pretty solid list of sleep time strategies that work for him , as well as for our youngest son , K. The sleep strategies for kids with autism below are things that we do to target a variety of sensory systems : visual , olfactory , proprioceptive , tactile , and even oral motor . They address his specific sensory needs , which is why I think they are effective for him . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Sleep Strategies for Kids with Autism or Sensory Needs <p> These are the strategies that we use and implement for bedtime success . They work for us . That does n't mean they will necessarily work for you or your family , but instead , they may give you ideas of things to try . <p> 1 . Create a Bedtime Routine <p> We have a set routine that we follow for bedtime and it has been the same since my kids were newborns . I know this strategy seems like common sense , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a regular bedtime routine . Our kids thrive on routine , as do many other kids , because it teaches them to know what comes next . There are no surprises . They know that sleep time follows reading books . <p> If it is bath night , then the routine is as follows : <p> Bath <p> Get dressed <p> Brush teeth <p> Go pee <p> Read books for about 30 minutes or until child falls asleep <p> Sleep time <p> If it is not bath night , then the routine is as follows : <p> Get dressed <p> Go pee <p> Wash face , hands , feet , etc. with a cloth <p> Brush teeth <p> Read books for about 30 minutes or until child falls asleep <p> Sleep time <p> We also use an electric toothbrush to provide oral motor sensory input before bedtime as a way to reduce chewing on books or toys during the bedtime routine . <p> 2 . Use a Visual Schedule to Reinforce the Bedtime Routine <p> We do n't use our visual schedule as much as we used to when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendously when he was little , especially since our visual schedule used written words and pictures . You can grab a copy of the exact visual schedule that we use here . It is a free printable ! <p> Proprioceptive sensory input is calming for kids and can help energetic kids settle down into a slower rhythm . So if your kids are a bundle of energy before bed , then try squishing them with a body pillow , using a weighted blanket while reading , or encourage them to crawl under a lycra bedsheet ( see our DIY stretchy sheet tutorial ) while reading . <p> We have noticed a huge difference in J 's ability to settle during bedtime since we started using our homemade stretchy sensory bed sheet on his bed . He crawls underneath and the light pressure is enough to keep him from wiggling and fidgeting during story time . <p> We started off using Momo the Monkey sleep training clock and J used to carry that clock everywhere with him . He never did use it the way it was intended and it eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer open and close its eyes . <p> However , when we received Gro-Clocks one Christmas , J was more interested in using it to help him know when it was time to sleep . He still does n't use it as a visual aid for when it 's time to wake up though and likely never will since he 's such an early riser , but it has definitely been a great help for settling to sleep . <p> Again , this strategy is kind of obvious , but mentioning it because it is still important . We like to jump on a trampoline , go for a bike ride , or even go for a walk before we do our bedtime routine . It 's a great way to burn off excess energy before bed and really wear out the kids . The fresh air always helps them sleep soundly for the night . <p> When the kids are wound up before bed , even after some fresh air and exercise , sometimes they need a little extra help to settle down for the night . A bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night and even helps them sleep better . You can do something as simple as a drop of lavender on a cotton ball and place it in their pillow case . Or you can try our DIY bedtime blend , which smells amazing ! 17095 @qwx217095 <p> This post is part of a monthly series called Parenting Children with Special Needs . This month 's topic is support and you can find the other posts regarding this topic below . <h> Wednesday , September 21 , 2016 <p> When I first learned about hyperlexia , all I wanted to know was how can I use this knowledge to help my son ? I knew WH questions were hard and I knew pronouns were confusing for him , but what could I do to actually help him improve these areas of speech and language ? <p> There are tons of great ABC games and apps that would certainly appeal to hyperlexic kids , but that is not what I want to cover here . Instead , I want to focus on the best types of games and apps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social skills . <p> The suggestions below focus primarily on improving their language skills so that these kids can express themselves better , answer WH questions with confidence , and build conversation skills . <p> Playing games with your hyperlexic kids is not only good for social skills , but they can be a great way to improve their speech skills as well . You can also modify games that you already have at home to target specific speech issues , just like your child 's speech therapist likely already does . As an example , you can see how we modified Guess Who to target WH questions using this free printable . <p> However , I wanted to focus on specific types of games that are really good for kids with hyperlexia . <p> 1 . Barrier Games <p> Barrier games are one type of game that are perfect for kids with hyperlexia . Barrier games are a great way to target expressive speech , vocabulary , following directions , prepositions , and more ! I highly suggest reading this article about how barrier games are great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play your own barrier games , taking turns drawing and describing what you are drawing . You can also buy a magnetic barrier game set or you can try one of our free printable barrier games below . <p> I spy games are also great to play with hyperlexic kids . If you play the verbal version , then be sure to use WH questions similar to " I spy with my little eye something that is green . What do you see ? " That encourages them to learn the differences between you and I and that some times those two words can refer to the same person . It is also a way to model a small conversation , encourage your kids to be descriptive and look at the parts of objects , and increase vocabulary . You can read more about the benefits of playing the verbal version here ( see point #1 ) . <p> However , playing visual I spy games is great too ! I have made a ton of free printable I spy games for kids that my son loves to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid in comprehension and to introduce new vocabulary . <p> I also encourage you to play these printable I spy versions alongside your child and ask WH questions as they search . For instance , you can ask how many of one object they find , what color certain objects are , what shapes certain objects are , etc . <p> 3 . Hangman <p> Another game that is great for hyperlexic children is hangman . Naturally , these kids gravitate towards anything that involves lots of letters , so hangman is a great game to play with them . <p> The reason why hangman is helpful for them is because it 's formulaic and encourages them to ask and answer questions . Hangman is a great way to engage in small scripted conversations . You can simply write down the formula for the questions on a piece of paper if your child needs prompting . Something like " Is there a letter ? " and " Yes , there 's a letter " or " No , there 's no letter . " <p> Your child will also enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the word or phrase for the game . If so , then they have to practice answering verbal questions , which is something they find tricky . <p> 4 . Dress Up Games or Paper Dolls <p> Games such as Raccoon Rumpus and toys such as the Melissa &amp; Doug Magnetic Dress Up Sets are a great way for kids to work on pronouns , which if you have a child with hyperlexia , then you 're likely familiar with how problematic pronouns can be . Pronoun reversals are a common feature in hyperlexic kids so it is important to find fun ways to practice them . <p> Take turns with your child while playing while these types of games and toys and describe what the person is wearing , being sure to emphasize the pronouns " he " and " she . " <p> 5 . Games That Focus on WH Questions <p> WH questions cause problems for kids with hyperlexia . I can not emphasis enough how important it is to practice WH questions with these kids as it aids in comprehension , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target WH questions . <p> Apps are a great way to help hyperlexic children improve their comprehension , language skills , and social skills . They make a perfect supplement to speech therapy , occupational therapy , and any other therapy you use for your child . The apps have been organized into common problem areas for hyperlexic kids ( e.g. , pronoun reversals , comprehension issues , difficulties with WH questions ) so that you can easily find the apps that you need to help address your child 's issues . <h> Tuesday , September 20 , 2016 <p> If you 're looking for ways to keep the kids busy during the witching hour or whine-o-clock ( and honestly , who is n't looking for ideas to survive that time of day ! ) , then look no further than your own kitchen for inspiration ! Grab some muffin tins ( and some other household objects ) for these ridiculously simple boredom busters for kids . No preparation needed . Just grab and go ! <h> Boredom Buster Ideas for Kids Using Muffin Tins <p> I 've come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tins that target sorting , fine motor skills , patterning , math , and practical life skills ! So even if these activities are simple , then you can be happy knowing that you are sneaking in some learning for the kids too .

Nor does it lead to much imaginative play . So here 's my winter themed spin on the classic toothpicks and styrofoam activity : a winter fine motor village ! <p> While perusing the dollar store , I came across some Christmas themed party picks . There were red Christmas bells , blue snowflakes , and green Christmas trees and came twelve to a pack . So I picked up one package of the trees and one of the snowflakes , but had no idea what I was going to do with them . <p> Then I thought about little Christmas villages and how fun it would be to make our own little village using the picks and styrofoam .

I added the details onto one , but J drew details onto all the remaining snowmen . Then I cut them out and taped them to the toothpicks as well . Cute , right ? <p> Here you can see the other house and one of J 's snowmen . <p> J happily created a little village using all the different picks . <p> After using all of the picks , J started reorganizing them to create a winter forest around one particular house . He even moved all the snowmen to huddle around the house , trapping some poor person in his little house .

@@23062592 @3062592/ <h> Friday , July 12 , 2013 <p> It has been awhile since we 've done a color sensory bin , so I thought we 'd explore the color blue next . <p> I have a huge pail of beautiful blue water beads . They are the same ones that have been used for the Arctic Small World Sensory Bin and our outdoor water bead and pool noodle activity . So I used the water beads as the base for this bin . I also added some blue plastic cups , blue cookie cutters , some blue bottle tops from our recycling bin , a large blue lid also from the recycling bin , and some blue tube shots . Here 's how the finished bin looked : <p> J explored this bin by himself while K was napping . However , I love the feel of water beads , so I also dug in . It was really relaxing for me to swish my hands through the water beads . Seriously . They are so amazing to touch and feel . <p> J quickly went to work scooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container to another . <p> When K woke up , he joined in . <p> And of course , he HAD to have the same blue cup that J was holding . So I quickly add two blue plastic bowls , hoping that would be similar enough . Nope . Nada . <p> Eventually , they did work something out and happily scooped and dumped water beads everywhere . <p> Remember when I said it was relaxing to play with water beads . It did n't stay that way for long . Soon water beads were everywhere . Then J got upset and started crying about something , which lead to him peeing on the floor . So like I shared on my Facebook page , it 's all fun and games until there are water beads everywhere and someone pees on the floor . 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097 
@@23062593 @3062593/ <h> Saturday , February 28 , 2015 <p> Two years ago today , I decided to start a blog . It started off as a fun hobby , but quickly progressed to so much more . Now it 's my hobby and my job . It has also become my platform to curate resources for other hyperlexia parents , which has been both fun and encouraging . I especially want to thank those of you who have messaged me via email or on Facebook to share your stories about hyperlexia . Your stories have made me smile and helped me confirm that my decision to share our story was indeed what I needed to do . To think that I have actually helped other families around the world by sharing my story is absolutely heartwarming . Even if writing about it was emotionally exhausting . So I may have started out blogging about fun kids activities ( and still do ! ) , but last year proved to me that I was meant to do more . To write more . To share more about my struggles and triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could connect with other families . I have certainly found my voice . So thank you for listening . Or I guess reading would be a better word . <p> Since my daily life is immersed in what I lovingly refer to as " number hell " - thank you hypernumeracy for that - I thought it would be fun to share a bunch of my favorite posts from the past two years in groups of two . But before I do , I also want to celebrate two huge achievements from my blogging career . First , I published a book , which was a childhood dream . Second , I reached 200,000 followers on Pinterest and even got paid to pin something on Pinterest . That 's cool , right ? <p> Okay , let 's celebrate two years ! Ready or not , here are two posts , two posts , two posts , two posts , two posts ... I think you get the idea . <h> Friday , February 27 , 2015 <p> These particular ice cube trays are like buttons just waiting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I will never make - haha ) . So I decided to turn them into a keyboard of sorts to practice matching uppercase and lowercase letters , spelling words , and searching for particular letters . It may be a simple light table activity for kids , but it also encourages literacy and fine motor skills . And seriously , what kid does n't like pressing buttons ? ! 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Fine Motor Alphabet Activity for the Light Table <p> For this activity , I used three translucent ice cube trays from the dollar store and some dry erase markers . I wrote uppercase and lowercase letters on the ice cube trays with the dry erase markers . I can easily wash the marker off so that I can reuse the trays for another activity in the future . <p> I just love how these ice cube trays look on the light table , but they 're even more irresistible when they are alphabet buttons waiting to be pushed . We played a few different games with these : <p> I would call a letter and then K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would match uppercase and lowercase letters by pressing the letters at the same time . <p> I would help K spell words by dictating the letters while he pressed them . <h> Thursday , February 26 , 2015 <p> One of the reasons why I made metallic dyed beans in the first place was so that I could make a pot of gold inspired sensory activity for St. Patrick 's Day . I ended up creating two mini sensory bins , one for each of my boys , using the golden beans . Here 's our simple fine motor mini sensory bins inspired by a pot of gold . <h> Monday , February 23 , 2015 <p> I 'm slightly addicted to metallic liquid watercolors . So I could n't resist dyeing some sensory bin fillers in gold , silver , and copper . The result : metallic dyed beans . Quick and easy to make , these shimmery metallic beans are so much fun to play with . I 'm kind of obsessed with how they turned out . " They 're magical , " as my five year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some beans in a bag , add a a few squirts of liquid watercolors , and then shake . Regular liquid watercolors do n't seem to dye beans as well as food coloring . However , I find that these metallic liquid watercolors have a thicker consistency , so they did a great job at dyeing the beans . Once the color was evenly distributed , I placed the colored beans on some paper towel to dry . They dried pretty quickly , within an hour or so . Once they are dry to the touch , they are ready for play . <p> Oooh la la ! Are n't they pretty ? ! <p> Time for some close up shots . Bam ! <p> Now how about some photos of all those metallic colors mixed together ? <p> J loved them so much that they literally had him seeing hearts . " Mom , mom , mom ! It 's a heart ! ! " <p> What do you think ? What 's your favorite color of the metallic dyed beans ? I think I like the gold best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Essential oils have become a huge part of our daily routine in dealing with sensory issues , anxiety , and autism . After some trial and error , I have finally concocted the perfect blend for our family . I call it the calm and focused child essential oil blend because it does exactly that . It calms my sons ' sensory responses , balances their emotions , and keeps them calm and focused . It has drastically reduced the number of " bad autism days " in our house . It is definitely my go-to DIY essential oil blend ! 17100 @qwx217100 <h> A Few Safety Notes About Using Essential Oils with Kids <p> When we first started using essential oils about 18 months ago , we saw a huge impact in our daily lives . It has been a huge part of how we treat ( manage or cope might be better words ) with autism . However , I have been hesitant to share our story since there has been a huge essential oil movement in the kid blogging world , especially as of late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , you do n't want to get my rant started ) , but oftentimes , these pushy multi-level marketing reps forget to mention important safety concerns . So here are just a couple of important reminders : <p> I am not an aromatherapist . I am just sharing a blend of oils that has worked well for our family . <p> This blend is meant to be diffused and/or mixed with a carrier oil before applying to skin . Never apply this blend to the skin without a carrier oil . <h> How to Make the Calm &amp; Focused Child Essential Oil Blend <p> I simply add the oils to 80ml of water in our diffuser and diffuse first thing in the morning . <p> Here 's a breakdown of what each oil does . Lavender is great for calming and relaxing . Mandarin orange balances emotions ( good bye autism meltdowns ! ) , but I mostly add it because I like the smell . To be honest , I can not stand the smell of any of the other oils individually . Frankincense has a sedative quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cedarwood helps to focus the mind and balances emotions . Finally , vetiver calms the sensory system and stabilizes emotions . <p> When I diffuse this blend , I find that sensory meltdowns are reduced and that J focuses better on his schoolwork , both at home and at school . On days that I forget to diffuse this blend , J seems more agitated and more prone to autism meltdowns . It definitely helps balances his emotional responses when he is having sensory issues . So needless to say , I always make sure to have these oils handy . <h> How to Use this Essential Oil Blend as a Spray <p> Another option is to add the essential oils to a cobalt blue glass spray bottle and top it up with water . Shake before applying . You can either spray it into the room like an air freshener or spray on the skin . I usually spray it in two spots on the skin : back of the neck and on the back at the base of the spine . I apply it to both of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our day to day life . <h> Friday , February 20 , 2015 <p> Looking for another easy math idea for kids ? Well , these DIY wooden math dice are a great way for kids to practice their math facts and obviously , my number-loving five year old loves them ( see hypernumeracy ) . I really like that these math dice are simple to make and can be tailored to fit your own child 's abilities . I 'm also really excited that I get to share this easy activity on one of my all-time favorite kid blogs , The Imagination Tree . So pop on over and check it out ! <h> Wednesday , February 18 , 2015 <p> Pinterest is my favorite social media platform . It also happens to be my best social media platform for driving consistent traffic to my blog . Here is how I got 200,000 Pinterest followers in less than two years . In the summer of 2014 , I did a lot of experimenting with Pinterest to see what would and would not work for me . In the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my following exploded . Today , I am just shy of 200,000 Pinterest followers . That 's 200,000 followers in less than two years ( I joined in either June or July of 2013 ) . Sure I got featured by Pinterest , but I also spent months building , tailoring , and experimenting with my account to prove to Pinterest that I am indeed an awesome , authentic pinner worthy of being featured . So here are my tips for building a Pinterest strategy that works to drive consistent traffic to your blog. 17101 @qwx217101 <h> Pinterest Tips for Bloggers <p> To give you a reference point , here 's my top referral sources of all time and how much traffic they provide : <p> Pinterest : 36% <p> Direct : 27% <p> Facebook : 16% <p> Organic Search Results : 6% <p> When I first joined Pinterest , I basically pinned everything and anything that I saw . Growth was slow , but I also had no idea what I was doing . And some of those early pins were ... umm ... embarassing , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to do some Pinterest research of my own to see if I could determine a pattern at all . After conducting my research , I started experimenting . Here are 10 helpful tips that you can use to help grow your Pinterest following based on what I discovered . <p> Pinterest Tip #1 : Study &amp; Analyze Top Pinners in Your Niche <p> Since I am in the kid blogging niche , I started off by studying the profiles of the top pinners in that niche . I was particularly interested in all pinners with over 50,000 followers . Things I was looking for : <p> How many pins did they have ? <p> How many boards did they have ? <p> What kind of boards did they have ? <p> How many collaborative boards did they have ? <p> After studying about 10 different big pinners in my niche , I noticed that : <p> All the top pinners in my niche ( with the exception of one ) had less than 100 boards . Most of those big pinners hovered around 80 boards . <p> All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A majority of the top pinners in my niche had more general boards like food , math , activities for toddlers , etc. vs. cake recipes , a specific board for numerous preschool themes , etc . <p> My findings suggested that less was more . Fewer boards with a more general theme and fewer better quality pins seemed to be the answer . Depending on the niche you are in , you may find different results . <p> Pinterest Tip #2 : Delete Things That Are n't Working <p> After discovering common patterns in my niche , I did a big spring cleaning of my Pinterest profile . And I still do this purging process every couple of months . I started leaving collaborative boards that either were n't performing well or that I was n't pinning to that often . I left all seasonal collaborative boards too since they were only beneficial to me for 1-2 months before the particular holiday . I needed boards that would be performing well all year round . <p> I started merging related boards by moving pins to one board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of followers in the process , but it was worth it , for me . I also scrolled back ( like all the way back to the beginning ) and started deleting pins . I had so many broken pins in those early days . And I had some really ugly pins too . They all had to go . I also deleted all pins that had less than 10 repins because clearly , they were not performing well . It was also at this point that I started to be more picky about what I was pinning . <p> Pinterest Tip #3 : Be Picky When Pinning <p> After cleaning up my boards like I mentioned in tip #2 , I started to be picky . I refused to pin round-ups . I never clicked on them , personally , so why would I pin them ? Please note that I do pin some from time to time , but they have to be pretty spectacular round ups to be worthy of my repins . <p> I also started focusing on image quality . I wanted to pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I liked the idea , but the image was n't the greatest , then I simply clicked the like button instead of the pin button . See , I 'm showing Pinterest that I 'm social ( see tip #7 ) . <p> I also started pinning clean images . I stopped pinning really cluttered pin collages . They were not aesthetically pleasing , so why would I want that on my boards ? <p> I also took the time to edit the pin descriptions of things I was repinning . If they had hashtags , then I removed them ( see tip #5 ) . If they had a person tagged , then I removed the tag . Did it have a keyword friendly description ? If not , then I made it keyword friendly . The new Pinterest smartfeed thrives on keywords so make sure your pins are search friendly ! Oh and if it had one of those " OMG I must try this ... blah blah blah " kind of description , then I changed that too . I hate those cheesy descriptions . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bottom line : I wanted to pin the best ideas with the best images . I wanted to curate a beautiful gallery of images and ideas . <p> Pinterest Tip #4 : Switch Up Your Look Occasionally <p> Another thing I started experimenting with was moving boards around , changing board covers , and trying out different collaborative boards . <p> I always have my blog board first , followed by my best performing boards . After that , though , I like to move seasonal boards near the top a couple of months prior to the upcoming holiday or season . Once the holiday passes , I move them towards the bottom , just before all of my collaborative boards . Nearly all of my collaborative boards are at the bottom of my Pinterest profile . I like to highlight a few of my own collaborative boards near the top , but , otherwise , all other collaborative boards are at the bottom . In the picture below , you can see my blog board is first . I then have my most popular boards next ( quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensory play , and fine motor activities ) , followed by a couple of seasonal boards . <p> I like to change board covers quite regularly too . Again , I am picky about what I choose . I avoid text based images for the board cover . Instead , I try to pick bright , well-lit images that really showcase what kind of pins will be on that board . <p> Going back to tip #3 of deleting things that are n't working , I try out new collaborative boards quite often too . If they just are n't resulting in good repins , I simply leave them and find a new one to try instead . <p> Pinterest Tip #5 : Limit Hashtags <p> Unless you are required to include a hashtag for a sponsored campaign , just stop using hashtags on Pinterest . Yes , stop altogether or at least limit them to a tasteful amount . <p> " The same is true for hashtagshaving too many of them in your descriptions may negatively impact your ranking . " - via Pinterest blog <p> Pinterest Tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edit Profile " button and fill in all the relevant information . See the picture below . <p> Did you know that for every single Pinterest board you have , you can select a a board category and write a description for the board ? Well , do it ! Select a board and then click the " Edit Board " button . See picture below . Make sure to use keywords in your boards ' descriptions . Avoid hashtags in the descriptions ( see tip #5 ) . <p> Pinterest Tip #7 : Be Social &amp; Be Authentic <p> Pinterest is a social network , so be social ! Like things , follow people , repin things from other users , and even comment on pins . I hardly ever comment on pins myself , but I think it 's likely one of those things that I should experiment with to see what happens . <p> Pin often and pin a lot . Pin organically versus using a scheduler . Pinterest wants , and will reward , organic , social pinners . At least , they did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched to primarily scheduling pins . <p> I like to go on pinning sprees , pinning dozens of things in a span of a few minutes . I also probably do n't pin my own content enough . But you know what ? Pinterest sees me as an active , social user and that 's exactly what I want . <p> Also , be authentic . I could log into my Pinterest analytics and see what other interests my followers pin , but creating a board dedicated to hair styles or fashion just is n't me . I want my boards to be a reflection of my interests . I want my boards to be a reflection of things that I would actually make or do myself . So yes , I pin only the things that interest me . I do n't pin things I think my followers will like . I do n't create boards that I think my followers will like . I just pin what I truly love , kind of like I 'm pinning as a non-blogger . <p> Pinterest Tip #8 : Create Pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get more traffic to your own blog , right ? So create pin images for your own blog posts that you would pin yourself . Make pretty , vertical images that do n't give away everything about the post . Remember , you want people to click on that image and visit your blog . Important point to remember is that Pinterest prefers vertical images . Vertical images take up more space in the newsfeed , making your image dominate the newsfeed . Look at the picture below . Notice how that coffee cake muffins pin takes up a good chunk of the newsfeed ? That is prime real estate right there ! <p> Pinterest Tip #9 : Leave a Breadcrumb Trail <p> I have a board dedicated solely to my own blog posts . So when I want to pin my posts to other boards , I always go to my blog board , find the pin I want to share , and click repin from there . Basically , I am leaving a breadcrumb trail . You 'll see when I repin my own pin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L ) " message at the bottom of the pin . That leads back to my account . Breadcrumbs , I tell you . Breadcrumbs . <p> Pinterest Tip #10 : Get Rich Pins <p> If you have n't already done so , then get rich pins ! I 'm a busy person ( are n't we all ? ) . So when I find a few minutes to pop over to Pinterest , I am more likely to pin something that has rich pins . Why ? Because I know it leads to the correct source . What if the pin does n't have rich pins ? I will likely skip it if I do n't have time to click over and check the source . Remember , I 'm busy ( and lazy too ! ) so I want to skip the extra step if I can . See the picture below to see the difference between rich pins and non-rich pins .

It was pretty awesome . <p> They also experimented with parking lots , which is great for one-to-one correspondence . <p> My boys particularly enjoyed drawing lakes , roads , and bridges for their cars . They would first draw a body of water and then the roads . J would ask , " How will the car get across ? Oh , we need a bridge ! " Then he would draw a bridge for the cars .

The tissue paper gets all soggy and mushy , which makes this sensory bin look really spooky and ghost-like . <p> The boys were eager to check it out . <p> J quickly grabbed all the tissue paper ... <p> Then started wringing it out onto the floor . That 's one way to wash my kitchen floor ! <p> K was also fascinated by the wet tissue paper . <p> He then put some on his body ( see his socks in the picture below ) , which made him look sort of like a mummy . <p> Then both boys took turns dipping their head into the bin , splashing the water , and even tried to dump all the water on the floor . Once they were done , the tissue paper really disintegrated , which made the bin look even more spooky . <h> Thursday , September 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the ideal time to come up with a Halloween inspired busy bag for kids . So get prepared to haunt some houses and count some ghosts ! <h> Halloween Busy Bag Idea for Kids <p> I found some adorable ghost glass stones at Michaels a week or two ago so they were perfect for this busy bag . However , you could easily substitute white or clear glass stones . Just draw some faces on using permanent marker . Or you could try using orange ones and make some Jack-o-Lanterns using a permanent marker . <p> To make the haunted house cards , you 'll need some black construction paper and a white crayon . I cut the black construction paper into quarters . Then using a white crayon , I drew houses on the black paper . I tried to make them look imperfect and funky . Then each house was given a house number from 1-10 . <p> The activity itself is pretty self-explanatory . Count the number of ghosts needed to haunt each house . And since counting was involved , J was happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you can see , he enjoyed lining the ghosts up just perfectly . <p> However , ten houses was n't enough to satisfy him . Once J finished house #10 , he started to improvise a bit . Here 's house #13 with its 13 ghosts . <h> Wednesday , September 25 , 2013 <p> We took some time to learn about stars and constellations using our light table recently . The inspiration for this activity came from translucent stars that I found at the Dollar Tree last week . <h> Space Themed Light Table Activity for Kids <p> While checking out the Dollar Tree last week , I came across some plastic translucent jewelry links for kids . In the package were stars , hearts , and flowers in three colors : pink , yellow , and purple . As soon as I saw them , I knew they would be perfect for the light table . <p> To set up the activity , I first taped some blue tissue paper to the top of the light table . I wanted to use black , but had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue paper . Regardless , the blue worked well to create a perfect evening sky for the stars to shine . <p> I then printed off the constellation cards that I found here . However , every single time I tried to print them it would only print the first two pages . So we had to make due with the two constellations that would print off . <p> I placed the two constellation cards and a basket of stars on the light table . J started off the activity by placing the stars on top of the constellation cards . <p> Afterwards , he started coming up with his own constellations and even gave them some names . <p> Here 's the " U " constellation . <p> And here is J building his next constellation . What will it be called ? <p> Well , he called this constellation " Buttons . " Why ? Well , if you turn your head , then you will notice that it is a 3 x 4 grid just like the buttons of a telephone . <p> J really enjoyed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . And it was great to see his imagination at work ! <h> Tuesday , September 24 , 2013 <p> The latest busy bag ( or box in this case ) in our collection cost just over $5 to make and uses recycled items to help kids learn letters . Or in J 's case , spell words and organize numbers into patterns ( hello , hyperlexia ! ) . Regardless , it 's a simple and frugal way to make and organize letter manipulatives for toddlers and preschoolers and would be similar to a Montessori movable alphabet . <p> This DIY recycled alphabet and number busy box idea for kids is a perfect quiet time activity and will encourage your kids to work on literacy skills . 17101 @qwx217101 <h> How to Make a Recycled Alphabet &amp; Number Busy Box for Kids <p> I cut letters and numbers off some recycled cardboard boxes a few months ago for the boys to play with . Well , do the boys ever enjoy them ! <p> However , I was struggling with the storage of the recycled letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Up until last week , they were lovingly stored in an old baby wipes container . Then I found this 32 compartment no spill bead organizer at Walmart for $5 ! It was perfect . <p> Using a permanent marker , I wrote the uppercase and lowercase letters in each compartment . Since there were some empty spots , I wrote the numbers in too . Some of the numbers had to partner up with another number , but that 's not a big deal since I hardly have enough numbers for the box yet . And , more importantly , the boys do n't seem to mind . <p> Then the recycled letters and numbers can be organized into their spots . You 'll notice that I am missing some Qs and have very few numbers at this point , but searching for the missing items on our cardboard has been part of the fun . It 's like a scavenger hunt for the boys to help me find some letters to fill up the box . <p> On the lid of the box , as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I used my Silhouette Cameo to cut out the words " The Alphabet Box " from gray vinyl . <p> Update as of December 19 , 2013 : I have had numerous questions about what to do with this busy box . J loves to just sort letters , spell words , and arrange numbers into patterns . He has also used them as part of his second language learning , which you can read about here .

Inspired by an activity that used wooden rings and loose parts on the light table , I came up with my own version using shower curtain rings . Yes , the shower curtain rings have returned ! So I set up this basket of shower curtain rings and various colored glass stones on the light table for J to explore while K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Exploring Loose Parts <p> These shower curtain rings are becoming a versatile loose part lately ( see here , here , and here ) , but we had never used them on the light table before this activity . And they look pretty neat . I 'd love to see what some of the colored translucent ones would look like on here . <p> Anyway , J started off by placing the shower curtain rings all over the table . <p> Then he started adding some glass stones to each ring . <p> After looking even closer at what he was doing , I noticed that he was practicing grouping . Notice the three stones in each ring below . <p> Still working on grouping three stones in each ring ... <p> Then he told me he was going to " group four .

Well , I finally got around to finishing up letter E.

One of the elephant 's ears also lifts up to reveal a miniature Earth . <p> Then there are the eggs .

So we built some spiderwebs in this simple Halloween themed light table activity for kids . <h> Spider Themed Light Table Activity for Kids <p> I found some colorful spider string lights at the dollar store recently . Each string of lights cost $2 . I was n't planning on hanging spider lights around my house as I do n't really like spiders that much . Instead , I wanted to pull the spiders off of the individual lights so that they could go on the light table . And it worked like a charm because they look pretty cool on the light table . <p> I placed some cut up pieces of yarn on the light table along with the spiders so that the boys could build some spiderwebs . You could also have your child help cut up the yarn for some good scissor practice . <p> J initially used the yarn to make letter spiderwebs for the spiders . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blob-and-go kind of approach . He grabbed a handful of yarn , placed it on the light table , and put a spider on top . Voila ! Instant spiderweb ! <p> K also enjoyed adding multiple spiders to one web . <p> Then J started using the entire light table to make a really large spiderweb for all of the spiders to happily live and play on . <p> This activity was such a fun way to introduce spiders to the boys . And it makes a great activity for Halloween since that 's coming up pretty quickly !

Most of the beads ended up being completely destroyed by J , but I did manage to save a couple for F ( she was coming over later that day ) . <p> As cool as the giant water beads were , I 'm not sure that I would buy them again until the boys are slightly older since they lasted all of 10 minutes before J destroyed them .

When I 've used them with preschoolers I had a lot more left over for use again . <p> We have n't had issues with the small ones either . I have been using the same ones for two years .

And how is it different from early reading ? <h> Hyperlexia or Early Reader ? <p> Hyperlexia is a precocious self-taught ability to read at an early age , usually before the age of five , accompanied by intense fascinations with letters and numbers , as well as significant difficulties in oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and difficulties with comprehension . <p> For instance , Kara shared in our hyperlexia support group that her son " began carrying a letter W magnet around with him everywhere around 18 months . It was his security item ! " We had similar experiences as J would play and carry around letters everywhere he went . His security item was an English/Spanish ABC flashcards book that he carried everywhere ( until it was beyond recognizable ) ! <p> 2 . Significant difficulties with verbal language <p> Kids with hyperlexia struggle with verbal language , both understanding it and speaking it themselves . Hyperlexic children struggle understanding " WH " questions and often appear to be selective listeners . They rarely initiate conversations , which was a huge telltale sign for us , and their speech is often echolalic in nature . They also struggle understanding abstract language and are literal thinkers . You can read more about the conversation skills of kids with hyperlexia here . <p> 3 . Develop normally , but regress around 18-24 months <p> Unfortunately for me , my memory is fuzzy around this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , but I do know that J 's fascination with letters became evident around 19 months . I do n't recall him really regressing , but after speaking with other families , they did notice a period of regression with their children during this time . For instance , Chelsey shared in our hyperlexia support group that her son " regressed at 18 months and lost all of his words , except for numbers , by 2 years of age . " <p> 4 . Awkward social skills <p> Hyperlexic kids are awkward socially , which is n't surprising since most of these kids also receive an autism diagnosis alongside the hyperlexia label . J has always bonded better with adults instead of other kids and after discussions with other families , they have noticed a similar pattern with their kids . Their difficulties with verbal language likely contributes to the social skills difficulties , which I have definitely noticed with my son when he interacts with his classmates . <h> What to Do if You Suspect Your Child May Have Hyperlexia <p> If you think your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can about hyperlexia and ask for a referral to a speech pathologist and/or psychologist . Here are some other helpful resources that you may be interested in : <h> Monday , June 20 , 2016 <p> As I continue to dive deeper into the ABCs of hyperlexia series , I am amazed and surprised by how many subtle characteristics of hyperlexia other parents can relate to , the characteristics that you likely wo n't find on a hyperlexia fact sheet . For instance , I recently mentioned how my son J gives a canned response of " I do n't know " when answering a WH question in this conversation skills post and it turns out it might be kind of common with these kids . Many parents in my support group told me that their hyperlexic children do it too ! How interesting ! <p> I remember when I first blogged about my son 's hyperlexia that a huge hyperlexia advocate , Dr. Treffert , reached out to me and told me how valuable it was to listen to parents of hyperlexic children because we are the experts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anything , but I can see what he means . Us parents of hyperlexic children have a wealth of information to share about what day-to-day life with hyperlexia looks like . So in preparation for this post , I reached out to fellow hyperlexic parents to find out more about what their kids are fasincated by . <p> It 's no secret that kids with hyperlexia have an intense fascination with letters , numbers , logos , maps , or visual patterns . <p> But what do those fascinations look like in daily life ? <p> And what do those fascinations turn into ? <p> And what other things do these kids become fascinated with ? <h> The Intense Fascinations of Kids with Hyperlexia <p> I think for most parents of hyperlexic children the first thing they notice is the intense fascination with letters . These kids look for them everywhere , point them out everywhere , play with alphabet toys constantly , and turn practically every object possible into a letter . Here are some examples of how this fascination with letters plays out in day-to-day life : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters and numbers on the plates <p> Watching all of the credits at the end of a movie <p> Enjoying movie credits more so than the actual movie itself <p> Playing with alphabet magnets constantly and arranging them into alphabetical order or writing words <p> Singing ABCs both forwards and backwards <p> Preferring to watch TV and movies with the closed captions or subtitles turned on <p> Reading signs around the neighborhood and/or tracing the letters on the signs if within reach <p> Making letters out of any material possible such as crayons , cars , rocks , sticks , etc . <p> Fonts - J loves to write in fun fonts , trace his fingers over fancy lettering , and even taught himself cursive handwriting in less than 20 minutes last summer . <p> Numbers quickly became the next fascination for my son with hyperlexia , but he also has hypernumeracy so obviously his fascination is really intense . And trust me , it is some days , but definitely not as intense as it was when he was about three years old ! Here 's how this intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calendar and important dates , such as holidays and birthdays - In fact , J usually reminds me of birthdays so I do n't ever miss them ! <p> Time and clocks , including learning to tell the time at an early age <p> Temperature and thermostats <p> Calculators - We never left the house for years without a calculator or two in our hands ! <p> Page numbers and table of contents - J never asks about the title of book . He always wants to know how many chapters and how many pages the book has ! <p> Large numbers like zillions , trillions , and all the way up to a googol <p> Counting to large numbers over and over <p> Counting backwards <p> Skip counting , forwards and backwards , at an early age <p> Money <p> Watching movies or TV with timers showing - J used to refer to movies that he wanted to watch by their total length in hours , minutes , and seconds versus saying the title of the movie . <p> Roman numerals <p> Dot-to-dots <p> Tally marks <p> Another fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These kids love to learn about countries , capitals , and more ! I suspect my younger brother could be hyperlexic and in addition to him reading at a super early age , he knew some of the most ridiculous facts and information about every single country in the world when he was little . Here are some of the topics that kids with hyperlexia often get fascinated with : <p> States/provinces and capitals <p> World capitals <p> Studying and reading atlases <p> Kids with hyperlexia also love to doodle . Like all the time . I 've shared some of our favorite doodling materials before , but J 's favorites have always been drawing with chalk , drawing on his Magna-Doodle , and doodling non-stop on paper . And actually , letting these kids doodle is a wonderful strategy to implement at home and/or in the classroom . <p> The periodic table is also extremely appealing to kids with hyperlexia . Why would n't it be with all of those letters and numbers all over it ? ! <p> Another fascination of kids with hyperlexia is space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets and space from about age 5 to 6 . He would create constellations and planets out of random objects . He particularly loved labeling how hot or cold each planet is with their temperatures . <p> I also polled other parents of hyperlexic children in my Facebook support group about their children 's intense fascinations and here were a few other topics that came up : <p> Mazes <p> Checklists <p> Flashcards <p> Polygons and shapes in general <p> Building signs <p> Logos <p> Atoms <p> Human body parts <p> Encyclopedia type books <p> Traffic lights <p> Famous people like presidents or composers <p> Fruits and vegetables - Chelsey shared how her son possesses " an encyclopedic memory of each and every one from around the world . He still likes to carry fruit everywhere and will often sneak it in to bed so he can cuddle it throughout the night . " <h> How to Use These Fascinations to Help Kids with Hyperlexia <p> Sometimes it seems these kids can get stuck on one topic for a long time and I know how tiresome it can be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust me , there are days when I cringe a bit when I hear J say , " I have a math question for you ! " because I hear it approximately eleven billion times per day . Or how he lives and breathes all things traffic light related . But here 's the thing ... I will never ever try to discourage his fascinations . They are the key to engaging and connecting with him . I have already talked about how important obsessions in autism are for that reason . <p> So how does that translate into everyday life ? <p> Well , here are a few things that I have done using J 's fascinations : <p> To encourage him to eat his lunch at school , I use a lunch box with a chalkboard in it . He can feel free to doodle if he likes , but I use it as a checklist of his lunch . I always write the menu down for him in order of importance . He always eats the food in the order it is presented in the checklist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> J goes through periods of time where he is absolutely terrified of bath time . We do n't know what triggers it , but I have solved our bath time troubles ( at least for now ! ) by handing him a translucent ruler and telling him to measure the bath water . Once it reaches the desired measurement , then I shut the water off . So we do n't have bath time at our house we have 5 inch baths or 3 inch baths . <p> To encourage my son to tell me about his school days , I ask him to list three things he did during the day instead of asking him a WH question . He loves lists so much that he is always motivated by them ! <p> Read books and come up with activities based around their fascinations . For instance , to tap into J 's fascination with traffic lights , we do traffic light activities such as this suncatcher craft . <p> When J started kindergarten , he still struggled with getting dressed by himself . Not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be motivated to do it . So I fixed that issue by timing him . I challenge him to try to put his socks on in less than 15 seconds or his shirt on in less than 30 seconds . Works awesome ! And works great for almost anything he resists wanting to try .

This free printable camping I spy game for kids is a great way to get your kids excited for any upcoming camping trips and pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17096 @qwx217096 <p> I <h> Download the Free Printable Camping Themed I Spy Game 17102 @qwx217102 <h> Tuesday , June 14 , 2016 <p> It 's one thing to be able to advocate for your child with hyperlexia when no one has heard of the diagnosis , but I find it is even trickier to explain hyperlexia to other parents . And trust me , other parents do take notice of your child 's hyperlexia . <p> But before I discuss how to explain hyperlexia to others , I want to tell you three recent stories . <p> Let me backtrack to the fall of 2015 , when I was talking with J 's teacher . She was telling me that J had been writing in another language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to write in another language other than French or English would be worth noting . Well , that and he 's in grade one . The teacher was n't 100% sure what language he was writing in , but it appeared to be similar to Italian or Spanish . Regardless , I told her it was n't unusual for him to write in other languages or sometimes even in his own invented languages . Meanwhile , a mom of one of J 's classmates overheard the conversation and eventually shared it with her husband . Later that week , the husband approached me and asked me , " Can J speak or write in other languages ? " <p> To which I responded that it was a bit more complicated than that . So I mentioned that J had hyperlexia and hypernumeracy , explaining that J had a precocious self-taught ability to read and started reading before he turned two . The husband than asked , " So he 's gifted ? He can help me predict lottery numbers or something ? " <p> Then a few weeks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's classmates asked me similar questions out of the blue . She said that she had " noticed J 's superior reading ability " and asked , " Is J gifted ? " <p> Again , I explained that he had hyperlexia and hypernumeracy by using the precocious self-taught ability to read definition , only to be cut short with stories from the grandmother about how her daughter was gifted too . The grandmother never let me finish adequately explaining hyperlexia , which frustrated me . <p> Finally , sometime during the early part of the school year , I had another conversation with a father of one of J 's classmates . I mentioned that J started reading before age two and that he had hyperlexia . The father then went on about how he knew lots of kids who were really early readers , including himself . But here 's the thing : <p> Hyperlexia is more than just early reading . <p> These conversations left me a bit frustrated because obviously , I was n't explaining hyperlexia adequately enough to them . So how am I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what hyperlexia truly is ? <p> And judging by discussions in some of the hyperlexia support groups , other parents encounter similar issues . <h> How to Explain Hyperlexia to Others <p> I 've learned from my mistakes from previous conversations and now I know to try to explain hyperlexia in a particular way . Whenever I discuss my children , it is always in as positive a manner as possible . Sure , J has challenges and quirks and K is stubborn as they come , but my kids are also witty , kind , and fun to be with . So I keep that in mind while explaining hyperlexia . I always highlight J 's superior ability to decode the written word and his self-taught ability to read at an early age because it is the cornerstone to understanding what hyperlexia is . <p> But I also like to touch on these key points that separate hyperlexia from giftedness and/or early reading : <p> Expressive speech delay <p> Difficulties with oral comprehension and WH questions <p> Awkward social skills <p> Intense fascination with letters , numbers , logos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my explanation in one sentence , I would usually say something along these lines : hyperlexia is a precocious self-taught ability to read at an early age that 's accompanied by difficulties in speech and comprehension . <p> Obviously , I also like to mention J 's hypernumeracy when explaining hyperlexia saying that he is extremely good at math and give an example of what he 's currently working on in terms of math . Most people find this part extremely fascinating ! Who would n't ? ! <p> So when people ask , " Is he gifted ? " <p> I respond with , " Well , it 's kind of complicated .... " and then launch into a discussion about hyperlexia . I get a bit passionate about it if you get me going ! <p> But overall , yes , I do think he is gifted when it comes to math and decoding written words . He has a remarkable ability that frankly blows my mind most days . <p> And my response to those people who say something along the lines of " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was called hyperlexia ! " is usually this : " Well , hyperlexia is more than just reading at an early age as these kids struggle with comprehension , expressive speech , and social skills . Early readers do n't necessarily have these speech and language difficulties . Also , hyperlexia is usually diagnosed alongside autism . " <p> I hope my explanations are adequate , I really do , but at the same time , I must admit that I find it odd that people ask questions like , " Is your child gifted ? " But I will have to save that topic for another post ... <h> Monday , June 13 , 2016 <p> Although our kids are not in organized extracurricular activities and sports at this point , we do like to expose them to a variety of different sports .

Who can diagnosis hyperlexia ? How can I get the hyperlexia diagnosis ? And so on . Important questions , yes , but it is n't that simple . <p> Because hyperlexia is currently not a standalone diagnosis . That makes things tricky for parents like myself trying to get help for their child . <p> So I thought I would cover as much as I can about the " diagnostic " process regarding hyperlexia . <h> The " Diagnosis " of Hyperlexia <p> Hyperlexia is not a diagnosis by itself and , as such , does not appear as an official diagnosis in psychiatric and psychological diagnostic manuals . <p> Instead , hyperlexia is a practical label . That means , the label of hyperlexia gives parents , professionals , and educators a better understanding of how the child thinks and learns . Having a label of hyperlexia also makes it easier to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child . <p> Although there have been three types of hyperlexia proposed , most children will usually receive just the general label of hyperlexia . They will usually not be officially labeled as hyperlexia type I or type II or type III . Mostly because the research does n't necessarily support these types yet as it is just a proposed theory . However , I find that most parents know which type their child fits into , if that is something that they find useful . For me , the type does n't matter so much as the actual label of hyperlexia . <p> Often , hyperlexia is diagnosed alongside other diagnoses , which can further help determine which " type " of hyperlexia your child has . Hyperlexia is often diagnosed alongside an autism diagnosis.However , it can also be identified alongside other diagnoses such as pervasive development disorder or expressive language disorders ( see more on page 3 here ) . But not every child with hyperlexia will have one of these other diagnoses . <h> Who Can " Diagnose " Hyperlexia ? <p> In my experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received the hyperlexia label in one of three ways : <p> From a psychologist , usually during an autism evaluation <p> From a speech therapist , usually after the parent raises the possibility of hyperlexia <p> Self-diagnosed and confirmed by professionals <p> Since hyperlexia is not an official diagnosis , you will likely not receive a " diagnosis " on paper . However , many professionals will either introduce you to the label of hyperlexia or will confirm your suspicions . <p> For us , we learned about our son 's hyperlexia during his autism evaluation when the psychologist introduced us to the labels of hyperlexia and hypernumeracy to describe his skills and abilities regarding superior decoding of language and math . I am still so grateful to the psychologist for introducing us to hyperlexia and hypernumeracy because it certainly made everything so clear ! We finally got the answer that we needed and were able to find appropriate strategies to help J succeed . <p> Quite a few speech pathologists that we have interacted with have n't heard of hyperlexia or know so little about it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my son identified as hyperlexic in this manner . Other parents have had varied experiences with this avenue . <p> However , had I been aware of hyperlexia when J was a toddler , I am positive that I would have self-diagnosed him with it and then raised my suspicions with professionals to confirm the " diagnosis . " Many parents seem to find themselves in this position . They learn about hyperlexia , cry with relief , and push professionals to confirm their suspicions . <p> To me , you know when your child has hyperlexia when you see pictures and videos of other kids with hyperlexia acting exactly like your child . I know that when I finally googled hyperlexia and watched some videos , looked at photos , and read about hyperlexia that I had finally found what J had . It was so clear that he was hyperlexic ! <h> Tuesday , June 07 , 2016 <p> Canada Day is quickly approaching and there is a serious gap in Canada Day activities and ideas for kids .

Filled with speech errors , pronoun reversals , and echolalia , the conversational skills of kids with hyperlexia can be a bit awkward at times . So I 'm going to give you the low-down on what their speech skills look like during conversation . I 'm also sharing 10 tips for improving conversation skills in kids with hyperlexia. 17101 @qwx217101 <h> What Conversation with Hyperlexic Kids is Like <p> One of the biggest red flags for me when J was younger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and K was almost two , I could hold a better back and forth exchange with K than I could with J. And when I could get a little bit of a conversation going with J , it was echolalic in nature and usually ended quickly . <p> It was frustrating to know that my son who could read and spell practically anything could struggle with his oral language so much . I kept wondering why the huge disconnect ? Once I learned about hyperlexia , though , then it all made sense . <p> Keep in mind though there seems to be a lot of variance in the conversation skills of kids with hyperlexia , much like how autism is a spectrum . However , here are some typical features of a hyperlexic child 's speech and communication skills : <p> You can see why carrying on a conversation with a hyperlexic child would be difficult when there are all of these issues in their language skills . I will address a lot of these issues in further detail through The ABCs of Hyperlexia series , but I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or in the classroom . <p> Now , J is obviously the only hyperlexic child that I have personally known and/or spoken with , so I wanted to include a separate section dedicated specifically to his speech skills . I 'm not entirely sure whether this unique characteristic is specific to hyperlexia or if it is specific to him , but it is definitely worth pointing out in case it is a hyperlexic trait ( and research just has n't mentioned it yet ) . <p> One of the most recurring " issues " ( I use the word issues loosely here ) that we deal with is J 's canned response of " I do n't know . " Whenever J is asked a WH- question , he automatically responds with , " I do n't know . " Most people assume he genuinely does not know the answer , but that 's incorrect most of the time . I have to frequently remind all the teachers , family friends , and professionals in our life that J struggles with WH- questions and as a result , requires extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately with " I do n't know , " it 's not that he does n't know the answer . It 's just that he needs a few extra seconds to process and comprehend what he was asked . So if you wait a few seconds after he responds with his canned response , then he does answer almost always with an appropriate response . His canned response is his way of buying himself some time to process the question . <p> We are currently working on encouraging him to say phrases such as " let me think about that " or " give me a second to think " instead of his normal " I do n't know " response to avoid the confusion during conversation with others . <p> But until then , please give him those few extra seconds that he needs . <h> Tips for Improving Conversation Skills in Kids with Hyperlexia <p> **Please keep in mind that I am not a speech therapist . These tips and ideas are ones that we have had personal success with and/or I have learned about through my research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond . <p> First and foremost , give your kids a chance to respond ! Remember that WH- questions are particularly challenging for hyperlexic kids , so they may need the extra time to process what you were asking . <p> You 're more likely to get a conversation going with a hyperlexic child if you rephrase your WH- questions as a statement where they can easily fill in the blanks . For example , instead of asking , " What did you do at school today ? " , I could say , " Tell me three things you did at school today . " It 's way more effective ! You can use these free printables to practice basic questions and prompts : <p> Kids with hyperlexia have to be taught social and speech skills very specifically . So if you want them to be a good conversationalist , then you 'll need to teach them exactly what to say when someone asks them a question . You can write your own speech scripts for practically any situation . <p> For instance , today we set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we reviewed common questions and answers that they may encounter and practiced them . We practiced things such as : <p> " How much does a glass of lemonade cost ? " - " It costs $1 . " <p> " How are you going to spend the money that you make ? " - " I 'm going to buy Pokemon cards ( or whatever they intend to do with the money ) . <p> " I would like one cup of lemonade and one rice krispie square . How much would that cost ? " - " That would cost $2.50 . " <p> etc . <p> 4 . Practice knock-knock jokes . <p> This one may seem a bit unusual , but if you think about it , knock-knock jokes follow a predictable pattern and require two people interacting back and forth in order to make the joke work successfully . So even if the jokes are formulaic in nature , these kids learn to exchange words back and forth and even practice WH- questions , two skills important in having an actual conversation with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles . <p> I 've discussed this topic before , specifically as it pertains to comprehension , but books such as Elephant &amp; Piggie books visually displays a conversation . Kids with hyperlexia can see how pronouns are modified between person to person and how to answer WH- questions appropriately , among many other things . <p> Read these types of books out loud together with each person taking the role of another person . <p> Alternatively , you could read play scripts together with older children as it would have the similar effect of teaching the back and forth nature of conversation . <p> 6 . Use an interesting tone while speaking or even sing the questions . <p> Kids with hyperlexia appear to listen selectively , so sometimes you need to get their attention first before you dive into conversation . Plus , kids with hyperlexia tend to listen to the tone of your voice over the actual content of your speech . You could try whispering in their ear , singing really loud or goofy , or even talking with a song-like , high-pitched voice . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Write it out ! <p> It 's no secret that these kids can read and love to read , so use that to your benefit . While asking your questions verbally , write them on a white board or chalkboard or piece of paper . That way the kids can read and hear what you are asking . <p> 8 . Expand on what the child says . <p> Always reinforce what your child does say in response to your questions , even if it 's echolalic in nature . So if I ask , " What do you want for lunch today ? " and they respond with " Sandwich " , I can expand on that by saying , " Sandwiches are my favorite things to eat for lunch . Let 's find some bread . Where can we find some bread for our sandwiches ? " If they respond with an echolalic phrase , then you can say , " Oh I remember that that is from the insert title of book or movie that it comes from here . But when I ask about what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to eat for lunch . ' " <p> 9 . Teach body language and eye contact directly . <p> Body language , positioning , and eye contact are all important things involved in conversations with others . However , you have to teach this skills to hyperlexic kids in a concrete and direct ways . <p> For example , if you want your child to make eye contact with you while having a conversation , then use visual cues to make this happen . I sometimes like to hold up a set of fingers by my eyes and ask , " How many fingers am I holding up ? " That always gets J 's attention and makes him look at my face , even if it 's for a couple of seconds . Alternatively , you could hold up written statements by your face for your child to read out loud during conversation practice . <p> Also , get down to their level so that they can see your eyes . It also shows that you are interested in listening to what they have to say .

So I thought it would be fun to explore the sound that bees make by creating a buzz basket , complete with a buzz-tastic book ( okay , I clearly made up a word ) . 17100 @qwx217100 <p> I came up with the buzz basket idea after reading the Bumblebee Chunky Friend Storybook with the boys . The book is about Busby Bumble , a bee who loses his buzz . I thought we could turn the story into a hunt for Busby 's lost buzz and boy , did J and K ever enjoy this activity ! <p> This activity is a great precursor to studying music for a number of reasons . It teaches kids to use their ears and listen to what 's around them , even in nature . It engages them to compare sounds and look for similarities . We also imitated the buzz sounds using different " instruments . " <p> To put the buzz basket together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played trumpet . Did n't know that I played trumpet ? Well , shame on you for not reading point #5 here . Anyway , you can always leave the trumpet mouthpieces out if you do n't have any . <p> The last two items in the basket are the Bumblebee Chunky Friend Storybook and a straw whistle . I made the straw whistle by cutting one end into a triangle . Then you simply blow on the triangle end and it makes a loud buzzing/whistling sound . The buzz basket , when put together , looked like this : <p> I started off by reading the Bumblebee Chunky Friend Storybook . Then the boys started experimenting with the different instruments to see if they could locate Busby 's buzz . <p> First up was K double fisting the trumpet mouthpieces . He made no sound , but loved trying . <p> J managed to make some noise and giggled hysterically afterwards . <p> Then I created some buzzing noises using the mouthpiece . It sort of sounded like a bee , but J and K were n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we moved on to the straw whistle . It took quite a bit of effort to make some noise with it , so neither boys were successful in making it buzz . Instead , I blew on it for them . Again , not quite the buzzing sound they were hoping to hear . <p> Then it was time for the buzzing noisemaker . I quickly demonstrated how it worked . BUZZZZZZZ ! Then K and J each tried it out . Looks like we found the missing buzz after all ! <p> This activity could be done with babies , only with you playing all the instruments for them . Or you can even make the hunt for the buzz more challenging for older kids by including a wide variety of instruments with some that buzz and some that do not . Then they can play all the instruments until they find the one that sounds like a bee . 17098 @qwx217098 17094 @qwx217094 17097 @qwx217097

We always make our own and the best recipe we have tried ( and absolutely LOVED ) is this no bake play dough from The Imagination Tree . It is honestly the easiest and best homemade play dough ever . It lasts forever too . Usually one batch of this play dough will last us many months .

@@23062617 @3062617/ <h> Saturday , February 28 , 2015 <p> Two years ago today , I decided to start a blog . It started off as a fun hobby , but quickly progressed to so much more . Now it 's my hobby and my job . It has also become my platform to curate resources for other hyperlexia parents , which has been both fun and encouraging . I especially want to thank those of you who have messaged me via email or on Facebook to share your stories about hyperlexia . Your stories have made me smile and helped me confirm that my decision to share our story was indeed what I needed to do . To think that I have actually helped other families around the world by sharing my story is absolutely heartwarming . Even if writing about it was emotionally exhausting . So I may have started out blogging about fun kids activities ( and still do ! ) , but last year proved to me that I was meant to do more . To write more . To share more about my struggles and triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could connect with other families . I have certainly found my voice . So thank you for listening . Or I guess reading would be a better word . <p> Since my daily life is immersed in what I lovingly refer to as " number hell " - thank you hypernumeracy for that - I thought it would be fun to share a bunch of my favorite posts from the past two years in groups of two . But before I do , I also want to celebrate two huge achievements from my blogging career . First , I published a book , which was a childhood dream . Second , I reached 200,000 followers on Pinterest and even got paid to pin something on Pinterest . That 's cool , right ? <p> Okay , let 's celebrate two years ! Ready or not , here are two posts , two posts , two posts , two posts , two posts ...

@@23062620 @3062620/ <h> Saturday , April 27 , 2013 <p> I came across this matching pole idea while browsing Pinterest and thought it was an absolutely brilliant idea . Of course , I wanted to expand on it since I saw the potential for this activity to be more than just a letter matching activity . Really the possibilities are endless . It could be used to match letters , numbers , sight words , colors , and shapes . Or how about expanding it further ? Match uppercase to lowercase letters , numerals to their written form , words that rhyme , simple math problems , etc . You get my point . It could be adapted to meet the needs and interests of any kid . I love inexpensive ideas like this , but even more so when they are versatile . <p> Materials <p> Paper towel rolls <p> Dot stickers <p> Permanent marker <p> I made three different ones : ( 1 ) uppercase letter matching , ( 2 ) number matching from 1-25 , and ( 3 ) sight word matching . <p> The three variations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #1 : Uppercase Letter Matching <p> I wrote all 26 uppercase letters on the cardboard tube and made the corresponding letter stickers . This variation was for K to play with since he 's getting really good at identifying his letters . He knows almost all of them already . <p> K examining a sticker . <p> Aha ! Got one ! <p> Concentrating hard . And yes , he put stickers on himself . : ) <p> Storing stickers on one 's shirt is a more efficient way to accomplish this task . <p> See ... he can just peel them off ... <p> and easily stick them onto the tube . <p> K 's partially finished tube . <h> Variation #2 : Number Matching <p> For the numbers variation , you could choose to stop at whatever number you would like . J can count really high , as you have probably noticed in previous activities , but I chose to stick with the number 1-25 . <p> Starting with number 1 . <p> Searching for the correct number . <p> Peeling off another sticker . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Variation #3 : Sight Word Matching <p> This variation was designed for my little reader J , who began reading before he turned two ( he 's 3 1/2 now ) . I picked some random sight words from this list and wrote each chosen word on the cardboard tube and on a dot sticker . The idea is to match the sight words , all while getting in some reading practice . <p> J matching some sight words . <p> Reading and matching the words correctly . <p> After about five minutes , J moved on . Here 's how the tube turned out . <h> Other Variations <p> As I mentioned , there are so many ways to modify this activity . Here are some suggestions : <p> Match numerals ( e.g. , 2 ) with the written form ( e.g. , two ) <p> Match uppercase letters with lowercase letters <p> Match math problems with their corresponding answer . I would put the answer on the sticker and then match it with the corresponding addition , subtraction , multiplication , or division problem on the cardboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cardboard tube and on the stickers . <p> Color matching . Write the color name and match with the corresponding sticker color . Or use colored markers to draw on the cardboard tube and match with the corresponding sticker color . <p> Match rhyming words ( e.g. , cat and hat ) <p> Match opposite words ( e.g. , up and down ) <p> Match capital cities with their country or province/state. ( e.g. , Ottawa and Canada ) <p> Match animal names with animal stickers <p> Match numbers to practice counting by twos , fives , tens , etc . <p> So many possibilities ! <p> What other ideas can you think of ?

This particular St. Patrick 's Day fine motor sensory bin for kids works on scooping , pouring , and tweezing . Kids can also work on pinching with this sensory bin . <p> This sensory bin is certainly green and festive , but it 's also ridiculously simple to put together for toddlers and preschoolers . It combines tactile sensory play with fine motor practice , but kids can also explore math concepts such as measurement , volume , and counting the shamrocks . Certainly lots of learning can happen with this simple sensory bin ! <p> This simple St. Patrick 's Day sensory bin can use any sensory bin filler that you 'd like .

Each week I will be showcasing ten books that we 've been reading . They will be the ones that have been read multiple times during the week . But that 's not all ! I will also be showcasing a minimum of ten books that my lovely Facebook fans have been reading during the week . That 's 20+ children 's books to check out every single week ! So join me every Wednesday on And Next Comes L 's Facebook page to share your books and then again on Thursdays on the blog to see what books have been showcased . <h> Our Ten Books for the Week <p> This book has been checked out nearly every single time we go to the library ( we should own it by now since it 's at our house so much ) . J is obsessed with this book ( not surprising , given his number obsession and all ) . Each bug is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the numbers used are based on some fact about that particular bug . There are also lots of flaps to lift and explore . <p> The things I have learned about bugs by reading this particular book has amazed me and let 's just say that I hope to never see a Chan 's megastick in real life . Bugs that big should not exist . Seriously . <h> 2 . Apples A to Z by Margaret McNamara with illustrations by Jake Parker <p> Image from Amazon.com <p> We read a lot of ABC books . And I mean a lot .

So that means I read this book about 5-6 times in a row before he falls asleep . <p> It talks about all sorts of things as they relate to apples , such as cider , juice , harvest , and deciduous trees , as it moves through the alphabet . Everything you 've ever wanted to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorable . <p> I am always on the lookout for new number books and this one was the latest find at the library . This book would also be a good fit for those obsessed with cars , fire trucks , and other vehicles . J has been enjoying it a lot lately . <p> Surprise , surprise ... another ABC book . Well , K loves this book and who would n't ? ! It 's filled with adorable babies , photographed in black and white , with the prop in a bright , bold color . And J always gets a kick out of the baby " eating " the yarn for letter Y. <h> 8 .
