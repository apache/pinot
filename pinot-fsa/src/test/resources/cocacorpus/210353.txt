These men and women , who lived by a code of honor and whose mettle had been tested , emerged knowing that they were capable of far more than they had ever dreamed possible . If their children ever contemplated a career in the military , no verbal endorsement was necessary . <p> Welcome to the 21st century . The war in Iraq and the war against terrorism have clearly taken a toll on our country 's psyche . The approval rating among all Americans for the war in Iraq is at an all-time low . The erosion of confidence is even more evident in parents of young adults 16 " 21 years old . Support for the war among youth of recruitment age is also declining . This growing ambivalence posed a serious challenge to our client , the United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) , in meeting its recruitment goals for all military services . <p> While conducting research with parents , Mullen discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career option for their children . More than half of parents told us that they were less likely to recommend the military to young adults due to the war on terrorism . Only one in three said they would strongly support their child 's decision to join the military . Our challenge was to reintroduce adult influencers to the values the military represents and the positive role it plays in American society so that they would be willing to have a thoughtful conversation with youth regarding military service . <p> Key Insight Through our research , we learned that most conversations that parents and kids have about the military are initiated by the youth , so parents are generally caught by surprise and ill prepared to handle such important conversations . We also discovered that , by and large , parents easily reject the military as an option based on their own impressions and fears . What adults did n't object to was the idea of becoming better informed about the military so they could help their child weigh the pros and cons of military service . The thoughtfulness required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we found that an informed , two-way conversation about military service increased the chance of parental support . <p> JAMRS and Public Relations The JAMRS campaign is a fully integrated marketing communications program that reaches adult influencers through a variety of media platforms including print advertising , a television Public Service Announcement ( PSA ) , print and broadcast editorial coverage , direct mail and the Web . <p> Mullen 's PR team works within the integrated team to support , enhance and promote the marketing initiatives of JAMRS , from the Make It A Two Way Conversation advertising campaign to the premiere of the documentary . The PR team also works to create national awareness for the values , qualities and benefits gained from military service , as seen in the Futures publications . Through crisis media relations and development of public affairs guidance papers , JAMRS PR works to change perception and build advocacy among American adult influencers to consider and possibly recommend military service to youth in their lives . <p> Through a multi-disciplinary approach to reach JAMRS ' target audiences , the Mullen PR team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct formal messaging and Qs&amp;As ; research and monitor media ; create educational materials , plan and execute promotional events ; and support crisis communications planning .

Social media is n't a campaign or a program , it 's an ongoing relationship. - Olympus understood this and made that commitment . <h> 2. - Define your community <p> The more clearly you define your community and learn how they engage with a category , a brand , content and media , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a mass audience , but rather to connect with digitally savvy photo enthusiasts who might enjoy learning and talking about the new camera . <h> 3. - Determine objectives <p> True , Olympus signed up for the long term to listen , learn , share , contribute but our real objective was to launch the E-P1 , generate buzz , get bloggers to pay attention , and have the press pick up the conversation . <h> 4. - Engineer your presence <p> Essentially we constructed a social media brand platform , connecting Twitter , Facebook , Flickr and YouTube so we could take our questions , content and conversation to the community rather than ask them to come to us. - Of course , Olympus prominently displayed links on its website , too . <h> 5. - Build a following <p> You can let it happen serendipitously , or you can develop a game plan. - We chose to follow key influencers , promote their content , contribute to their conversations , and offer them value in hopes they might follow back . <h> 6. - Engage , share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about the new camera we got fans and followers engaged in discussions. - We shared videos , product demos , invited them to submit content , and simply talked . <h> 7. - Do something attention getting <p> Even in the social media space , you have to compete for attention and generate content worth talking about . We did it by partnering with Tom Dickson of Will it Blend fame. - We started with a teaser video that generated nearly 200,000 views in the first couple of days , then followed with a full blown product introduction . We did n't create a viral video for the sake of creating a viral video ; rather we came up with a fresh new way to demonstrate the totality of the camera 's features. - It worked , evident by this blurb in Wired . <h> 8. - Mobilize your community <p> Ok , in this case we did something social outside the digital realm. - We invited bloggers and reporters to a product demo and photo shoot at Coney Island. - But we also provided our fans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . <h> 9. - Measure results <p> As our head of analytics likes to say , " you cant put up a weather station and measure yesterdays weather . " - So early on we put in place systems to measure the conversation , sentiment , tweets , RTs , web traffic and impressions from both online and offline media coverage. - This gave us a base to compare the conversation at the start of the project with the buzz generated after the announcement. - It will also give us a baseline to use in determining actual sales and their relationship to the conversation . <h> 10. - Keep on going <p> As we said , and as Olympus knows , this is n't a program or a campaign , it 's a commitment. - So we 're still at it. - Listening , talking , sharing , responding. - Of course its too soon to see the sales numbers , but feedback from dealers has been very positive . - And we know based on previous experience that there is a correlation between buzz and sales. - So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press are writing , prospective customers are talking , and the videos are getting shout outs everywhere . <p> Can you think of anything we missed ? - - Are there best practices we did n't consider ?

@@23443499 @3443499/ <p> How do you hire for excellence today in a space that seems to change overnight ? As agencies and brands alike continue their mad rush to hire social media savvy talent it can be difficult just to get the right people on both sides of an interview . <p> To add some clarity to the hiring process , here are five qualities I strongly believe you should look for in a candidate whether they 're entry-level or a manager . You wo n't see much discussion as to the number of friends , fans , or followers a candidate should have . This is intentional . <h> 1 . Superior Writing <p> Traditional readers wont put a book down because of a bad sentence or delete an email because of a typo . The same ca n't be said for readers on the social web . If you want your message to be read and inspiring enough to be shared , demand crisp sentences with simple words , bright verbs , and witty turns . <p> How you assess a candidates writing talent is up to you . But if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-the-spot editing , and a few real-time responses , you 're taking on a big risk . <h> 2 . Emotional Intelligence <p> Given the regularity with which trolls stir up trouble and web-rustic brand managers freak out in response , you should only pursue candidates who can clearly think through the panic around them . <p> If you 're not good at getting candidates to ramble on about themselves , you can take a quick temperature check by digging into their social media presence . Do they use sarcasm and stir things up in their public-facing commentary ? Capture those remarks and ask about them . <h> 3 . A Sense of Humor <p> Apart from being more fun to work with , a candidate with a sense of humor is vital for success on the social web . Make the time to develop a few examples of dry brand messaging and ask the candidate to rework them to be more fun . Its not foolproof , but this will give you a quick look at how the candidate thinks and what it might be like to work together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But getting it out of the way now is a lot easier than spending the next few months telling your poorly-vetted hire to skip the potty jokes in Facebook updates . <h> 4 . Content Marketing Savvy <p> If you want people to see the messages youre creating , its important to have a marketing plan in place that everyone on the team supports . Be wary of candidates who may have content marketing chops but consider themselves " creative writers " such that theyll balk when asked to write around key phrases or with a certain tone . <p> If a candidate has succeeded on some level in marketing personal content online , perhaps through an active blog or other writing project , you can safely expect some baseline understanding of how to make a larger presence thrive . <h> 5 . An Appetite for Success <p> The effort needed to successfully launch a social web presence or even just revamp an existing one is mind-blowing to anybody who has never been in the thick of something similar . If a candidate is n't obsessed with staying in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll end up with somebody who may do a decent job during the 95 hours but who wont bring anything else to the table . <p> Find out how the candidate approached workflow on previous projects . Were weekend check-ins a normal part of work ? Were hours flexible enough to allow for a few late nights without resentment ? 
@@23443501 @3443501/ <p> Aereo , a startup subscription TV service company , is being sued by major broadcasting networks in New York to prevent the service from launching due to copyright infringement . - Aereo leases antennas to its consumers , that when activated with the company 's app , allows them to tune into broadcast TV as well as record programs on a cloud-based DVR .

However the effect of a loss for Aereo would likely be minimal for advertisers . <p> Ideally the broadcast networks will cooperate with Aereo , realizing that there are opportunities for both parties to benefit from this shift in consumption . While this would mean basically the end for local affiliates , the broadcast networks can live on with the support of services like Aereo by working to provide digital ad insertions or simply new interactive units that advertisers will shell top dollar for . Smart TV 's are already tinkering with similar technology , but with Aereo broadcast networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablet armed with entirely unique capabilities . <p> If they would instead see this new technology as an opportunity for growth instead of a threat to their current business , they would see that the rise of the internet does n't mean the destruction of television , but rather the extension of its influence into the next age of media with the right strategy .

@@23443520 @3443520/ <p> Do you remember the movie Minority Report ? You know the movie with Tom Cruise that gives us an early glimpse of what things could be like in the future ? The underlying premise is that someday the way of life as we know will be more advanced ; computer screens and monitors will be replaced by holograms and someone will have the ability to read our minds and know our innermost secrets . Although this may seem a little far-fetched , technology is being developed to bring this kind of world closer to reality . And we may be even closer than you think . <p> Most of us are familiar with the outdoor campaign that Mini Cooper did back in 2007 . The campaign was centered on the idea of customization . Mini owners often like to customize their vehicles as much as they can down to the color of the racing stripe or the seat cushions . So why not deliver personalized messages that they receive as they are passing by their local billboard ? Mini requested participation from owners around the country and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled out a form with questions about themselves the answers of which were then loaded onto a RFID ( Radio Frequency Identification ) enabled key fob they carried around with them . As the participants cruised around and passed by a specific billboard , a reader within the board would identify that person by their key fob , and a statement that was relevant only to them would be posted on the board . Pretty cool . <p> Now , in 2010 , IBM UK is taking this idea a step further and working on a technology that would turn ordinary digital billboards into RFID readers . They are capitalizing on the fact that most of our credit cards and mobile phones now have built-in RFID chips that house all of your personal information whether you like it or not . The idea is similar to Minis ; a reader inside the board will identify you , potentially even by name , and deliver you a personalized advertisement . IBM says that this technology will prevent consumers from being bombarded by messages that are irrelevant to them and in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing more exciting than the premise of picking your target audience out of a crowd and speaking directly to them . For example , Stop &amp; Shop could use this technology to serve up ads for the products that you most frequently purchase or showcase the deals at the store where you frequently shop . Or a brand like JetBlue could serve communication to a specific consumer who makes frequent trips to one particular city , touting their rates vs. their competitors . <p> This concept has three key implications : 1 ) less waste in a medium that is known for inefficiency , 2 ) media planners should have an easier time selling outdoor as part of the media mix if we can demonstrate its communication precision and 3 ) in the end , 1 to 1 messaging should equate to a higher ROI . Who would n't want this , right ? <p> There is some concern , however , that this technology is even being considered for advertising purposes . Some initial thoughts from critics are that this is an invasion of privacy at the highest level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to opt in and they were ultimately intrigued enough to want to participate . But do consumers really want brands to have the ability to see what type of toilet paper they buy and then have that posted on a digital billboard ? <p> At the current time , there are myriad questions for brands and agencies to consider : <p> Will using this technology actually hurt our relationship with loyal consumers given its invasive nature ? <p> Will our clients be flexible enough and willing to adapt to the idea of changing messages out as quickly as we need to and by location ? <p> Will the cost to participate outweigh the benefits ? <p> Could the system ever be hacked to deliver phony messages ? <p> It may be a while before we see this roll out in a form that is accessible to any and all brands . Overall , I think there will be a way for brands to use this technology without being overly invasive . But what do you think , advertising profession aside ?

The sledgehammer approach of giving consumers a highly orchestrated whack around their collective mindsets does n't work anymore . Consumers are becoming immune to marketing " they 're zoning out the messaging and media blur that 's before them . They 're increasingly becoming advertising savvy and putting their marketing defense mechanisms on full alert . And they 're smarter because of how they 've adapted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content they want and how to filter out the messages they do n't want to receive . <p> Consumers possess the technological aptitude and capability to pretty much do what they want , when they want . <p> Consumers get to pick and choose how to interact with and transact with brands . <p> Consumers seek out relationships with the brands that best demonstrate they understand them . <p> Consumers fully engage brands that engage them and connect with them on their own terms . <p> What Brands Have to Recognize <p> Brands have to accept that the consumer is in total control . They 're in control of how they want to be communicated to and they 're gaining control over the conversation about the brands . It means the rules of the marketing engagement have changed . Brands today ca n't use the same old tricks to win in this brave new world of marketing communications . <p> There are new rules for brands to abide by " they need to recognize two important things : <p> Firstly , it 's not enough to develop an integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using the optimal media delivery system " infiltrating the consumer 's mind requires an understanding of when they 're most open to receiving a communication <p> Secondly , the traditional approach to advertising is based on how to connect a brand with the consumer " whereas today the reverse is true ; creating an opportunity for engagement takes an understanding of how to connect the consumer to the brand . <p> This Necessitates a New Mode of Marketing <p> Winning today requires a new way of thinking. - It takes a new approach to communications that puts the consumer at the center . It means understanding how a consumer interacts with content and media and seeing the world from their perspective . It also means the brand has to find a way to connect with the consumer in a different way , by operating in the space where culture and technology converge . It boils down to understanding the aperture of receptivity : - when is the consumers most open to a message or encounter ? <p> Today , brands have to recognize and identify the modal state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection " and gauge as to whether , when and how the consumer will invite the brand into their world or mind space . <p> At Mullen , we 've discovered how to do that by making a major breakthrough in connections strategy . We 've found a purpose driven and unbound way of shaping messaging and communications strategies that engage the consumer when they 're most receptive. - What we 've developed is a new and innovative way of thinking about marketing communications " we call it the Modes Of The MindG . <p> The Modes of the MindG <p> Over the past several months Mullen has carefully observed cultural developments , conducted proprietary research and has tapped into the cognitive and behavioral sciences , to identify the seven modes that define a consumer 's mind state , receptivity and behavioral activity : <p> Through our studies we 've found the seven Modes Of The MindG are linked to a derived satisfaction " that 's connected to how a consumer interacts with content and technology . Knowing what combination of light bulbs to turn on in the consumers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential for modal receptivity with the most relevant content and appropriate distribution engine , is how to a brand can infiltrate the consumer psyche . <p> Through our work and research learning , Mullen has discovered that The Modes of the MindG approach to marketing communications sparks powerful consumer connections and impacts behavior by influencing how a consumer thinks , feels , and acts . It leads to a heightened potential for communications that penetrates the conscious and subconscious mind to drive action . <p> A brand can achieve that by mining culture and understanding human nature to identify the apertures of the mind that are most open and unlock the potential to create enhanced relationships . Through the Modes of The MindG approach " it 's possible to change the brand relationship paradigm from marketing monologue to conversational dialogue and to become part of the consumer 's world in a highly relevant way . <p> What a Brand Can Do <p> And so to answer the question : how can a brand win in the changing marketing communications environment of today ? <p> The answer is " think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a sphere of influence that impacts the consumer mindset from the inside out . <p> Let the highest potential mode(s) of receptivity be the driver of messaging and connections strategy " and inform the best way to speak with and engage with the desired target audience constituents. - In making a modal connection , consumers will be more open to your brand and ultimately , more likely to buy into your brand . 
@@23443543 @3443543/ <p> When the blogger universe exploded , marketers beheld a population of influencers somewhere between everyday folks and professional journalists , but with serious word-of-mouth marketing power . So they met the blogger ego . <p> As someone who 's been a journalist and a blogger receiving hundreds of public-relations e-mails per week , Ive seen the good , bad and ugly ways marketers solicit coverage . And no one is more jaded these days than bloggers . <p> Bloggers , who now compete ( or join forces ) with journalists in news gathering and reporting , require a different communications strategy in order to effectively reach them and , hopefully , develop a rapport . <p> Step 1 : Know your audience <p> The biggest misconception about a blogger-outreach strategy is that it is simple and easy . Blogger lists take serious resources and hours of labor to create . At Mullen , we have spent years cultivating good blogger lists , which we are constantly adding to or updating . <p> To begin building your list , think about who may already be talking about your product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but should be , talking about your product . Find them , too . <p> Once you have a name , you must read the blog . Read at least the past three posts , but look for regular features or other specialties they write about . This will make sure you are pitching relevant information to the blogger , and you can flatter them by showing that you know what they write about and can speak to why its a fit for your product . <p> Pay attention to how bloggers suggest you contact them . Contact forms may seem like a hindrance , but I 've had great blogger response when I take the time to fill these out . Additionally , start following them on Twitter and Facebook , so that you are engaging with them across mediums . This could also lead you to further bloggers to target for your outreach . <p> Step 2 : Seduction <p> Once you 've built your blogger list , you are ready to begin dialing ( or typing ) and smiling . <p> And , above all , do not act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance with the blogger ego : <p> Salutation : Always include the bloggers name , some reference to the title of the blog and proof that you actually read it ( comment on a recent article , let them know some common ground they share with the company you represent , or add your thoughts to something they mention in the " About Me " section ) . <p> Body : Write something personalized that explains why this blogger is being pitched . It does n't  have to be lengthy , but it does have to be authentic . Then include the approved release or pitch materials . <p> Following up : The absolute worst thing you can do is not write back if the blogger comments on your pitch . Always be prompt with responses part of showing them that you care . <p> Step 3 : The Gift That Keeps On Giving <p> Remember : bloggers like to feel special . Whenever we do any sort of blogger-outreach strategy for clients , we emphasize that exclusive offers and giveaways are a key ingredient to getting their attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-versed in the FTC regulations about sending gifts to bloggers . <p> You also need to give them something they can offer their readers . Most bloggers will tell you that , for the most part , they are in it for altruistic reasons sharing the untold , impressing knowledge on the populace or spreading their wisdom or information . Do n't  just send them something to try ; send them something their readers can try , too . <p> Step 4 : Listen <p> If you are doing something wrong in your outreach efforts , the bloggers will tell you . <p> Christine Hohlbaum is an author , " mommy blogger , " and ex-patriot now living in Germany ( an important fact she says is overlooked by many PR pros who pitch to her ) . Her blogs , The Power of Slow and Mamas Musings , get 2,000 to 3,000 unique site visitors per month , primarily at Mamas Musings . She receives dozens of pitches from PR professionals each day , even more during the holidays . <p> As a PR consultant , she is sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the attention of a robust list of bloggers . But as a blogger , she sees good intentions go completely bad . <p> " Many people e-mail blast , which is something that you do not want to do with bloggers , " Hohlbaum said . " If you 're going to take the time , actually talk to me . " <p> That means be personable . Hohlbaum likes it when a pitch begins with " Good Morning " or " Happy Monday ! " or comment on a recent post . Anything that shows they did more than look a contact up on Cision . These are things that separate the savvy PR professionals and the spammers , Hohlbaum says . <p> Susan Kessler is writer of The Frual Diva , a blog about frugal living that also has appeared in the Los Angeles Times . As someone who regularly receives marketing pitches , Kessler offers her own tips : <p> Do n't  assume the blogger will want this deal or company . <p> Do n't  hide who you are or the nature of your product this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogger that everyone else you contacted is interested ( in other words , do n't  lie ) . <p> Do n't  ignore the blogger to push your own agenda when they tell you what their readers are interested in . <p> Do n't  let the e-mail conversation end negatively always thank people for their time . <p> Do try again politely at a later date if the blogger is uninterested attitudes change . <p> And finally , she said , " Do flatter it still works ! " Everybodys ego likes a little stroking , but that does n't  guarantee you 'll get a write-up.

@@23443556 @3443556/ <p> The experiment The Boston Book Festival promotion consisted of outdoor signage ( or messages printed on pieces of paper ) . The messages included a provocative quote from one of the authors participating in the event and a QR code that directed the user to the Boston Book Festival registration page . One version consisted of simply that , the quote and the QR code , and a second version consisted of the quote , the QR code and directions that explained how to download a QR reader , scan the code and what to expect if you did . Through a QR generator and a Bit.ly URL shortener I was able to create the codes and track each version separately . Because college students are likely to be interested in a book fair , I distributed 160 signs on the Harvard campus for one day ( a Sunday ) . They were placed on outdoor billboards on the quad , on bulletin boards in dorms and throughout the campus . <p> While imperfect , the goals of the experiment were to : 1 ) get an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the version that included instruction outperformed the version without instruction . Oh , and : 3 ) increase attendance at the Boston Book Festival . <p> The results 30 total individuals activated the QR code . 18 came from the version with instruction and 12 from the version without instruction . Let 's assume a 5,000 traffic estimate , considering approx. 7,000 Harvard undergrads , a slower day of the week , distribution occurred largely on the undergrad quad only , and they were only up for a short time period . Well also take a guess ( yes , a guess ) that on average each person saw 2 signs . That leads us to .3% response rate . <p> Harvard students reading the QR poster <p> The takeawaysCaveat : None of these insights are grounded in statistically significant findings or a perfect experiment , but rather they are informed observations based on real activity . <p> Consumers are activating QR codes more than they are clicking on banners online ( in some cases ) . While a .3% response rate is nothing to write home about , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than some online banner campaigns . <p> Consumers need instruction on how to activate the QR code . We can also gauge that we are at a point where QR codes are still in their infancy and consumers need education on how to use them . As they continue to be preloaded in the newer devices , we would expect their adoption rate to increase accordingly . <p> The QR code itself should be seen as a teaser tactic as well as a way to engage consumers . Interestingly , the goal of QR codes is generally to activate otherwise static media experiences. - However , while the intended effect occurred for .3% of estimated traffic , the QR codes more effectively served a different purpose . I would say at least eight of ten consumers walking by stopped to read the signage because they were confused about the QR code . Although they did not act on the instructions , they paid attention to the signage due to the code .

We fielded a national consumer study covering a wide spectrum of service-based categories , and our findings reinforce just how tenuous the relationship is between women and service brands today . <p> In this economic climate , women know they wield scarce buying power and they 're not afraid to use that leverage . Its more challenging than ever to foster loyalty , especially when women have so many choices . <h> The Male/Female Dynamic : <p> We asked both men and women about their service product expectations in 29 different categories from telecommunications to travel and health providers to financial services . Not surprisingly , we found that women continue to be far more likely than men to expect good service sometimes beating mens expectations by a 15+ point margin . <p> Interesting too , is that women are far more likely than men to say that there are major differences in service quality between companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between different hotel chains , as compared to 47% of men ; 41% of women recognize major differences between credit card companies versus 32% of men .

Even scarier to marketers is that the women in our study indicated they are considering cutting back even more . <p> You know what they say , " hell hath no fury like a woman scorned !

The possible silver lining womens expectations for good service are so low in certain categories that there is plenty of opportunity to wow women if you try a new approach . <p> What are- we doing to solicit consumer feedback and use it to affect- our business in real time ? <p> Are- we actively- following the social chatter about- our service ? <p> What are- we doing to become a part of that conversation ? <p> Even if your target is n't solely women what could you learn from looking at womens attitudes and behaviors to make your brands service experience better for men and women ?

@@23443620 @3443620/ <p> Programmatic buying , as we know it , began with the 2005 launch of the Right Media Exchange platform . However , as early as 2000 , Google began offering ads on search engine result pages with their AdWords pay per click product . PPC rapidly became the quickest and most efficient way for digital marketers to gain success . Like PPC , programmatic buying provides advertisers with the ability to purchase display media inventory that is uniquely targeted to each user in a real-time buying construct . Similarly , programmatic display is experiencing rapid success . eMarketer estimates ad spending in this category to top $3 billion in 2013 , a 73% increase over 2012 . Given the near decade-long head start search engine marketing has on programmatic display , below are some valuable lessons we can learn from the PPC model : <p> LESSON #1 : NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF CREATIVE <p> A search ad is shown to only those interested in your product or service , as identified by the query they enter into the search engine . To convince consumers that their ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilize creative testing . Changing the smallest of variables in the ad copy ( i.e. , a call to action ) can have significant impact on CTR and/or conversion rates . This level of rigor around creative testing generally does n't tend to happen within display media , yet there are dynamic creative platforms available like Adobe , Flashtalking , or DoubleClick Dynamic Creative that can be utilized , as they are built into DSPs . Generally , more time is spent determining how we can use technology for better targeting and less time is spent on what we actually say to somebody once we find them . In a real-time media landscape , the ability to adjust your creative as you learn becomes an important lever in managing successful programmatic campaigns . <p> LESSON #2 : TEST , LEARN , EVOLVEQUICKLY <p> Algorithms based on behavioral data allow search advertisers to spend more time working with creative and less time pulling and analyzing data . This means they can focus more of their time on testing and learning . Once a change in creative is made , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the data the next day and next week . This is another invaluable lesson that we can apply to programmatic display : test , learn and evolve quickly . <p> LESSON #3 : DO N'T FORGET THE HUMAN ELEMENT <p> The most successful search campaigns rely on a combination of technology and human intuition to help make sound decisions . For example , a particular keyword might be driving high CPCs and low conversion rates , so a machine-based system might flag it as inefficient . But you might know that it 's extremely valuable for you to keep bidding against that keyword , as a new competitor is entering your category and you need to maintain consumers ' share of mind by appearing against this keyword . While programmatic buying algorithms and other machine-based systems save us time , we can not rely on them completely . A human 's instinct and intuition will always be necessary in managing successful campaigns . This is arguably the most important lesson we can learn in the dozen years search engine marketing has been around .

@@23443630 @3443630/ <p> Enough already with the arguments about the death of the so-called Purchase Funnel and its relevance or not , for the digital age . Because maybe the real issue is not whether the funnel is obsolete but that agencies and marketers have been looking at the funnel the wrong way ? <p> So , take a deep breath . Take a different view of the funnel . And think about it this way . <p> In a consumer-controlled world , where its less about taking the brand to the consumer and more about taking the consumer to the brand , behavioral patterns are less likely to be linear or sequential . And therefore its hard to imagine a consumer who seamlessly transitions from a state of awareness to purchase , by smoothly sliding down the funnel as they consume media. - But knowing this does n't  mean that the funnel is no longer relevant . There 's more to consider . And let me explain why : <p> 1 . What we know from our work behind the 7 Modes of The Mind is that consumer behavior in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mindset . <p> 2 . We 've discovered that mode of behavior and potential brand receptivity is shaped by a confluence of consumption based on how a consumer interacts with categories , brands , technology , content and media . <p> 3 . We 've found that the consumer journey towards a brand experience begins at one of seven primary modes : entertainment , share , learn/research , task/transact , socialize/connect , play and information mode . <p> 4 . We 've also studied how the consumer jumps from one mode to another as they make their way towards the path to purchase based on what frame of mind they 're in while consuming different media , devices and content . <p> By connecting these dots together in this way it then becomes apparent that the consumer mode of behavior and the " gravitational-pull " towards the bottom of the funnel are highly inter-related . And what 's amazing is that when you take a peak inside the purchase funnel you can begin to see all this unfold . <p> Go beyond a two-dimesional view of the funnel , dig deeper inside , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually see this modally driven form of behavior unfold . Far from being a linear sequential series of steps , what you 'll likely see is a meandering path to purchase towards the center of the funnel that 's akin to a journey through a twisting-turning labyrinth , with trap doors and blind alleys , trampolines and pitfalls . But because this journey is fraught with distractions along the way , it also means the consumer may or may not make it down to the bottom of the funnel depending on when and how a brand engages them . <p> So far , what 's clear from our initial work in this area , is that knowing how and when to intercept the consumer within the funnel and understanding what mode they 're in at a particular moment , increases the odds theyll take the chute to purchasing your brand and become an advocate . Using a snap-shot of the three-dimensional view from above the funnel as an integrated modal connections framework can also be helpful , as a way to potentially mapping-out the journey a consumer might embark on as they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , do n't  be mistaken . The funnel is far from dead because on the inside , what we 've found is that its very much alive. - Dare to dive in , and what you may discover might initially scare your brand to death . But equally , do n't  be surprised if this new perspective of the funnel provides you with a better understanding of how to give your brand a new lease on life .

Instagram can get around this quickly just by requiring Facebook profile synching . Will they ? Probably . Keep an eye out for an email about the security of your Instagram account that requires Facebook synching to confirm and secure your account .

Providing a solid analytics platform that serves up not only the actions around content , but also total paid and earned impressions , will be key to success .

Then her son , 2007 Heisman Trophy winning Tim Tebow , tackles her to the ground . Goofy smiles and heart-warming feelings ensue . Not a particularly memorable spot in and of itself . <p> But Focus on the Family got their $2.6-million-dollar-buy worth before Drew Brees brushed his teeth Sunday morning . According to the BrandBowl , Focus on Family was far and away the most tweeted about brand among Super Bowl advertisers in the days leading up to the big game .

It eschews top production values , in favor of building buzz and a community of avid followers in the months ( and years , really ) leading up to the game . It let 's the people take control of the brand . The result is hilarious , simple , stand-out spots that get tweeted about in droves , make Doritos feel like a contemporary brand and makes them winners of the Brand Bowl . <p> Acknowledgment : this article waswritten with contributions from Andy Schneider.

@@23443652 @3443652/ <p> It seems many marketers are waiting for the day when Advanced TV gains some national scale and becomes a real marketing opportunity . The truth is that the opportunity already exists , but its happening at the local level . Although the major MSOs have formed Project Canoe in an effort to nationalize- these local capabilities , the reality is we are a few years away from true scale , so why not test and learn locally while the industry figures out a way to nationalize it ? - Today , we can target over 71+ million local cable households within 210 DMAs in new and powerful ways that include Addressability , Interactive TV ( ITV ) and Video-on-Demand ( VOD ) . <p> So how can we start testing ? National advertisers long for the day when they can target specific consumers with specific messages known as Addressability . For example sending out one message to higher income homes and another to moderate income homes . Although this capability does n't  exist nationally , it is available locally through Market Segmentation which provides capabilities such as Ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or geographic characteristics ) ; Ad Copy ( promote different products/services to different consumers simultaneously ) ; and Geo-Targeting ( allows an ad to appear only to specific psychographic and demographic profiles ) . All of these options allow the advertisers message to be more targeted , relevant and effective . In an addressability test conducted in Baltimore , relevant ads that were targeted to specific consumers were 33 percent less likely to be fast-forwarded through . The targeted campaign was actually 65 percent more efficient than a traditional buy despite the premium required to run the split copy . <p> ITV has the capability to drive sales as consumers can respond immediately to an advertising message via their remote through the use of Interactive TV . Opportunities include : RFI , Polling ( surveying consumers through their remote ) and Telescoping ( direct link to VOD long form content ) . Benefits of these platforms include the ability to send coupons/literature to a particular audience ; cutting costs on direct mail by improving efficiencies and only sending to interested parties ; as well as qualifying future prospects . Markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Phoenix , Tucson and Honolulu . There are currently 32 additional spot markets where just the RFI feature is available and another nine markets where RFI , Polling and Telescoping are scheduled to be available in Q1/Q2 2011 . <p> The VOD platform offers four types of sponsorship opportunities that can provide value to the brand by having your message appear in a relevant environment with engaging content . Advertisers can own their own digital channel through " Showcase , " where they can air one or more customized long-form video messages from 2-30 minutes . A " Feature " highlights the brands products/services next to sponsorable programming housed with other video selections in a channel dedicated to a particular category . For instance , an Aruba Tourism ad housed next to St. Lucia and St. Martin in a " Caribbean destinations " folder . Advertisers can associate their brand with appropriate programming related to their product ( cooking , family , fitness ) through the use of " Content Sponsorship . " One example would be Nike running a : 30 spot for golf clubs before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demand Publishing " allows a retailers FSIs to be transformed into a slideshow video . <p> There are good reasons why brands such as BMW , Dial , Disney , the NAVY , Home Depot and New Balance have incorporated local advanced TV platforms in their media mix . These clients are looking to establish best practices on a small scale at a lower cost thus positioning themselves to be more competitive once these capabilities reach national scale .

@@23443669 @3443669/ <p> This years South by Southwest Interactive Festival started off tragically with the news of the Japan disaster casting a shadow over the otherwise jubilant festivities . But by the time SXSWi was over , the crowd-funding was in full swing , and all of the ubiquitous " dudes with beards and glasses " were heading to the airport to be replaced by more dudes/dude-ettes with tattoos and piercings arriving for the music festival . One thing was clear to all : marketing in the modern era is all about ENGAGEMENT . <p> As NYU professor and author Adam Penenberg described on one panel , when people engage with each other ( tweeting , writing on their walls , checking in , blog commenting , gaming ) the body releases the chemical Oxytocin , also known as the hormone of love . The same hormone that bonds mothers to their newborns also increases empathy 13 percent in males . So , you could think of all the networking that takes place at SXSWi as a love fest of sorts . Certainly , for Seth Priebatsch , the founder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all about engaging with others through the " gamification " of social apps and sites . If we only transform all challenges of the modern era education , the environment into a game that we all solve together , the world will be a better place . And this is a theme I heard throughout the event education is broken , work is broken , social media is broken now let 's change the rules and play some games ! <p> I appreciated Jason Brown of Zyngas sentiment that " games are becoming indistinguishable from real life communication " and as I watched all attendees staring at their screens throughout the show this truth became self evident . But the funny thing about " South By " ( as you should call it if you want to demonstrate street cred ) , is that its a cul de sac of future thinking that will eventually hit Main Street once everyone catches up . So , while Location Based Services ( LBS ) are the rage at the show , the market of smartphone users that actually use them is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wear bright orange tee shirts with matching orange frame sunglasses ( love that Priebatsch style ) . Watch the mobile LBS/gaming market take off as brands aim to increase engagement with consumers through loyalty-creating games that encourage them to " level up . " <p> But , lest we believe that people will play games without incentives , consider the promotion that Jill Okawa Fletcher of Virgin America did with LBS provider Loopt to drive people to check in at taco stands to win flights to Mexico . On the " Go Here , Do This " panel she shared with LivingSocial , Foursquare and Yelp ! everyone agreed that " you need a big carrot " and that Facebook Places will be the check in hub for LBS . In counterpoint , in a panel on the true value of a Facebook fan , everyone concluded that its important to not focus on your brands most influential fans , and that giving away free ice-cream dilutes the value of a fan base . What 's most important is what you do with the fan ( engagement , again ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Facebook that the average fan spends $77 more than non-fan customers . <p> So if engagement via gaming , LBS and social media is the key for brands relating to consumers , the bar is even higher to produce content ( stories , videos ) that will create better engagement . Social is n't about just creating pass-along viral buzz , its about dialogue , and the dialogue should never be just about the brand . This was made even clearer when I met my personal hero Victor Pineiro of Big Spaceship who posts for Skittles and was on a panel with the guys who created Whopper Sacrifice and American Express Open Forum . Their advice : fail and fail often . This is a process of constant reinvention . Conversational posts are 8-10 times more likely to get responses . Stories are not about us ( brands ) . Focus on the topics that brands share with consumers because that 's what forms dialogue .

The creation myth can no longer be a myth . Designer and storyteller need to work together . You can not control your brand , you can only influence what people feel . Today , not taking risks is risky . " <p> " Content is still king " was heard from several during the show , but one risk-taker in particular hit it home : artist and designer Marc Ecko .

In many ways , his passing was a passing of the torch to a new generation of adventurers gathering in Austin to tune in , log on , and check out ( the modern eras version of " tune in , turn on and drop out " ) .

" - If anyone reading this has n't  realized that everything has changed , maybe Gary Vaynerchuks new book The Thank You Economy will help smack some sense into you . - At the very least , it will make the new world a bit less scary for you or your boss or your bosss boss . - I think people will find that Gary V. is a wonderfully unlikely spokesperson and an incredibly steady voice of reason in a seemingly endless world of chaos . He intuitively gets it and can articulate and translate social media very well . <p> here 's my take on the brand spanking new Thank You Economy , the latest from the author of the New York Times best-seller Crush It ! , famous internet wine marketer , social media godfather , and overall feisty personality . <p> The book opens by drawing some amazing parallels to the days when every store owner needed to endear himself to his small community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community happy . If a customer was unhappy , word of mouth would spread and it would cause great problems . Then we became busier , more fragmented , less personal and our individual voices stopped mattering as much to businesses . Essentially they could get away with not caring . <p> But , with the introduction of SM , we are back in a community where each individuals voice matters a lot and the business owner needs to authentically care and should want to communicate with the individual for a lifetime of ROI . That really simply sums up the incredible and undeniable role of SM today . While we have seen other authors point out the differences between pre- and post-industrial revolution society and how it relates to brands roles in our lives , Gary has put a lot of smart thinking into what this means for social media and drawn out useful conclusions for us . The book gives great easy-to-digest examples of some social media successes and failures we can all learn from . There is also content - in here that wont sit easily with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard . In fact , he makes a great case for why advertising and marketing need to continue to be more relevant and more entertaining then ever , why they naturally go hand in hand with SM if used properly by the right people . - It also gives nice context to social medias role in relation to advertising and marketing . All stuff that should be smacking advertising and marketing people in the head , if it has n't  already . The book also underscores the need for absolute authenticity in SM and how to get there with your company . <p> Garys book should be required reading for anyone working , thinking or thinking about thinking or working in social media . Or anyone who works at a company that is thinking about using social ( which should literally be every company in the world ) . The Thank You Economy has been written in a way that people who are very new to social and people who have been working in it for some time will get a lot out of it . Agencies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it liberally . It should be used by agencies to get clients ( and there are still some ) who do n't  yet know the invaluable value of SM to get off the fence . And it should be used as a tool by clients to get senior management who may not yet see the undeniable value of SM to be a lot less scared about it . It debunks the anti-social media myths and paths of resistance in very compelling and motivating ways . <p> Like I said , thank you for writing this book Gary , its a much needed smack upside the head for marketers and I think you just made all of our jobs a whole lot easier . Nice work .

Despite this , studies suggest that there will be anywhere from 30 to 40 million 3D sets in the market within the next few years . What will fuel that growth are more reasonable prices , significant increase in available 3D content , and technology that will rid viewers of those pesky glasses . <p> Marketers are looking at the same obstacles to 3D TV ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . However , there are some advertisers that have made it past these barriers and are currently experimenting with 3D TV channels. - For example , this year P&amp;G/Gillette , Sony , and Disney/Pixar ran 3D units in ESPNs 3D launch of the World Cup . While there was a great deal of hype prior to these 3D commercials actually airing , there has been little subsequent talk regarding any insights we can garner . For now , the advertising community is left to speculate on the potential advantages 3D TV could bring to marketers and the resulting costs of those benefits . <p> Marketers should be intrigued by what 3D could offer in terms of creativity ; adding a third dimension breaks down creative boundaries and offers a new frontier in which marketers can conjure fresh and truly new , innovative ideas . 3D presents a particularly appealing opportunity for products that have fascinating features , or are more captivating in reality than in pictures. - Consumers could see your product in their own living room , which would ( ideally ) enhance the products allure. - Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers may actually watch and gasp enjoy commercials . Adding a 3D element to the TV spot would presumably peak the viewers interest , significantly increasing engagement with your brand . <p> One obvious stumbling block for marketers is the cost-prohibitive nature of new technology . 3D is expensive to produce at 30 to 40% more than the average commercial , and marketers would have to produce and traffic in three different versions of each creative vehicle ( SD , HD and now 3D ) . It is a particularly high cost considering there are less than 2 million 3D sets currently in the marketplace. - Another potential impediment to marketers is the lack of 3D content . Not only are there just a handful of 3D TV networks currently operating , but most people agree that viewers are only interested in watching sports , live events , and action movies in 3D ( i.e. not Desperate Housewives or GMA ) , which confines the number and quality of viewers a marketer can reach and limits branding opportunities .

Since the release of Avatar , revenue for 3D movies has plummeted ; the release of a 3D Twilight movie has been shelved , and the 3D version of Toy Story 3 pulled in less revenue than the 2D version . However , while many doubt the mediums power of longevity , it is in the best interest of the electronic industry , retailers , movie studios , video game creators and MSOs to make sure that 3D TV penetration grows .

However , some electronic companies are already reducing their projections for 2010 , so where those figures ultimately land is anyones guess at this point . Whether an advertiser has the production budget to capitalize on reaching the 3D early adoptors depends on the scale at that time and the potential ROI for reaching them with 3D messages . The good news is there could be some exciting times ahead should consumers ultimately buy into this new technology . The better news is no one needs to up their production budgets for 2011 just yet . We just need to keep an eye on the continuing evolution of the technology and assess whether consumers will embrace it or be content with HD.
