But , rather than spending a lifetime studying degrees and higher qualifications , short courses can give you the opportunity to update your skill set in only a fraction of the time . <p> Ranging from one day to one year , short courses are perfect if you 're looking to formalise your skills gained in the workplace or build upon your qualifications gained through university . They can be the key to unlocking job prospects , promotions or new career ventures and theyll do wonders for your creativity ! <h> Career enhancers <p> Short courses are a great way to fill the gaps in your knowledge and give you a competitive edge when it comes to job promotions . As technology evolves systems , programs and practices change , making it critical for workers to refresh their skills and stay on top of the game. <p> Courses in areas of self-development , such as leadership , workplace communication and conflict resolution , can make you the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an employer , these courses can help you effectively deal with employee issues and workplace relations and earn you the Boss of the Year award . Skills such as these are easily transferable from workplace to workplace and are a great asset on your resume. <p> Studying a First Aid Certificate can also give you skills that are transferable not only in your career but in everyday life . For some jobs , certified first aid knowledge is mandatory . For Maria Mu , her time as a flight attendant required her to have a current First Aid Certificate . <p> I was required to have it when I was a flight attendant , but in general it is a great thing to have . You 're prepared for any situation that might come up and having that knowledge is extremely comforting , says Mu. <p> If you 're interested in pursuing your entrepreneurial dreams then studying a MYOB or bookkeeping course can give you the skills to efficiently manage the business side of your business . <p> Working every day on the same tasks , small business owners run the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A short course , which may offer new ideas and skills , can really fire up the mind and inspire greater business success , says Leah Gibbs , Business Manager and Founder of Lifestyle Careers . <p> Short courses can also be used to turn your career towards a new direction . Studying a TESOL course , through a leading distance education provider such as SEEK Learning can open new opportunities for those wishing to travel and teach overseas . <h> Taste-test a career path <p> Like a taste-tester at an ice cream shop , short courses can allow you to sample the wares before you buy . Gaining an insight into the type of knowledge required for a particular industry or field can save you the time and money of studying a full-time degree. <p> Starting off small can also give you a foundation to continue building your skills upon . Many short courses can be accredited if your situation requires you to further your qualifications . Short courses can be the ideal way to gain the skills you need at this stage , and are also an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called bridging units or preparatory units , can also help you if you need to brush up on some knowledge for tertiary study and prepare you for the work level and study skills that are expected.Some course providers allow you to study individual course units at a time . This gives you not only specific knowledge but also an insight into the nature of the whole qualification without having to make a three-year commitment. <p> Open Universities Australia allows students to study 13-week undergraduate units individually , in order for students to continue their other commitments while studying . <p> Our students have backgrounds that are more diverse than that of traditional , face-to-face universities . We offer students the opportunity to work around their personal and professional lives while still receiving an education , says OUA Chief Executive Officer Stuart Hamilton . <h> Turn hobbies into something more <p> If you 've always wanted to turn your interests into a hobby or even if you wanted to find a hobby you 're interested in , short courses can be a great way to start out . Studying anything from home gardening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself off the couch and learn new skills and knowledge. <p> Keeping the mind active is just as important as keeping the body active , and learning new things . Those who have completed short courses in fields unrelated to their careers show an open and interested mind , an enthusiastic attitude and a lust for life , says Gibbs. <p> Pursuing your hobbies can also be a great way to unlock new career options . If you 've always wished you could turn your hobby into a full-time career then short courses can give you the professional skills and techniques to match your passion . <p> Open Colleges short courses give you skills that are transferable from the home to the workplace . This means that if you plan on studying a Certificate in Animal Care to look after Pickles the poodle , you will also have the professional training to launch your career in the animal care industry. <p> Joanne Becketts studies in animal care compelled her to ask for work with her local veterinarian and pursue a career looking after animals . <p> I told him that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along some of my assignments and results .

In todays global environment , being bilingual is critical to working and communicating on an international level and gives you that extra savoir faire . <h> What you need to know <p> Short courses have a different fee paying structure to longer qualifications and it may not be an option to defer payment or gain government assistance . Make sure you are aware of all the financial considerations involved before you sign up for the course. <p> Also make sure you understand completely whether your course is nationally recognised or can be accredited towards further study if you are interested in using your qualification in the workplace or plan on pursuing further study. <p> Be aware that for some careers you may still require an undergraduate qualification just studying a multitude of short courses does not equal a masters degree . Also , be wary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your resume , unless they are relevant to the jobs you are applying for . Simply listing a few in your interests can help to show that you are a well-rounded , inquisitive person . <p> Short courses show potential employers you are motivated , keen to learn and sharp . They show current employers you are not content to rest on your laurels , and that you see continual improvement as a priority , says Gibbs. <p> Although less of a commitment than studying a university degree , you are still required to put in time and effort to do well when studying a short course . Some short courses may require you to undertake exams , attend a certain number of classes or hand in assignments in order to complete the requirements . The onus is on you to succeed but the benefits are worth it . <p> Feeling inspired ? With over 1000 short courses on offer at ShortCourseFinder , you 're bound to find something to pique your interest . So whether it 's gardening or growing your own business , get stuck into a short course today ! 
@@71750371 @450371/ <h> The advantages of online study <p> In todays education market , an astounding 80 per cent of students around the world are engaged in online learning . In Australia , online study is at the forefront in the education sector , with many universities and TAFEs expanding their online course offerings as a result of the dramatic rise in demand and predicted exponential growth . <p> Various studies have shown that distance learning programs are just as efficient and as valuable as regular classroom programs , and sometimes even better . A study examining the effectiveness of web-based versus face-to-face delivery of education found that participants were more attracted to online education because of its greater flexibility and offering of work/life balance . It also promoted a learner-centred approach and enabled students to overcome potential obstacles to engaging in education . <p> So what are the benefits of studying online ? <h> Accessibility <p> Online learning is available to everyone and overcomes barriers or restrictions that can limit engagement , providing the flexibility to accommodate your specific individual needs . Students with mobility limitations , experiencing an illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in rural areas or who do n't  have access to transport , can work at their own pace from wherever they want . You no longer have to be on campus to get an education . <h> Flexibility <p> You get to choose how and when you want to study ! You can study in the luxury of your own home , or anywhere else that takes your fancy . <h> Save money <p> Online courses are almost always cheaper than their on-campus counterparts . Not only do you save money on study costs , you also save on other related costs such as parking , public transport , petrol and , for some people , childcare . <h> Maximise your time <p> Do you want to spend hours stuck in traffic or on public transport ? Online study enables you to save a lot of time and energy . You 're not restricted to a rigid timetable and do n't  have to waste valuable time waiting around for classes time that could be better used to study , work or see family and friends . <h> Lots of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad range of courses , not just the local offerings . You can evaluate a multitude of courses and decide which one you like the best . <h> Study at your own pace <p> Some people pick things up quickly and can power through course material , while others need more time to digest and review . With online study you have 24/7 access to study materials and can choose the speed and intensity that is right for you . <h> Work when you want <p> As a distance education student you do n't  have to worry about your work hours and taking time off to attend classes . Research demonstrates that students who are working and studying benefit from being able to apply their learning to their work and vice versa . Graduate Destinations 2011 reported that graduates who studied mainly by distance had better full-time employment outcomes than those who studied on campus , presumably because many of the external students were able to work and gain valuable experience while they studied . <h> Student support <p> At the click of a button you can ask a lecturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other students . No more playing phone tag or waiting outside lecturers offices ! <h> Networking opportunities <p> Online study enables you to broaden your professional network . Rather than just meeting local students , you will be able to connect to a diverse range of people who can offer their advice and support . <h> What do hiring managers say ? <p> The most frequent question from potential students is whether or not hiring managers place the same value on distance learning . We spoke to Andrew Ryan , a Senior Human Resources Manager who has worked in banking , professional services and utilities organisations . When recruiting applicants , I look at everything on balance based on the position we are recruiting what do their results look like ? Is a degree or diploma needed for the job ? What experience do they have ? There are many quality distance learning programs run by leading institutions and I value that candidates have taken the initiative to undertake education , online or campus based . <h> A student experience <p> Penny , a mother of three who worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for interior decorating . Having three boys under the age of 7 made it impossible to attend classes so she did her research and found numerous online course offerings available .

Having trained originally as a physiotherapist and then moving into management , it gave me the opportunity to see if I really wanted to make the move into a more creative role . She has recently established her own interior decorating business after starting with doing the bedrooms of her friends children . Word-of-mouth took off and now its full steam ahead !

These are a critical part of most government applications and essential to creating an outstanding application . <p> Even if you have a brilliant resume that shows you have excellent skills and qualifications to do the job and you 've written an absolutely sensational cover letter tailored to the position , if you do n't  address the selection criteria in a separate document that explains how well you fit each criterion , chances are you will be overlooked . Fulfilling the selection criteria to the satisfaction of the selection committee is the only way you can make it across the line to the next stage of the recruitment process the interview . <h> Where to start ? <p> The first thing you need to do is find out what the selection criteria are . You will find them either in the advertisement or on the government department 's website along with a downloadable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new document and list all the criteria , word for word , as they appear in the job application kit . <p> Name the document and make sure you include your own name at the top of the page . You can use a heading such as : <p> Statement addressing selection criteria <p> Selection criteria summary <p> Responses to selection criteria <p> Statement of claims , selection criteria <p> FYI When it comes to naming documents , all your application documentation should have your name prominently displayed and its best to name the electronic documents with your name , not just selectioncriteria.doc . This will make it easy for the receiver to identify your document from all the others that have also been submitted . <h> Give examples <p> When answering the selection criteria think about how you meet each selection criterion and list examples of relevant skills , experience , incidents , training and personal qualities .

If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience such as something you have done at university , for a voluntary organisation or a club to illustrate your capacity to undertake the work required . <p> In every answer to the criteria , you need to demonstrate that you have developed and practised these skills in your past experience/s . Its not enough to just state that you can do it . <h> Use keywords <p> Part of the trick of responding to selection criteria is identifying and understanding the keywords in each criterion and incorporating these into your response . These subtle differences and the way you word your response could be what sets you apart from the other applicants . <p> Know the difference between phrases such as ability to ( means having the skills ) , knowledge of ( familiarity gained from actual experience ) and understanding of ( fully comprehend the matter ) . Incorporate your understanding of these terms into your response and you 're on the right track to submitting an outstanding statement . <h> Choose the right words <p> When writing a selection criterion response , find one excellent example from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome . Make sure that you use strong action words such as demonstrated , reviewed , developed , initiated or negotiated rather than less powerful words such as involved in or assisted . <p> Always give examples and avoid unsubstantiated claims . You can use bullet points if there is a list of points you are making . <h> Address all the parts <p> More often than not , selection criteria will consist of several parts and are sometimes qualified as either essential ( must-have skills and experience ) or desirable ( good to have and improve your chances of being highly regarded ) . <p> It is tempting to write a broad response focusing on just one part of the criterion and hope this will get you through . But if you want to hit the selection criteria nail on the head and guarantee yourself an interview , then this is n't good enough . <p> For example , Ability to contribute ideas and demonstrate initiative and flexibility actually has three components ability to contribute ideas , demonstrate initiative and demonstrate flexibility . In order to respond to this correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills , making sure to include the keywords in your response . <h> STAR approach <p> As mentioned above , the key to responding to selection criteria well is to address all parts of the criterion , to include the keywords and give specific examples . Many well-written statements follow what is known as the STAR method of response : Situation , Task , Action , Result . <p> The following example response is broken up into the STAR components , with each section labelled .

Whether you choose STAR or SAO , it is important that you show how you can meet each criterion . <h> The final touches <p> Some government departments and agencies do not want any more than three paragraphs per criterion ( or about 250 words ) ; others do not have any limit . As a general rule , try to be as concise as possible and at the maximum , write no more than one A4 page per criterion . <p> Once you have completed your statement of claims in relation to selection criteria , check over your responses and make sure there are no typographical errors and that the sentences read well . <p> Finally , make sure that the formatting of your selection criteria document matches the accompanying resume ( or CV ) , cover letter and any other documentation you are submitting .

@@71750381 @450381/ <p> We all know that being good at your job does n't  guarantee that you 're going to be a good manager . Many of us have learned this from personal experience while most of us have had a horrible boss at some point , how many of us have been fortunate enough to work under a truly inspiring leader who knows how to motivate and get the best out of their team ? And more importantly , how do you become such a leader ? <p> Different management styles will suit different contexts depending on the company culture , the size of the team or organisation , the nature of the work or industry and the particular personalities involved . There are some universals , however . <p> Effective management is an art but luckily , it is one that can be learned if you follow some basic principles . Here are some tips on becoming a better manager , starting right now : <h> 1 . Select the right people <p> It all starts with getting the best possible team in place together , the whole can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to select the right people for the right jobs , build a complementary team , and align your people with your organisational goals and culture . <p> As Wallace Lee , a project manager with Westpac , puts it , Recruit right . Make sure that each person not only has the right skills but , more importantly , fits the culture. <p> Knowing how various roles will help to achieve your organisations goals can help define the requirements against which you will interview and assess candidates , according to Iain Crossing , an organisational consultant with Inspirational Workplaces . <p> The development of key people may be the single greatest determinant of an organisations ability to deal with uncertainty and succeed . Central to its development is a leaders ability to engage people and align the needs of individuals with those of the organisation to deliver a united and cohesive front , states Grant Sexton , managing director of Leadership Management Australasia . <h> 2 . Show empathy <p> Empathy is the ability to listen to people , relate to their emotional experience and let them know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can build rapport with and between people , leading to greater trust and transparency in the team . <p> As a manager , openness and empathy should be a key part of your personal brand . According to Iain Crossing , this is the most important core competency for managers and leaders . <p> Developing the ability to understand people and connect with them in a genuine , meaningful way is a key determining factor in how effective you can be at influencing them , setting them objectives that motivate them , and rewarding them in a way they each actually find motivating , says Crossing . <h> 3 . Communicate clearly <p> Communication is the key to fostering transparency and building relationships built on openness , trust and honesty with your team . The first step in effective communication , according to Crossing , is to create the time and space for people to talk and to ask questions . <p> Both Crossing and Lee emphasise the importance of clearly communicating your goals and expectations , and defining peoples roles and responsibilities in line with these . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want . Crossing advises managers to set clear objectives for both the organisation and its people to discuss and negotiate , let people know what support and resources they have access to , and to clearly link rewards to objectives . <p> Non-verbal behaviour is just as important as what people say , so effective managers need to be keen observers to gauge how people are responding to a work situation at an emotional level . Lee says that managers need to be intuitive , since staff members may not always tell you when they 're struggling . <p> Communication needs to flow in all directions , from managers to their staff , from staff to managers , and between team members . An effective leader is a good listener and fosters an environment where people can get to know each other and understand each others strengths , weaknesses and communication styles . Good managers are open to input from their staff , and learn from their feedback . <h> 4 . Lead by example <p> Iain Crossing has observed that people will pick up on the verbal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders need to take responsibility for the atmosphere they create and shape it with their own behaviour . This can be as simple as your posture and demeanour when you arrive at the office in the morning , or more systemic like outlining values and protocols for working with each other . <p> Its also important to practise what you preach . You cant expect your staff to work harder than you 're willing to . Once in a while , roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty . As Lee says , Respect does n't  come from your position you have to earn it. <p> 5 . Delegate <p> As a manager , its important that you recognise that there are only so many hours in the day , and only so much that you can do by yourself . While you may find that its faster to get things done on your own in the short term ( particularly if you have a new or inexperienced team ) , in the long term you will save a lot of time by delegating meaningful projects to your team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skills and help them reach their potential . However delegation does n't  mean micromanaging . Wallace Lee also warns against micromanaging : Do n't interfere know when your staff can run with things. <p> Its important to let your staff take ownership of their work and find their own ways of doing things . Articulate the outcome you would like to see and then leave them to their devices , checking in every once in a while to see if they need your support . As Crossing advises , Delegate responsibility rather than tasks , for maximum impact . <h> 6 . Be positive and constructive <p> Providing timely and meaningful feedback to your staff is crucial , as is determining how best to give them this feedback . Crossing recommends tailoring your approach to each individual , with some people requiring regular assurance and support , and others preferring more autonomy . Lee adds that its important to let your staff know what they 're doing right as well as what areas they need to work on . <p> Its better to tell people what you want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to do , according to Crossing . If you have to comment on poor performance , use actual observations to demonstrate the issue and talk about behaviours ( which people can change ) rather than criticise personalities or make value judgments . <h> 7 . Thank and reward your people <p> This area is often neglected but ca n't be overstated it takes very little effort to thank someone , but it can make all the difference to how people feel on the job . After all , your team members are people , not robots ! <p> When it comes to rewards , Iain Crossing says that its important to provide rewards that people will actually find gratifying . For example , some people love to be taken out for lunch , while others might prefer time in lieu or more autonomy and responsibility . Many managers reward people in the way they themselves like to be rewarded , which is not always effective . <h> 8 . Develop your people <p> A manager is only as good as their team . Lee emphasises the importance of focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed their success is your success . Be patient . Coach them and coach them and coach them ... they 'll remember one day. <p> The best way to coach your people is to help them focus on process rather than content , according to Crossing . As a manager you will have people coming to you with issues and problems , but instead of getting bogged down in the detail , coach people . If you do n't  know where to start , here 's a framework . <p> Ask the person to : <p> Outline the problem ; <p> Describe the impact the problem is having ; <p> Explain what they 've tried already ; <p> Define what an ideal outcome looks like ; <p> Explore the resources they might use to get there ; <p> Consider possible next steps ; <p> Have them try it ; and <p> Come back to you with the results . <p> This turns the problem orientation into a solution orientation , as well as being a great learning opportunity and empowering the person to solve the problem themselves . <h> 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square and know when to take risks .

Encourage innovation for instance , Google allows one day a week for every employee to innovate. <p> ( Google does indeed allow its employees to use up to 20 per cent of their time to pursue their own independent projects .

If you have n't been in a position for very long , you might opt for a basic resignation letter . If you 're moving to a new town , a relocation resignation letter can provide some background for your departure . Or perhaps , if you work for a large organisation that requires you to send a copy to the HR department , a more formal resignation letter may be just what you need .

@@71750385 @450385/ <h> How To Choose The Right Referees <p> When you are putting a job application together , make sure you choose your referees carefully because they could make or break your chances of success . <p> Here are 9 things you should do when picking a referee . <h> 1 . Choose someone who knows your work <p> Work-related references are generally more potent than personal ones since they can attest to the way you operate and what you are capable of . It 's best to choose someone who is senior to you , rather than a peer , but make sure the person you choose is someone you have worked closely with . <p> Choosing from your most recent place of employment is ideal however this can be problematic if you do n't want your current employer to know you are looking to move on . Most interviewers understand if a reference ca n't be provided from where you are currently working , but try to make your choice as up to date as possible . <h> 2 . Choose someone who thinks highly of you <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about choosing a referee who might have doubts about your ability and potential . Choose the people who have seen you at your best and can give first-hand accounts of the success you have had on various projects and endeavours . <h> 3 . Have a variety of options <p> When putting together your list of referees , it 's good to choose people from a few different areas of your life professional , academic and personal . However , unless a potential employer asks for a personal reference it 's best to stick to professional and academic contacts . <p> If you 're a recent graduate who is looking for your first ' real job ' , ask one of your favourite lecturers who knows you and your work well . If you have just left school , ask the principal ( if that person knows who you are and you were a good student ! ) or the teacher of your best subject . <p> For your personal reference , try to choose someone who has a good standing in the community perhaps a teacher , doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office ( for example , a member of a committee or governing body ) . <h> 4 . Tailor your references <p> Just as you design your resume and cover letter to target different jobs , give the same level of consideration to your choice of referees . Some people might work better for different positions . <p> For example , if a job requires the ability to supervise , choose references who can attest to your management and leadership skills . Also , if you are applying for a number of jobs , it 's nice to share the load . <h> 5 . Choose someone who comes across well <p> The way your referee communicates will reflect on you good or bad . So even if they know your work and think highly of you , it wo n't be effectively relayed if they have a monotone voice , are full of ums and ahs , do n't have a good phone manner or , if they give a written reference , ca n't spell and use correct grammar . Choose people who you know can communicate well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give your referees a heads-up <p> Get in touch with the people you would like to be your referees and politely ask them if they would be happy to give you a reference if required . If you do n't do this and they get a cold-call from one of your prospective employers , not only will they be less than impressed but also they may not be able to give you the rap you deserve . <p> And do n't just ask once and then think that person is fair game forever . Let them know every time someone may be getting in touch . <h> 7 . Make sure you brief your referees <p> Give your chosen referees some background on the job you are applying for : the job title , what you will be doing and the attributes the employer is looking for . Also politely remind them of the projects you have worked on and your accomplishments so they will be well prepared . It can also be helpful to give your referees an up-to-date copy of your resume . <h> 8 . Provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know who they are contacting . Be sure you supply your referees ' full names , phone numbers and email addresses , position titles , how you know them , and how long you have known them . On your resume , it 's good to write that your referees are available upon request . That means you can keep track of who will be contacting them . <h> 9 . Always be sure to show your appreciation <p> Write a thank you note or phone your referees to let them know the outcome of your job search . This is just common courtesy , but it will also mean they will be more likely to help you out again if need be . 
@@71750386 @450386/ <h> What To Do With Your Arts Degree <p> There 's a common misperception that arts degrees ( also known as ' humanities ' or ' liberal arts ' degrees ) do not make for strong career prospects . This is because unlike vocational degrees , which have specific career outcomes , arts degrees are focused on increasing a students knowledge and critical thinking skills in a variety of areas literature , history , fine art , philosophy but not ones that lead directly and obviously to a job . <p> Arts or humanities students study ideas , movements and theories in culture , society , history , language , reasoning and more . Extensive reading and research helps arts students to form a broad understanding about the world around them and the ways in which humans connect and interact . This kind of knowledge is vital to develop a broad-based understanding of society , as well as critical communication and analytical skills . <p> Though arts degrees are appealing to many students , the lack of career direction and explicit training makes the graduate career path for arts students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only 66 per cent of humanities graduates who were available for full-time work were actually able to secure full-time employment . The median salary for humanities graduates was $46 000 . When compared to bachelor graduates from all fields , where 76.2 per cent of those available for full-time work found full-time employment and the median salary was $50 000 , the prospects for arts graduates do n't  look so rosy . <p> However , that 's no reason to shelve your Hemingway , Levi-Strauss or Foucault and resign yourself to the commerce degree that your parents want you to do ! With the right tools and the right attitude , you can take your arts degree wherever you want and secure a career that 's both interesting and financially rewarding . <h> Understand your career options <p> The flexibility and versatility of an arts degree means that graduates have the lions share of choices when it comes to which industry they can enter . In 2011 bachelors graduates from the humanities most frequently found employment in business , human resources , marketing , arts and media , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were similar , typically finding work in business administration , sales , management , media , hospitality and government agencies . In other words , the possibilities are endless and its really up to you where you choose to take your degree and apply your skills . <p> Consider all your options media , business , publishing , marketing , the public sector , arts or community services . If you are interested in a particular industry , take the time to research that industry to better understand the requirements for entry-level roles . You may find roles and organisations that you did n't  even know existed . Research companies in the industry of your choice to understand organisational structures and business models . There are a multitude of resources available for this kind of research including careers counsellors , job search websites , industry associations , company websites and more .

Many employees look for a few key competencies , preferring to recruit graduates who they can train in industry-specific skills on the job . Some of the most important skills that an arts degree will give you include : <h> Communication skills <p> One of the most highly sought after skills in the job market is the ability to communicate effectively and this is an area where arts students excel . Essay writing , oral presentations and group work develop advanced communications skills and require a person to absorb , understand and transmit information . Arts degree graduates are therefore able to synthesise complex information and communicate it concisely both orally and in written form . <h> Critical reading and thinking skills <p> Arts students cover a vast amount of reading for their subjects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means more than just understanding the points and arguments presented it means questioning what you 're reading , its premise and validity , and looking at what is omitted as much as what is presented to the reader or audience . This is a sophisticated skill which allows students to understand issues in context and see the limitations of an argument . Curiosity , self-reflection and intellectual autonomy are fostered in arts courses and the ability to demonstrate these traits to employers can make you an attractive and competitive recruitment candidate . <h> Analytical skills <p> Arts students develop strong analytical skills the ability to break ideas and issues down into their component parts and drill down to the root of problems while considering possible solutions . When looking at a problem , someone with analytical skills tries to understand why the problem occurred , rather than simply looking at what the problem is . Analytical skills encompass the ability to interpret information , weigh up different sides of an argument , identify problems and offer reasonable , well considered solutions . Pure logic has its limitations , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to think creatively and laterally . This ability is essential in helping businesses to come up with creative and innovative ideas and solutions . <h> Research skills <p> Arts grads know how to find information , and have the discernment to distinguish between good , authoritative information and poor quality , unreliable information . As part of their studies , arts students are required to find and research a large number of primary and secondary resources , and distil and analyse the most relevant points to create a clear argument . Many arts students are also media- and Internet-savvy , knowing how to skilfully navigate the tangled web of information to be found online and in traditional sources . <h> Consider postgraduate study options <p> Many students choose a Bachelor of Arts in order to pursue a particular subject that they are passionate about , such as philosophy or literature or anthropology . For the most part , however , students who choose an arts degree are looking to broaden their knowledge and experience in order to find a satisfying career path . <p> With the in-depth knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diploma or masters degree , you 'll have the advanced knowledge to launch your career and be an expert in your field . <h> Check out the career-defining moves you need to make in your 20s , 30s and 40s.

@@71750395 @450395/ <h> Industry experience : the value of work placements <p> I have learnt an incredible amount about business , experiences that no monetary value could even come close to purchasing . Every challenge was a learning experience , every day is a lesson and you are never too young to strive to be the best you can be. <p> Phil Watson , work placement student , ICMS <p> If you 're itching to put all that classroom theory you 've been learning into practice , there 's no better way to do it than through a work placement . <p> Work placement is any work experience , practicum , clinical or field placement that students undertake as part of their academic program . They can be optional but are often a requirement in order to complete a degree and usually include assessment . Sometimes you 're even paid during your work placement . <p> Work placements are an integral component of many courses , especially when you 're studying something with a strong practical element such as teaching , nursing , natural therapies or community services . Even if you 're studying by distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The point of doing a work placement is to give you real-life , practical experience in the workplace . This kind of experience is invaluable it tests your skills , proves your competency , and gives you an opportunity to observe and receive feedback and supervision . Work placement experience will definitely help you when you 're looking for a job you 'll have great contacts and have something concrete and relevant to put on your resume . If you 're lucky , work placements can sometimes lead to permanent work with the same company . <p> Margaret Ploskodniak , Clinical Placement Coordinator at the Jansen Newman Institute ( JNI ) , explains : We incorporate hands-on experience into every one of our programs , integrating academic knowledge with practical and clinical experience . JNI graduates are workplace-ready and placements and field work are a vital part of the development of learners into practitioners. <h> What happens during work placement ? <p> Every work placement is different , but they usually involve a combination of observation and supervised work at a relevant organisation . It might involve an external placement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own multi-modality clinic or attendance at one of our community events , says Sam Jacobs , Head of Operations at the Southern School of Natural Therapies ( SSNT ) . <p> Some placements are managed through log books detailing observations , others are supervised on site as students begin to treat clients . All students undertaking placements required for their course are supported by experienced clinic supervisors and academic staff . Most external placements are unpaid , but students are covered by the schools insurance for all course-required activities , adds Jacobs . <p> Pippa Sangster is studying a Graduate Diploma of Counselling and Psychotherapy at JNI , where students must complete 50 hours of face-to-face clinical work in the second year of their course . For her work placement , Pippa provides free counselling sessions at the Green Point Community Centre , as well as bereavement counselling at the Central Coast Bereavement Service . <p> All students must participate in individual and group supervision through JNI . We must attend at least seven out of eight group supervisions and 10 individual one-hour supervision sessions . Additionally , some placements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the Central Coast Bereavement Service I attend regular supervision with the Coordinator of Bereavement Counselling. <h> How do you get a work placement ? <p> Most course providers will assist students to find their placements . JNI provides information about possible work placements and introduces clients through the clinic , but students are also encouraged to look for their own placements . We have a database of organisations that take our students . Students are encouraged to initiate contact with an organisation that will facilitate them meeting their desired career outcomes . Students are well supported through the Clinical Coordinators Office to establish a placement relevant to their needs and their work/study balance , says JNIs Margaret Ploskodniak . <p> The International College of Management , Sydney ( ICMS ) operates in a similar fashion . Phil Watson is studying a Bachelor of Business Management specialising in Sports Management at ICMS , where a nine-month period of paid industry training is a requirement of his degree . ICMS has a careers and development department which assists all students in finding a placement if required , and every student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities to ensure everyone has the chance to receive the greatest experience possible . Alternatively students are able to find their own placement if they have the ability and contacts to do so , says Watson . <p> Students can also get creative with their work placement . Instead of finding a placement with another company , Watson created his own opportunity : My work placement was slightly different in nature . I had the privilege of being the first ever student at ICMS to start my own fully operational , viable and registered company for industry training . I started a company called 360 Sports Pty Ltd , a sports consultancy company which is still fully operational. <h> Are you assessed during your work placement ? <p> Assessment is almost always a component of work placements so that students can receive formal feedback as they hone their skills , as well as reflect on their own performance and this is one of the most valuable aspects of the experience . <p> I was assessed during my placement and was required to write a report on my experience . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milestones , best and worst experiences , self and peer evaluations . I also had to relate it to key issues and subjects studied at ICMS , says Watson . <p> Students are also assessed , as well as receive supervision , at JNI . All students receive supervision in a variety of formats such as weekly debriefings as well as individual and clinical supervision . Students must hand in relevant assignments and learning contracts and portfolios during their practicum , says Margaret Ploskodniak . <h> Why do a work placement ? <p> It ensures that you have the experience , skills and confidence required to succeed in your chosen career . Placements link classroom learning with real-life situations , explains Ploskodniak . The students get to experience work with a variety of clients in different settings in the community , interact with skilled clinicians and practitioners , and explore career options . We follow the training standards of the relevant professional bodies. <p> From the students perspectives , work placements provide some of the most valuable learning during their studies . This is one of the most valuable experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be entering the workforce once I finish my degree well behind the eight ball , but this has put me ahead of the game , says Phil Watson . Nothing beats real world industry training experience is unbeatable. <p> Pippa Sangster heartily agrees . My work placements are proving to be absolutely invaluable . When I began my placement I realised very quickly that this was the place where I was really going to learn how to be a counsellor . However much I may have learnt through lectures , role plays and group therapy at college , this is where I was going to be able to put my learning into action . Abstract ideas I thought I had understood suddenly became crystal clear to me once I was undertaking counselling with real clients. <p> In addition to the specific skills you learn on the job , there are many additional benefits you gain insight into the industry and how its run , as well as invaluable networking opportunities . My placements give me the opportunity to learn about the practical side of the counselling business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way organisations function and provides opportunities to network with other people in the counselling and community field , says Sangster . <p> For those who excel during their work placement , there is always the chance that the placement could lead to permanent work . Linda McCarthy , a naturopathy student at SSNT , was given such a chance . One of the placements resulted in being offered casual work after the completion of placement and on graduation a role was offered as the practising naturopath in a very busy dispensary . This was invaluable and I do not think this would have been offered had it not been for the third-year observation placement. <p> Phil Watson sums up his work placement experience with characteristic enthusiasm . I have learnt life skills that I can apply everywhere in both day-to-day life and also particular social situations . I have also learnt an incredible amount about business , experiences that no monetary value could even come close to purchasing . Every challenge was a learning experience that I ensured I took with both hands . Every day is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the best you can be and achieve your dreams , goals and desires .

Or maybe it could be a particularly challenging project at work which you managed to complete , or having increased your companys revenue or improved its systems , making you feel that you had made a valuable contribution . <p> Others may take pride in more interpersonal achievements , such as having mentored a new team member , or helping someone with a challenging task .

@@71750398 @450398/ <h> The many faces of social work <p> Social work is a demanding career that can be emotionally taxing at times but wonderfully rewarding too . If you 're a student studying social work or someone considering making a leap into the field , then its likely you 're a compassionate individual who lives to help others . <p> The field of social work is incredibly broad and diverse . Its a job that can take you from the tip of the Northern Territory to work with remote Indigenous communities , to the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital where you will console and find practical information for the families of critical patients . <p> Without a doubt its a difficult and emotionally rigorous career , which is why you need to factor yourself into the equation by considering your needs and interests , and finding the field of social work that best suits you . Getting to know the lay of the ( social work ) land will give you the best chance at finding a job that aligns with your values and strengths , and ignites your passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of social work is best for you ? <p> Because its such tough work , I think its really important to love the clients you 're working with and to find a supportive workplace , social work graduate Kate Bakunowicz says . <p> Diane Turner , a brain injury social worker at the Royal Rehabilitation Centre in Sydney who has 35 years of experience in social work , agrees . <p> Get into a place where you can learn and grow , she says . And always value your colleagues . <p> With that in mind , here are eight broad social work sectors for you to consider : <h> Health care <p> Medical and health care is an extremely diverse sector of social work that includes multiple sub-sectors such as acute care , allied health , mental health and community health . <p> Regardless of the speciality , working as a health care social worker involves dealing with people from all walks of life , with all kinds of illnesses be it a stroke , spinal injury or schizophrenia . <p> In hospitals and rehabilitation centres the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources to both patients and their families . In community health however , the focus shifts to those with health concerns living at home . <p> An interest in health and medicine is key as it is important that social workers in this field understand how illnesses will impact on their clients lives . <h> Substance abuse and addictions <p> The area of substance abuse and addiction can be a challenging one in social work as practitioners may find themselves working with clients who do not necessarily want their help or think they need it . Addiction can include alcoholism , gambling or drug addiction . <p> Social workers in this particular field will need a thick skin and a great deal of patience in order to build trusting relationships with their clients . Work can involve providing clients and their families with drug education and prevention methods , counselling , and delivering self-help programs . <h> Immigrant and refugee advocacy <p> Social work in this field focuses on assisting people who have become vulnerable through the process of migration . This includes working with migrants , asylum seekers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers provide these individuals with practical assistance and advice to help them access health services , income support , education and other services in the community . <p> Its an area of social work that requires a strong sense of social justice and an ability to overcome language and cultural barriers . <h> Indigenous communities and services <p> Social work in the Indigenous community and services sector aims at improving the Indigenous populations quality of life and promoting social inclusion . <p> The work can vary from delivering grassroots programs to developing overarching policies , but the underlying focus is the same to ensure Indigenous people have the same access to education , medical services and employment opportunities as any other Australian . <p> Again , this is a tough field of social work that comes with its own unique set of challenges , some of which include the prevalence of substance abuse , health issues and poverty . A comprehensive understanding of Australias past mistreatment of the Indigenous community is vital . <h> Criminal justice <p> Social workers in the criminal justice sector work predominantly with offenders at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal behaviour by reducing the risk of re-offending and to help offenders rehabilitate and realise the impact of their behaviour on themselves , their families and the community at large . <p> The work may involve helping offenders tackle problems such as drug and alcohol abuse ( which may contribute to their offending ) ; providing courts with a range of meaningful alternatives to incarceration where appropriate ; and assisting prisoners to resettle into the community after release from custody . <p> This area of social work can be particularly challenging as it calls for the ability to connect with people with different worldviews and value systems . A thick skin and assertive personality are crucial . <h> Disability services <p> People with disabilities are often marginalised and unintentionally overlooked in society . Therefore the role of a social worker in this field is to empower these individuals and help them work towards living rich and full lives . <p> This starts by advocating on behalf of clients and families , and by ensuring that clients have adequate financial and psychological support . In doing so , you help give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities as the rest of the population . <p> Practitioners in disability services may be employed in a variety of workplaces including rehabilitation centres and community outpatient programs . <h> Child protection <p> Social workers in this field work towards protecting children from abusive and dangerous environments where they may be neglected , exploited or physically and/or sexually abused . <p> It is recognised as a highly specialised area of social work , and in Australia is conducted by government authorities . <p> The main task of a child protection social worker is to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect ; conduct risk assessments and , in very serious cases where a child is at risk , remove children from families . <p> Social workers in this area often work alongside lawyers and the police department to ensure the welfare and safety of a child is put first . Such work might include appearing as a witness before a court and securing alternative accommodation for a child . <h> Family counselling <p> Families that are struggling through a traumatic experience and are unable to cope may turn to social workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may include relationship breakdowns , loss and bereavement , domestic violence , addictions and sexual assault . <p> Social workers here assist families by providing them with short-term counselling ; providing information about government or community support services ; and by helping family members work out options for the future . <p> Practitioners in this area may be employed by general counselling agencies as well as services that assist victims of domestic violence and sexual assault .

The style needs to be succinct and punchy . <p> Rather than just listing your daily duties , outline various actions you took in your previous work and what their outcomes were , how you made a difference , how you met ( or exceeded ) targets and overcame specific challenges to create value for your employer .

You should only include the past 10 to 15 years ( depending on relevance ) and then simply list your roles prior to that .

Even if you do n't  know exactly what those words are , you can still make an educated guess . <p> As a general principle , try to use keywords that relate to the skills and experience the employer is looking for in a candidate .

This gives the person reading your resume an immediate overview of you as a person and is a good opportunity for you to grab their attention . This may need to be tailored to meet the focus of the specific job you 're applying for . <h> Resume tips <p> Tailor and tweak your resume for each different job so it highlights the skills and experiences which are most relevant to the role you 're applying for . <p> Keep it succinct and punchy , and use dynamic action words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In general , restrict your list of previous jobs to the past 10 to 15 years ( unless preceding ones have been relevant ) . <p> Include a career objective or summary . <p> Use keywords specific to the job or industry . <p> Include all your personal details at the beginning your name , address , home and telephone numbers , and email address . <p> Ensure that your resume is easy to read use bullet points , do n't  use too small a font , and use bold or italics where appropriate ( e.g. for headings or emphasis ) . <p> Ensure that the formatting does n't  get changed when you send it as an email attachment try sending it to friends to test it out . <p> Most importantly , ensure that there are no typos or spelling errors !

Following Scheelers thought processes will help you to see how this sort of question can be broken down into key variables and assumptions , as well as how to go about articulating your logic . <p> The key here is to think about what information you have ( or can estimate ) which can help you get to the answer . You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clear-minded enough to be able to sense-check the ultimate answer you arrive at . <p> First , I clarify the question what is meant by " airplanes " ? All planes , private jets , commercial flights only , military , fly-overs ? And what is meant by " right now " literally right this second ? What is meant by " over the US " ? Landmass only ? Does this include ocean territory ? What about Alaska and Hawaii ? <p> I will assume that " airplanes " can be divided into four categories : commercial passenger , freight , small private and military . There will be other types ( like charters and crop-dusters ) but to simplify things I will leave them aside . <p> I assume that these flights are only those flying domestically or to an international destination ( but still over the US ) . I will exclude planes flying over the US from one country to another . <p> I assume that " right this second " means 6.45pm . <p> I assume that " over the US " means over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at each type of plane to look for drivers of the ultimate number . <p> For commercial passenger planes , I assume a good driver would be the number of airports in the USA . I assume there are : <p> Giant airports would have about 20 flights per hour taking off , 18 hours per day . So , about 360 flights per day . At any one time , perhaps 15 per cent of these flights would be in the air . I would assume that the average plane would contain 250 people . So , that 's 360 x 15% x 250 x 10 airports = 135 000 people . <p> Major airports would have about 10 flights per hour , 18 hours per day . Fifteen per cent would be in the air at any one time , with an average of 200 people on board . That 's 108 000 people . <p> Medium-sized airports would have about 10 flights per hour , 15 hours per day . Fifteen per cent would be in the air at any one time , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 people . <p> Small airports would have about five flights per hour , 12 hours per day . Fifteen per cent would be in the air , with an average of 50 people on board . That 's 45 000 people . <p> Freight is trickier to estimate . I would estimate that there are an average of 100 cargo flights per major city in the US per day , and I 'd estimate there are 200 major cities . Fifteen per cent of these flights would be in the air at any one time . They would have an average crew of five . That 's 15 000 people . <p> For small private planes , I 'd say there is one private plane for every 500 head of population ( 300 million people ) , and that one per cent of these planes might be in the air at any one time , with an average of four people on board . That 's 600 000 x 1% x 4 = 24 000 people . <p> For military I am less sure . Let 's assume there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small ) . Let 's say five per cent are airborne at any one time with an average of 10 people aboard . That 's 5000 people . <p> Now I can add up all the people . The total equals 444 500 people in the air right now over the US . <p> To sense-check this , let me just divide by 200 ( the average number on board a commercial airliner ) . That 's 2222 planes in the air , or 46 over each of the 48 states . <p> Hmm , this seems a bit on the high side , so I may have over-estimated somewhere . I can go back through my assumptions and calculations to see if I can trim the number a bit . However , I do n't think I 'm far off.

Its time to leave the toga parties and two-minute noodles behind and put your degree to use in the real world . <p> One thing you need to remember is that around the country many young hopefuls just like yourself are graduating at the same time with similar education and experience , all vying for the same jobs as you . This can make getting a job in your career field fresh out of university tricky , but all it takes is some resilience , a great attitude and a clear understanding of what you want . <h> What do you want ? <p> Firstly , its important for you to work out what careers you are interested in . Just because you have completed a law degree does not mean you have to become a lawyer you may be interested in business analysis or politics . An arts degree under your belt could unlock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism . <p> With so many options , how do you narrow it down ? Think of any work experience you might have had and what you enjoyed about it . Perhaps you took a liking to writing articles , or you enjoyed working in small teams . Even think of subjects or assignments in your course that you liked and excelled in . Whatever your strengths , apply for jobs with these in mind . <h> Putting your skills to paper <p> Once you have decided what jobs to apply for you need to make sure your resume is up-to-date and makes you stand out from the crowd . Your degree is your main asset at this point , but any additional experience you have is a bonus ; however , if you have n't been able to gain any experience in the field , do n't  despair . Any work experience , volunteer work , achievements and extra-curricular activities will help to show your work ethic , initiative , potential and versatility . <p> Cover letters allow you the opportunity to sell yourself to the employer . Be specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generic cover letter . Address the letter to the appropriate person and wow employers by showing you have done your research , for example , Company name has grown to be a market leader in the specific industry over the past year and I would love to be a part of the team . <p> Make sure you individually address each of the criteria listed in the job posting , relating each one back to previous experience you have had . This is the time for you to show how your stint as a checkout chick has made you a team player and therefore suitable for the role advertised ! <p> Some industries may require you to show evidence of your ability to write or do research . If you have n't published any papers , feel free to include any class assignments or even blog posts that demonstrate your ability to communicate and expertise in the field . <h> Leave a good first impression <p> So you landed yourself a job interview ! Congratulations , you are one step closer to being employed . Even though you have probably spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the land of job interviews shoes are not an option but a necessity . First impressions are essential , and although this may not mean dressing up to the nines it does mean you need to dress appropriately for the role . <p> Be prepared mentally as well as physically for the interview . Armed with your university degree , most employers will expect you to have some understanding of the industry and current trends , as well as the basic skills required for the job . Know the business and the role you 're applying for inside and out . Also be prepared to think outside the box . <p> Employers nowadays are straying from traditional interview questions and procedures to find out more about their prospective employees . So do n't  be lost for words when you 're asked , If you were an animal what would you be ? <p> Make sure you are realistic yet optimistic when conveying your abilities to a prospective employer . If you havent had much experience in the field , describe how other work you have done has given you the skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that positivity and enthusiasm go a long way for many employers , the main thing they 're looking for in a junior is the right attitude . <h> Get a foot in the door <p> If you 're finding that you 're getting a lot of doors slammed in your face , then applying for internships and graduate programs can open new ones . While these do not guarantee you a job , they offer great hands-on experience and give you an upper hand if a position becomes available within the company . Businesses admire people who are willing to put in the time and effort to do unpaid work and this will show your passion for the industry . <p> This is also a great way to network and build up your contacts . An accountant from the firm you 're interning at may leave to start his own business and remember you . Chances are there will be several other graduates interning at the same time , so be sure to impress them with your eagerness and hard work . <h> Start at the bottom <p> Starting at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the door .

Work hard , get to know the key players in the company , and you may be noticed . You also have a better chance of hearing about job vacancies from within the company . <p> Keep an open mind about jobs youd accept you are not going to get your dream job a month out of university .

Not all universities offer off-campus learning , and the ones that do may not offer it for every course , but its definitely worth thinking about before you begin . <h> Studying on-campus <p> On-campus learning means you will be attending lectures , tutorials and other classes at the university .

Sometimes teachers will mark attendance , so its a good idea to attend each and every class . <p> One of the major benefits of choosing to study on-campus is that it is very interactive and social .

You can form study groups , do group presentations , talk about homework and take notes for each other if you miss a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit , you will have regular access to all the university resources , such as the library and computer labs . Do n't  forget all the social activities as well sporting events , concerts , markets , festivals and much more ! <p> Overall , studying on-campus at university is ideal for someone who wants to have a more social and interactive uni experience . Obviously you have to be able to get to the campus at specified times each week , so you must either live nearby or be able to commute . Everything including jobs , sport activities and other commitments have to be scheduled around uni classes , which can change each semester . For anyone who prefers a varied and participatory study mode , as opposed to learning things by yourself , on-campus study is a great and rewarding option . <h> Studying off-campus <p> Off-campus learning is also known as distance education or online study . Students doing off-campus study do the same as the on-campus course but , rather than attending class , they are sent study materials and complete the course independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow your own schedule , so its great for people who work full-time , cant get to campus , or have family and other commitments . <p> Off-campus learning can be made up of a range of course delivery modes , including printed study materials , reading lists , audio discs and DVDs , online conferences and online tutorials . You are still required to read all the textbooks , complete the course in the required time and turn in assessments before the deadlines . You will also need regular access to the Internet with a good connection , as online communication is an essential part of off-campus study . <p> One of the great things about distance study is that it gives you a lot of flexibility and allows you to fit study around your life , rather than your life around study . You can do your study at whatever time you want and from anywhere in the world . Furthermore , depending on your time management , you could have a full-time job as you do n't  have to physically attend classes . <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large amount of self-motivation and discipline . It can be hard enough trying to do the work when you are attending classes , but it can be even harder trying to do it by yourself . A strict schedule is a must for students studying off-campus . Its easy to get distracted , so you must have good time management and organisational skills . <p> Another downside is that you wo n't get to meet new people . One of the great things about uni is the different people you get to mix with and the friends you can make . With online study , you do n't  have that group to study or share ideas with . You wont be completely and utterly alone you will talk to teachers , interact with other students online and have lots of support from the university , but it does take a fair bit of self-directed learning to complete a course in this way . <p> As you wont be going into campus , you also wo n't have ready access to the library , so getting resources and doing research may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually pretty good at providing you with everything you need . Do n't  think you will be getting out of exams by not going into the uni you still have to do them , usually at an examination centre venue . <p> Be aware that not all courses can be done off-campus . Check with the uni first before making any decisions . Its also a good idea to talk to someone who has done it before and get his or her advice and opinions . <h> The verdict <p> Its totally up to the individual and their circumstances as to whether they choose to study on or off-campus . A student who has just finished high school , is ready to move out of home and craves a bit of a social life might prefer to go to the campus every day whereas someone who is good at self-directed learning and requires flexible classes due to other commitments will choose to study off-campus . If you 're unsure , check with the university or their website for more information to help make the right decision .

She survived the grueling entrance exam and interview process and is now enjoying learning all about the human body while making the most of the social side of the course . <h> Why did you want to do medicine ? <p> My father was a vet and I watched him do consults , treat patients and talk to clients . I found it an interesting process to have someone come in with a problem and then talk with them , look at their animal and try to solve the problem . I 've also always been interested in the human body and how it works . <h> Did you always want to become a doctor then ? <p> Kids always have exciting ideas about what they want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I actually always imagined myself doing medicine in the end . <h> Did you go straight into a medical course at university ? <p> No , I never wanted to do undergraduate medicine . I was too interested in other things as well , like languages and politics , so I decided to do an Arts degree . I got to do a bit of everything : chemistry , philosophy , maths , economics , politics , and languages ; Spanish , Chinese and French . It did n't  really lend itself to a smooth transition into medicine , but then again the people in my course now come from all sorts of fields . <h> What are the options for people who want to do an undergraduate medical course ? <p> There are fewer universities offering undergraduate medicine now , but if you did want to go straight into medicine in first year you need to sit the UMAT ( a problem solving , no knowledge required test ) and attend an interview . Its a longer course with a different structure than the postgraduate course because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Can you tell me about the exam you need to sit to get into postgraduate medicine ? <p> Its called the GAMSAT , which stands for Graduate Australian Medical School Admission Test . It is assumed that people sitting the GAMSAT have a knowledge of Year 12 physics and first-year university biology and chemistry . <p> Its an interesting test because there are three sections with the science section weighing the most . Then you have to write two essays on social science questions like what is democracy ? and crime and punishment . There is also an English comprehension section . <h> How do you prepare for it ? <p> Some people sit it with no preparation , while others opt to study for a year in advance and others attend courses on how to answer the questions in the GAMSAT . I borrowed some notes from a friend who had sat it , did a couple of practice exams , and read some sample essays and English comprehension questions . <h> What was the next step after the exam ? <p> You put in three preferences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of them might offer you an interview . Sydney Uni had a new format of interview called the multiple mini interview where we spent a certain amount of time at eight stations answering different questions . They were all scenario-based questions on ethical and professional aspects of medicine . <h> What is GPA ? <p> GPA stands for Grade Point Average , that is an indication of a students overall performance in their course . <h> What advice do you have for someone sitting an interview ? <p> Its difficult to prepare because they are scenario based . A lot of people went to courses to practice , but a doctor gave me the advice to read up on medical ethics , professionalism and the basic principles of medicine . Things like why a patient should have autonomy , the role of the doctor and the patient-doctor relationship . <h> What attributes are looked for in people wanting to become doctors ? <p> First and foremost , I think that being your own individual is important do n't  just say what you think the examiners want to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid concept of what is ethical and for people who are well-rounded with interests beyond medicine . They are also looking for people who are deep thinkers and can communicate their ideas . <h> What is the course like ? <p> I do n't  think you realise just how much work it is until you get into it . You can pass the exams and fulfill the requirements , but ultimately its about coming out a competent doctor . The course is pretty practical . From the outset you spend one day a week at a hospital with clinicians . We learn how to take patient histories , physically examine the patient , give injections and take blood pressure . <h> What do you most enjoy about it ? <p> I really like learning about the human body and I also really like the communal side of the course the fact that we are part of a group and all working towards the same goal . <h> And what do you least enjoy ? <p> I always feel like I never know enough . There is an infinite amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand the rest . Its not about being lazy , but it takes time for all the pieces to fit together and sometimes it can be frustrating . <h> What are your future career goals ? <p> Ultimately I hope to become a competent doctor who can diagnose and treat illnesses and care for patients . I think it would be satisfying to become a rural GP where you see your patients for many years and see them grow up . You are also servicing a community which really needs and values your skills . On the other side of it , I really do find some of the specialties interesting . <h> When do you have an opportunity to narrow your career path ? <p> Some people know from day one that they want to be an orthopedic surgeon or a cardiologist , but all the way through the degree you have opportunities to focus on areas of interest . Actually choosing a specialty does n't  come until years in . <h> What advice do you have for someone who thinks they might like to become a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life choice its not the kind of job you leave at 5 oclock in the evening and go home without a worry on your mind . Also , talk to people who are working in medicine and ask them about their experiences . <p> Its a lot of hard work to get there , so its not something to do on a whim . That said , we all really enjoy it ! I had a tutor in his seventies at hospital who came bouncing in every Monday morning saying how excited he was to be there and how much he loved medicine . From what Ive seen , I think medicine can be an intensely exciting and satisfying profession .

While their career is highly important to them , Gen Yers believe that working hard and effectively does not equate to working long hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their personal life and this means they are strong advocates of flexible hours and working from home . <p> And let 's be perfectly honest , who would say no to a better balance and working smarter ? <h> 2 . They put the I in team <p> In general day-to-day operations , Gen Yers are improving the workplace through an emphasis on networking and teamwork . Workplace culture and colleagues are very important to Gen Y and this is reflected in their preference for fewer meetings and more team-oriented and collaborative work . They are wary of office gossip and instead prefer to build strong relationships with everyone . <p> To serve this need for networking , they have brought with them the adoption of internal social networks , including instant messaging , video and phone conferencing as new methods of communication , increasing the amount of communication while decreasing the time it takes . <h> 3 . They are tech-savvy <p> Fluent in the language of social media and technology , Gen Yers are the harbingers of change in the office . Workplaces have now adopted social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective manner but also to change the way they market their brand and their business . They are quick adopters of new technology and prove a great asset for businesses trying to push the cyber-boundaries . <p> Indeed , this generation understands more than any other the ability of social media and technology to be a powerful tool in day-to-day business , from sourcing information to creating a following . With their adaptable nature and willingness to try anything once , Gen Yers are at the forefront of innovation , turning traditional business operations on their head . <h> 4 . They have different work expectations <p> Generation Y are entering the workforce with higher expectations than previous generations . While many see this as rude and demanding , knowing what you are worth and what you want is not necessarily a bad thing . People from all generations want an enriching job , an inspiring boss and flexible work options , but it is Gen Y who believe these should be a set condition of employment rather than an added bonus . <p> In the world of Gen Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of winning and losing , deserves a reward . This ideal has led to a shift towards using constant encouragement , feedback and incentives to motivate staff . A job with a purpose , great working conditions and strong work relationships are primary incentives for Gen Y. <h> 5 . They are socially aware , globally aware <p> Gen Y are a more tolerant and culturally aware bunch than their predecessors . Having grown up with ( almost ) no limitations and the world at their fingertips , Gen Yers have been exposed to a multicultural world , making them more tolerant of differences and , indeed , advocates for it . This acceptance stems from a strong belief in equality for all and their views on sexuality , gender and gay marriage are less conservative than that of their elders . <p> This awareness has also led to a strong understanding of conducting business without any borders an asset in a global economy . To hire a Gen Yer , you will have an employee ready to work anywhere , anytime . <h> 6 . They have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world ahead of Generation X Yers believe in a different method of management and leadership than their traditional predecessors . They dislike the hierarchical management style adopted by most businesses as well as the commanding and controlling nature of traditional managers . As leaders they believe in motivation and the freedom to voice your opinions , fuelled by their love of collaborating and their drive to find a purpose . <p> With the dawn of their takeover fast approaching , we can expect to soon see management styles change to a more hands-on , incentive-driven model . Make sure your business does n't  get left behind . <h> 7 . They have a social conscience <p> While many see Generation Y as Generation Me , over half of this so-called self-absorbed generation are involved in charity work and believe it is important to support their community . This principle is also prominent in their career ambitions and most Gen Yers seek work that has a purpose and value companies that understand their Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) . Many recruiters have described interviewing Gen Y job candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview the company , analysing everything from their carbon footprint to their ethics and philanthropic activity . <h> 8 . They are eternal learners <p> Being no strangers to change , Gen Y is a group of adaptable and fast learners . They are the most educated of all the generations and they enjoy the process of learning , shown in their keenness to master new processes and programs . Their love for new technology is unrivalled and with an iPhone in one hand and a Kindle in the other , they are the masters of multitasking . Workplace training and development is very important and , in fact , often demanded as a part of their work conditions . <p> This desire for knowledge and ability to adjust makes Gen Y ideal for the ever-changing business environment . <h> 9 . They put the y in why <p> Facing a constant bombardment of information , images and advertising since birth means that Gen Y is more critical , and indeed cynical , of marketing and packaged messages , so businesses need to earn their alliance rather than expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen Y the knack for discerning what is n't . <p> Their curiosity and insatiable thirst for information makes Gen Y a nosy bunch , unafraid of asking why not . This , coupled with their intense drive and enthusiasm , gives them the power to do anything they set their mind to . Harnessing this inquisitive nature will give you an employee who never stops looking for new opportunities as well as threats . <h> 10 . They are the future <p> Whether you like it or not , Gen Y is the future of the workforce and the smart thing to do is to accept it and ready yourself for their impact . Full of energy , hopes and dreams , they are a generation whose optimism for the future is unmatched by any other . And having lived through war , terrorism and the financial crisis , this attitude is far from nanve or unrealistic . <p> No one is better equipped for business in the twenty-first century than Generation Y. Filled with new ideas and , more importantly , the understanding of how to put them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future .

@@71750432 @450432/ <h> ' Excellent Communication Skills ' : What Does It Really Mean ? <p> So you think you 've got good communication skills ? Well , you would n't be alone . <p> Almost everyone lays claim to having excellent communication skills , and every job requires them but what does it really mean ? And what does it mean to have these skills when it comes to your job ? <p> Most jobs need good communicators , people who can express themselves clearly and positively , both verbally and in writing . Its one of the key ingredients of success , so it pays to understand what 's involved and there 's more to good communication than the obvious . <p> The problem is that good communication skills is a phrase so overused , and so broad , that its hard to know what its really saying . <p> Having good communication skills in the workplace is all about being able to convey information to people clearly and simply , in a way that means things are understood and get done . Its about transmitting and receiving messages clearly , and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things like give and understand instructions , learn new things , make requests , ask questions and convey information with ease . <p> It also means that you can adapt yourself to new and different situations , read the behaviour of other people , compromise to reach agreement , have difficult conversations with ease , and avoid and resolve conflict . In fact , a large part of good communication is about being empathic , so you can understand how others will interpret your words and behaviour . And do n't  forget that communication is a two-way street , so being a good listener is vital . <p> Good communication skills are some of the simplest , most essential and most useful tools for success you can possess . In fact , they are probably the number one ability sought by employers . So if you 're lacking in this department , you might like to keep the following in mind . <h> Keep your head up <p> Open hands , good eye contact , plenty of smiling , good posture , respect for others personal space : these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display your positive attitude and help present you as reliable and open . Having good body language establishes trust and rapport and means people will not only have more confidence in you , but will want to listen to and work with you . <h> The gift of the gab <p> Good language does n't  necessarily mean that you need the oratorical skills of Winston Churchill , and does n't  just mean being proficient in English ( although it helps a lot ) . It also means that your diction is clear and audible , your sentences are concise , your thought processes are logical and your delivery is flowing . Being a confident and amiable speaker establishes trust with your audience and helps you elicit information and make introductions . This helps to maintain strong relationships at work with co-workers and clients . <p> Speaking well also requires you to adapt your speech to suit your audience , involving changing your word choice and tone for different scenarios . You have to be flexible to communicate effectively and use lingo that 's appropriate and understandable to your listeners . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-abbreviated , or an email that just did n't  make sense ? Communicating well also means being able to write well , or well enough to get your message across clearly . This does n't  just mean spelling , grammar , sentence structure and punctuation , but also being able to read quickly , use email , attach documents , and send and respond to messages in an appropriate timeframe . And , like speaking , choosing those words that are just right for the situation . <h> Mind your milieu <p> The appropriateness of your language in different contexts is crucial . Your effectiveness as a communicator is entirely contingent on how you adapt your messages for different situations , different environments , different audiences and different purposes . <p> How you communicate at work also depends on the job . If you 're a teacher , for example , you need the whole gamut of communication skills written , spoken , body language because you 'll be talking to a multitude of individuals and groups . You need to be empathic , but also commanding . Morphing these signals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good teacher . These skills would be balanced differently for , say , a corporate lawyer or a retail salesperson . <h> On paper and in person <p> Your resume and cover letter are the first glimpse an employer has of who you are . And while it does n't  take much to write I possess excellent communication skills in your cover letter , the truth of the claim quickly becomes evident when you 're face-to-face with the interviewer . <p> With a cover letter , a prospective employer can immediately assess your writing skills your ability to spell , construct a coherent sentence and proofread your own work . If you want to be taken seriously as a contender , you have to ensure that both your resume and cover letter are grammatically sound and devoid of spelling errors . <p> Your application also gives the employer the chance to assess your ability to read accurately and carefully , based on how well you address the job requirements , and how well you expand on and illustrate specific points . Because so much is revealed by your resume and cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself with a top-notch package should be your top priority . <p> Once you make the cut and make it to the interview , the employer is privy to all your communicative quirks , and this will have a large bearing on your suitability and prospects . They will check out your body language , speaking skills , your confidence , your word choice , your tone the whole shebang . Good communication skills here will be hard to fake , so its worth practising answering potential interview questions and doing as much preparation as possible . <p> In the interview , you could be asked to give an example of when you have exercised good communication skills in the past . You could pick from a host of situations : a time when you deftly avoided conflict , or resolved a conflict ; or the time you sold a product to a hesitant customer or pitched an idea to your boss . In all cases , you can approach it from several angles at once , highlighting your capacity for empathy , understanding and diplomacy , your ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw something resolved sooner rather than later . <p> Regardless of what field you 're in and despite the apparent hollowness of the term , honing your communication skills will pay you back many times over . If you get it right , you 're guaranteed to have a much smoother path through life and your career .

@@71750438 @450438/ <h> Double degrees : double the advantage ? <p> Also called dual , combined or joint degrees , these university programs allow you to study two degrees at once , and are most commonly completed in a shorter time than it would take to complete them one after the other . On completion of the program you graduate with two degrees . Voila ! Today , almost 10 per cent of enrolments in Australian universities are double degrees . <h> How much longer does it take ? <p> Double degrees usually take a couple of years longer than a normal , three-to-four year bachelor degree . For example , a double degree may take five to six years , while it would take seven or eight years to complete two individual degrees studied separately . <h> Why do a double degree ? <p> Quite simply , you learn more . Learning in two areas that you 're passionate about means you can walk both roads without sacrificing your potential in either . Importantly , this can mean a richer , rounder education , and in some cases gives you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you add a commerce or law degree to a more arts-oriented one . <p> That means you 'll be more competitive . It can be incredibly beneficial entering a field with competencies in more than one area . Business/Law , for example , is a cherished degree for those working in both business/finance and legal fields , and management types who need to be able to understand and talk the language of contracts and legislation . Armed with these dual competencies , you 're more competitive , and your skill set has a broader scope . Youll have the flexibility to traverse across and integrate different disciplines and industries and that gives you options . <p> It also tells employers you 're serious . Studying a double degree is a challenge , and in that way it signals to employers that you are committed and have a strong work ethic characteristics that are transferable and attractive to any organisation . <h> What kind of course combinations are possible ? <p> Almost any you can think of . Some degrees that would otherwise seem diametrically opposed gain a special coherence under a double degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For example , studying a Bachelor of Languages and International Business degree gives you the language skills to conduct business internationally and opens up the opportunity to work overseas . Studying arts/law gives you both legal skills and broad-based knowledge in the humanities , making you a perfect fit for a career in marketing , PR , journalism , arts policy or management , entertainment law , or legal practice itself . Completing an arts/education degree provides you with an understanding of teaching with the grounding in the humanities to give your lessons the informed and cultured context they demand . <h> What are the downsides ? <p> Double degrees cost more and take longer but not much more , and not much longer . If you 're seriously considering a double degree , you 'll have to weigh this tension up between spending less money and less time studying ; and spending more money and time , and emerging with two , not one , degrees . <p> You 'll need to keep two heads and be extremely good at managing your time and priorities , and be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could be sitting a law exam one day and writing an essay on Wordsworth the next . This will be refreshing for some , and may even help you gain perspective on each field , but for others it will be a strain to keep focused on both subjects simultaneously . If you do manage , however , it means you 're an expert juggler something that will make you a great asset to any employer . <p> So come enrolment time , consider taking a double degree . Whether you want that competitive edge or just seek a more complete tertiary education , it could pack a double punch when you graduate and embark on your career .

@@71750441 @450441/ <h> Top paying jobs straight out of uni <p> After years living off a diet of Mi Goreng and whatevers on sale at Coles , uni graduates would be forgiven for jumping at the first salary thrown their way . A steady income is , after all , a welcome change . <p> But not all university degrees are created equal . While nobody should make a career choice based entirely on the size of a salary package , it does n't  hurt to know , straight out of the gate , which degrees and industries pay the best . <p> We take a look at the most recent Graduate Salaries report from Graduate Careers Australia , and list the career paths with the fattest pay cheques . We also highlight industry opportunities and areas of growth to help you make savvy career choices . <p> Its a bit of due diligence for those of you who are about to start studying or are thinking about it ! <h> 1 . Healthcare <h> Unsurprisingly , the top place goes to dentists , optometrists and those whove studied medicine : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $80k , $70k and $60k respectively in their first year out of uni . <p> And with Australias ageing population putting more pressure on health services , the demand for highly skilled health professionals is only set to rise . According to the latest Department of Employment projections , industry sectors such as medical services , allied health and hospitals are expected to experience a huge surge in growth over the near few years . <p> Being accepted into a medical or dentistry degree can be quite difficult , however , so there are always pathway options like a Bachelor of Medical Science to start you off . Or , if university is n't your thing but you love the idea of working alongside a dentist , there 's always a Certificate III in Dental Assisting. <h> 2 . Engineering <p> Sitting pretty in second place are engineering graduates , who can expect to earn a median salary of $64k in their first year out of university . <p> While the Australian labour market is no longer suffering from a shortage of engineers , there are a handful of engineering disciplines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - March 2015 Report , a strong demand for revit drafters and modellers exists across mechanical and structural engineering , while structural engineers are increasingly needed to work on commercial and residential building projects . <p> So which engineering degree should you pick ? It really depends on what sort of work excites you , and where your talents lie . But , as the latest report from Engineers Australia points out , certain degrees will offer more flexibility and employment opportunities than others . <p> For instance , the report states that a graduate with a degree in civil engineering can choose to practice as a structural engineer , geotechnical engineer , coastal engineer or civil engineer . <p> And if you take your studies a step further and complete a postgraduate course , your salary is expected to increase even further . The Graduate Salaries report , found that engineers who held a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering ( Engineering Management ) , were earning a median salary of between $95k-$100k. <h> 3 . Earth/Environmental sciences <p> With natural resources dwindling and global temperatures rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital . Earth Science covers a broad array of disciplines and includes all fields of scientific inquiry into planet earth , from the earths atmosphere ( e.g climatology , meteorology ) to its hydrosphere ( e.g oceanography ) and lithosphere ( e.g geology , glaciology ) . <p> Students who complete an undergraduate degree such as a Bachelor of Environmental Science can anticipate earning a median salary of $60k in their first year of employment , and can also expect enormous growth in the field in years to come . <p> Deloitte has tipped sectors such as ocean resources , clean coal , and gas as part of its top 25 sectors to expand in the next twenty years , while an IBISWorld forecast expects Australian coal seam gas revenue to grow by 148 per cent in 2015. <h> 4 . Education <p> The median salary for newly graduated teachers is a respectable $57k and , best of all , education in Australia is set to rapidly expand as an industry . <p> According to Department of Employment statistics , school education will be Australias highest growing sector by 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leading forecaster Deloitte has tipped subsectors such as private schooling and international education to be amongst the top 25 industries over the next two decades . <p> But if you 're not 100 per cent certain , and do n't  want to commit to a full degree , you can always get into the classroom first and get a feel for things with a Certificate III in Education Support . Alternately , if you 're passionate about travelling and teaching English to foreigners , a Professional TESOL Diploma is the way to go . <h> 5 . Law <p> After a gruelling four years at law school , graduates can anticipate a median salary of $55k in their first year of practising law in the real world . <p> The problem is , at present , Australia is experiencing an oversupply of law graduates , meaning its a highly competitive field in the jobs market right now for budding lawyers . <p> To stand out from the crowd our recommendation is to get as much experience under your belt as possible , and look for ways to diversify your skills or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Hays most recent overview of the law sector , there 's currently a strong demand for construction lawyers who have experience at PAE level as well as insurance litigators who specialise in professional indemnity and public liability . <h> 5 .

Paramedical studies <p> While its certainly not for the faint-hearted , for those of you who love an adrenaline rush and can keep a cool head , being a paramedic graduate will prepare you to bring home a median salary of $54k in your first year out of university . <p> The work has a surprisingly good work-life balance , with most paramedics working on a rotating roster known as a four by five . This involves two day-shifts plus two night-shifts followed by five days off . Shifts are typically 12 hours , with paramedics clocking about 38 hours per week over a 10-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Aussie paramedics being highly sought on the international scene . The London Ambulance Service ( LAS ) recently hired nineteen paramedic graduates from Charles Sturt University , all of whom had completed the universitys Bachelor of Clinical Practice ( Paramedic ) . <h> 8 . Information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) <p> Deloitte has dubbed the ICT industry the gateway for our growth sectors , and few would argue otherwise . Technology continues to play a significant role in driving economic growth and creating jobs and now , more than ever , we need tech-savvy individuals to step up and build this industry to its full potential . <p> If this is the industry for you , check out the rest of our IT courses . <h> 9 . Accounting <p> Accountants can expect to earn a median salary of $50k in their first year of employment , while those who are happy to accept jobs in more remote regions of Australia will enjoy a higher wage . <p> Hays quarterly report on accountancy and finance found that there 's currently a high demand for experienced accountants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive a heftier pay cheque if you 're willing to relocate to a rural or remote area for work . <h> 11 .

' Read on to find out what you need to pursue a criminology career . <h> What is criminology ? <p> In a broad sense , criminology is the study of crime , criminals , their behaviour , and societys definition of , and response to , crime and crime prevention , as well as how we treat criminals via corrections . <p> This fast-changing and booming discipline which has been around since the 18th century seeks to answer the questions : why does crime exist ? And how best to treat it while diminishing its occurrence ? <p> Criminology lies within the social sciences , and encompasses three main areas : law , sociology and psychology . Law , in this context , looks at how criminals are dealt with and defined ; sociology looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology looks at the criminal mind itself . <h> Why criminology is important <p> Without the comprehensive study of crime , criminals and the criminal justice system , we would have no basis with which to understand what motivates criminals to commit crimes , let alone how to best deal with criminals in a fashion that encourages their rehabilitation rather than recidivism . <p> Criminology is essentially about keeping communities safe and encouraging the wellbeing of society generally . Without it , law enforcement would be a blunt instrument , delivered without a true understanding of the motives behind crime , and therefore how to counter it . Criminology tackles both the causes and the effects of crime . <h> What criminologists do <p> Criminologists are found in many different contexts , so the work can vary according to the setting and the individuals skillset . You could be collecting data and collating statistics based on types of crime or the age of offenders , or writing and proofing reports about crimes and the possible causes of crime . You could have a hand in proposing improvements for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention strategies . You may also be involved in crime scene investigations , or attending autopsies to ascertain exactly what happened at a crime scene . You could also be writing behaviour assessments and intervention plans for offenders with complex needs and histories . <h> Career paths in criminology <p> Armed with a degree in criminology , there are many career paths you can take . It is often used as a launching pad for more specialised training in the field , or to complement existing professional experience or qualifications . <p> Graduates will find open doors in corrections and rehabilitation , in customs , criminal investigation , juvenile justice , forensic science , law enforcement , or research and policy analysis . This work operates on many levels , in local , state or federal government agencies as well as private agencies . <p> Criminologists are also employed in community-based organisations and initiatives , in youth and mental health work , counselling , social work , and in prisoners or victims rights .

For example , you may have been a correctional officer and seek to apply for a postgraduate course in criminology . <h> What you can expect to study <p> By studying criminology you 'll develop a host of practical and theoretical approaches to the understanding of crime . Areas you are likely to study are criminal law , social psychology , fraud , the sociology of deviance , methods of punishment and penology , law enforcement , forensic science basics , criminological theory , crime patterns pertaining to age , gender and socioeconomic status , and victims of crime . <p> You 'll also likely be trained in research methods and social policy analysis , so you 'll have the practical research and critical skills to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What else you need <p> To succeed in criminology , you need to be curious curious about why people do what they do , and what drives them to break the law . You also need to be passionate about improving the wellbeing of communities , especially marginalised ones , through the prevention of crime , and addressing the behaviour and rehabilitation of criminals . <p> Depending on where you wind up , chances are you 'll need to have solid report writing skills , and have a good handle on how to develop and interpret statistics ( both of which are skills you will develop as part of your studies ) . <p> Given its social scientific bent , you do n't  necessarily need a science background , or even a law background ; but if its a forensic , legal or psychological path you wish to take as a criminologist , then there are combined degrees out there where you can develop complementary skills in two fields at once .

@@71750447 @450447/ <h> 11 Top Tips For Effective Time Management <p> Time management is all about making the most effective use of your time and working smarter , not harder . It requires planning , and then sticking to the plan and that takes discipline . <p> According to the Pareto principle or 80/20 rule , 80 per cent of results come from 20 per cent of effort . That means that of all the things you do , 20 per cent are vital and 80 per cent do n't  contribute much . Just think of how much you would achieve if you focused more effort on the 20 per cent that really matters ! <p> So for the workaholics out there , we 've put together 11 tips to help you maximise your time ! <h> 1 . Set clear goals <p> Its important that you know what your short-term and long-term goals are this will enable you to differentiate between what 's important and what 's not . Its only when you know where you want to go and what you want to achieve that you can figure out exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you are clear about your goals , you can plan and prepare a sequence of action steps to achieve them . <h> 2 . Make a to-do list <p> To-do lists are your best friend . They can increase your productivity by 20 per cent , help to clear your mind , and save you energy and stress . <p> Start your day by spending five to ten minutes planning your activities for the day or , better still , prepare your list the evening before . Write out your tasks either on paper or on your computer . Break down large or complex tasks into smaller pieces chunk them down into do-able , manageable units that do n't  feel too big or daunting , and focus on one at a time . As you complete your tasks , cross them off its a very satisfying feeling ! <h> 3 . Prioritise <p> There 's a good chance you wo n't get everything on your to-do list done , but make sure you get the most important things done . That means you have to prioritise the tasks on your list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as most urgent ( not necessarily the same thing ) . Its helpful to number your tasks or assign them ABC status by giving the most important tasks an A , the next most important ones a B , and so on . <h> 4 . Make a schedule <p> Using your to-do list and prioritisation as a base , make a schedule for the day and for the week , including time for breaks and contingencies . The schedule needs to be realistic , with padding for interruptions and unscheduled events . How much contingency time you need to build in will depend on the nature of your work . <p> Having a schedule means you wont have to waste time and energy thinking about what you have to do next just follow your schedule . <h> 5 . Stop procrastinating and just do it <p> Everyone is guilty of procrastinating , but for some its a chronic problem that is a major obstacle to success . You know that looming report or assignment is n't going to go away , so you just have to bite the bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phone calls <p> For many , emails and phone calls constitute the single biggest obstacle to effective time management . Unless you need to be constantly available and accessible , avoid continuous email notification and let your phone go to voice mail these things can suck up untold minutes and hours , and make you repeatedly lose focus . <p> You need to give yourself solid chunks of time to concentrate on your work . Read and respond to emails in blocks only a few times a day so you 're not constantly chopping and changing what you 're doing . This may necessitate reconditioning others and their expectations of you , so they wo n't expect immediate responses but will know that you will respond at specified times . <h> 7 . Keep a time log <p> Its useful to track your daily activities and how much time each takes . This will give you a realistic view of how you spend your time , as well as what interruptions there are , and you might be surprised by how much time certain tasks actually take or how much time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also note what your energy levels and focus are like at different times of the day . This will enable you to figure out which activities you should be doing at what time of day you should schedule your most challenging tasks for when your energy level is greatest . For example , if you 're most focused and creative in the morning , then use that time to do your writing or brainstorming , and do n't  waste that time responding to emails. <h> 8 . Take regular breaks <p> Breaks will keep your mind fresh and you will be able to return to your work with better focus . If you work straight through , you will put in more hours but work less productively . <p> Stick to allotted break times . You might want to try the Pomodoro technique to see if it increases your productivity . In this time management technique , you work in 25-minute segments ( Pomodoros ) with 5-minute breaks between each period , and a longer break every four Pomodoros . Some people swear by this technique as a way of increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems in place <p> Being organised and having good systems for filing emails , computer documents and papers will save you many valuable hours in the long run so spend some time initially setting up your systems , then you wont have to worry about it . <h> 10 . Delegate <p> You probably do n't  have time to do everything yourself , so if you can , delegate less important tasks , or tasks that would be better performed by someone else . <h> 11 . Learn how to say no <p> This is extremely important ; your time and resources are limited , so you cant say yes to everything and accede to every request . You have to stick to what 's important and know when to just say , No . <p> Learning how to squeeze more into your day , and knowing how to make the most of your time is essential to your career and work/life balance !

Turn it off or put it in another room . Switch your computer notifications off and tell your friends they can wait . <p> If you hit a brick wall and just are n't  getting it , move on ! Or take a quick break and clear your head . Some of my best problem-solving has happened on my morning walks . <h> 5 . Reward yourself <p> You do n't  need to be a monk to get good grades .

It takes someone who 's emotionally stable , hard-working , quick-thinking , patient , who communicates well , is highly capable of empathy , and has a high degree of physical endurance . And that 's just for starters . <p> Despite the challenges , nearly every nurse out there has a heap of good things to say about their profession that its an honourable , worthwhile and highly fulfilling way to make a living . <p> Here are just some of the things nurses say about the rewards of their career : <h> 1 . You 're improving and saving lives <p> This is the chief reason that many nurses , in the face of what can be a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high level of job satisfaction . Nursing is all about the patient someone whose quality of life or chances of survival often grows directly due to the efforts of the nurse . A job rarely gets more meaningful than that . <h> 2 . Job security <p> As a result of Australia 's ageing population , there 's a strong demand for nurses . This means stablity and job security for nursing graduates . You can take a look at a snapshot of the health industry here . <h> 3 . You learn a very wide range of skills <p> Think nursing is all about checking blood pressures and sticking needles in arms ? Think again . With training spanning health science , social science , technology and theory , nursing takes a lot of expertise . <p> There are many kinds of nurses , from ER to ICU to mental health nurses and midwives . All can involve completing physical assessments of patients , checking equipment , administering medications and pain relief , washing patients , dressing wounds , filing reports , liaising with doctors and insurance companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iceberg . <h> 4 . Its a challenging and fast-paced environment <p> In a healthcare setting , a situation can change fast . A patients health can quickly deteriorate or the casualty ward can suddenly fill , and you might have more than a dozen patients to monitor at once . Handling everything thrown at you can sometimes be a challenge , but many nurses say this dynamism and pace is what they thrive on . If you like repetitiveness and taking it easy , then nursing is not for you . If you like variety and a job that keeps you on your toes , then it could be perfect . <h> 5 . There are good opportunities to progress <p> In studying a nursing course , you have different levels of qualification to aim for that roughly equate to different levels of responsibility . <p> When it comes to the clinical side of things , Assistants in Nursing ( AINs ) which include Aged Care Workers ( ACWs ) , Personal Care Assistants ( PCAs ) , Health Services Assistants ( HSAs ) and Care Support Employees ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Registered Nurse ( RN ) , assisting in the performance of nursing duties . <p> Then there 's an Enrolled Nurse a second level nurse who works under an RN , but with greater responsibility than an AIN . <p> Next up is the Registered Nurse , of which there are several different kinds specialising in areas such as paediatrics , mental health , disabilities , acute care and community care . The more experience you have , the greater your responsibility . <p> Nurse Practitioner is another step up the ladder . These nurses are essentially RNs educated to operate both independently and collaboratively in an advanced clinical role . <p> On the management side of things , Nurse Managers have extensive clinical experience but specialise in information and HR management . They effectively supervise and manage nurses in clinical care environments , usually in specific departments . <p> Then , on the education front , there 's the Nurse Educator , charged with the designing , planning , implementation and evaluation of nursing education and staff programs in educational and health settings . <h> Study options <p> Whether you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you want to be an AIN or nurse manager , a qualification is your ticket to entering the profession and moving your career forward . There is a wide range of nursing courses available to suit your career needs . <p> And while most nursing courses involve an element of hands-on experience via clinical work placement , many programs can now be completed largely by distance education .

@@71750468 @450468/ <h> How To Succeed In A Group Interview <p> Did you know that you could take a cocktail shaker to a group interview and walk away with a job offer ? That 's right its all about standing out from the crowd when it comes to group interviews ( do n't worry , I 'll explain ) . But when everyone else has the same goal , standing out is not such an easy task . <p> Answers to some of the key questions about group interviews can help . Finding the answers to questions such as How do group interviews work ? How am I assessed in group interviews ? What is involved in role-playing , group activities and speeches ? and What about general knowledge tests ? will help you to find ways to succeed . <h> Who uses group interviews ? <p> Companies that recruit large numbers of staff ( like retail and supermarket chains ) love group interviews . They are also used to recruit graduates into highly prized cadetships at organisations such as accounting firms , banks and other corporates . <h> My story <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group interview . At the end of a gruelling seven-hour group interview that started with 50 people , I was one of five candidates offered a job . We each had to give a three-minute speech so I decided to drink to my success using my personal attributes as ingredients for the job success cocktail ; hence the cocktail shaker ! <p> Why did it work ? Because I think the speech was memorable ( more for the cocktail shaker perhaps but memorable nevertheless ) . If you do n't stand out during a group interview , you 'll get lost in the crowd . While you do n't have to bring a cocktail shaker with you , you should think about how you can impress the interviewers . No matter how qualified or experienced you are , it 's easy to get spooked at a group interview . I was completely unprepared for a make-or-break question in a group interview with an iconic Australian department store : ' If you were a colour , what colour would you be and why ? ' <p> My nerves took hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I blurted out like an idiot ' silver because I really really like shiny things ! ' Instead I should have explained that I had experience selling electronics and this made me fond of all things metallic and chrome . <p> Try to discuss your experience and education whenever possible . Remain calm , take your time , and express yourself clearly . Do n't try to impress the group interviewer by pretending to be something you 're not . Interviewers are trained to see through any deception so stay genuine . <h> How do group interviews work ? <p> Group interviews usually take a couple of hours . But sometimes they can stretch over several days . Yes , they can be gruelling . Unlike regular interviews that can be relaxed and intimate by comparison , group interviews have strict guidelines simply because there are so many people to manage in the process . You will have barely any one-on-one time with the interviewer yet the interviewer is continuously observing the way you interact with the other candidates and your performance in the activities . <h> How am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are assessed from the moment you enter the reception area , even before you sit down . The interviewer will pay attention to everything from your manner to your outfit choice . You can create a great impression during the introductory stage of the interview . Your first opportunity to create a great impression is when you tell the group about yourself . <p> Be confident , maintain eye contact , and speak in a clear voice your body language speaks volumes . And highlight your individuality . If you need to list your greatest achievement , do n't say something that most of the other candidates have achieved as well like finishing high school . Instead , you might want to say something about an issue that has significance for you , for example , climate change and how you joined the local tree-planting club as your way of making a difference . <p> By the time the group interviews and role-playing starts , interviewers often have a list of candidates that they are most interested in . <h> What is involved in role-playing , group activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your teamwork and problem-solving skills . Usually , the games demand cooperation within the team and this should lead to some heated debating . <p> Get involved and be genuine by saying what you think . If the group is heading towards a decision you do n't agree with , state your opposition . Give a reason rather than just objecting . Overall , however , remember to support the group by not being overly pushy . <p> Role-playing is an impromptu test to see how well you can perform under pressure . It is used to test your natural ability and flair . In retail and sales positions , it 's very common to be asked to sell an item to the interviewer or to one of your fellow applicants . <p> To prepare for role-playing , you can do some exercises , or practise with a friend . If you do n't think you can manage role-playing , you might need to reconsider whether you want to apply for the job . You might need to give a short speech explaining why you are the best applicant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is your opportunity to say more about yourself and cover anything you have n't discussed so far . <p> You can make sure you stand out by connecting with the interviewer , whether it 's with humour or something else like your winning smile . You do n't need to be the best public speaker in the room but standing tall , having a relaxed facial expression and keeping the tone of your voice even will all help . <h> What about general knowledge tests ? <p> Each interview process is different and there will be things that throw you off course . There might be a psychometric , mathematical , or English test . It is difficult to prepare for these although there are psychometric tests on the Internet you can use to practise . It can also be useful to ask about the tests before you go to the interview . <p> You might be asked to answer some industry-specific questions so make sure you research key aspects of the industry or the latest market enterprise by the company . Do n't rely on simply browsing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , if you are having difficulty or if there is conflicting information , do n't hesitate to call a representative of the company to get an answer . <h> Find ways to succeed <p> Succeeding in a group interview is a fine balance between showing creative individuality , and looking like a bossy , aggressive nutter . You need to find the balance between vocally steering the ideas of your group and cooperating with and listening to others . If you come across as a loudmouth , bossy boots , or worse , an annoying know-it-all , in all probability you 'll be one of the first to be sidelined . <p> While making sure that you are remembered is the first step , you can go further . The simplest way to develop rapport is through your confidence . When you are in a room full of nervous people , a firm handshake , a smile and eye contact can often make the most lasting impression . 
@@71750469 @450469/ <p> This trend will create a global workforce that , according to future work experts like Lynda Gratton , will have profound impacts on the way we work. Itll mean continual growth in global outsourcing , enabling companies to figure out who their essential people are and simply outsource the rest , a Vistage White Paper reports . <h> Middle-skilled jobs are disappearing <p> The labour force is experiencing unprecedented polarisation , as we continue to lose middle-skilled jobs to outsourcing . Gratton says : <p> The past few years have been marked by the hollowing out of work By which I mean that the middle-skilled jobs traditionally taken on by graduates have been outsourced leaving only low-skilled jobs or high-skilled jobs. <p> It means the only jobs left will be complex ones , and low-skilled jobs that need to be carried out by someone on location . <h> Humans need not apply : robots make jobs redundant <p> Contributing to this loss of middle-skilled jobs is the fact that automation technology is growing at a rapid pace , leading experts to predict robots will be replacing us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study conducted by Oxford academics , Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne , within the next two decades , a staggering 47 per cent of jobs will be made redundant thanks to computerisation . <p> MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson and co-author of the book , The Second Machine Age , points out that technology has always been destroying jobs and has always been creating jobs , since the first machine age. But , as he tells the ABC , the problem is today its happening at a scale and speed that 's much greater than before. <p> These days there are machines that can do a multitude of things that were unthinkable a decade ago , from self-driving cars through to machines that can answer legal questions or make medical diagnoses . <p> According to Frey and Osbornes findings , the jobs most immune to automation are the ones that involve caring for others , persuasion and negotiation skills , social perceptiveness as well as fine arts and originality . <h> 2 .

What this is doing is also increasing the age at which Australians can retire . <h> Were working longer <p> Between 2004 and 2005 , the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) found that the average age of retirement was 58 years for men and 47 years for women . <p> But in 2008-2013 , this rose drastically to sit between 61.5 - 63.3 years for men , and 59.6 years for women . And its only set to get worse . Within the 45+ age bracket , almost two-thirds of people intend to retire at over 65 years of age , while 17 per cent expect to work til they are 70 or older . <p> So what does this mean ? With a greater percentage of older people needing to remain working for longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emerge . <h> Talkin bout my generation <p> The numbers do n't  lie , writes director of Future Casting , Brian David Johnson , for an Intel report on the future of Australia . We know we will have a lot of young people and people with grey hair . They are going to be spread all over the world and not evenly distributed. <p> Currently there are five generations in the workforce : <p> Traditionalists ( born mid 1920s 1945 ) <p> Baby Boomers ( born 1946 early 1960s ) <p> Generation X ( born early 1960s early 1980s ) <p> Generation Y ( born early 1980s mid 1990s ) <p> Generation Z ( born mid 1990s present ) <p> And each of them turn up to work each day with their own distinct set of values , priorities and expectations . This can only be a good thing , right ? Well , for the economy , yes . <p> ' When women entered the workforce in the 1960s and ' 70s demand for child-care workers took off , the prepared-foods industry boomed . And unemployment rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of older workers can be the salve for one of the worst types of economic poison inflation. <p> But for HR managers and organisations , catering to the diverse needs and career expectations of five distinctly different cohorts is proving to be problematic . At the Centre for Workplace Leaderships 2014 Future of Work conference , Gratton pointed out this emerging trend .

Work that 's about productivity and flexibility , not just showing up <p> As Gen X take the reigns , and millennials flood the jobs market , were going to see a strong cultural shift in the workplace thatll embrace flexibility and turn traditional ideas of work upside down . <p> In the Safeguarding the Future of Digital Australia in 2025 report , Chief Privacy Officer of McAfee , Michelle Dennedy , says : <p> Employers have tried to judge performance on now meaningless correlations of check in and check out times in the office .

As Gandel points out , flexibility is no longer a favour to be handed out like candy at a childrens birthday party ; its a compelling business strategy. And here 's the kicker . <p> When companies give employees freedom , they 're happier . And when workers are happy , productivity skyrockets . Gandel cites examples such as the American company Best Buy , who implemented a system called ROWE resulted-only work environment and found that productivity , in some cases , shot up by 40 per cent . <p> Experts are already pointing to the myriad of ways companies can increase productivity and foster a more cohesive and collaborative work environment .

Many are expected to continue to work well into their sixties and are currently interested in changing , rather than ending , their careers . <p> There are many stereotypes surrounding mature age workers they are expensive , difficult to manage , wont learn new skills , resist change and are n't  up to date with new technology .

They enjoy freedom and autonomy they work to live rather than live to work , which is often frowned upon as slack and difficult to manage by the Boomers , who prefer to do the long hours . A flexible workplace is a must for a Gen X-er and they value constructive feedback which both need to be taken into consideration when managing Gen X. <p> Gen X-ers are seen to be in the best position in the job market at the moment as they are set to step up to the plate and fill the leadership roles when the boomers retire .

' <p> Tandeep is a consistently high-achiever . He was Dux of Homebush Boys High School and was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of New South Wales , but he fits plenty of other activities around his study including helping out at the Co-op Scholars Charitable Society at UNSW . He is currently studying for his Bachelor of Commerce . <h> What are you studying at university ? <p> I 'm studying a Bachelor of Commerce . It 's hard work but it 's a good course ! <h> How many hours per week do you study ? <p> My course requires 12 hours per week in classes , but , in addition to that , I definitely have to study outside of class time . Altogether I study more than 20 hours per week . <h> How and when did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I made the final decision to take this course once I received the course scholarship . Just before that , I wondered what university I should go to , what profession I should choose . When I got the scholarship , it kind of sealed the deal . <h> How did you know that you wanted to get into business studies ? <p> I wanted to get into business studies not only because I was good at it during school , but also because I 've always had an interest in that aspect of the professional world . <h> What courses did you take in high school that were relevant to your university studies ? <p> In high school , I was n't sure exactly what I wanted to do at uni , but I took some courses that I was interested in that became relevant to my degree . I did economics at school , which was really important because a lot of the subjects in the first year of my degree were related to that content . I also did ancient history , which is not directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allowed me to think outside the square . Also , English and maths were very important . <h> Did you research different kinds of careers ? <p> Yes , I did do some research . I looked into law , engineering , medicine and science . I ended up choosing commerce because I gained a scholarship for it and because I know there will be opportunities for graduates in the industry in the future . <h> How did you go about your research ? <p> I looked on the Internet mostly . I went to university websites for their course outlines , what they required , assumed knowledge and their timetables . I also attended university open days and went to my school 's careers adviser , who was very helpful . He provided me with a lot of information which was tailored for me personally . He also gave me the Career FAQs books and they were pretty helpful . <h> Did you apply for other scholarships ? <p> Yes , I did . I applied for as many scholarships as I could throughout Year 12 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placement , so you have to go for a lot of them . <h> What do you have to do to be considered for a scholarship ? <p> A lot of people think that to get a scholarship , you have to be really smart and get the best possible marks , but in fact , you have to get good marks but also put in the hard work . A lot of it is the way you balance your extracurricular activities and school . You have to get out there in the community too , and take on responsibilities and leadership roles , and challenge yourself . <h> What does your scholarship give you ? <p> My scholarship provides $15 000 a year for four years . The $15 000 is given to me in fortnightly payments . The money comes straight to me so I decide what to do with it , but generally most people first pay off their uni fees and buy textbooks . Whatever 's remaining can be used on whatever I want . The scholarship also provides 18 months of industry training . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provides lots of networking opportunities . I 've met a lot of my friends at uni through the Co-op program they 're very good people . <h> What do you think the biggest difference is between high school and university ? <p> The biggest difference at university would have to be that no-one 's actually pushing you to complete your work , to do homework , to study it 's really individual-based . In high school , teachers are all on your side , trying to help you out . Here , lecturers and tutors do offer support for students and they have consultation times where you can go and see them , but it 's really a very different environment to high school . Another difference is that things move much faster at uni . In high school , you get a lot more time to do things , whereas in uni , you cover things you might do in a year or two at school in one semester . <h> What 's your typical week like at university ? <p> My time is broken up between lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to spend two hours in either a lecture or tutorial and I have a one-hour break . I use that break to get together with friends and to actually have a break , not study . <p> If I have an assignment due or a test on that day , I tend to do a bit of last minute cramming , but I usually use it to take a break because if I go the whole day without taking a break , then my brain tends to go numb and it 's much harder to concentrate . <h> What do you do in your spare time ? <p> In my spare time at home , I try to balance the amount of uni work I do with spending time with family , going out with friends and just relaxing at home . I 'm also a member of a few societies and if they have something on , I 'll go out and help them . <h> What kind of societies are you a member of ? <p> The main one that I 'm most active in is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charities through fundraising events . These activities develop personal skills as well as giving me the satisfaction of being able to give back to the community . <h> What do you plan to do after you graduate ? <p> After I graduate I will be working full time , most probably with one of the scholarship sponsor firms . I 'm also currently planning to undertake a graduate law degree part time . I 'm not sure how things will go , but that 's the plan for now . <h> Is there any particular specialist professional avenue you 'd like to pursue ? <p> With marketing , your specialty depends on where you actually work , but I 'd like to get into the side of marketing that 's not solely advertising . I 'm interested in the way businesses develop their products and organise and execute their marketing strategies . <h> Do you have any advice for secondary school students looking at university options ? <p> Do a lot of your own research to find the type of courses that would suit you best . Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really something that you want to do , because four years is a long time to be spending on something that you really have no interest in . <p> And ask around ; use your teachers , year advisers , careers advisers and principals to guide you . Also , do n't be deterred if you do n't get into the course you want . There are lots of pathways that you can use to get into uni.

Some of these are designed to boost your mark , while some will take factors other than your mark into consideration . <p> Choosing the best uni pathway for you is an important and sometimes complicated decision . Do n't  hesitate to talk to your school career counsellor or ring up and talk to the university about what 's on offer . <h> Keep trying <p> If at first you do n't  succeed wait for the second or third acceptance rounds .

EAS programs are designed to provide assistance to students who have faced educational disadvantage through their final years of high school . That may be a disability , living in a remote area , financial difficulties , or a death or illness in the family . <h> Fee paying courses <p> If you are prepared to cough up some cash to bridge the gap between the mark you have and the mark you need , full-fee paying courses ( rather than HECS ) could be your ticket to enrolment .

@@71750495 @450495/ <h> Keywords : The Secret To A Powerful Resume <p> In a world where resumes are usually sent in electronic form and often stored in databases , keywords are becoming an increasingly important tool that every job seeker should know about , and know how to use effectively . <h> What is a keyword ? <p> Keywords are specific words or phrases used in relation to a job role and a persons skills and experiences . They can be general , such as communication skills or consulting , but are often more specific to a particular role or industry , such as B2B communication or strategy management consulting . <p> Employers are becoming increasingly reliant on keywords to find appropriate job candidates apparently more than 80 per cent of resumes are searched for job-specific keywords . Keyword selection and placement in your resume , cover letter and LinkedIn profile can literally be the key to being found ( or not ) in a search . <p> Learning how to prepare a keyword-rich resume that makes the most of your skills and experiences will increase your chances of getting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose keywords for your resume <p> The best way to find relevant keywords is to scrutinise the job ad for the job you 're applying for , as well as other ads for similar roles . The job ad will reveal what skills , experiences , qualifications and other qualities they 're looking for , and it 's a good idea to mirror the language in the job description to show you 're a good match . Highlight each word or phrase that is specific or significant to the job and make a list of the most important ones . <p> Good sources of keyword ideas include online job ads , newspapers , company websites , trade magazines and books to see what keywords repeatedly come up in relation to a certain job role . Look for the words that appear early in a job ad or description , as they 're likely to be the most important ones . <p> Visit the websites of companies and other organisations in your field to see what the current buzzwords and lingo are . Read their mission statement and see if there are any important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read trade magazines , annual reports and relevant news articles to keep on top of what 's happening in your industry and how people talk about it . Joining online discussion groups and forums can also help you keep up-to-date and see how other professionals discuss industry issues . <p> Also ask recruiters , HR professionals and other contacts in the industry for keyword tips . <h> How to use keywords <p> When preparing your resume , use keywords liberally throughout but try to load them towards the beginning , especially in your Summary of Qualifications or Professional Profile . You can use these sections to give your keywords a more general context in relation to your overall professional profile . <p> When describing your previous roles and experiences , focus on functions , skills and responsibilities , job-specific terms or phrases , and industry terms . Be sure to spell out the type of services and products you dealt with in your previous work and the specific industry , rather than just the company name so that these terms can be searched by the computers search software . <p> Different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word to the job criteria/role . Keywords that are specific to a particular job or industry are weighted more heavily than more general keywords that could apply to many jobs and industries . While specific hard skills will be most valuable for keyword searches , more general soft skills , such as interpersonal and communication skills , teamwork or leadership , still have their place . <p> Its best to tie keywords to your accomplishments ones that use the skill represented by that keyword . For example , Directed and implemented the businesss social media strategy could be expanded to Directed and implemented the businesss social media strategy , resulting in the introduction of social media protocols and the establishment of both internal and external community forums that helped to enhance feedback , responsiveness and cohesiveness. <p> Since you do n't  know exactly what form of a keyword will be searched , its also a good idea to use variations of similar words , such as manager and management , content management system and CMS , or business-to-business and B2B . <p> Do n't  forget that while your basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your resume , and the keywords you use in it , for every different job you apply for , according to the jobs specific requirements and criteria . <p> Do n't  forget to use keywords in your cover letter too . While cover letters are n't  generally searched for keywords , its still important to mirror the words and criteria as set out in the job description so the interviewer can see you 're a perfect fit . It also shows that you 've read the job ad with care and have tailored your application to the job rather than just sending out a generic version . In other words , theyll be able to tell that you have taken the time and effort and really want the job . <h> Keywords in action <p> An effective resume includes strong action verbs , and keywords should be tied to these when describing your previous roles and achievements . <p> Here are some examples of action verbs combined with actions that would act as effective keywords ( in bold ) : <p> When using keywords , there is always a balance to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keywords in your resume but it still has to flow , make sense and grab the readers interest rather than just being a random collection of keywords strung together willy-nilly . And whatever you do , stay honest do n't  list skills and terms that you know are good keywords unless they are a true reflection of your background and experiences . <p> If you 've posted your resume online or on LinkedIn , do n't  forget to sprinkle it liberally with keywords too . You never know who may be searching online and come calling !

@@71750513 @450513/ <h> Choosing A Career Path : Passion Or Pragmatism ? <p> Are you one of those people who 's always known what you want to do when you grow up like become a doctor , policeman or vet ? Whose childhood passion for writing stories or playing with Lego naturally and inevitably led to a career in journalism or industrial engineering ? Well if that 's you , count yourself amongst the lucky few . <p> For the rest of us , figuring out what to do with our lives can be a confusing business . There are so many options and so many considerations do you follow your heart and choose a career based on your passions and interests , or do you follow your head and choose a practical job that offers great career and salary prospects ? <p> Passion and pragmatism are not mutually exclusive , of course , but sometimes it does come down to a difficult choice . Choosing the path of creative fulfilment and pursuing your dream of becoming the next Cate Blanchett or great Australian novelist can involve risk and sacrifice just ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedian Wil Anderson , who understands these sacrifices well . The first year I did stand-up I made $4000 , and the second year I made $6000 . I was making less than the dole so it was n't a glorious existence at that point . I never saw a movie that was n't on a Tuesday , ate a lot of two-minute noodles and drank a lot of cheap wine , but I do n't think I 've ever had more fun. <h> Part-time passion <p> Some people are happy to indulge their passions in their leisure time , while maintaining a day job to keep the income rolling in . <p> Michael has worked in the banking industry for many years while indulging his passion for writing during his leisure time . Now , however , he is at the point where he is ready to give up his day job entirely so he can write full time but that is a luxury afforded by his years of hard work in the financial sector . <p> I now feel I want to devote solid time to my writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just a hobby . My thinking now is that you have to follow your passion when it comes to careers , and now I have the means to be able to give more attention and focus to it , says Michael . <h> Following your bliss <p> Let 's face it if you decide to pursue a career you do n't  enjoy simply because of practical considerations or parental expectations , you 're setting yourself up for future unhappiness or a mid-career crisis . <p> Wil Anderson knows this well too . I ended up doing journalism at university because it seemed like a good way to still be involved with writing and , unlike comedy , it also seemed like something you could actually do as a job . I did that for three years and absolutely hated every minute of it . I was very successful at it , but none of that success brought me any happiness so I thought maybe I should do something that made me happy , whether I was successful at it or not. <p> Passion usually breeds success , but following your bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as creating contingency plans . <p> This is a process actor and comedian Glenn Robbins , aka Kel Knight from Kath and Kim , had to work through as well : I was working at an insurance company when I realised I seriously wanted to pursue acting as a career . I remember being in the office and looking around at all the people who had been there for about 10 years and they did n't look very happy . It 's good that I worked in that industry for a while because it made me realise what I really wanted to do , which was to act. <p> So being the conservative person that I am , I enrolled in a drama teaching course at Melbourne State College . This meant that I could pursue acting but would also have a career in teaching to fall back on in case it did n't work out , says Robbins . <h> Choosing a career path <p> If you 're trying to figure out what career path to take , you have a few things to consider . First of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are your interests , strengths and values , and what are you really good at ? Knowing your personal brand will help you evaluate what would be most important to you in a job would it be having creativity or autonomy , or opportunities to travel ? <p> Now brainstorm jobs that could be related to the things on your list and enlist the aid of family and friends to help you come up with ideas . <p> Try to find out as much as you can about the jobs and industries that interest you research online and at libraries , read related news and trade magazines , talk to your family , contacts and industry professionals , attend career and trade fairs , and keep an eye on job advertisements for job descriptions . Consider working part-time , or as an intern or volunteer to get a better idea of what 's involved and whether you 'd like to pursue this as a career . <p> In addition to your own level of interest , the factors you will need to weigh up will include what the job market is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work-life balance , location , and whether you will need to move or travel . You also need to find out if you will need specific qualifications to nab the job of your dreams . You could also consider talking to a career counsellor or coach for extra guidance . <p> Think large , and think laterally . You do n't have to stick to the tried-and-true paths of accounting , business or law . If your true passion is health or you 've always really wanted to be a teacher or web developer , then figure out what qualifications you need , and go for it ! <p> Sometimes the only way to find out if you like a job is simply to give it a go but be prepared to move on if you find its not the right one for you . After all , most people change career paths three to five times during their lifetime , so changing your professional direction is not unusual and can make for an interesting and stimulating journey . <p> Gabrielle Gawne-Kelnar was working as a successful photographer before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gabrielles advice to anyone considering career paths is to ask yourself : What is it that you 're seeking ? Get really clear on your vision and just be really brave in looking at all the possible alternatives that might enable you to achieve your vision . Courage is key just try something out and you 'll see that it can really work. <h> How did you choose your career path ? Was your decision based on passion or pragmatism ?

' <p> You might have seen Flight Lieutenant James Lister at Queensland 's Government House dressed in his military uniform complete with ceremonial sword , snacking on scones and drinking champagne . He is the aide-de-camp ( ADC ) to Ms Quentin Bryce AC , the Governor of Queensland ; a position that requires him to meet and greet the VIPs who relax in the luxurious dining areas of Government House . <p> Throughout the Commonwealth , ADCs are drawn from the ranks of the military to serve under the Queen 's representatives as well as the top echelons of the judiciary and military .

As an ADC you 're in a conspicuous armed forces role so you need excellent presentation as well . <p> I joined the air force in 2000 and four years later I was appointed to the role of ADC to the Governor-General .

I still have to stay fit , be highly organised and have great teamwork skills . The major difference in this role is there 's greater emphasis on the ceremonial side of military service . <h> What are your most memorable experiences ? <p> I once marched into the chamber of Legislative Assembly with my sword and uniform on to deliver a message to the Speaker of the Queensland Parliament . As I was leaving , the politicians suddenly started jeering and hooting at me . I heard one of them say : ' he 's better than the last one ' , and another called out , ' yeah , he can come back ' .

One day , I might meet with the Chief Justice over a glass of champagne at Government House , and the next , I might travel to a remote community to have scones and tea with the locals . It 's fantastic ! It 's a great experience to travel and to learn about community organisations and the work they do . <h> What makes your work difficult ? <p> The time frames are very tight .

I wo n't be attending the Government House receptions and dinners , meeting the top people in the state . It 's an end to the travel , buzz and pomp and ceremony that surrounds the Governor .

@@71750531 @450531/ <h> Troublesome Co-workers : How To Deal With Difficult People <p> You can choose your friends , but you ca n't choose your colleagues . It is inevitable that you will come across the workmate from hell ( WFH ) at some stage in your working life . Even if the WFH napalms your every idea , takes credit for your moments of brilliance and then bitches about you as soon as your back is turned , there are strategies that you can employ to keep your sanity and your job . <p> The office can be like a school playground sometimes , so it 's important to be able to negotiate your way to professional success and sanity . One of the first steps in dealing with difficult people is to understand their devilish nature , so you can take up defensive arms and beat them at their own game . <h> The bully <p> Stealing your lunch money has been replaced with stealing your clients . Flushing your head down the toilet translates into accidentally spilling red wine on your pristine white shirt at the Christmas party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will leave a doughnut on your desk before you start work each day . <h> Coping with the bully <p> Bullies usually feed off reactions , so curb your emotions and try not to let it show that they are getting to you . Avoid confrontation , but if you 're in the right you should stand your ground . Workplace bullies are often cowards , so do n't be afraid to voice your concerns to your boss or an HR professional ( particularly if it 's your boss that 's doing the bullying ) . If things still do n't improve , you might consider finding another job . Either that , or get promoted into a position where they have two options : give up their bullying ways or get out . <h> The credit thief <p> These smooth operators were the kids who would go through your bag , copy your homework and then get free lollies at the canteen because of their hard work . These days they are after big bonuses or an early promotion . <h> Coping with the credit thief <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , you may have to step up security on what you are doing . If you have a brilliant idea , keep it under tight lock and key until you have unveiled it to the boss . Make sure your boss , and no-one else , has regular updates of what projects you are working on . <h> The know-it-all <p> Sure knowing stuff is a positive thing , in fact its usually beneficial to doing a job , but some knowledge is best left to a friendly game of trivial pursuit . Two heads are better than one and if no-one else can get a word in at meetings because the self-proclaimed office Einstein is always showing off and sticking their hand up first , the fresh and original ideas may never get a chance to be expressed . <h> Coping with the know-it-all <p> Rolling your eyes and biting your tongue might be the only tactic you can use against this annoying piece of work . It wont necessarily calm down their know-it-all ways , but it may soothe your nerves . If you want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each person at the meeting gets to have a go . During general office time , you might suggest some quiet time . If all else fails , plug in the earphones and pretend to be preoccupied with your iPod . <h> The stress head <p> Hyperventilation , sweaty palms , raised voices and panicky body movements may trick the office stress head into thinking they are being productive , but it usually just gets the whole office on edge and grinds all actual productivity to an abrupt standstill . <h> Coping with the stress head <p> The best way to deal with this convulsing mess of nerves is to stay cool , calm and collected yourself . Stress breeds stress , and the last thing the stress head needs is you feeding their fervent and fretful energy with hyperactive levels of your own . If they bark requests at you , just respond calmly and do n't play into their little game of getting everyone to freak out with them . Alternatively , sit them down and get them to breathe into a paper bag it 's a proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss , they are sweet as pie , but turn your back for a moment and they 're ploughing into you with staples , scissors or any other sharp office implement they can find . Metaphorically of course , but it still hurts the workplace vibe when everyone but the backstabber feels they ca n't leave the office for fear of being verbally knifed in the back . <h> Coping with the backstabber <p> De-clawing this catty colleague may take a bit of snaky manipulation of your own . It also takes a collective group effort . One-sided bitching is like a one-person conversation it definitely takes two to talk trash . Set the example by standing up to this blade-tongued colleague next time they start slicing into one of your co-workers and before you know it they will have no-one left to bitch about . Keeping your back to the wall at all times may be the only other way to prevent blood spilling on the office floor from this knife-wielding wacko . <h> The hermit <p> The resident office hermit is by far the least offensive on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the office cubicle well before the rest of the team arrive , and silently tap away the day without so much as a glance towards any of their office co-inhabitants . It 's not so much what they do , but rather what they do n't do they do n't contribute to the workplace banter , do n't discuss what they are working on and do n't get involved . All they seem to do is add unnecessary dullness to the workplace . <h> Coping with the hermit <p> It is most likely that the office hermit is just shy so getting them to come out of their shell might be all there is to it . Ignoring them will only make things worse , so include , invite , embrace . Entice them out of their shell and into the swing of office life . They may not be up to attending all the office shindigs in the beginning , but pulling them out of the wallpaper camouflage is a start . <h> The office gossip <p> There is no denying that workplaces are hotbeds for steamy gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the boss has got one eye on business and the other on the new receptionist , and if two staff members were spotted slinging insults at each other in the cafeteria then there 's no wonder it 's providing solid fodder for lunchtime chitchat . But there is a very important line between harmless office gossip and gossip-mongering that fuels malicious rumours . <h> Coping with the office gossip <p> Generally it is best not to buy into office politics and gossip no matter how juicy ! Usually because it 's not true and also because if you play the sordid secret squirrels game , you 'll be fair game if there are things you want to keep under wraps yourself . <h> The teacher 's pet <p> This upwardly mobile career ladder climber is the equivalent to the much-hated social climber . They dedicate a significant proportion of their talent and energy to getting ahead and they do n't care how they do it . These unscrupulous suck ups will do anything to get a better job title , a gold-plated name plaque on their office door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair or your job . <h> Coping with the teacher 's pet <p> There is nothing wrong with ambition but if you are working with someone who is using dubious tactics to get to the top , you may need to fight fire with fire . No , this does n't mean using the same dubious tactics . Make sure your own work is above and beyond what they are doing and you 'll be the one reaping career rewards in no time . <h> The jaded colleague <p> This is the person who has been sitting at their desk well past their career use-by date . They have lost all enthusiasm for their work , and like a leech they will inevitably suck out all your passion for your job too . The highlight of their day is packing up and walking out the door . Until then , they 'll stare blankly at the computer screen , paint their nails , and waste both their time and yours . <h> Coping with the jaded colleague <p> Move desks , move offices , move to the next state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative rays of this washed-up colleague . Your mother was n't lying when she said you only get out of something what you put into it and it 's exactly the same in the workplace . Maintain your enthusiasm and approach your job with vigour , then reap the rewards of promotion which is another way to escape before you become jaded too . <h> The distracter <p> This person means well , but they can prove to be the most destructive to your work . They pop up consistently throughout the day and hang around making idle chitchat about nothing at all for long periods of time . They are the ones who never grew out of primary school percussion improvisation sessions their phone volume , as well as their personal volume , is stuck on monotonous loud . <h> Coping with the distracter <p> You have to nip this one in the bud early before they program you into their radar and target you every time they have the itch to gabble on endlessly . You can try telling them politely but firmly that you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is nothing . <p> Try a distracting tactic yourself . Look out the window and say something like ' My God , what the hell is that ? ' and as they peer out into the void , take off fast and , whatever you do , do n't look back .

@@71750536 @450536/ <h> 8 Sure Ways To Give The Resume Performance Of A Lifetime <p> Its a given that applying for a job means selling yourself , but the reality is that it just does n't  come naturally to most of us . Hell , most of us struggle to take compliments , let alone give ourselves a whole list of them and then , if were lucky , discuss them at length with potential colleagues . <p> At Career FAQs , we 've been offering career advice for over a decade , and we have our assessment of resumes and cover letters down to a fine art . When I 'm looking at those few pages of someones working life I often put them through what I like to call the movie test , which is to ask : if this were a movie , would I understand the point and would I keep watching ? <p> Think about it . Selling yourself is similar to putting on a performance and if karaoke is on the cards then some of us will run a mile while others will need help wresting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill of the spotlight or the safety of shadows , the key to a killer job application performance is clear : you need to think of your audience . <h> 1 . Spend time on your establishing shot <p> We all know the one . The lone horseman in the barren landscape , the extreme-long view of a cityscape , all backed by rousing orchestras slowly prodding our emotions awake . <p> If you set the tone right from the start , the audience wont be able to help coming along for the ride . Leading off with a one-paragraph professional profile or summary gives you the opportunity to introduce your voice . Agonise over this one because if you can distil your experience and achievements down into one killer sentence or two you will have them hooked . <h> 2 . Stick to the genre <p> Your resume should suit the industry you 're working in you would n't follow a horror plotline for a Disney movie so do n't  focus on your incredible IT skills if you 're applying for a customer service role . Also understand what your genre calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your amazing tale or do you also need a portfolio ? Article samples ? Website links ? Choose the storytelling method that allows you to put your best foot forward . <p> Every genre has its structure and I could n't tell you how many resumes we see that are in the wrong order . Act 1 should be your professional profile , followed by either your qualifications ( if recent ) or your most recent job , through to earlier positions in reverse chronological order , then technical skills and volunteer roles . You should be making things as easy as possible for your audience so follow the framework that recruiters understand and that means clearly separating your responsibilities from your achievements for each job . You want them to digest your information without any effort , just like a well-oiled rom-com. <h> 3 . Workshop your script <p> This performance is about you getting a job . Recruiters do n't  need to know if you 're married , how old you are or whether you like baking on the weekends . Unless you 're volunteering , stick to the main story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be strong in order to communicate your potential . If your grammar is off , your spelling is dodgy then your audience will turn off quicker than they walked out of Gigli . And using American spelling would be like Toni Collette acting in Muriels Wedding with a dodgy American accent its just plain wrong . And do n't  be afraid to ask a mentor , friend or family member to workshop it with you ; they may know your strengths better than you do and pick up the things you 've missed . <h> 4 . Design your set carefully <p> If your set is a mess then your audience wont know where to look . They need to be able to move smoothly from scene to scene ( section to section , job to job ) and know where they are in the story at all times . Break each section up with a simple heading and do n't  try to cram too much in . Choose a font that 's readable on most programs ( Cambria , Times , Calibri ) and stick to it . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ templates . You can simply bold your section titles and use empty space to make each point sing . <p> Know when to exit stage left . Courtesy mediabistro.com. <h> 5 . Do n't hog the spotlight <p> Most recruiters simply wont read much more than two pages so slip on your director shades and start cutting to key scenes . If you have included too much unnecessary information you will just take away from the key elements . <p> When choosing what to include you really have to look at your story arc . Have you shown progression through your roles ? Have you kept it punchy with dynamic , active words to describe your experiences and responsibilities , rather than just listing them ? <h> 6 . Define your character <p> One thing I often find is that people are good at listing what theyve done , but they struggle to define their strengths . Unfortunately there is nothing more boring to an audience than a one-dimensional character that does n't  have any reason to change . When recruiters are looking at your story , they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond Rocky moments like making profits , developing new systems or dealing with more responsibility . <p> Just like a good biopic , you need to write in the first person . And if you think you do n't  have anything extraordinary to say , think again . It can be hard to visualise everything you have achieved in your career so if you 're stuck for ideas , take a look at other job ads to see what recruiters are looking for and check out some of your industry peers on LinkedIn . You 'll soon realise you have kicked some goals along the way . <p> Your biography also needs to make sense . There should be no gaps in years that are left unexplained . Time should always look as productive as possible , which brings me to my next tip . <h> 7 . Do n't stick to the same old gags <p> If you do n't  tailor your cover letter and resume to answer the ad , then you have n't thought about your audience . Focusing on your IT skills when they have emphasised customer service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bikie bar it might be superb , but its not what they want to hear . <p> One of the best things you can do is show that you 've thought about the job not only what they 've asked for , but the company and anything else that might be an asset to them . This is an audition , after all . Look carefully at the ad and use keywords at just the right moments but remember you need to show , not just tell . Give specifics , make them measurable and do n't  just include one-line assertions such as successful sales manager without backing yourself up . The best resumes deliver clear punchlines. <h> 8 . It 's ok to make a song and dance <p> Still got stage fright ? Shake it off by writing a list of all the tasks you do in your current job , or have done previously . Then go back and write down all the skills you needed to get those tasks done , keeping the selection criteria in mind . Once you 've got a bucketload of skills written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at work and what results you were able to achieve . <p> Work through this methodically and you should start to get a picture of yourself as a developing character doing some great things . Remember , potential employers actually want you to perform for them , so do n't  be shy . And if you 've started daydreaming about who might play you in your own telemovie , then you 're only a step away from needing that acceptance speech . Break a leg !

@@71750547 @450547/ <h> Disability not a disadvantage in the workplace <p> When looking to fill vacant positions , businesses want to hire the best possible candidate . Often this means that people with disability are overlooked in favour of those who may appear to be more fit and able . Stereotypical but erroneous beliefs can mean employers miss out on a valuable pool of resources and experience especially when you consider that one in five Australians has a disability . <p> Basic assumptions are made often unconsciously about what a person with disability can or can not do . However , research has shown that there is little difference in the productivity between people with disability and those without . <h> The benefits <p> There are many benefits in choosing to hire people with disability . The Australian Network on Disability ( AND ) , an organisation that promotes the inclusion of people with disability in all aspects of business , encourages employers to tap in to the diverse range of skills , experiences and abilities of people with disability to gain new perspectives . <p> Organisations that understand the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Businesses that fail to make their products and services accessible to people with disability , or do n't  build their expertise in welcoming customers with disability , risk missing out on a great deal of business , says AND spokesperson Rachel Butler . <p> Hiring people with disability also helps businesses to embrace their corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) , promote a diverse workplace and raise team morale . <p> Safeway in Rosebud West , Victoria , is one of the many businesses leading by example and hiring people with disability through Disability WORKS Australia ( DWA ) , an organisation that helps to find placements for people with disability . <p> Assistant store manager Simone Blake says , We wanted to help someone with a disability in our local community . Employing somebody with a disability gives the whole team a lift and helps to positively change the store culture. <p> Apart from enhancing the reputation and brand of the business , employing people with disability can also have long-term fiscal benefits . According to a Safe Work Australia study , workers with disability have lower rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a result , lower workers compensation costs than people without disability . <p> AND has also stated that people with disability tend to stay loyal and committed to their employer and show higher retention rates than employees without disability . Increased tenure reduces the costs of training and integrating new staff into the business . <p> By accommodating people with disability organisations are gaining loyal and committed employees who will support them in achieving their business objectives , says Butler . <h> Its easier than you think <p> Common misconceptions are the biggest barrier that people with disability battle in attempting to gain employment . Employers often believe that the costs associated with hiring people with disability are high . More often than not only simple adjustments are required to make the business disability-friendly . <p> Many adjustments are cost-neutral while research has identified that where costs are incurred , around 80 per cent of those adjustments are under $500 , says Butler . <p> Research has even shown that many employers believe the benefits of hiring people with disability outweigh any associated costs . In some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come in all shapes and forms and while some disabilities may be obvious to the naked eye , many others are more discreet . <p> Another method of creating opportunities for people with disability includes job splitting or carving . This involves breaking off certain tasks from other positions that are hard to fill to create new roles for people with disability . <p> Holden Hill Police Station , South Australia , turned to DWA when they could n't find a permanent employee with transcript typing skills willing to perform the repetitive tasks of the position . <p> Administration manager Doris Andrew hired Sonja Veitinger , who was referred to her by DWA . Veitingers vision impairment meant that she could not fill the administration role so Andrew split the task of transcript typing from the general role and employed Veitinger on a part-time basis . <p> By being creative with the role were getting retention in this job , providing a solution to one area of skill shortage and proving to be more cost-effective , says Andrew . <p> Veitinger required computer program JAWS and a dual headset to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment of the workplace to identify and make any adjustments . <p> By investing in the right person you will reap the benefits . There is room in generic jobs to carve duties and provide opportunities for people with a disability as well as assisting businesses with areas of skill shortages , says Andrew . <h> Recruiting <p> There are many organisations dedicated to helping employers recruit people with disability . These organisations can help you to make any necessary adjustments to the workplace and can provide ongoing support . <p> The Australian Network on Disability ( AND ) is a not-for-profit organisation that promotes the employment of people with disability . AND works with employers to help them become disability confident and engage with people with disability as stakeholders , employees and customers . <p> Disability WORKS Australia ( DWA ) is a national body that facilitates the provision of employment for people with disability .

Leaving this field blank is simply wasting an opportunity to make a strong comment about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also wastes an opportunity . Think about the impact if you add a phrase that attracts the attention of the reader . For example , for a senior engineering position you could write Experienced engineer for Senior Project Engineer position . <h> Opening paragraph <p> It may be tempting just to write Attached please find my resume and cover letter for the advertised position which is fine and certainly wo n't go against you . However , writing something a little more attention grabbing will set you up as a real contender . You should make the reader really want to read your cover letter and resume . <p> The opening paragraph could say something about your achievements and link them to the position .

I would love to meet you to discuss the position and look forward to hearing from you. <h> Use keywords <p> Many resumes and cover letters are now stored in databases so using language relevant to that industry will help your application hit the right buttons and make sure it is easily retrievable . <h> A thank you is good manners <p> Thank the person for their time and consideration . <h> A last word or two about email cover letters <p> When you attach your documents resume , cover letter and any other documents requested by the company make sure that you name the documents with your name : lindsaysmithresume.pdf or lindsaysmithresume.doc . Do n't  forget that the recipient might have up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than re-naming these resumes , the person may be tempted to trash them immediately . <p> Sending files as pdfs will ensure the styles you have used will not corrupt . If you do send files in this format , let the reader know that you can send Word documents if this is preferred .

If you get off on the rush of creating content to tight deadlines , this could be the career for you . <p> One journalist who has learnt this first-hand is Helen Isbister , the Sky News reporter in Adelaide . Isbister was thrown in the deep end and had to quickly learn all the skills required to be a one-woman broadcasting show . I do all the on-air stuff , as well as my own camera work and producing . I cover everything from politics , sport and business to courts , police and entertainment . It 's a big brief , but I enjoy getting to follow the biggest stories of the day and having a lot of variety. <p> Its a perfect career for those who thrive under pressure , but you have to be tenacious . Bill Birtles , a radio journalist for Triple J , advises , First of all , you need to be really persistent just to get a solid job in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to write . Build up a portfolio of work ASAP if you 're at university that means start writing for student publications . Do anything that shows over time that you have a commitment to actually working in the industry and that you have an interest in current affairs . You need to build up a portfolio of work to make sure that people realise you are keen and ambitious. <p> Journalists also need to eat and breathe all things media . As journalist Mia Freedman observes , I think that to be involved in the media you 've got to be hungry for information , you 've got to be very curious . Ultimately , to work in media you 've got to be a very big consumer of media in all forms. <h> 2 . Marketing and advertising <p> Marketing and advertising careers are just as dynamic and diverse just ask Serge Costi , Assistant Brand Manager at Tip Top . I assist the senior brand manager with the planning and execution of Tip Top marketing plans . I am involved in new product development , product launches , advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like the hands-on nature of the job and being involved in so many different functions and activities. <p> Marketing careers are ever-evolving with the growth of new media and online opportunities . The world of advertising has also had to keep up with the times and provides a stimulating and fertile environment . <p> Well-known ad man Siimon Reynolds broke into the advertising world at a young age and was a creative director by the time he was 21 . According to Reynolds , effective advertising is always about good old-fashioned communication , regardless of technological change . Communication is always the same . Its still all about selling . Its like you 're sitting down with someone and you 're convincing them to buy your product , but in this case its in an online ad or a Twitter page . Youve just got to remember that no matter what medium you use , youve just got to be persuasive , you 've got to be liked , and you 've got to make sense. <p> Reynolds has seen people come and go and emphasises the importance of persistence to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard to master , and its hard to rise to the top . So at every level beginning , middle and senior you 've got to be up against yourself , practising , getting better . Be persistent , but be alert throughout your career , not just at the start , advises Reynolds . <h> 3 . Public relations <p> Want to follow in the Jimmy Choo-shaped footsteps of Sex and the Citys public relations expert Samantha Jones ? That would involve managing all manner of communication and public perception about organisations , people , products and specific issues by handling media , crafting positive messages , getting positive exposure and editorial coverage , and organising events . Its a fun and challenging career for extroverts who love research , writing , organising , problem-solving and public speaking . <p> Josh Meadows is media advisor at the Australian Conservation Foundation ( ACF ) and loves his fun and stimulating job . I track media developments to keep abreast of what 's being reported and what slant the stories are taking , write and disseminate materials such as media releases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organise events. <p> I 'm doing a job that 's stimulating , important and interesting . I 'm working on things I 'm passionate about , with a great bunch of people who are so enthusiastic about what they do . I 'm in no hurry to move on , says Meadows . <h> 4 . Publishing <p> Do you have an eye for detail and get excited by correct punctuation and a beautiful font ? A career in magazine or book publishing , online publishing or editing could be beckoning . <p> Amanda Evans is Development Editor at a large book publisher : I enjoy being involved with a book from the initial project research and proposal to management ; to then working with authors , editors and designers to shape the direction of the text ; to finally putting all the elements together in a final form . My favourite part of the job is seeing the finished book that is the culmination of the teams hard work . The excitement around the office when a book arrives fresh from the printers is incredible ! <p> Magazine publishing is a notoriously difficult industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot in the door is to do a stint of work experience something that all magazine editors recommend . If I could offer any advice to people trying to break into the industry , it would be to secure some sort of ongoing work experience . Even if it means working for free as an intern for 12 months , I have seen so many interns go from being the workie , to the person with a job in publishing , says Amanda Nicholls , Editor of Total Girl magazine . <p> The other universal recommendation from all magazine editors is to network and make the most of your contacts . Former Cosmopolitan Editor Mia Freedman says , So often jobs in the media are n't  advertised , they just go to whoevers around and whoevers a known quantity . That 's how I got my job and how a number of staff that I appointed got their jobs . Its because I met them when they were doing work experience at Cosmopolitan when I was editing. <p> Jana Frawley , National Food Editor at News Limited , confirms the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of word of mouth . My advice to anyone coming into the industry is to pull in any contact that you possibly have and nurture any contacts that you make . As you get a few years experience under your belt , your contacts recommend you , or let you know when jobs are coming up. <h> 5 . Technical writing <p> Technical writing is another area that those with a love of the written word and knowledge of a niche area can consider for a career . Its a form of writing or documentation used in fields as diverse as computer hardware and software , health , finance , biotechnology and law . As a technical writer , you could be writing software manuals , legal textbooks or financial reports basically writing in any specialty area for either a technical or non-technical audience . You do n't  necessarily have to be an expert to be a technical writer but you need to be able to understand and use technical language , and translate that into plain English . <p> Jo Chalmers completed a Masters in English Literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two loves to become a health writer for a large nutraceuticals company . I did two kinds of writing , some marketing material which was for consumers , and more technical writing for health practitioners . Both required lots of research and documentation but they gave me experience in writing for two different audiences , and that versatility is important for any writer. <h> What qualifications do you need ? <p> Formal training is n't an absolute necessity for a successful foray into communications , but its a competitive field so anything that will give you an edge will help . <p> According to journalist Helen Isbister , Formal qualifications are n't essential , but nearly everyone in the newsroom has them . It may be a degree in journalism , business , law or PR , just to name a few . Everybody follows their own path , but I think going to university is a great experience which will always be helpful in launching your career. <p> There are a plethora of communications courses in journalism , freelance writing , marketing , and publishing and editing on offer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groomed with the skills and know-how to be " work-ready " . Skills they will use include press release writing , market research , business planning , developing proposals , presenting , negotiation and even interview skills , says APMs David McDonald . <p> Amber Wilson studied freelance journalism through Open Colleges ( formerly known as Cengage Education ) by distance and is now working as a freelance writer . I had left a full-time job to have a baby now that I was a " stay-at-home mum " , I really wanted to find a way of turning my writing skills into profit . This was where the Freelance Journalism course became my new best friend . The tutorials were easy to follow , and being able to work at my own pace , I could study in between caring for my baby. <p> Perhaps the most useful information I learnt was the best way to approach publications and what to do to increase my chances of selling articles . As a result , a magazine accepted an article and another has been published online with the Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the confidence , says Wilson .

Be sure to wash your hands before and after eating , after you have used the loo , and after sneezing or coughing .

Regular use of antibacterial hand cleaners or wipes is also helpful . <h> Cover your mouth and nose <p> Flu germs can spread through droplets in the air , so cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze then throw the tissue out and wash your hands .

@@71750573 @450573/ <h> Job Interview Question And Answer : What 's Your Biggest Weakness ? <p> One of the most dreaded of all interview questions is the greatest weakness minefield . Many recruiters are , in fact , moving away from using a question that has become over-used and predictable , yet it is still one you have to prepare for . But how do you answer it without casting yourself in a negative light , while still sounding honest and self-aware ? Is it possible to provide an answer that does n't  sound like a rehearsed spiel or clichT ? <h> Be positive <p> Answering this question successfully is all about presenting yourself including your weaknesses in the most positive light , according to Steve Gunther , a consultant with boutique recruitment firm 2discover . <p> But this is not an exercise in spin-doctoring and obfuscation . This is your chance to demonstrate your honesty , self-awareness , and willingness to learn and improve . <p> While identifying a weakness or deficiency , emphasise that you are aware of the problem and actively working to improve . Answer with enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great attitude you have . For example , if you say that you sometimes have a tendency to procrastinate , be sure to emphasise that you are aware of the problem and have become an ardent planner and list-maker to keep yourself on schedule . Stress how much satisfaction you get from crossing things off your to-do list and getting things done on time , and how happy you are about the improvements you 've made . <h> Its all about perception <p> Remember , the same negative trait can be turned into a positive depending on how you present it . If you have a tendency to be overly meticulous and therefore sometimes take too long to complete tasks , you can highlight the fact that you like to see things done to the highest standard though you are getting better at letting things go and working more quickly now . ( Having said that , avoid the transparent ' I 'm a perfectionist ' humblebrag of an answer it comes across as immature at best , and disingenuous at worst . ) If you tend to be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as aloof , you can say that you are a little shy but once people get to know you , they soon see that you are loyal , discreet and a good listener . <h> Use examples <p> 2discovers Steve Gunther asserts the importance of using concrete examples from your past as illustration . Instead of speaking in loose generalities and hypotheticals , talk about your experiences and show how you have improved on your weaknesses in previous jobs . The more specific you can be , the better . <p> For example , you can tell the interviewer that you used to have a tendency to tardiness , but that once you started setting your alarm clock a half hour earlier and using your mobile phone to remind you of appointments , you have n't been late once in the last six months ! <h> Use common sense <p> Think about the key qualities required for the job and make sure that you demonstrate your strength in those areas and only cite weaknesses which are less crucial to the role . For example , if you are going for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to detail is a weakness whereas if you are going for a creative , big-picture type of role , then lacking attention to detail might not be such a big deal . <h> Demonstrate that your skills are transferable <p> If your obvious deficiency is a lack of experience in a similar role ( such as when you are changing career direction ) , Gunther advises you to find a link between your previous experience and the present role , showing that your skills can easily be transferred to a new context . Let 's say you come from a background in office administration and are pursuing an entry-level job in marketing and communications . If , in your previous job , you wrote and proofread newsletters and reports , and helped to contribute marketing ideas during staff meetings , then you have relevant experience that can be transferred to your new role . Stress that you are adaptable , and eager to learn and apply yourself to a new environment . <h> Use this as an opportunity to elicit more information <p> Gunther also suggests that you use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your supposed weakness can complement their business or team . For example , if you are someone who needs and likes structure , find out what their present systems are like . Do they operate like a well-oiled machine that you could easily slot into , or are they in dire need of a systems overhaul that you could help to implement ? If their structure is not compatible with your working style , this may not be the company for you and its better for everyone if you figure that out now . <h> Be honest <p> Keep in mind that your prospective employer will call your referees and ask about any weaknesses , so do n't  be caught out saying something untrue that will later call your honesty and integrity into question . Outright lies will usually come back to bite you - do n't risk it ! <h> Sample Answer <p> Here is an example of how to answer this question : <p> ' When I started off my career as a manager , I was terrible at delegating responsibility . I thought it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly learned that not only was I getting frustrated because I never had enough hours in the day , but my team was also stagnating because they were n't learning to do new things . I started off slowly by delegating smaller tasks to my team members , giving them clear instructions on what I expected , and providing feedback at the end . As a result , I freed up a lot of my time , and helped to grow my team members ' skills which in turn improved their motivation . While I still struggle to delegate some tasks , overall I 've become a lot better at delegating . ' 
@@71750574 @450574/ <h> Job interview question and answer : If you were a car , what type would you be ? <p> If you were a car , would you be a sleek and speedy Jaguar , a solid and dependable Volvo or a practical and fuel-efficient little Smart car ? <p> Your answer to this question should n't be guided by car envy or the latest model featured on Top Gear , but by the requirements of the job you 're applying for . If you 're going for a job in a fast-paced industry where speedy thinking is paramount , then it would be wise to liken yourself to a sports car of your choice . If image matters let 's say its a job in advertising go for something sleek and classy , maybe a Ferrari or an Aston Martin if you want to give off a James Bond vibe . <p> If , on the other hand , you 're applying for a job where reliability will be particularly valued , then you cant go past something like a Volvo or Lexus . Just make sure the car you choose has characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and industry you 're about to enter . For example , when you think of a Volvo , innovation and cool are not the first things that enter most peoples minds . That may not matter if you 're applying to be a tax auditor , but it may if you 're applying to be the newest member of a companys social media marketing team . <p> Similarly , if you 're applying for a position with a progressive company that prides itself on its innovative culture and environmental credentials , then why not say you 're a Smart car cutting-edge , compact and environmentally conscientious . You probably would n't want to say you 're a Rolls Royce or a big , fuel-guzzling 4WD . <p> A 4WD , however , might be appropriate if you want to project an image of ruggedness and an ability to handle all terrains like if you 're applying for a mining job in remote Western Australia , or any job requiring a bit of grunt and a willingness to get your hands dirty .

@@71750582 @450582/ <p> ' I started here as the works supervisor for the construction of parks and gardens about five months ago . ' <p> Melissa , 25 , was featured in Career FAQs Landscaping &amp; Horticulture during her fourth and final year of a horticulture apprenticeship at the City of Gosnells in Western Australia . <p> Since then , Melissa worked in a nursery for six months before going out to the country and working in the outdoorsy role of works/maintenance supervisor . <p> She has recently taken up a job at the Shire of Chittering where a whole new world of horticulture has opened up to her . <h> What are you doing in your current job ? <p> I started here as the works supervisor for the construction of parks and gardens about five months ago . It 's way more of an office job than what I have done previously . I go out and see the guys on site to see that everything is going to plan , but I spend more time in the office doing purchase orders , organising contractors and all that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseeing ? <p> Maintenance grading , potholes and signage in the town , and all the parks and ovals . We also have a few units that we look over in the way of lawns and gardens . We also do cemetery work . <h> What did you learn during your apprenticeship ? <p> Everything from turf , to parks and gardens , to mechanics . It was good because we got to change crews every few months and try our hand at everything they had to offer . I got a very broad range of experience doing that . There were n't many staff at Coolgardie , so you had to be on the ball with everything . <h> Once you finish an apprenticeship or traineeship what are the career opportunities like ? <p> The horticulture industry is pretty broad in terms of the number of different jobs you could be doing . Craig , the apprentice who appeared in the Career FAQs book with me , is still working at the City of Gosnells and has been offered to do the landscape design work . That 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go to someone so young . Because of a shortage of experienced people in horticulture at the moment , you can move into different areas quicker then ever before . <h> Are there jobs available in both the city and country ? <p> Yes . Usually the country offers a bit more incentive and a bit more money in order to get the qualified people out there . The promotion opportunities are better in the country and I think that 's what helped me get to where I am now . <h> What do you like most about your job ? <p> Seeing a job get finished and being able to create things . Coolgardie was great because I actually got to use my horticulture and design garden beds , parks and things like that . I prefer the hands-on work to what I do now , but it 's also good to see another side of the industry and get a bit more professional in what I 'm doing . <h> Are there any negative points ? <p> It 's hard work . In one way , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now as I did in my previous job , because it can be quite a strain on your body and you do get quite tired . I think the only other thing is that when you are an apprentice , you get low pay but I 'm sitting pretty good now so that kind of makes up for it . Also I enjoyed what I was doing so it was n't really a problem . <h> In your first Career FAQs interview , you said there were n't many women in the career . Is that changing ? <p> I think it is a little bit . You see a lot more women now , and you see a lot of women starting their own landscaping businesses so that 's really positive . When I first started with Coolgardie they were quite set in their ways and I think they found it hard to accept that a female was coming in as their boss . However , after about four months that settled down a bit . <h> What sort of person suits the career ? <p> Someone who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and think outside the square a little bit . You are always trying to look for different ways to design or make the job easier . They also have to be prepared to work hard because it can be very demanding . <h> Where do you see yourself going from here ? <p> I think I 'll be in this job for a long time because there are a lot of different things I still have to learn . Everything is new to me here because the job is very different from my last one .

@@71750585 @450585/ <h> 7 Ways To Maintain Your Networks <p> You befriended your boss on Facebook , you set up a LinkedIn profile and you followed all the relevant people on Twitter . You knew it would only be a matter of time before your networking genius landed you your dream job in a leading company . Now , what do you do with all those contacts you made along the way ? <p> Your contacts list could include people you used to work with , former bosses , business contacts you made on a job , your next-door neighbour , the brother of your best friend from primary school or randoms you met on the bus who work in your field . <p> Rather than throw away or forget about your little black book overflowing with names and numbers , maintaining your network of contacts could benefit your career down the track so here 's how to do it . <h> 1 . Keep a record of your network <p> Keeping an organised address book is essential . Store any business cards or contact details in an orderly fashion with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records of your last point of contact as well as any other personal information ( in a non-stalkerish manner ) such as family facts and likes and dislikes . Enquiring after little Bradys cello practice or Bruiser the dogs operation will show that you 've paid attention and actually care . Even remembering that they like two sugars in their morning chai latte will prove that you are not simply using them for their influence , position and power . Be careful , its a fine line between caring and creepy . <h> 2 . Use social media to stay in touch <p> It can be a little awkward getting in touch with a contact after years and years of silence . However , modern technology is helping to ease the gap with social media . Touching base every now and then through email , Facebook or LinkedIn can help you segue into asking them for a reference or a leg-up into the industry . This is where you can pull out your wealth of knowledge and impress them that you 've remembered they have two sons , five grandchildren , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only kidding . They hate Beyonce. <h> 3 . Contacts are not your friends <p> When it comes to networking , there 's are definitely rules of engagement and networking ' best practices ' . Treat your more distant , professional contacts professionally , which can be difficult when dealing with social media . Refrain from sending them inane Facebook quizzes or invitations to your Twilight fan club . If you 're prone to enjoying a Big Night Out or two , make sure that you change your privacy settings to block them from seeing any photos documenting just how much fun you had . <h> 4 . Catch up with the closer ones <p> If you 've had a relationship with a contact in the past , like going to school together or sharing a corner in your first job , it does n't  hurt to arrange a catch-up every now and then . Even if you only have coffee with them once or twice a year , your relationship will be much stronger for it . <h> 5 . Help them out <p> If someone in your network cries out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know anyone who could help them out ? Do you know of a job vacancy that they would be suited to ? Even if all you can offer is to keep an eye out for possibilities and proof their resume , they will appreciate it . Remember that relationships are a two-way street and it may be you asking for career help one day . <h> 6 . Surprises should be left for birthday parties <p> If you 're planning on applying for a new job , get in contact with your referees before you start your job hunt to make sure they are still fine with recommending you for employment . They wo n't enjoy having a phone call sprung on them without notice . And the last thing you want is your old boss getting confused between John the slacker and you , John the model employee . <h> 7 . Remember your pleases and thank yous <p> As your mother taught you , good manners will never go out of style . Thanking your contacts for any help they may have given is extremely important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@71750588 @450588/ <h> The etiquette of rejection <p> The Rolling Stones said it best : you cant always get what you want . When you go for a job interview but do n't  get the job , its always hard accepting the rejection but there 's an art to being gracious in defeat . <p> After any interview , always send an email or note to the interviewer thanking them for taking the time to see you . Do n't  harass them with calls or emails as you await their decision . <h> Thanks , but no thanks <p> If you find out that you 've been unsuccessful in getting a job , you still need to thank the company for considering you . You can also ask them to keep you in mind for any future positions that might open up . Its always important to leave a good impression and convey your professionalism , as you never know what might happen down the track or who else they might know in your industry . <p> Even if you do n't  get the job , if you impress them they may pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alternatively , give you a bad rap if you 've behaved poorly . Remember , its a small world and you cant afford to burn any bridges ! <p> Do n't  behave like one candidate we interviewed who , after being told the bad news over the phone , followed up with a long email detailing everything we should have done ( we should have called his referees , for example ) . He declared he was still the right person for the job and that we were making a mistake by not hiring him . His behaviour only confirmed our belief that he was n't the one for us and that wed definitely made the right decision ! <h> How to ask for feedback <p> When you are thanking the interviewer make sure you take the opportunity to ask for some feedback . Getting feedback from an unsuccessful interview can be both reassuring and helpful , pointing you to what areas or interviewing skills you can work on . Perhaps you gave a great interview but another candidate fit the bill more closely or had more experience , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feedback is invaluable and will help you in future interviews . <p> You can ask for feedback over the phone when you first hear of their decision , or follow up over email . If you are speaking over the phone then keep in mind that they will probably want to keep the discussion brief , so take all their comments on board and definitely do n't  argue against any of the points they make . In all your professional interactions , no matter what the outcome , you should be unfailingly polite , gracious and professional even , or especially , in the face of rejection . 
@@71750589 @450589/ <h> Hospitality industry needs qualified professionals <p> Australias tourism and hospitality industry may see a boost in the wake of Oprahs visit Down Under , but it cant afford to rest on its laurels . Skills shortages in the industry are rife , creating shortfalls in service and staffing that the country can ill afford . <p> The GFC , global pandemics and terrorist threats , combined with Australias geographical distance and strong dollar , have conspired to create a sharp decline in tourist numbers from traditional markets such as America and the UK . In this climate , Australias tourism and hospitality industry is being forced to raise its game to keep up with global standards . That means that the level of skills and qualifications for people working in the industry has to rise . <p> The tourism and hospitality industry is suffering severe skills shortages , and many of the half million employees working in tourism are unqualified , says Stuart Wiggins , deputy head of college at William Blue College of Hospitality Management . <p> Hospitality and tourism are " emerging professions " where historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal qualifications . Experience and enthusiasm were qualification enough in the past. <p> However , in an increasingly sophisticated and competitive global market , experience and enthusiasm are no longer enough at least not if you want to advance beyond entry level . Hotel groups and tourism operators now require staff with industry-recognised qualifications , especially for more senior positions . <p> The industry has a new wave of graduates ready to take entry-level jobs and gain experience ; however operators are still enduring skills shortages in more senior and specialised positions . Those with years of experience in the industry are often required to formalise their knowledge via management degrees and professional bodies to advance up the ladder , says Wiggins . <p> So what qualifications are necessary to work in hospitality these days ? The lower level qualifications certificates and diplomas generally cover entry level skills and knowledge but the higher qualifications , such as bachelors and masters degrees , focus more on the management and business skills necessary to be successful in what is the largest and fastest-growing industry in the world . Hospitality and tourism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its a business that is expected to continue growing and Wiggins foresees very positive employment prospects for those with the right qualifications . Our career management team always has industry partners trying to source staff for frontline positions in accommodation services , restaurants , bars , banqueting , events and kitchens . With the economy picking up again the demand is increasing. <p> The future for those in hospitality is looking rosy . A qualified hospitality manager will never be unemployed unless they want to be . The industry is growing faster than the supply of graduate managers and therefore the options are many , varied and global . Tourism and hospitality will continue to play a dynamic part in the ongoing global economy and will do so for many years to come , says Wiggins . <p> Baron Wills is a recent hospitality graduate who understands the value of formal qualifications . Having just completed the Bachelor of Business in Hospitality and Tourism Management at William Blue , Wills is now participating in the Colleges graduate placement program and gaining valuable industry experience by working as a manager-in-training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney . <p> I knew that personality was important in this industry , but having the right qualification was the essential factor if I wanted to pursue a successful career in hospitality management , says Wills . <p> Working at the Shangri-La over the past year has given me amazing on-the-job experience at the entry level . I 've moved around the hotel as a corporate management trainee , experiencing first-hand the daily challenges and rewards of each department . <p> We have a range of hospitality courses , including diplomas and bachelor degrees in hospitality management , from industry-recognised course providers . You can choose to study on campus or by distance just find the course that best meets your needs . <p> The International College of Management , Sydney ( ICMS ) is a leading business school offering internationally recognised degrees in hospitality management .

From what course you should study to how long an apprenticeship takes , we answer all your questions about how to become a qualified chef and how to succeed in Australias exciting food scene ! <p> So you 've decided you want to become a professional chef , but you have no idea where to start . All you know is you have a food dream and you want to make it happen ! <p> Whether your hearts set on opening Sydneys hottest banh mi truck , you dream of pushing molecular gastronomy to new heights or want to work at Noma under the masterful RenT Redzepi , becoming a chef requires lots of study , dedication and training in the culinary arts . <p> But if you have a passion for food and a knack for cooking with a bit of creative flair , you can begin working your way to the top of the food chain . <p> Here are the steps you need to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do work experience in a kitchen <p> Get yourself into a kitchen ASAP . <p> Why ? Because as legendary chef , Jacques PTpin , says you need to make sure you get into cooking for the right reasons. <p> In an interview with Munchies , PTpin says that his one piece of advice to young chefs is to first work in a restaurant . It does n't matter what you do , it could be working as a dishwasher , waiter or cook but the point is to ' get the taste and essence of that thing that may seem glorious from the outside . ' <p> ' After you 've been at it for a couple of months , you 'll realise whether its the love of your life or something you do n't  want to do at all . If it gratifies you , it makes you happy to cook for people , and it fills up your life , then go ahead. <p> So before you dive headfirst into becoming a chef , get a job as a kitchen hand or do some work experience to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cooking for fun and cooking for a living are two completely different beasts . Working in the hospitality industry means long hours , working most if not all weekends and even public holidays . You 'll essentially be working any time your family and friends are off the clock , so its important to get a feel for what sort of impact this will have on your work/life balance . <p> Here are some other questions you might want answered whilst you decide whether being a chef is the right career for you . <h> What are the work conditions like for chefs ? <p> Commercial kitchens are fast-paced and high-pressure work environments . Once service starts and the orders roll in , things happen very quickly and there 's little margin for error . It demands a lot of energy and focus , so spend some time in a commercial kitchen to make sure this is the sort of workplace you 'll thrive in . <p> Thankfully most chefs agree that the militant-style kitchen has largely disappeared , but commercial kitchens do have a hierarchy and clear chain of command that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kitchen might not be the best place for you . <h> How much do chefs make ? <p> This depends on how much where you work and your level of seniority in a kitchen . According to the latest stats from PayScale , this is the salary range for chefs in Australia : <p> Kitchen Chef : $36,916 - $57,885 <p> Sous Chef : $42,638 - $64,184 <p> Head Chef : $45,120 - $77,122 <p> Executive Chef : $48,246 - $108,804 <h> What does it take to succeed as a chef ? <p> Seasoned chefs all agree that if you want to succeed you need a strong work ethic and an almost obsessive love for food . here 's some advice from the worlds leading chefs : <p> You need to immerse yourself totally in the world of food ; everything else takes a back seat -- Tom Colicchio , Topchef host and James Beard winner <p> You 're better off peeling potatoes at a great kitchen than working saucier at a really mediocre place -- David Chang , owner of Momofuko <p> In order to make delicious food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a palate capable of discerning good and bad -- Jiro Ono , sushi master and Japanese national treasure <h> Step 2 . Apply for an apprenticeship with a TAFE or private college <p> Technically there are n't  any specific qualifications you need to hold to work as a chef ( Heston Blumenthal for instance is completely self-taught ! ) , however as a trades-based profession in Australia , it is common for chefs to complete an apprenticeship and gain a vocational qualification such as a Certificate III in Commercial Cookery ( SIT30813 ) or higher at the end of their training . <p> There are different qualifications and apprenticeship opportunities depending on what type of chef you want to become : <p> Here are answers to all the questions you might have about completing an apprenticeship . <h> How do you qualify for a chef apprenticeship ? <p> To qualify to begin your apprenticeship you need to have completed your Year 10 School Certificate . Check with your local TAFE or careers adviser as the requirements may vary for different states and territories . <p> Culinary schools or specialised colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these institutes are highly regarded in the world of culinary arts and have excellent campuses to facilitate your learning . Like TAFE courses , culinary schools also require a combination of practical industry placement and class work . Entry requirements and costs of these courses may vary , so do your research before making your final decision . <h> What equipment do you need to complete your apprenticeship ? <p> Like a hairdresser needs scissors , a painter needs a paintbrush and a builder needs a hammer , a chef also needs the tools of the trade . Particularly when you 're learning , its important to have good quality equipment . Most schools and colleges will require you to purchase the folllowing equipment : <p> Chef 's knives <p> Chef 's whites or a uniform specified by your TAFE or college . This may include a chef jacket , trousers , apron , hat and hair net <p> Comfortable , covered and protected shoes <p> Make sure you give your college a call and ask what the estimated cost will be for the equipment before you enrol in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hit with a big bill the first week of class ! <h> Step 3 . Work as a chef apprentice while you gain your qualification <p> In Australia , it takes approximately 3 years to complete your training and make the transition from apprentice to qualified chef . This training is usually made up of working four days a week in a restaurant and one day attending class at TAFE or college . <p> Many apprentice chefs work in the same restaurant for the full three years of their apprenticeships . However , it is commonplace to move from restaurant to restaurant to gain more experience cooking in different environments and to gain exposure to different cuisines , styles of cooking and flavour profiles . <h> What does a chef apprentice do ? <p> As an apprentice chef , you will have a variety of jobs that may include : <p> Assisting with menu planning <p> Ordering food supplies and equipment <p> Preparing and cooking food <p> Plating and garnishing <p> Cleaning <p> You will have a lot to learn as an apprentice , so it 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all areas of the kitchen . <h> Do you get paid for being a chef apprentice ? <p> Yes , as a chef apprentice in Australia you will earn an apprentices wage . Chef apprenticeships usually last 3 years and the hourly pay rate increases as you progress through your apprenticeship . It also varies according to factors such your age , where you work , and what award you 're contracted under . <p> For instance , according to Australias Fairwork Pay Calculator , a first year apprentice who is under 21 years of age and working full-time will earn $11.34 per hour , and $430.82 per week under the Restaurant Industry Award 2010 ( MA000119 ) . <p> Penalties for working on weekends , public holidays and late at night ( after 10pm-midnight ) and early in the morning ( midnight to 7am ) also apply . <h> Step 4 . Gain your qualification and specialise <p> After three years as an apprentice , you 'll graduate with a nationally recognised certificate or diploma and be ready to work as a qualified professional chef ! <p> Where you take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen to explore the future of sustainable , or perhaps you want to specialise in Asian cuisine and learn the art of pulled noodles whatever it is , the end of your apprenticeship marks an opportunity to hone your craft ! <h> Step 5 .

If you decide to move on , job hunting as a chef will involve : <p> Chefs are also needed across a number of different industries and workplaces , so do n't  limit yourself to finding work in a restaurant or cafT .

With a whopping 88 per cent of Australian household Internet users conducting some form of e-commerce in 2011 , online marketing is , without a doubt , the new marketing frontier . <p> And then there 's social media . With one in every nine human beings on the planet on Facebook and 2.9 million hours spent on YouTube each month , social media has mushroomed to completely transform the way in which consumers are engaged and target demographics reached . Its an exciting and transformative time in the marketing world , and you could be right in the thick of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever <p> But its not just social media . Mobile computing and apps , online advertising , search engine optimisation , RSS feeds , online press releases , blogs , email marketing , viral marketing , affiliate marketing , branding all these form part of the marketing landscape in 2012 . This means organisations not only have new markets but a new set of avenues through which messages can be delivered to consumers which means that on top of being creative , you will have to get your head around how to exploit all the available media and technologies . It certainly makes for a more eclectic approach than the old days of billboards , radio and TV ads ! <p> These are exciting times , with almost limitless possibilities . The challenges , and the rewards , have never been greater . <h> You get to connect with loads of people <p> At its core , marketing is about getting your message through to people and convincing them to buy your product or service . Marketing requires constant communication with people and , as a marketer , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , you need to really know people and understand what makes them tick . An account manager needs to be able to get along with clients ; a market researcher needs to anticipate what target audiences might want ; a public relations pro needs to know how audiences will respond to news . To be a truly effective marketer , you need to be able to put yourself in someone elses shoes and understand how they think and feel . <p> Marketing work also involves working in teams to develop and nurture creative ideas for a campaign , so it helps if you 're a people person . If you love collaborating with others , a marketing career could be just what you 're after . <h> There are good opportunities for progression <p> There are two main areas for marketers : the client side and the agency side . The client side involves working in the marketing department of a business , non-profit organisation or public sector department . Agency work means working for a business ( agency ) that provides advertising and marketing services to other businesses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in client services , you might be a marketing assistant helping out with different entry level tasks . The next rung up might be to become a marketing coordinator , and if yours is a company that sells a product , youve also got product designers and managers . Above that you 've generally got the department head honchos : marketing managers and directors . <p> On the agency side , there are multiple opportunities in project management , public relations and market research , with a range of levels of progression . There are also media buyers and account management roles for those with strong management , negotiation and financial skills . <p> If you 've got the talent and drive , there are plenty of opportunities for both frontline and behind-the-scenes roles . <h> Its vital to business and all industries need it <p> Marketing is used by virtually every organisation , both commercial and public , and the quality of that marketing often determines a businesss success or failure . Whether its a financial institution , fashion retailer , government department , e-business or charity organisation each needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of sell . <p> By applying your marketing nous in whatever field or industry interests you , you can be a key player in driving the success of any business . <h> Its one of the most creative industries out there <p> Marketing messages need to be constantly refreshed , renewed and transformed in order to cut through the noise of competing messages . You have to continually work at new ways to approach a problem and think outside the square , and there 's no place for complacency . Few jobs hinge on creativity and innovation the way marketing does . <p> You can apply your creativity in all sorts of ways from developing big-picture marketing strategies to the details of what text and images to use . <p> And when it all clicks when a campaign gets a massive response and transforms a businesss fortunes just ask any account or product manager how that feels .

Administrators are involved at all levels of an organisation , from receptionists and data entry clerks right up to office managers and executive assistants who act as the 2IC to CEOs and managing directors . <p> According to French mining engineer Henri Fayol , who developed a general theory of business administration , administrative practice can be segmented into five elements : planning , organising , staffing , directing , controlling and budgeting . <p> The staffing element relates to human resources , which includes recruiting and inducting staff , maintaining a safe workplace , industrial relations , and ensuring that workplace relationships are positive and constructive . <p> The planning , organising and controlling elements lie at the core of every administrative role .

@@71750638 @450638/ <h> A different kind of hay fever <p> With spring upon us , plenty of people are rediscovering their green thumbs . But as you tend to the small veggie patch in the back corner of your garden , consider those who look after a much bigger veggie patch like 4600 hectares of it ! <p> Agriculture is a broad industry that encompasses more than most people realise . From food to fibres and fuels to raw materials , its an industry that literally keeps us going . Its also subject to the cruel vagaries that Mother Nature conjures up , although fields such as agronomy help to minimise risk and maximise harvest . <p> I spoke to Rohan Brill , a Research and Development Agronomist for the NSW Department of Primary Industries in Wagga Wagga , about why he chose a career in agriculture . <h> Did you always want a career in agriculture and why ? <p> I always enjoyed the science side of farming but I struggled with much of the mundane jobs involved with farming such as shearing , going up and back on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture after leaving school I enjoyed the challenge of it , that success is really up to you and not anyone else . The mundane jobs I now view as an essential part of the job and they also give me time to think . <h> Why did you choose agronomy specifically ? <p> Agronomy is a good blend of science and practicality and it allows me to work in a field I 'm interested in , especially since I still have the goal of expanding the family farm , and I 'm always keen to learn . I 'm lucky that while I work full-time in agronomy I still have the family farm , which keeps me in touch with the risk management decisions that farmers need to make and enables me to evaluate the usefulness of my work . <h> How did your university experience shape your career aspirations ? <p> The main thing I learnt was how to find things out . I learnt the value of evidence in driving decision-making and now use that in my job . There are so many fads and gimmicks in agriculture , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to what is a sales pitch or a trend . This ability to filter and apply information and learn from experience really sorts people out . <h> What do you find the most rewarding part of your job ? <p> I like conducting research and development that leads to grower adoption and an improved practice in the farming community . For example , in my previous job at Coonamble I conducted research on the early sowing of faba beans . Growers took this research on board , which has led to more yield and more money being made from faba beans in the region . As an extra bonus there are also environmental benefits . Faba beans host bacteria that make nitrogen in the air available to the plant , so much less fertiliser is required . The development of these types of crops is crucial for farming sustainability . <h> What do you find the most challenging part of your job ? <p> One of the issues is the amount of driving I do . In 2012 I did about 70,000 km total in a vehicle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also struggle with some of the protocols and systems in my work for example , it takes a lot of time to scope and apply for research funding for projects , then at the end of a project it can be hard to measure its success , which may take a longer time to assess but funding bodies need to see positive measured outcomes from their investment . <h> Do you have a good worklife balance ? <p> My job is very flexible in terms of hours . I 'm more than happy to work long days when required , then balance that out with some time off in down time . In winter I like heading to the northern hemisphere summer , which gives me time to completely switch off from my job and the farm for a few weeks at a time . I spend time working on the family farm on the weekends and do a lot of planning while exercising . I find exercise to be great for productivity and more can be achieved in fewer hours when you 're fit and healthy . <h> Does your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a great working knowledge of the back roads of NSW . I also get to travel interstate for conferences and study tours , where a lot can be learnt from different farming systems . I have just recently returned from a fascinating trip to Kazakhstan , where I spoke on crop diversification . The Kazakhs had a thirst for information and I was glad I was able to help them out , but it was n't just a one-way flow of information . I was able to gain a lot of knowledge from a vastly different production and social system . <h> What is your best advice for people looking to get into agronomy ? <p> My best advice would be to learn how to find things out . Do n't  lose sleep over how much knowledge or experience you have at a young age because that will gradually come with time . The more I learn in agronomy , the more I realise that I need and want to learn . <p> If you 're looking for a rewarding career in agriculture , see our range of online courses .

@@71750657 @450657/ <h> Kissing Your Job Goodbye : How Do I Quit ? <p> Leaving a job can be just as hard as leaving a relationship . Knowing when to cut your losses and start anew is instinctive for some , but for others it 's a slow , painful and drawn out process . <p> Packing up your desk and striking out for fresh terrain might be a scary experience , but the pay-offs can be enormous . The most important thing to remember is that , if you do decide to make the break , you 'll need to go through a process of negotiation so that both parties can minimise animosity and tension . <h> To leave or not to leave <p> As with relationships , most of us stick around in a job long after we know we should . Its familiar , its comfortable and sometimes its just easier to stay . Even if all the signs point towards the exit , we continue to drag ourselves through the daily grind , pretending that everything is just fine . <p> So how do you answer the all-important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Writing a list of pros and cons can often sort out mixed emotions and help when people are making decisions about their love life . Why not do the same with your job ? It will help you decide whether to stay or go and will save your work colleagues from sitting through hours of listening to your grievances . Remember , working relationships have expiry dates as well . <h> Excuses for staying <p> Often we stay in relationships ( personal and professional ) because of fear fear that we wont find something or someone else , fear that no-one else will want us , and sometimes fear of not knowing what will happen next . Other times we stay because we 've invested time in the relationship and do n't  want to go through the hassle of starting all over again . We know all the little nuances of the job how everyone at work likes their coffee , how to use the quirky filing system , and what all those in-house acronyms mean . <p> This is where the question of the old and familiar versus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exciting opportunities , which give you a new lease of life . Current relationships , like current jobs , may be familiar , but if it is n't working then maybe it is time to be brave , overcome your fear , and make a move . <h> SOS relationship therapy <p> Like relationships of the heart , working relationships are a two-way street . But what happens when we reach a crossroad or even hit a dead end ? <p> Before you consider ending the relationship completely , you might want to pull over and get some therapy . First step talk it over . Sit down with your boss , discuss your concerns and talk things through you might be surprised ; he or she may really want to keep you and might even look at ways you can both improve your work situation . If your relationship with your boss is on shaky ground , you can always call in the career advice experts human resources ( HR ) to mediate discussions between you and your boss . <h> Saying goodbye <p> Once we 've made the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible is what most of us aim to do . But what do we say to our soon to be ex-boss at the end of a working relationship ? Awkwardness and uncomfortable stand-offs can become the norm in work break-ups just as in relationship break-ups . <p> Telling your boss that he or she is an inconsiderate , insensitive imbecile is neither helpful nor professional . Making a dramatic exit may be tempting but burning your bridges will only hurt your career in the long run . So forget the idea of sending a text message or leaving a post-it note stuck to your bosss computer . While it may be easier to do this , such goodbyes wont help your chances of getting a future job reference . <p> When it comes to making an announcement of your departure , avoid the temptation to spread the news around the office before you have informed the boss . Organising a time to speak with your boss about your decision is better than abruptly announcing it as he or she is rushing out of the office . <p> A face-to-face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand is a simple and stylish way of saying goodbye . No matter how bad your relationship has become , your boss will appreciate that you have been honest . Furthermore , it is professional and your employer will have a good lasting impression of you no matter what difficulties you 've had in the past . People do n't  remember how you started but they sure remember how you left . And while you 're at it , its a nice gesture to leave your contact details in case your employer has any questions about the work you were doing before you left . <p> While there may be 50 ways to leave your lover , there really is just one right way to kiss your job goodbye !

The minimum standing varies according to which country the student is from . IELTS results are valid for two years . <h> Do all international students need to sit the IELTS test for study in Australia ? <p> No . If students went to an international school overseas or if their education was in English , the equivalent of their higher school certificate result will determine their entry into university in Australia .

They are used by employers to help assess a candidates suitability for a particular job and usually consist of an ability/aptitude test and a personality questionnaire . <p> Organisations such as information technology companies , financial institutions , management consultancies , the public service , police forces , fire services and the armed forces are particularly likely to use this sort of test to help screen candidates , although many other types of companies also use them . <p> Online testing is becoming increasingly common and used at earlier stages for initial screening , to help filter out unsuitable candidates and find those who will be asked to come in for an interview . <p> Having to do a psychometric test can feel daunting , especially if you 've never done one before . The best thing you can do is familiarise yourself with the process so you 're as well prepared as you can be . here 's the heads-up on what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test <p> Aptitude and ability tests assess logical reasoning , thinking abilities and competencies . They can consist of verbal reasoning , numerical reasoning , abstract reasoning and perhaps spatial or mechanical ability , depending on the type of job you are going for . They consist of multiple choice questions which you are required to answer in a limited amount of time typically 30 minutes to answer around 30 questions . <p> Verbal ability <p> Verbal reasoning tests measure your ability to understand word-based concepts , understand analogies , find common elements among different concepts and manipulate ideas on an abstract level . They typically include things like spelling , grammar , sentence completion and comprehension , and following detailed written instructions . <p> Most employers place high importance on verbal competency since so many jobs require good communication skills . <p> Numerical ability <p> Numerical reasoning tests include things like basic arithmetic ( addition , subtraction , multiplication and division ) , number sequences and simple mathematics ( percentages , powers , fractions , etc ) . If you are going for a management-type role , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers will want to see some indication of your ability to use numbers even if the job does n't  require lots of number-crunching , but do n't  worry you do n't  need advanced mathematical skills to succeed . <p> Abstract reasoning <p> Abstract reasoning is your ability to perceive relationships , discern the underlying logic of a pattern and assimilate new information . It is thought to be a good indicator of a persons fluid intelligence and ability to learn , so is considered an important part of most aptitude tests . Abstract ability is particularly important for jobs involving problem-solving , complex data , developing strategies or requiring initiative . <p> Abstract reasoning tests usually require you to recognise patterns and similarities between different shapes and figures . <p> Spatial ability <p> Spatial reasoning is your ability to visualise and manipulate two-dimensional or three-dimensional shapes or patterns . Its usually only included on tests for jobs that specifically require good spatial skills . <p> Spatial ability tests often involve the visual assembly and disassembly of objects that have been rotated or which are viewed from different angles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical and mechanical principles things like levers , pulleys , gears , springs and simple circuits . They are usually used for technical and engineering-type jobs , as well as the military , police forces and fire services . Questions tend to be industry-specific . <p> Personality test <p> Personality tests , such as the free online Career Personality Test , assess your behavioural style in an attempt to determine whether your personality is the right fit for the job as well as the culture of the organisation . They attempt to gauge things like how you relate to others , how you deal with your emotions , how you handle stress , your general working style , and even things like integrity , honesty and predisposition to anger . <p> When it comes to personality tests , its best to be yourself and be honest . There are no right or wrong answers on a personality test ! Trying to second-guess what the employer is looking for may backfire , and there 's no point in getting a job for which you are not well-suited and which you therefore wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to prepare for psychometric tests since they test your innate abilities and personality , but there are still things you can do to prepare . It pays to do some practice tests beforehand to familiarise yourself with the kinds of questions to expect , especially since that will make you feel more confident and relaxed on the day . If you 're feeling rusty on your maths or reading comprehension skills , do some review and practice questions to get your skills back up to speed . There are a multitude of websites , such as www.shldirect.com , which offer practice tests so get online and get started ! <p> Katie Smith , Executive Assistant at SEEK Employment , had to do a psychometric test as part of the interview process at SEEK and offers this insight : <p> It was a little bit daunting , but it was fine because there 's obviously an element of abstract reasoning , so you cant really prepare for it you just go in there and do your best . With the personality test , that 's just a matter of being totally honest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're looking for . You just have to be honest and hope that you 're the sort of person they 're looking for for that particular role. <p> Check out the Career FAQs Career Personality Test to help you find careers that suit your temperament and traits .

Here are the 10 highest paying jobs in Australia that do n't  require a degree . From working in ICT to taking on a management position , you 'd be surprised at the variety of jobs that pay well and value experience and technical skills far more than whether or not you went to university . <p> Were told that the best ( and most conventional ) route to a successful and highly paid job starts with a university degree . Greater education = greater skills = greater career prospects . Right ? <p> Not necessarily . <p> With academic inflation on the rise , degrees mean far less these days and companies are taking note . <p> Digital goliath Google , for one , has a hiring policy that focuses less on shiny degrees and more on hands-on experience . <p> ' One of the things we 've seen from all our data crunching is that GPAs are worthless as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Google 's former senior vice president , Laszlo Bock said in an interview with The New York Times . <p> Bock does n't say that education is worthless , but he 's concerned that academic environments do n't mimic the real world .

' <p> When you look at people who do n't  go to school and make their way in the world , those are exceptional human beings , ' Bock continues and explains that Google no longer asks for college transcripts or GPAs because ' We found they do n't predict anything . ' <p> While having a degree under your belt certainly does n't  hurt , you neednt be academically inclined to earn a six-figure salary . <p> Here are the top 10 highest paying jobs in Australia that wont have you swimming in HECS debt or locked in a lecture theatre for four years : <h> 1 .

It 's also one that pays handsomely , with SEEK data putting the average salary of construction managers at $123,504 per annum. <h> 2 . Air Transport Professionals <p> Navigating the skies as a commercial pilot or air transport professional might not require a degree but does take serious commitment and skill . <p> The Civil Aviation Safety Authority strictly regulates the industry here in Australia and requires that you pass a series of examinations and clock at least 200 hours of flying experience before you can obtain your Commercial Pilots Licence ( CPL ) . <p> To fly as a pilot in command of a multi-crew aircraft , you 'll need an Air Transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more arduous process and requires passing a series of exams in subjects such as air law , meteorology , and aerodynamics and clocking at least 1500 flying hours . <p> Potential salary range : $56k-$285k <h> 3 .

@@71750689 @450689/ <h> Starting university - what to expect <p> Regardless of whether you 're 18 and going to university straight from high school or you 're 29 and wanting to gain a qualification , starting uni for the first time can be tough . Wandering around an unknown campus , adjusting to lectures and tutorials , making new friends , learning new things , juggling your finances , all whilst trying to get a degree to advance your career it can get a little overwhelming . Its a lot to take in , but most people do it wonderfully and come out of it having had one of the best experiences of their lives . <p> Here is some advice on how to minimise your pre-uni jitters by being prepared , feeling confident and knowing what to expect . <h> Orientation week <p> Orientation week , or O-week , is a great way to begin your uni life . Its held a week before classes start ( sometimes two weeks ) and involves a number of social activities and events designed to welcome and orient new students to uni life . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet people , receive information about the uni , get a feel for the campus and just have some fun . <p> At O-week you can expect anything from sporting events , tours of the campus , markets , games , workshops , lectures and often large-scale events with famous bands . Oh , and not to mention lots of drinking and partying ! <p> Look on O-week as a once-in-a-lifetime experience . Not only will it help you familiarise yourself with the campus that you will be spending most of your time at for the next few years , it will also be lots of fun and leave you with many fab memories . Just do n't  party too hard and wreck yourself for the first day of classes ! <h> Making new friends <p> Uni is not like high school . Nor is it like your hometown community , or even like your workplace . At uni , you will mix with people from all walks of life . There will be young and old , people from different countries and cultures . You will meet students from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabilities , or that cant speak much English . Everyone is there to learn and grow . Be ready to accept people and branch out of your comfort zone . <p> Its a good idea to try to make a friend in each class you have . This way , you will always have someone to discuss study with and someone to take notes for you if you happen to miss class ! You will most likely have to do a group project at some point in your uni career and this is also a good time to make a few mates , as well as practise working in a team . <p> Likewise , societies , clubs and sport teams are a great way to build some friendships and develop your teamwork skills . Pick something you like or something you 're interested in , and just go for it . Societies and clubs are a voluntary thing so if you do n't  like it , you can always drop out . <h> Lectures and tutorials <p> Depending on your course at university , classes are usually made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre and may have hundreds of people attending them . Because of this , there is not much interaction in lectures themselves you are just one student in a sea of bodies . It is basically just a lecturer doing exactly that lecturing , for a couple of hours . Its important to attend as most of the work gets covered here . <p> Tutorials , on the other hand , will be more face-to-face learning and will give you a chance to ask questions , do some activities and group work , and go over everything you covered in the lecture . There are generally around 20 to 30 students in a tutorial . Each class will probably have one lecture and one tutorial per week ; however , learning at uni can come in a variety of different forms , such as online learning or laboratory work , depending on your course . <h> Teachers and learning <p> At uni , you 're in charge of your own learning . If you miss a lecture or do n't  turn up to your tutorial , no one will care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you receive your marks at the end of semester ! <p> For the teachers at uni , teaching is only a very small part of their job . They have plenty of more important things to do , such as administration and research , publishing articles and books , supervising students doing their PhD , and sitting on various committees and boards . Teachers at uni wont be chasing you to do your homework like they did at high school its up to you to show interest and they will impart you with their knowledge . You are responsible for everything from enrolling in classes before the cut-off date , to knowing when you have tests or assessments due . This is about taking responsibility for yourself , without anyone to hold your hand . <p> Elle , a student at Southern Cross University , recently found out how different uni and high school really are : In high school you are pretty much spoon-fed the information , at uni they make you do the research and extract the information yourself , says Elle . It took me a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new study pattern that would be appropriate to the amount of work I had to keep up with . It helped to have a good set of friends that I could meet up with for study dates and share ideas about assessment tasks. <p> There is a great table outlining the main differences between high school and university check it out here . <p> The key is to be prepared and manage your studies and time wisely . Record everything in your diary at the start of semester and always refer back to it . Friends also come in handy at this time as you can remind each other of when things are due . Learning independently can take some time to get used to , but once you do , the lessons will see you through the rest of your life .

@@71750701 @450701/ <h> Perfect the art of psychometric tests <p> Thanks to your carefully polished resume and cover letter , you 've been shortlisted for that dream job . Now it 's time to jump another hurdle on the path to your new role . <p> Psychometric tests are on the rise , with more than 70 per cent of large Australian firms now using the assessments in the preliminary weeding-out process . So it 's in your best career interests to understand how they work and what you can do to blitz them . <p> The good news is you do n't need to get freaked out by the terminology . Despite its connotations , psychometric does n't mean you will be lying on a couch being poked and prodded by a stern-looking psychologist . They 're not there to unlock your deepest , darkest secrets and release the skeletons from your closet ; they just want to know if you are the right fit for the job on offer . <p> The bad news is there is n't much you can do to ace a psychometric test you either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That said , there are a number of things you can do to put yourself in peak performance condition . <h> Understanding the tests <p> The nature of psychometric tests can vary , but basically they come in two different streams . Firstly , you will be screened for things such as numeracy , literacy , abstract reasoning and information checking . The results of these aptitude tests will verify whether you are intellectually capable of doing the job . <p> Then there 's the personality test . This will aim to find out whether you are the right fit for the company and assess factors such as honesty , sociability and conscientiousness . It will give the potential employer an insight into how you might cope with stress , whether you are a team player or an independent worker , if you have problem-solving abilities , and whether or not you are ambitious . <p> While the test is n't the be-all and end-all of whether you are offered a position , combined with more traditional employment criteria it will allow the employer to delve beneath the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Be aware that the timing of the tests may differ from company to company ; some give the test to applicants before the interview stages and others give a more in-depth test to help decide between several interviewees . <h> Preparing for the tests <p> While you ca n't study the exact content of aptitude or psychometric tests , there are measures you can take to prepare for the big day . Learn as much as you can about the test session beforehand structure and content , how long it will last , and whether you 're allowed to use a calculator so you know what to expect when you 're in the hot seat . Many organisations and career services provide sample questionnaires , so try to get hold of some of these so you can familiarise yourself with the layout and practise pacing yourself . <h> Practice <p> While practice ca n't make perfect for psychometric testing , it will pay off if you can approach it with confidence . Work on improving your logic and reasoning skills by solving word games , brainteasers , crosswords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading and look up words you do n't understand . Giving your mind regular mental workouts like this will also help you to think more quickly when you 're up against the clock . <p> As for the personality component , unless you book yourself in for a session with Dr Phil there 's probably not much you can do to make over your personality and iron out any quirks before the big day . However you can get into the right frame of mind to respond to the test . <h> Get your brain in peak performance mode <p> Make sure you are well rested and nourished on the day of the test so that you are in the best mindset possible . Avoid a sugary breakfast or you could crash and burn during the test . If you feel tired , hung-over or plagued by personal problems during the test it could affect your performance . If you go in with a good attitude , brimming with confidence and a can-do attitude there is a very good chance that this will be reflected in your answers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose as you 'll be more concentrated and focused .

Most tests ask similar questions repeatedly but in different formats so it will be hard to maintain consistency if you are not sticking to the truth . Many tests also have inbuilt lie scales that will test you against the norm and come up with alarm bells if you answer extremely or inconsistently . Honesty is the best policy . Answer truthfully and quickly without attempting to second-guess the employer and without giving the responses you think they are looking for . Just think , if you go to great efforts to lie you might just end up in a job you are totally unsuited for and hate !

This resulted from a combination of strong fiscal stimuli and the recovery in commodity exports . <p> Australias stimulus package focused on five key areas : social assistance for targeted groups , supporting consumption through support for homebuyers , infrastructure spending , skills , training and job-search assistance , and the Fair Work Act of 2009 . <p> It has been estimated that without the implementation of these measures , growth would have contracted by 1.3 per cent between 2008 and 2009 . Instead , the fiscal stimuli helped to support household spending and public consumption , which in turn helped to stimulate growth . <h> Flexible arrangements save jobs <p> Australias relative economic resilience was not due entirely to fiscal stimuli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report 2009 , Australias combination of a swift economic response , targeted labour market programs and adaptable employment practices by industry helped to support employment and minimise job losses . <p> During the financial downturn many Australian businesses adopted changes in working arrangements , such as reduced hours and job sharing , to ensure that job losses were kept to a minimum . <p> Jason Clare , Parliamentary Secretary for Employment , commented on the key role that businesses played in minimising the damage . Business also deserves a lot of credit for their actions during the downturn . Many have gone to great lengths to keep their staff on , moving staff to flexible working arrangements like part-time work , he said in a speech in October . <p> A good example of this is Broens Industries . Broens is a high-tech engineering company based in Ingleburn in Western Sydney . They have revenue of about $25 million and employ about 200 staff. <p> I caught up with the Managing Director of Broens , Carlos Broen , a couple of months ago . He told me that in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reducing staff , or reducing their hours of work . He chose the latter , and has been able to keep his entire workforce on working four days a week , said Clare . <h> The future of Australias workforce <p> However , while Australia has emerged from the GFC relatively unscathed in comparison to most other countries , the ILO report warns that premature withdrawal of public stimulus initiatives could lead to a slowdown in growth and loss of 100 000 jobs . Businesses can not afford to revert too readily to their old ways . <p> Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chief Executive Peter Anderson says : The ILO report is a timely reminder of the critical role Australian business has played , in conjunction with policies of past and present Australian governments , in building a strong labour market and contributing to the wellbeing of our society through employment , even in the midst of a global recession. <p> Although Australia 's unemployment rate stacks up well compared to other industrialised nations , the report suggests there is no room for complacency given our economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as strong external demand for commodities and increased domestic consumption that was aided by largely expended public stimulus , says Anderson . <p> Certainly organisations which have demonstrated flexibility and innovation during the downturn will reap the rewards , with their teams largely intact .

@@71750714 @450714/ <h> Job Interview Question And Answer : How Do You Handle Criticism ? <p> This interview question might seem like a tricky one to answer because it ultimately boils down to admitting that you are a mere mortal who has flaws . ( And before you even think about claiming that you 've never had to handle criticism , that 's a terrible idea because you risk appearing arrogant , out of touch and lacking in self-awareness . ) <p> However , this seemingly tough interview question is a fairly straightforward one to navigate if you think it through . It 's designed to understand your response to constructive feedback do you get defensive or upset ? Are you quick to assign blame ? Here are a few examples of how to best approach your answer : <h> ' I try to see criticism as an opportunity to improve my work ' <p> Constructive criticism is an important part of professional growth , and this is a good chance to show your potential employer that you are open to improvement , and striving to do better . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are happy to put your ego aside and act upon feedback and advice . Explain that you think that criticism is an important agent of change , and you are open to receiving feedback from your peers , superiors and subordinates in order to further your growth and development . <h> ' I decide whether the criticism is valid or not ' <p> Criticism is n't necessarily a synonym for the cold hard truth . When you come up against a less-than-rave review about your work , you have the right to judge it on its own merits . In your answer , you should explain to the interviewer that in you would accept the criticism when given , thank the person for their feedback and take some time to consider it . After weighing up the evidence , you would decide whether or not you are making the correct decision . Criticism can spring from a person 's doubt about your abilities , jealousy of your success or pure vindictiveness so depending on the situation , you may need to stand strong and be confident in your abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go against the grain and defy public opinion , and your answer should demonstrate that you are abe to separate the wheat from the chaff . <h> ' It depends on whether the criticism is from a colleague , a client or my boss ' <p> Criticism from a client is a completely different kettle of fish to that from a colleague . It 's important to make this distinction , since handling criticism from clients and carrying out effective damage control could be a core component of the job on offer . If you are going for a job as a waiter , for example , the interviewer wants to know how you would handle a cranky customer , or if you are applying for a job as an airline check-in agent , how you would diffuse the situation if flights were delayed . <p> Explain to the interviewer that you would approach the criticism differently depending on its source . For a customer , you could say that your primary goal would be to listen to and empathise with their complaint , and then try to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would hear them out and try and ask questions to understand the situation completely , so you can improve . For your boss , you would proactively solicit feedback as part of your regular catch ups , since you want to continually improve and progress . <h> Give an example <p> Interviewers love real-life examples because they show that your answer is based on the person you are , rather than a person you have created in order to blitz the interview . Make sure that the example illustrates that you have viewed the criticism objectively , taken ownership of the problem and used it to improve your work . If you are in a leadership position , you will also need to show that you are responsive to criticism by calling a follow-up meeting to discuss feedback and work towards solutions .

Now we can put little sensors on them and collect information as they train and compete . <h> What are the different elements of your job ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its own culture and philosophy on the way of doing things , so you ca n't just revert back to your textbook . You have to respect the way things happen in rowing versus hockey versus athletics . There are many roads to Rome and there are many ways to win a gold medal . <h> Do you have a typical day ? <p> Not really and that 's one of the things I like about the job . I 've never wanted to work nine til five or have to wear a tie to work . Some days , I might start really early out on the water with the rowing team , and other days I 'll be on tour . Sometimes I 'm at competitions , then other days at training camps or selection trials . <h> How much opportunity do you get to think outside the square ? <p> You are always trying to think of better ways to do things , but that does n't necessarily mean throwing away what you 've been doing . Some people want to come up with the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my experience the best impact a sport scientist can have is to make sure that all the mundane things are done perfectly all of the time . <h> What parts of an athlete 's preparation are your responsibility ? <p> I 'm a physiologist , so my role is focused on the physical side of training . I liaise with coaches to help design , monitor and adjust training programs where appropriate . My job is to make sure athletes are doing the right amount and type of training throughout the week , so that they are fit and fresh for competition . The other disciplines in sport science are biomechanics , nutrition and psychology . <h> What are you doing in the lead-up to Beijing ? <p> I just got back from three weeks away with the rowing team , because they had two World Cup regattas in Italy and Poland . The men 's hockey team just got back from winning the Champions Trophy in Holland . The good news with both those sports is that all the hard work is done by now . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpening up on the teamwork . <h> Are you going to Beijing ? <p> No , my job is done in the preparation . The Olympics is really tight with the number of additional staff who are allowed to accompany the team , so I have to ensure all the work is done properly beforehand and make sure that the people who are going will be able to look after the recovery and cooling strategies . Then I can sit back and watch it on TV . <h> Is that one of the best things about your job ? <p> Literally our whole job is focused on two weeks that happen every four years . In some ways that 's pretty hard , because after the Olympics finish there is a month or so of wind-down time , and then the four-year plans will be in place to start preparing for London . My whole four years are judged on that particular moment . That can be tough , but it 's what sport is about . <h> What are the bad points about being a sports physiologist ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it if you were n't absolutely passionate about elite sport . Other countries do n't stop training because there is a public holiday in Australia . At the same time , I did n't want a nine til five , clock-in clock-out , get-on-the-treadmill job . <h> What are your future career ambitions ? <p> Career progression in sport science is pretty flat . You would most likely start at one of the institutes in a junior development program for one of the minor sports and then work your way up to the national programs in the priority sports . Ideally , I would like to work with two sports at a national level and really look after those two sports . <h> What 's your advice for someone who wants to follow in your career footsteps ? <p> If you do n't do a sport already , then get involved in one either as an athlete or coach . You do n't necessarily have to reach an elite level of performance , but by going through the process you get to understand how the information you learnt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uni , get the theoretical knowledge to understand the nuts and bolts of the career . When you get into the workforce that will be your bread and butter to allow you to give coaches good advice . 
@@71750717 @450717/ <h> How to make casual teaching work for you <p> Teaching is one of the most rewarding and challenging careers around . Those in the profession come from a range of backgrounds and special interests , and there 's more than one way to get in . You can do a full four-year Bachelor of Education degree , but a large number of graduates from other disciplines get into teaching by completing a one-year Graduate Diploma of Education ( Primary ) , Graduate Diploma of Education ( Secondary ) or Graduate Certificate of Tertiary Teaching to boost their career options . <p> For many teachers , education is a stable permanent career in which they can steadily progress . But for many others , casual or relief teaching can be a useful temporary and flexible job which allows them to add an extra string to their bow and gain valuable experience while they work on other projects or seek permanent work in their field . Its becoming an increasingly popular and worthwhile career choice for many . <p> Casual teaching offers a range of benefits . Experienced teacher and author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says , One of the main reasons that people choose to do casual teaching is because of the flexibility of time . As a casual teacher , you also get to try things out , make mistakes and learn from them . You get to try something different in another school or with another class tomorrow , says Megan . <p> If you 're a casual teacher seeking permanent work or someone using it as a stepping stone to a new career , the following seven tips will help you to get the work and be the best casual teacher you can be ! <h> 1 . Work on your resume <p> Strengthening your resume is the first step towards gaining work in schools , so ensure that you have a professional resume that clearly communicates your skills and qualifications . Megan stresses that with most recruiters , You have seven seconds to make an impression . Ensure that your cover letter is addressed to the correct person and that you include your days of availability to work . <p> Be sure to follow up your resume with a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received . This demonstrates your ability to show initiative and your enthusiasm to work at the school . <h> 2 . Be prepared <p> It sounds obvious , but when your phone rings in the morning , answer it ! It may be a school calling with a day of work for you . Megan suggests that you make a note of the person calling you from the school . Just remembering the persons name when they call the next time can build rapport . <p> Be prepared with resources for the subjects you teach across a variety of grades . Being prepared gives structure to a work schedule that can be variable and unpredictable . The more organised you are , the greater your confidence will be when you enter a new school . <h> 3 . Present yourself professionally <p> Everything about you says something about you , says Megan . You only have one opportunity to make a good first impression so be sure to pay attention to the details of your presentation what you choose to wear , the way you smell , even your posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the staff dress code . She says , Its not about trying to impress them , but trying to make a good impression , showing that you 're a reliable , clean and tidy relief teacher . <h> 4 . Approach the classroom with a sense of confidence and authority <p> Even if you feel nervous or uncertain , its important that your students see you as confident and in control . The biggest mistake a casual teacher will make is they will try to be liked by their students . This is not your goal as a casual teacher , says Megan . The sooner you establish a strong presence in the classroom , the sooner you will be able to get students to engage in productive class work and manage discipline issues effectively . <p> Be firm but kind is my overarching motto , says Megan . She also recommends talking to students who arrive at school early and asking them how things usually work in the classroom . This will save you a lot of time in having to re-establish structure as a casual teacher . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative , says Megan . Theyre taught certain ways of doing things and when they 're thrown into a different school each day , and because they 're afraid of getting it wrong , they take an approach of zero initiative and they sit back and let the day roll on. <p> Taking initiative may mean doing some extra work , stepping out and doing something you 've never done before . Principals and permanent teachers will notice that you take initiative . They will respect you more if you try and fail rather than not trying at all , says Megan. <h> 6 . Build relationships and rapport with staff <p> ? Make a point of saying goodbye to the person that you report to for the day and to the office staff . The office staff can really help you to get work in a school , so building rapport with them will keep you top-of-mind when the school needs a casual . <p> ? Many casual teachers never go into the staffroom because it can be an intimidating place with its own set of social rules and expectations . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will have to overcome your fear and cross that threshold . Building relationships with other teachers is a sure way to get more work in the school . Do n't be invisible , says Megan . Prepare some questions to ask other teachers , which can start conversations . A good question to start with is , How long have you been working here ? <p> Remember : its about building genuine relationships with the staff , not about being fake or manipulative to get ahead . <h> 7 . Do more than is expected of you <p> If you want to be asked back again and again you will need to do something that causes you to stand out from the crowd . Megan says , Lots of casual teachers rock in , do nothing , babysit the kids , at 3.15pm lights out and off they go. <p> If , on the other hand , you arrive 15 minutes earlier and you leave 15 later than expected , everyone will sit up and take notice . Megan also recommends that you leave the classroom better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet , which shows the permanent teacher what you did with the class for the day . If you leave a tidy class , with work marked and a daily planner sheet signed with your name on the class teachers desk , you can guarantee that you will get a call to do a casual day with the school again . <p> Above all , remember that you can have a huge positive impact in this career . You can make a difference in one day , one class , one interaction with a student , says Megan . When you focus on being a positive influence on the children you teach , your performance will be transformative for both you and them .

For those who are n't  natural phone people , the mere thought of it can be enough to induce heart palpitations . <p> The telephone is often your first point of personal contact with a potential employer , so its important to make the interaction a good one . They will get an immediate impression from your telephone manner and tone of voice , and this could make the difference between getting a callback or not . <p> As easy as it is to send your resume by email without bothering to make a call , picking up the phone is always a good idea because it gives you a chance to establish a personal connection and shows an extra degree of initiative and confidence . It just gives that extra personal touch and will differentiate you from the other impersonal resumes theyll be receiving . It will also give you a chance to get more information about the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to establish a rapport with the hiring manager or interviewer over the phone and that could land you a face-to-face interview . <h> 1 . Call as lead-in or follow-up <p> Job calls can be made either before you send your resume , to get more information and alert the person receiving the resumes that you 'll be sending yours through ; or they can be made soon after sending your resume as a follow-up , to introduce yourself and confirm that they 've received it . <h> 2 . Do your research before you call <p> Before you call , read the job ad carefully , do an Internet search on the company and visit their website to find out about the products and services they offer , the company structure and culture , the industry and other pertinent information . <h> 3 . Write down what you want to say <p> Its always a good idea to write down your key points and questions before you make the call . You do n't  want to read them verbatim and sound stilted , but it will help if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything important . Base any questions on the job description or the information you have gleaned from your research . Having specific , well thought-out questions will impress them and show that you have read and researched with care . <p> Also have a copy of your resume on hand in case they ask specific questions about your background and experiences . <h> 4 . Set yourself up <p> Use a quiet , private room you do n't  want your call interrupted by screeching children , mobile phones , music or passing traffic . Find somewhere quiet where you can focus and conduct a professional conversation . <p> If you can , use a landline because mobile phones can sometimes drop out or have poor reception . <p> Its also important not to chew gum , eat or drink while talking , but have a glass of water on hand in case your mouth gets dry . <h> 5 . Practise your spiel <p> Its always a good idea to practise what you 're going to say aloud before you make the call . You can play with different wording and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to convey confidence , enthusiasm and energy in your voice . It helps to actually smile while you 're talking , as it will make your voice sound brighter and warmer . Also breathe deeply to help you relax . <h> 6 . Do n't  forget the niceties <p> Say hello , ask for the contact specified in the job ad , address him or her using Ms or Mr , politely state your name and explain that you are calling about the job opening . Always ask if it is a convenient time to talk first , because they may be in the middle of something . If they do n't  have time to talk at the moment , ask when would be a more convenient time to call . <p> Its important to not only tell them about yourself , but to listen attentively to everything they say .

@@71750721 @450721/ <p> It is becoming increasingly common for interviewers to throw in some unusual questions during interviews rather than sticking to the tried-and-true list . This could be for a number of reasons : they want to see if you can think on your feet , be creative , say something illuminating about yourself and possibly demonstrate a sense of humour . <p> This can take the form of a question such as If you were an animal , what would you be ? Variations of this kind of question could include If you were a fruit , what would it be ? , ' If you could be any colour , what colour would you be ?

Whatever your choice , try to choose an animal with generally positive connotations . <p> When it comes to fruit , almost anything will do as long as you can give a good reason for it . You can choose a fruit that goes well in fruit salad to show that you 're a team player and get along with others ; or a banana , which is versatile and has substance . Or for something a bit different , how about a tomato , which crosses the line between fruit and vegetable , is highly versatile and can be eaten raw or cooked all demonstrating flexibility and transferability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where oversensitivity is not an asset , perhaps you could liken yourself to a rockmelon which has a thick skin ! <p> Remember , there is no singular ' perfect ' answer to these sorts of questions its all about trying to see your thought processes , how you handle being put on the spot and your ability to be a little creative . Try to tailor your answer to the specific job for example , do n't  say you have the independence of a cat if you 're going for a job where being a team player is important but try not to overthink it and just have fun with it !

Changes to immigration law means that there are now a small but growing number of organisations that accept applications from international students . <p> If an international student is looking to gain a graduate job , it 's probably best to check out a company 's website to see the type of graduates those companies are looking for , and if they recruit international students . <h> What have students said about their placement experience ? <p> All of them gain something from the program from developing their communication and professional skills to understanding workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of career options .

But do n't  fall into the trap of diverting all your energy into your second job and jeopardising your main career in the process that in itself could land you on the top of the redundancy pile . <p> Apart from the extra cash going into the bank account , more time slaving away means less time to empty the bank account . However , there 's no point burning the midnight oil for some extra cash if you 'll never have time to enjoy it plus you 'll be paying more tax on your secondary income . Also do n't  forget that some things are invaluable ( such as health and family time ) , so do n't  be so busy counting your coins that you forget about what 's really important . <h> Keeping things interesting <p> Working different jobs can create room for your real passions , meaning you can pursue what actually interests you in one gig while also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may work as an accountant during the day to pay the bills , while you sing at night to satisfy your creative urges .

A second job can fast-track your career by broadening your skills and networks .

You might like to keep your second job in the same industry you already work in , or go down a completely different path . <p> There are some things to look out for if you want to take up extra employment . Firstly , many primary places of employment require permission for you to hold down a second job . There may be some ethical issues which come up , like confidentiality or competition , especially if your second job is in the same industry . Working for two different employers also means you risk losing your energy and focus , so be careful not to let your performance slip . <p> Its not only your primary job you need to keep in peak condition you also need to make sure a second career is n't going to affect your worklife balance too much . However , if you can avoid biting off more than you can chew , you will end up wealthier and possibly wiser .

It also gives the boss a record of your contact details and generally puts you ahead of the rest of the crowd . <p> Start with contact details The first thing you need to do is say who you are . And it makes it easier for your prospective boss to get hold of you . Your contact details should have your name , telephone number and email address prominently placed at the top of the resume .

Including your education is a standard in resumes so it 's good to make yours look professional . <p> Be creative with work experience Even if you have n't had a ' real ' job with set hours and pay , informal or volunteer work counts as work experience . It shows that you are proactive and keen , and it is all potential employers expect to see at this stage in your ' career ' . Door knocking for the Red Shield Appeal or helping out on weekends at the local retirement home is something to be proud of .

Speaking more than one language , proficiency at Microsoft Office or administration skills will all give you an upper hand over a teen that solely excels at playing Buck Hunter . Being good at Maths is a definite asset if you are going to be handling money . <p> Do n't forget your interests and activities Letting a potential employer know your interests will make you stick in their minds and create a character that exists beyond the sheet of paper .

This can range from premature babies and children with cerebral palsy to patients recovering from major surgery or injuries . <p> It can be a really rewarding career because you have the potential to impact on a patients quality of life , says physiotherapist Katherine Wong . For example I work in rehabilitation and its really exciting to teach somebody to walk again after they 've had a stroke . <p> Physiotherapists use a range of treatments to reduce a patients physical pain and restore function to their limbs . Techniques may include mobilisation and manipulation of joints , massage and hydrotherapy . <p> If you have an ability to inspire confidence and motivate others , and are genuinely interested in health and wellbeing , then consider physiotherapy as a career . You can also train to become a physiotherapy assistant by completing a Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance ( Physiotherapy ) . <h> Speech pathologist <p> Despite what many people think , speech pathologists treat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or speech impediments . Clients can include people of all ages who have difficulty with communication and/or swallowing . This might vary from babies struggling with breastfeeding to people who need to relearn how to speak after suffering a head injury or stroke . <p> As a speech pathologist , your day-to-day tasks will vary greatly depending on the organisation you are employed at and the type of clients you treat . For instance , speech pathologists who work in hospitals will work with patients in a rehabilitative capacity assessing a patients swallowing function to ensure eating is safe post-surgery or perhaps devising communication strategies for those undergoing cancer treatment . Meanwhile , speech pathologists who specialise in providing disability services may treat young children with autism or cerebral palsy to increase their communication skills and confidence . <p> Regardless of where you end up as a speech path , you 'll need superior listening and interpersonal skills and an ability to tactfully approach a patients problems . An interest in language and communication is useful too . <h> Exercise physiologist <p> Contrary to what many people believe , exercise physiologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're university-qualified experts in exercise therapy and rehabilitation . <p> What most people do n't  realise is that exercise is a form of medicine , says exercise physiologist student Robyn Yin . Exercise physiologists basically prescribe exercise . <p> EPs develop individualised exercise programs that are designed to prevent or manage chronic disease , injury or disability . Clients can include those with diabetes , cardiovascular disease , obesity , arthritis and even depression . But its not just about tailoring exercises to a clients health condition . EPs also use counselling and motivational strategies to ensure clients commit to regular exercise on a long-term basis . <h> Dietitian/Nutritionist <p> If you think dietitians just help celebrities lose weight , then think again . Dietitians are , in fact , health professionals who apply the science of nutrition to improve the health of individuals and the community at large . This involves educating clients on the impact of diet , planning appropriate diets and meals for clients with medical conditions such as diabetes , and advising other healthcare professionals on the role of diet in health care and recovery management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunities are endless . You could work in a major hospital planning meals for the seriously i 'll , or you could work with children at schools , teaching them about nutrition and food . Where you take your career as a dietitian is really up to you . <p> Nutritionists also work in the area of nutrition and can work in gyms , doctors clinics , complementary medicine clinics , sporting clubs , health food shops and hospitality , or as a nutritional counsellor or consultant . The educational requirements to become a nutritionist are less rigorous than for dietitians , as dietitians require a bachelor degree or more . <p> If you have a deep appreciation for food and are genuinely interested in health and wellbeing , a career as a dietitian or nutritionist could be for you . We offer a range of nutrition courses that can be studied online . <h> Orthoptist <p> Very few people understand what orthoptists do , and chances are if you do , youve probably been treated by one . Orthoptists are essentially eye experts who diagnose eye movement disorders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , orthoptists do not prescribe glasses . Instead they work closely with ophthalmologists ( eye doctors ) , assessing and testing the vision of an ophthalmologists patients . <p> They also screen the vision of school children to detect any vision disorders , can test for age-related eye conditions such as cataracts , and may help rehabilitate patients after a stroke or head injury . Orthoptists can recommend surgery if a patients condition requires it ( but do not perform the surgery themselves ) , or will suggest exercises or therapy where appropriate . <p> Orthoptist , Janine Sing , says its a challenging career but one that can make a real difference in peoples lives . Every day something is different . You go into work not knowing what to expect , she says . Being an orthoptist provides me with great opportunities to get out there in the health industry and make a difference . <p> Orthoptists can work in private practice , hospitals and low vision clinics , or devote their time to research . The field is so small that there is always a demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't many of us out there , says Sing . Job-wise there are plenty of opportunities and so much room to grow .

@@71750759 @450759/ <h> 5 Things I Wish I 'd Known When I Finished High School <p> Finishing high school can be an exciting but also daunting experience . Looking back on my own transition from school to university , I realise everything I could have done differently . I 'd like to share a few things Ive learned since then through my own and other students experiences , to give you insight and to help you realise that you are n't  alone out there if you have no idea what to do after high school ! <h> 1 . Most people do n't  know what they want to do when they finish school its normal ! <p> Like many students , I did n't  actually know what course I wanted to do after Year 12 , despite getting good marks . At the time I thought I was the only one in the world going through this dilemma ! However , the fact is that most students do n't  know what they want to do when they finish school , and those that do are in the minority . If you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you be expected to know what you want to do for the rest of your life ? <p> Nothing is set in stone . Career change statistics suggest that the average person will make a career change approximately five to seven times during their working life . This means there is not just one job you will do , but many . With our constantly changing work practices and technology , you might have a job in the future that does n't  even exist now ! <p> As your experiences broaden you will start to realise what you like and do n't  like to do through trial and error , so be prepared for a journey of lifelong learning . The most important thing is to be open-minded , motivated and willing to learn ! <h> 2 . Your marks do n't  define your course or career choice <p> Do n't  let your choice of further study be solely determined by your HSC results . Consider your motivations and interests and do not let your marks sway you from what you really want to do . I constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose their course because they had the marks when they really wanted to do something quite different . <p> It is very rare to come across a student who is strong and individual enough not to get swayed by their marks or the prestige associated with an occupation . One of the people I admire most is a friend of mine who had the marks to get into any course she wanted but she chose to stay true to herself and become a kindergarten teacher . She is a phenomenal teacher , full of passion , and any child who is lucky enough to have her as a teacher will remember her for life ! Even if you do n't get into uni , it 's not the end of the world . <p> The question you really need to be asking is : why do I want to do this course ? Think about your reasons and try to be as honest with yourself as possible . <h> 3 . There is more than one road to the same destination <p> Students may be disappointed when they get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people might not achieve their best results at high school and this does not mean they wont be successful . Just look at Richard Branson , a high school drop-out who had dyslexia and was a lousy student . What Branson demonstrates is that hard work , drive and determination are the essential elements to success . <p> Getting good grades will give you more options upfront , but in the long run no one but you will remember your marks and they will not define who you are and what you will achieve for the rest of your life . <p> There are many different pathways to get to the same destination . Missing out on a course does n't  mean the dream is over . You can look at alternative pathways , single subject enrolments , starting in another course then transferring , or completing an undergraduate degree then undertaking postgraduate study . You might choose to work and then take on further study as a mature-aged student . There are many different combinations and permutations and in Australia we are fortunate to have access to a diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need to be aware of what your influences are <p> When I look back on finishing Year 12 , I now realise I was scared stiff of leaving the security of high school . I had had a positive experience and good friends , and did n't  want to face the big wide world on my own . My choices were influenced by who I knew and which university they were going to , and other factors such as my parents and erroneous preconceptions about courses and occupations . <p> When I counsel Year 12 students I find it is very common for students to go for a course or institution largely based on where their friends are going or how far it is from home . Ive come to realise that most young people do n't  know any different , so how can they imagine a world beyond their own life experience ? <p> Sometimes the best course for you is not the one at the most prestigious university or the one your friends are going to . Its important to consider the learning style that suits you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best study program for what you want to do . Take the time to stop , reflect and discuss the factors that are influencing you . <h> 5 . If you take a year off , use it wisely <p> I deferred my first year of study because I did n't  know what I wanted to do . During that time I did work experience , volunteered and got a casual job . The year flew past , and at the end of it I knew a little bit more about the world of work , my skill set and what I did n't  want to do . But I had n't  gotten any closer to the answer I was so desperately looking for . When I think back on my gap year , I put way too much pressure on myself to find out exactly what I wanted to do . <p> If you take a gap year do n't  think you will suddenly have a great epiphany and necessarily know what you want to do with your life ! Having time out from study can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right time to take that year off and make sure it is for the right reasons . Do something that will enrich your life . <h> Your learning never ends <p> Your learning does not conclude at the end of high school , nor at the end of a degree or even when you get your first job . In fact , that 's only the start ! The road ahead will be full of twists and turns , and sometimes the destination will be clear while at other times it might feel like you 're going in circles . There will be many opportunities for gaining new knowledge and skills , for changing direction and ultimately for personal growth . This is what a career and life is all about !

I often went there as a child for school , as well as on family visits . After a degree in history at the ANU , I completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Cultural Heritage Studies at the University of Canberra and I wanted to find a way to make that study of history applicable in my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial is a place that I have a great deal of admiration for so I thought it would be a great place to work . <h> What was it like living and studying in the United Kingdom ? <p> The Memorial was very generous and gave me a year off and I went and did my Masters degree in the History of Design and Material Culture at the University of Brighton on the south coast of England . It was a great way to refresh my skills and rebuild my enthusiasm for my job . I had a wonderful time learning about new ways to look at objects , what they can tell us about the past and how to apply that knowledge . <p> It was a completely different experience and one that I was glad to have the opportunity to do . Having a new perspective on what people appreciate in terms of collections was really interesting . I gained a lot of new ideas to apply to my work back in Australia . From a personal perspective , this new experience refreshed me mentally as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was one of the Memorials travelling exhibitions that opened in Canberra in 2006 . I was given the opportunity to work initially as the co-curator and then as curator . I helped put the exhibition together in terms of selecting the displays and writing text . It looks at the ways in which war and sport have intersected over the last 100 years of Australias history . Its been a popular exhibition , and provided us with a good opportunity to show a side of the collection that we do n't  usually get to display . Visitors are able to see soldiers , sailors and airmen engaging in sporting activities , rather than the stereotypical things we think are involved in fighting war . It was a really exciting project for me to work on because we got some wonderful photographs , images and objects , and put them on display for the public to see . <h> How long did it take to prepare this exhibition ? <p> It was about 18 months all up , which is a standard time frame for an exhibition .

Some people want to find a home for their military memorabilia and I deal with those donation offers . I also occasionally write articles for our website and magazine and answer media enquiries . Exhibition work is also a big part of my job with preparation and research . Cataloguing is another big part of my day . <p> We have a large collection of objects at the Memorial there 's over 150 000 objects alone in the section I work in and a lot of my work involves research to find out who the objects belonged to , and the story behind each one , so that we can preserve that information for everyone to access . <h> Do you have many opportunities to travel ? <p> I travel occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to visit the different venues where each exhibition is held , see it set up and talk to people in these regional areas .

Its a really wonderful opportunity to get out there into the public and bring our collection from Canberra to these regional areas . <h> How many people work in your team ? <p> There are 19 people working in the Military Heraldry and Technology section . Most of these are curators and assistant curators , but we also have a photography team which works on photographing objects as they come into our collection so we can put them up on our website .

@@71750773 @450773/ <p> The purpose of this question is twofold : to find out about your professional dislikes , and to gain some insight into why you are looking for another job . The interviewer will assume that there must be something you dislike about your current job , because otherwise you presumably would n't be looking for another one . <p> Its always best to present yourself in the most positive light and not to whinge about your employer or workplace , but certain dislikes are legitimate and can even reflect well on you . For instance , if you say you dislike the inefficiency of certain systems in your office , that will tell the interviewer that you value efficiency and accuracy . But do n't just stop there explain how you have suggested ways of improving the systems or demonstrate what changes you have made to improve processes in your current workplace so you come across as being solution- rather than problem-oriented . <p> If you 're going for a job as a sales rep , it might be alright to admit that you do n't  love paperwork , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what is necessary . However , it might not be such a good idea to say you do n't  like paperwork if you 're applying to be an office manager it could very well cost you the job . Similarly , a sales rep who says they do n't  like dealing with people probably would n't get very far . <p> Whatever you say , try to frame your decision to leave your current role in positive terms . Instead of saying that you hate your job and just want a change , you could say that while you learned many valuable skills in your current position , you are now seeking a role that would challenge you and enable you to better use all your capabilities , in an environment in which you could really thrive and grow a win-win situation for both you and your potential employer . <p> You should also use this opportunity to demonstrate how well suited you are to the role you are applying for , as well as the company . For example , if you are applying for a job with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current job , you would welcome the opportunity to work with a larger organisation or anything else that explains why you would prefer to work for the company you are applying with . Positive reasons to switch to a different company could include its corporate culture , size , structure , industry , working conditions or schedule . <p> Here is an example : <p> ' While I really enjoyed working at Carlton United , unfortunately it offered few opportunities for growth and development . I volunteered for multiple projects for other teams on my own time in order to grow my project management abilities , but these were limited by the size of the company . At a larger company like Pacific , I believe that I would have the opportunity to make greater use of my team management experience , and continue to refine my project management skills . '

She has a strong sporting background in surfing , netball , basketball and surf life saving and has competed at state and national levels . Since doing this interview Lyndsey has started a permanent job at Port Wakefield Primary as a Year 5/6/7 class teacher and the school 's Indonesian teacher . She is also the Australian Education Union representative for her school and has spoken at DECS and AEU conferences . <p> Why did you want to become a teacher ? <p> I believe that it is a valuable occupation to be able to pass on skills , knowledge and attitudes to other people . Providing students with opportunities to explore and experience the world around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching children is knowing that you have helped them overcome something difficult and then seeing the smile on their face . <h> Did you always want to be a teacher ? <p> No . At first I wanted to become a psychologist so that I could help children in need . However , I realised that the best way to help children is to support their learning . Providing support and assistance to develop the knowledge , skills and attitudes needed to help them in life is far more effective than solving the problem after it has occurred . <h> What was involved in your Bachelor of Education course ? <p> It was a four-year course that comprised two years of general studies and two years of professional studies . The first two years involve studying the key curriculum areas that you want to teach . The following two years are professional studies where you undertake three periods of Teaching Practicum in a school . You also undertake curriculum study topics in different subjects . <h> What does your job involve ? <p> Teaching a class during school hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , going on excursions and camps , communication with colleagues and parents of students , evidence of planning , and after-school commitments , such as coaching and umpiring . <h> What aspects of the profession interest you in particular ? <p> I am new to this profession , so everything interests me . I take every opportunity to advance my skills and understanding about teaching . I like to keep up to date with new methodologies and teaching strategies . Providing a valuable and engaging education to my students is important to me . <h> What advice would you give someone who is starting out ? <p> Find out what the areas of need are , such as specialist teaching areas , and train in them so that you come out with something that an employer sees as valuable . Go to country schools on your Teaching Practicum so that you can build links with country schools and perhaps win a permanent teaching position . Unless you have a specialist training that 's in need , you may get permanency only in the country . 
@@71750776 @450776/ <p> But how much does a postgraduate qualification really help your job prospects ? Will it leave prospective employers as dazzled as your friends ? And , perhaps most importantly , will you really earn more dollars than your meagre , bachelor degree-wielding subordinates ? <p> With the average masters costing anywhere between $20,000 and $37,000 , its a decision not to be made lightly . Nobody wants to spend the rest of their working life paying off government loans . <p> To help spare you ( and your bank account ) any unnecessary anguish , we take a look at what the postgrad fuss is all about , including the industries where it literally pays to pursue further study . <h> Who 's doing it ? <p> Graduates who undertake further full-time study within a year of completing their bachelor degree ( % ) <h> Will a postgrad degree lead to glory and riches ? <p> Possibly .

The sad reality is that although there are many industries where undertaking postgraduate study can make a genuine difference to your job prospects and skills bank , there are even more where you could probably afford to reconsider your options . Is another degree really the answer ? <p> Yes , postgraduate salaries are , on average , greater than those enjoyed by undergrads , but by just how much ? Economics grads will be chuffed to learn that those with a postgrad qualification can expect to take home an average of $37,483 more than their undergraduate counterparts , whereas those in the field of social work have less to be happy about , with an average of $13,174 extra in the bank . <p> At the risk of sounding like a broken record , research really is your best friend on this one .

Obtaining a PhD in some abstract division of astrophysics probably wo n't enhance your job prospects a great deal if its too niche for anyone but you to understand . <p> What 's the moral of the story ?

@@71750806 @450806/ <h> How to write a successful job ad <p> Writing an effective job advertisement is the best way to woo the right applicants and will help you sort the wheat from the chaff . You need to present your company in the best light , as well as accurately describe the position and its role within the company . The more specific you are in your criteria , the more effectively you will target the right applicant and see if they 've bothered to read the fine print . <p> Putting together an effective job ad is simple if you stick to some basic guidelines . <h> Job title <p> Make sure you include the professional job title at the top of the ad . Potential applicants will search for certain keywords in relation to the position , so its a make-or-break manoeuvre . Make it simple , honest and to-the-point . You may choose to add extra information if it makes the job title more specific for example , Project Manager Financial Services is more informative than simply Project Manager . <h> The company <p> After knowing what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be working for . Show how desirable your company is , the opportunities it presents and why a talented worker should uproot from a current job to come and work for you . You could include some points about the organisations position in the industry , the central location of the office and opportunities to travel or be promoted within the company . <h> Job description <p> Now you need to tell your future employees exactly what the job entails . Top performers respond to challenges more than money , so you want to make the job sound rewarding and stimulating . Tell potential applicants what they will be responsible for ; give an outline of their day-to-day tasks and who they will be answering to . This will give job seekers an idea of the expectations for the role . Also mention when the position will commence and whether its full-time , part-time or contractual . <h> Ideal candidate description <p> Its time to let potential applicants know exactly what you want out of them . This is n't the time to beat around the bush you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stack of useless resumes . Also , giving a strong description will attract people who are after a challenge . <p> Many companies make the mistake of using lots of buzzwords that do n't  necessarily translate into anything practical . Use criteria that mean something , like how much experience is desirable and what level of education is expected . Also outline what skills are required for example , customer service or specific computer programs . <p> If there is a clear outline of the ideal candidate for the job , it will mean stronger applications as well as applicants who will fit into the dynamics of the company . You may choose to use bullet points to cover characteristics such as : <p> Highly motivated and results driven <p> Excellent communication , presentation and time management skills <p> Energy and enthusiasm <p> Sound judgement and decision making <p> Highly numerate with superior analytical skills <p> A commitment to outstanding customer service <p> Attention to detail <h> Salary package <p> The salary question has to be broached at some point . Most people scanning a page of ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a media manager who is on $40,000 sees a job ad for a media manager on $200,000 , they may think its out of their depth . You should also list any extra perks that will set you apart from the competitors . A fantastic location or unusual perks of the job , commission , supportive worklife balance policies or flexible work hours can be effective selling points . Alternatively , you could write salary package to be negotiated if the level of the job is evident . <h> Layout <p> A simple job ad is an effective one . Ads that are plainly written and clearly formatted are easier to read and will enable job seekers to quickly assess their suitability for the job . Bullet points work well . <p> Steer clear of complicated job descriptions , fancy designs , funky language or anything out of the ordinary . Someone reading a job ad with lots of fancy , yet confusing jargon will wonder straight away what the catch is . <h> How to apply <p> Make sure the method of application is clear . Most advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person applicants can direct their enquiries to . Do n't  forget to put a closing date on applications ! <h> Do n't  discriminate <p> A recent survey by Kelly Services found almost half of business professionals would be in breach of anti-discrimination laws when writing a job ad . Putting together a job ad that does n't  discriminate is actually harder than it sounds firstly because there are so many groups you can discriminate against , and also because laws vary across states . <p> In general , all jobs must be open to all people on the basis of merit , and only merit . That means the job ad ca n't discriminate against age , gender , sexual orientation , disability , transgender status , industrial activity , marital status , family responsibilities , breastfeeding , physical features , political belief or activity , pregnancy , race , or religious belief or activity . <h> Where to publish your job advertisement <p> These days jobs are most often posted online . The largest Australian job boards are on the Seek , MyCareer and CareerOne websites . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the MyCareer lift-out of the Sydney Morning Herald . Government jobs are also posted on the website APSjobs.gov.au or the print version of the Australian Public Service Gazette .

The government is very good in that respect , and that is what attracted me back into a public servant role . ' <p> Not everyone who works in education is a teacher . There are a lot of people , like Wendy , who work behind the scenes to make sure that everything runs smoothly . Wendy juggles her time between being a mum of her six-year-old son and working for the Queensland Government as a client service officer . <h> What jobs did you have before becoming a mother ? <p> I worked for Education Queensland for 12 years in a variety of public service roles including working in libraries in client services , as well as in marketing and communications . I 've also worked in publishing as a proofreader and editor . <h> What are your responsibilities ? <p> I do a variety of tasks each day , including coordinating professional development events , providing support to the communication officer and updating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you were applying for jobs ? <p> I found it difficult getting back into the workforce after being a stay-home mum . My family moved around a fair bit because of my husbands work , and we spent two years on the Mornington Peninsula , Victoria . In Victoria I did not have any family nearby to help , so child care was a big issue . I found it hard to find jobs that fit with school hours and there was fierce competition for any part-time work . So that was really tough . I missed out in some job selection processes because I could n't commit to a full-time workload . I found that I lost a lot of my self confidence when I was out of the paid workforce and that definitely made it harder for me to present confidently in interviews . <h> How did you get your current position ? <p> Because I had worked in the government for 12 years , I was able to go on long-service leave when I had my son . The government has very good entitlements for public servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I resigned . Because I had worked for the government it was easier to get my foot back in the door . So I re-applied through a merit process where I submitted a job application addressing selection criteria . <h> What were you looking for coming back into the workforce post-pregnancy ? <p> The main thing I was looking for in a job was flexible hours and the ability to work around child care . The government is very good in that respect , and that is what attracted me back into a public servant role . <h> Is it challenging to juggle work and motherhood ? <p> I went into full-time work in 2007 and that was really difficult : I felt exhausted all the time and I had no worklife balance . Luckily the department has a commitment to good working conditions , so I was able to drop back to a part-time position working four days a week and Ive negotiated to start a bit later and work back at the end of the day . It is challenging to juggle work and motherhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with my son , but it also means that at times I have cognitive overload trying to keep up with everything at work . My partner is a great father and takes time off when he can and helps run the household . <h> What childcare options do you use while you are at work ? <p> Its a bit of a juggling act at the moment . I 've got grandparents helping out a couple of afternoons a week , and my son goes to after-school care one day a week . On Thursdays , when I 'm not working , I volunteer to work at his school so I am able to drop him off and pick him up . <h> How do you maintain a worklife balance ? <p> Its hard getting all my work done within time frames , so its important to prioritise tasks . There are also things that I cant prepare for . For example , when my son gets sick and I need to take time off , its very easy to get behind at work . I try not to fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just enjoy my family . I also try to see a movie or make time for myself . <h> What do you think could be done to make the transition from motherhood to work easier for women ? <p> Working for the government is good because if you are a permanent employee you have the option to ease back into part-time work . There are also options available for job-sharing . I think other companies should implement incentives like these for mothers . I recently went to a conference where one of the speakers ( Wendy McCarthy ) spoke about the importance of mothers having a mentor in the workplace when they are on leave so they are kept in the loop with work issues . I think that 's a great idea . <h> Did you do anything to keep up-to-date professionally while you werent working ? <p> While I was on leave I tried to maintain my skills by doing short courses , and professional reading and freelance jobs .

I am truly inspired by these women . I personally found I could n't maintain that lifestyle . When I was working in publishing I found it hard to work shorter hours and produce quality work within printing timelines . Also , childcare costs mounted up . You do n't  really end up much ahead financially if you 're putting your child into care every day . However , I do n't  regret staying home with my son for his early years . You cant buy back that time and I 'm glad I was able to do kindergarten duty and playgroups with other mums . Being a mother has taught me many valuable life skills which help me inthe workforce . <h> Where do you see yourself going from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many plans for the future everything is too unpredictable .

We helped establish alternative sources of income , such as mushroom barns , organic vegetable farming and installing bio-digesters for cooking . I helped to establish funding support by writing project proposals and reporting to donors in support of the community outreach projects , and I supported the rangers that patrolled the forests .

The animal in captivity usually does not live for more than one or two years and could potentially spread diseases to humans . Trade in animal parts can be linked across continents and be involved in supporting other illegal activities . So , for many reasons , one or two animals that you may see in the illegal wildlife trade really do matter . <h> What does your current job with the Scouts involve ? <p> I develop environmental education programs for Scouting at the world level .

One of the really interesting parts of my job is identifying elements of our programs that can be consistently applied throughout the world , such as the need to have access to clean water and clean air , caring for the habitats of plants and animals , and preparing people for natural disasters .

Looking back over the past few years , I do n't think I could have predicted where I have been or what I have done , so it 's a matter of making the most of the experiences and seeing where things can take you . 
@@71750826 @450826/ <h> Leanne Baker - Lecturer and Internship Coordinator , School of Tourism and Hospitality Management , Southern Cross University <p> ' We work with the students extensively so that they can decide which industry sector and which employers are going to be most suited to them and their career aspirations . ' <p> Leanne is a lecturer who practises what she preaches . The tourism professional and avid traveller runs the internship program at Southern Cross University so tourism and hospitality students can come to grips with what the industry is really about . <h> What does your job involve ? <p> I work with students in the second and third years of their tourism and hospitality degrees to make sure that they are job and industry ready . I make sure they 've got all the skills to write excellent job applications and resumes , and that students know where to go to look for information , how to get industry contacts , and how to follow up on applications . <p> The other part of my job is to liaise with the industry to set up internship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also supervise the students while they 're working and doing their internship . There 's a lot of variety ! <h> What qualifications do you have ? <p> I have an honours degree in business tourism and I 'm studying for a PhD . <h> Was your degree necessary for the jobs you 've had ? <p> Absolutely . I would n't have this job without a degree . <h> You 've worked in the business sector as well as in marketing . What skills did you acquire in these industries ? <p> My experience gave me a hands-on knowledge of how the tourism industry works . I 've worked in hotels , resorts and clubs . This gave me a glimpse of the marketing side of things . Nothing beats that practical , inside knowledge of the industry you 're promoting . <h> What 's your most memorable overseas job experience ? <p> Working for the Japan Travel Bureau in Japan . I really enjoyed being able to work in another country , using another language and learning about how their businesses operate and how they network . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most memorable . <h> Do industry rules change depending on the country you 're in ? <p> Tourism standards and rules are very location specific . Different countries have different operating systems and different structures . <p> For example , one of our students is doing his internship in Laos at the moment and he 's saying to me , ' Leanne ! One of the big difficulties I have is to get people not to eat the wildlife ! ' In class , that 's not something we would have thought to prepare students for . It 's important to have cultural sensitivity and to be aware of cultural differences . <h> Is it possible to learn culture-specific practices on the job or is it necessary to do some formal training ? <p> I think it 's important to do both . It 's important to have that on-the-job experience because theoretical training complements the hands-on learning from life experiences . The concept of lifelong learning is so important , especially in our industry , because you have to be researching constantly and you need to know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the academic side of things . <h> How long does a tourism and hospitality degree take to complete at Southern Cross University ? <p> The standard program takes three years , which includes five months or one semester working in the industry . <h> Why are internships part of the degree ? <p> Internships allow students to specialise in their chosen sector and gain hands-on experience in the industry . This means that if a student really wants to specialise in the events sector , he or she can go and work in an events management company . They actually get hands-on , inside industry knowledge and have the opportunity to apply all the things that they 've learnt in class to real-life situations . We find that learning through doing , helps cement students ' knowledge , makes them industry-ready , and helps them further their careers . <h> Do students get to choose where they undertake their work placement ? <p> Most definitely . We work with the students extensively so that they can decide which industry sector and which employers are going to be most suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go about securing work experience positions ? <p> There are two ways . Sometimes it 's through a direct approach with the students . Sometimes it 's through network relationships that the uni has built up through its staff or through the internship program . Often internships will come about through word-of-mouth recommendations from satisfied employers as well as graduates who have worked their way up into more senior roles and are keen to lend a hand to the next generation of internship students coming through . <h> What kind of response have you had from students and employers ? <p> Students love it ! They often say it 's the best part of their degree because it 's so hands-on and they really enjoy getting in there and putting all the things they 've learnt into practice . Employers love it too because they get to secure highly motivated , exceptional graduates before they 've actually finished their degree . Employers also love it because they 're involved in those final five months of training the student making sure they are industry-ready and that they have industry-relevant skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the program ? <p> You name it ; we 've had them in every state of Australia and around the world ! Students have worked in : event management , sports administration , hotels , resorts , government bodies , marketing consultancies and the education sector . We 've pretty much got the industry covered ! <h> Do any of the internships involve payment ? <p> The majority of internships are paid now , which is a very different scenario to 15 years ago when we first started our program . Students are generally paid at the relevant entry-level wage . <h> Do many students get offered permanent job opportunities as a result of their placement ? <p> About 70 to 75 per cent of the students stay on with their employers . The other students are often planning to travel , or have found another job . Some are poached by another employer who has been impressed by their skills . <h> What 's the biggest misconception people have about employing interns ? <p> That they 're slave labour ! <h> Tourism is notorious for having a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I guess it depends which sector you 're looking at . In hotels , often there 's a high turnover because of the location , the labour is transient , and people are working their way around the country . Sometimes remoteness is a problem for people . Other times it 's the hours tourism demands people do n't want to do shiftwork forever . <p> There are some excellent employers out there that have great staff retention and staff reward programs in place , and they offer ongoing training . We work really hard at promoting these employers to our students . The culture that they build can be quite effective at reducing that staff turnover . Companies that value their staff retain them very well . <h> Have there been many major changes in the industry since you started ? <p> Yes . I think the biggest one that 's hitting us at the moment is the skills shortage , it 's not only hitting tourism at the moment , but all the industry sectors . I think it 's actually a good thing because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attracting and keeping good staff and that 's having a positive effect on industry practices overall . <h> What 's the best thing about working in tourism ? <p> It 's got to be people .

@@71750829 @450829/ <h> How to become prime minister : the path to the top <p> The road to the Lodge has sometimes been a rocky one , as recent events have demonstrated . The path can be arduous and is not for the faint-hearted . Australia 's former prime ministers have been a diverse lot , some colourful and some more sedate , coming from both sides of politics . <p> So what does it take to get the top job in Australia ? If you look at the rollcall of Australias 27 prime ministers to date , a few patterns emerge . First , you must be tenacious . It also helps if you 're male until now , that is . It helps to be born in Australia , though four previous prime ministers were born in Scotland , three in England , and one in Chile ( Chris Watson ) . And there must be something in the water in Victoria , because it 's given rise to 13 of Australias previous prime ministers ( as compared to NSWs 11 ) . <p> Most prime ministers have demonstrated political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a background in law . Only one has managed a rock band , only one was prime minister for less than a fortnight , only one has disappeared under mysterious circumstances and only one holds a world record for drinking beer . <p> here 's a look at Australias last five prime ministers and the paths they took to get to the top . <h> Julia Gillard , June 2010 <p> As of 24 June 2010 , Julia Gillard is Australias first female prime minister . The events that transpired to hand her the prime ministership were remarkable and unprecedented . After less than one term in office and with his popularity plummeting both with his party and the public , former prime minister Kevin Rudd stood down in response to Gillards leadership challenge and handed Gillard the reins of power uncontested . <p> Gillards political bent was evident from an early age . Hailing from a working-class background , the Welsh-born and Adelaide-raised Gillard studied law and arts at the University of Adelaide , where she became involved in student politics . She worked as a solicitor and union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat before working as chief of staff for Victorian opposition leader John Brumby between 1996 and 1998 . Gillard entered Parliament in 1998 when she was elected as the member for Lalor in Melbourne , moved to the frontbench in 2001 as spokeswoman on immigration and joined Kevin Rudds team in 2006 . <p> When Rudd came to power in November 2007 , Gillard became Australias first female deputy prime minister , as well as holding the portfolios of education , employment and workplace relations , and social inclusion . <h> Kevin Rudd , November 2007 June 2010 <p> Kevin Rudd was swept into power in November 2007 on a wave of hope and popularity after 11 years of Liberal rule under the Howard government , only to experience a spectacular fall from grace and have his term prematurely cut short after two years and seven months . In response to Julia Gillards leadership challenge , Rudd stood down and relinquished the prime ministership on 24 June 2010 to avoid an inevitable defeat at ballot . Rudd was the first Labor prime minister to lose office after less than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of his childhood on a dairy farm . He joined the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) at the age of 15 , completed an arts degree in Asian studies at the Australian National University ( ANU ) , and worked at the Department for Foreign Affairs from 1981 to 1988 . Rudd was appointed chief of staff to the Labor opposition leader in Queensland , Wayne Goss , in 1988 , worked as a senior China consultant for KPMG , and became federal member for Griffith in 1998 . He became shadow minister for foreign affairs in 2001 , federal leader of the ALP from 2006 , and was elected prime minister in November 2007 . <h> John Howard , March 1996 December 2007 <p> John Howard was the second longest-serving prime minister after Sir Robert Menzies . He served as the member for Bennelong from 1974 to 2007 , was federal treasurer to Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser from 1977 to 1983 , became leader of the Liberal party and Coalition opposition from 1985 to 1989 , was re-elected as leader of the Opposition in 1995 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the federal election in 2007 and was the second Australian prime minister to lose his own seat . <p> John Howard grew up in Earlwood , Sydney , studied law at the University of Sydney and practised as a solicitor for 12 years . He was active in Liberal party politics from the age of 18 and served as president of the Young Liberals from 1962 to 1964 . He was the only Liberal prime minister to be educated in government schools and was given the name Winston ( his middle name ) , after British Prime Minister Winston Churchill . <h> Paul Keating , December 1991 March 1996 <p> Paul Keating came into power in 1991 after winning a leadership challenge against then prime minister Bob Hawke . He went on to win an unwinnable election in 1993 but then lost the federal election in 1996 . <p> Keating grew up in Bankstown , Sydney , attended a technical college but not university , worked as a clerk and then as a research assistant for a trade union . He joined the Labor Party as soon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1966 . He was elected as federal member for Blaxland in 1969 at the age of 25 , making him one of the youngest federal parliamentarians , and was treasurer for Bob Hawke between 1983 and 1991 . Keating launched a leadership bid in June 1991 against Hawke , but lost and then resigned as treasurer . However , his next attempt at the leadership in December 1991 was successful , and he became prime minister . <p> Keating was an aggressive debater famous for his caustic tongue . Love him or hate him , he knew how to deliver a scathing insult . Some of his more well-known putdowns include calling John Howard a little desiccated coconut and this : I am not like the leader of the Opposition . I did not slither out of the Cabinet room like a mangy maggot ... <h> Bob Hawke , March 1983 December 1991 <p> Bob Hawke was Australias longest-serving Labor party prime minister , enjoying four terms in office .

Social media manager <p> LinkedIn recently placed social media management , otherwise know as online community management , as the top skill for 2013 according to its member profiles and their job-hunting success .

@@71750838 @450838/ <h> Will That Get Me Fired ? The 10 Tests Every Employee Needs To Take <p> Like me , you might have heard of more than a few colourful unfair dismissal cases : an employee fired from freight company Linfox for discriminatory comments he made on Facebook outside of work hours ; the employee who was fired for calling his boss a wanker ; the case of the government employee who used an anonymous Twitter account as a platform from which to criticise department policy ; the 25-year-long employee with a medical problem who urinated in a drain outside their factory ; the worker who was terminated after drinking two beers on his lunch break ; the senior manager who archived pornographic material at work ... You get the picture : the list goes on and on and on . <p> Of course not all dismissals are quite so intriguing , but many are eventually found to be unfair . So how do you know if you 've crossed the line ? We can learn a lot from what has happened so far . <h> Some may be stranger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two recent cases involving Linfox employees highlight just how tricky it can be to define what makes a sackable offence . In one Linfox case , an employee who persistently used his mobile phone at work was found to be fairly dismissed because it was in breach of company policy . However , another Linfox employee , who was sacked for making what were seen as sexist and racially vilifying comments against his managers on Facebook , was reinstated due to his long service and his companys lack of social media policy at the time . <p> While we might be tempted to read these cases as great drama , we should n't forget that they actually relate back to our own livelihoods . The Fair Work Commission ( FWC ) is the place with the power to influence this : its Australias national workplace relations tribunal and it decides whether a dismissal is fair . In the 20122013 financial year alone they published 11,673 decisions , many of which are now serving as benchmarks for future cases . <h> You have to have your own back <p> The FWC used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unions on industrial action and approving collective enterprise agreements , but with more employees on individual agreements these days , they are spending 17 per cent more time with single cases . Not only do individuals need to lodge their claims for unfair dismissal themselves , most of those people represent themselves at hearings . In todays workplace you need to take responsibility for your own rights . <h> How does the Fair Work Commission use its powers ? <p> The FWC judges all unfair dismissal claims by asking whether the dismissal : <p> Ill soon unpack this further with 10 tests you can take to see whether your dismissal ( real , or potential ) could be considered fair . The fact is , though , that even the FWC is refining their definition of fair on a daily basis . The FWC has the power to order the employer to reinstate the employee ( if bridges havent been horribly burnt already ) , and/or for the employer to pay compensation to the employee . They assessed 36,616 applications last financial year alone with 18,991 resolved at hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn from ! <h> What is a valid reason for dismissal ? <p> In order for the FWC to rule a valid reason for dismissal it must be sound , defensible or well founded . Sounds logical , right ? This is opposed to capricious , fanciful , spiteful or prejudiced decisions those few words are probably reminding you of some questionable firings you 've witnessed along the way . <p> That 's why its important to pin down that elusive line . In an attempt to do so I 've reviewed the FWCs recently published Benchbook of cases and have come up with these 10 tests . And its not just a checklist to review once the worst has already happened . If you take note now you will not only be less likely to overstep the mark , you will also know what your rights are if you 're ever accused of having done so . So take note , its your livelihood after all . <h> Still have doubts ? Heres what the Fair Work Ombudsman told me : <p> ' When it comes to termination , employees should ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers expectations of how they should behave , or damage the reputation , profitability or viability of their employers business . If the answer is yes , or even unclear , employees would be wise to avoid carrying out that behaviour , or seek advice about it first , particularly if it could risk damaging their employment prospects . ' <p> Fair Work Ombudsman spokesperson , 28 February 2014 <p> As well as unfair dismissal , there are different kinds of protections available , such as anti-discrimination , so make sure you get some advice from the Commission before you lodge your claim . <p> If you 're not sure of your rights , you can always contact the Fair Work Ombudsman directly to see where you stand . They get about 25,000 complaints a year , so you 're not alone ! <p> Oh and for the record , the guy who called his boss a wanker in an all-company email was found to be fitting in with existing company culture , judged on their previous use of emails . He was awarded $62,000 in compensation , but with a 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation in which he found himself . ' <p> There 's no doubt the line will always move , but we can always learn from other peoples mistakes . <p> If your job is n't working for you then maybe you should try to get ahead of the game by re-skilling . And if you 've already found yourself terminated , then you might like to take some advice from some people who know about rejection our politicians . <h> Test 1 : Would your dismissal be considered harsh ? <p> A dismissal could be considered harsh due to the economic and personal consequences faced by the employee on account of losing their job , or , particularly , where the decision to fire the employee is considered an overreaction . If you do n't  think the punishment fits the crime , then you may have a case to keep your job . <p> Case examples : A corrections officer was fired for taking toilet paper to an inmate during lockdown . This was in breach of the employers policy , however , the employee claimed that another employee was not dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that not only was the conduct comparable and the treatment different between the two employees , but also that the termination was harsh in the circumstances . The Department of Human Services was ordered to pay the former employee $20,419 in compensation , which represented a 20 per cent deduction on possible compensation due to the employees misconduct . <p> An employee had worked for Allied Mining Services for 28 years . After some contractors had been working on a water pump they left their safety locks in place , preventing the water from flowing . The employee checked along the pipe to ensure no one was still working on the pipeline , and then removed the safety lock . This was a breach of the safety rules of the employer , but due to the long track record of good service without safety breaches , and the employees remorse , the termination was found to be harsh and the employee was reinstated . <h> Test 2 : Would your dismissal be considered unjust ? <p> Getting fired might be considered unjust if you werent guilty of alleged misconduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fired for causing a forklift to collide with another forklift . Due to the seriousness of the health and safety risks , the dismissal was found to be valid , but the termination was found to be unjust because the employer was wrong in accusing the employee of deliberately causing the accident. The employee was reinstated , albeit in a new position that was to be no less favourable to him . <h> Test 3 : Would your dismissal be considered unreasonable ? <p> Termination based on serious misconduct is unreasonable if the evidence does not support the decision at the time it was made . If you are made redundant when your employer could have reasonably offered you another position , then your termination may also be considered unfair . <p> Case example : A maintenance worker was made redundant when Boral Window Systems outsourced maintenance to a labour hire agency . The employee argued that his employer did not consider him for other available positions and the FWC found that there were suitable vacancies elsewhere in the business at the time . His dismissal was found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stapler be serious misconduct ? <p> Wilful or deliberate and that is inconsistent with the continuation of the employment contract . It is also conduct that causes serious and imminent risk to the health and safety of a person or to the reputation , viability or profitability of the employers business. <p> It goes on to list theft , fraud , assault , intoxication at work and the refusal to carry out lawful and reasonable instructions consistent with the employment contract so there is plenty of room to move really . <p> Case examples : A Telstra employee was accused of having sex in a hotel room in front of colleagues while on a business trip . There was an investigation conducted by her employer after a complaint was filed , and the employee lied about her conduct and her recollection of what had happened . It was found that the questions the employer asked were reasonable and that while the conduct itself might have been of a personal nature , the employees dishonesty destroyed a relationship of trust and confidence . <p> Serious misconduct does n't  have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a butcher who would not remove his eyebrow ring which was considered to be non-compliant with a lawful direction of his employer , a Jupiters Casino manager who placed a bet at a TAB within the casino complex and a Hoyts employee who took an item from the candy bar without paying for it and when questioned about the incident , lied to management . Despite the bite-sized nature of the theft , the cover up amounted to serious misconduct and therefore it was deemed to be a valid dismissal . <p> When we consider that a Coles employee who took a few spoonfuls of Milo home to mix his own drink before consuming it at work , and for whom a case of dishonesty could not be mounted , was reinstated , it seems that serious misconduct is a matter of intent . <h> Test 5 : Can you actually do your job ? <p> You ca n't be dismissed due to a temporary absence for illness or injury for up to three months , or up to three months in total over a 12-month period , or where you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if there is medical evidence that you are unlikely to be able to return to your duties , this could have some bearing on being terminated . <p> Capacity also includes your ability to do the work you were employed to do . Its tested not by an expectation of your personal best , but of a satisfactory performance when viewed by an objective party . <p> Case examples : A branch manager at a bank was unable to lead his team to adequate sales and these were tracked through a performance management process . The FWC concluded that there was a valid reason for his termination . However , because the employer did n't  stick to its own process and warn the branch manager that his employment was at risk , it was found that he was unfairly dismissed . <p> Regarding physical capacity , a brewery technician with a congenital health issue was placed on restricted duties . After medical investigations undertaken by the employer , the technician was terminated due to a lack of capacity to perform his role . This was found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from work for seven years after injury for physical and psychological reasons . Because she was not given an opportunity to respond , and subsequently two medical practitioners suggested that she could return to restricted duties after a period of training and supervision , the dismissal was found to be unfair . <h> Test 6 : Have you been able to defend yourself ? <p> Employers have to follow a code , which instructs them to give written warning of dismissal before it occurs . Many believe there to be a requirement for three written warnings , however this is not the case and just one is sufficient for your employer to have properly consulted with you . And , they do n't  need to supply written warnings if your conduct is considered to be serious misconduct . <p> If your employer is considering dismissal then they are obligated to give you an opportunity to respond to the warning and rectify the problem . You are also allowed to have another person ( though not a lawyer ) present when the possibility of dismissal is discussed . <p> Case examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material via work email accounts , in breach of company policy . However , due to the lack of procedural fairness in the termination process and the employers unwillingness to reflect on the workers remorse , the dismissals were ultimately found to be disproportionate to the cause , and therefore unfair . Even so , the order by the FWC was that the employees should be reinstated to their positions within 14 days , but without compensation for their lost income . <p> There was also a case concerning a 58-year-old , 15-year-long employee of Panasonic Australia where his relatively new manager had brought a pre-written statement to a meeting in which they dismissed him this was deemed by the Commission to be unfair due to the predetermined nature of the dismissal . He was reinstated . <p> Similarly , cases where employees have been fired by email have also been found to be unfair , with compensation paid . Such a case was brought against NestlT Australia when an employee was accused of harassing colleagues . He had also been convicted of several criminal offences . Whether the allegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was terminated by email and not given the opportunity to respond to the accusations or to attempt to rectify the situation . <h> Test 7 : Is your boss likely to be inconsistent ? <p> If another employee has engaged in similar conduct to you in the past and they were treated differently , the FWC may consider this as a relevant factor in determining fairness . <p> Case example : A store manager at Woolworths was terminated for consuming two beers on his lunch break . Woolworthss policy was explicit that no alcohol was to be consumed during work hours and therefore his dismissal was found to be fair . However , an employee of Nationwide News was terminated after it was discovered he was drinking on his lunch break . Even though it was a breach of company policy , it was found that the dismissal was harsh as the FWC took into account recent policy change , inconsistent enforcement and the employees period of service . <h> Test 8 : Is what you get up to after work going to affect to your job ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see that if what you do outside of work hours erodes trust with your employer , then you might find yourself rightfully terminated . <p> Case example : A Good Guys salesman had n't  been correctly paid his commissions for a month . Then , after a short period of rectification , he was again not properly paid for a month . He emailed his operations manager with his concerns , spoke to her personally on a number of occasions , and one evening posted against his status : wonders how the f work can be so f. useless and mess up my pay again . C .. ts are going down tomorrow. <p> According to the case notes , the Facebook page was set to maximum privacy settings with only his select group of 70 friends able to see what he had written . Nowhere had he mentioned the Good Guys and there were approximately 11 co-workers in his group of Facebook friends . That same day , he was contacted by his area manager , while absent from work , to inform him that the company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee went to work the next day and explained to his superior that he did not intend to resign , to which his superior reportedly replied : resign now or I will sue you. A letter of termination was received some days later and three weeks pay was transferred . He claims he did not receive commissions owed for the 8 weeks in question . <p> The Commissions statement was clear : The fact that the comments were made on the applicants home computer , out of work hours , does not make any difference . The comments were read by work colleagues and it was not long before Ms Taylor the operations manager was advised of what had occurred . The respondent has rightfully submitted , in my view , that the separation between home and work is now less pronounced than it once used to be. <p> It was found that the employer notified the employee of the reason , gave him an opportunity to respond , did not refuse a support person to be present , and that the employee should have engaged with the Good Guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manager . The employees application was dismissed . <h> Test 9 : Are you consistently failing ? <p> Ok , this one is probably the most common fear of all employees can they fire me for just not being good enough ? The answer is yes , as long as they give you a chance to improve your performance over a reasonable period of time . <p> To the FWC , performance is diligence , quality , care taken and so on , leaving a whole lot scope for underperforming employees to get the boot . The test of fairness is in the warning . Warnings and there need only be one must state that your employment is at risk if your performance does n't  improve . The employer needs to have made clear communication , either verbally or in written form , to persuade the employee to do something about the situation . <p> Case examples : A Donut King staff member was fired from her casual role after five years . She was terminated for alleged poor performance but had received no warnings . It was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay as compensation . <p> However , a machine operator in a wrapping factory was absent from work , due to illness , for six months following an argument at work , there were then meetings held to address work quality , attitude and late attendance . There were five written counsellings , four written warnings , informal counselling , and a final written warning . Finally , when the employee took photos inside the factory , in breach of the site guidelines and rules , the operations manager had a meeting in which he advised the worker that he believed he had no choice but to terminate his employment , and followed up by asking him if there was any reason why he should not do so . The termination was found to be valid . <h> Test 10 : Are you eligible to take your unfair dismissal case to the FWC ? <p> Generally , if you have an employment contract ( even verbal ) , earn less than the high income threshold ( currently $129,300 per year ) , you have worked for your employer for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year depending on your type of employment ) , and you get your claim in within 21 days of your dismissal , then you can lodge a claim with the FWC.

@@71750844 @450844/ <h> The truth about ATAR cut-offs : why low does n't equal inferior <p> We all know the ATAR system is a tricky beast . You can slave over your assignments , kill it in your exams , but no one can ever tell you whether it is really going to be enough to get you into that dream course . This is because ATARs are a rank , rather than a score ; they 're about where you sit among your competition the tens of thousands of them ! <p> Nothing is certain until you have an offer in your hand , but of course that does n't  mean that you should n't have a number to aim for . Now that the results are out , most of you will be obsessing over the previous years main round ATARs , but you need to be careful : some of you might be pulling yourself out of the race prematurely , thinking that certain careers are out of your reach or disregarding courses because their ATAR is below where you consider yourself to be . The fact is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye . <h> Shouldnt I aim for a course with a high ATAR ? <p> Lots of you will look at a course with a high ATAR and assume that its either really popular or really tough , or both . The unfortunate flipside of that coin is that students often look at courses with low ATAR cut-offs and think they are somehow inferior . The truth is that its just not that simple . <p> The ATAR cut-off is calculated from the number of places available in that course , for that year , the level of the ATARs across the courses pool of applicants , and how many of them are applying for those places . Take the Australian Catholic University as an example . Last month the Sydney Morning Herald reported that ACU had a 20-point drop in ATAR cut-off for one of their education courses . If you took their headline in isolation , you might have thought that teaching was n't a popular choice last year or that less people wanted to go to ACU , but a change in ATAR cut-offs alone does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places were increased by 28 per cent with teaching subjects soon to be taught at both the Strathfield and North Sydney campuses . This opened up the doors to more people and lowered the ATAR in the process . The courses did n't  get easier , nor did they become less popular . In fact when I spoke with Professor Pauline Nugent , Provost and Deputy Vice-Chancellor ( Academic ) , she reported that since 2013 ACU has enjoyed a 7.4 per cent increase in first preference nominations across the board , and 7 per cent across all preferences . <p> Just as that example shows that you cant assume an ATAR cut-off explains how popular or hard a course might be , it also points to the current situation : it has gotten easier to get into university . Since the cap on the number of university places was removed in January 2012 , many universities have been working towards increasing the number of places they offer . ACU has even increased its student numbers by 45 per cent in just three years ! 2014 saw that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was still a 3.5 per cent increase in total offers from 2013 ( translating to 8,423 more uni students starting next month ) . <h> More places = lower ATARs <p> Its a story that 's repeated among many of this years significant ATAR drops . When I first compared 2013 and 2014 , it looked as if Central Queensland University had dropped dramatically in status . Looking a little deeper , its a similar story to ACU , where they are focused on giving more offers to more students . In fact , they want their ATARs to remain low , as Scott Bowman , Vice Chancellor of Central Queensland University said in The Australian : <p> My university 's biggest challenge is keeping ATAR entry points down . When you are renowned as a university of opportunity in regional communities with a predominantly low socioeconomic status student load , you have a social expectation to ensure that a genuine student , regardless of background , has every chance at a degree . This is why we throw everything at student support and judge the graduate outcome , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out of town if we did it any other way. <h> Its about how you graduate , not how you got in <p> You might be thinking : welcoming more people in the door is one thing , but how successful are they likely to be when walking out the door at the end of their degrees ? Bowman explains : We are also proof that lower ATAR entry levels do not erode university quality . We try our best not to exclude lower ATAR students , yet our graduates enjoy 10 per cent better employment outcomes than the national average . Despite where our students fall on the ATAR spectrum , overall they are more employable and better paid than the average graduate. <p> ACUs Nugent agrees : <p> Our quality of students is very high even with courses that have an ATAR cut-off of 58.5 the majority of people are sitting in the 60s 70s and 80s . Success is about how you support students when they come into the university and the quality of the student when they exit . No employer ever says to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of XX " ; they say that they were a great graduate. <h> High ATARs do n't  necessarily mean better/harder courses <p> In a system like this its inevitable that as some things move down , others move up , but remember this : ATAR cut-offs only reflect the rank of the last person to be accepted into a course , not the average . Where Nugent says ACUs falling ATARs reflect additional places , she also points to the fact that some universities have increased the amount of early offers they make to selected students prior to the main round , reducing the number of places available for first round offers and therefore increasing the ATAR cut-off . <p> Early offers do appear to be increasing . There were almost 5,000 less offers made in the main round this year when compared to 2013 , but early round offers increased by 7,698 . With this as a potential factor , high ATARs could also be considered a mark of exclusivity from a lack of main-round places , rather than sheer popularity or difficulty . Some universities do keep ATARs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket minimum of 80 across all of their courses this year . <h> Its about the course , not the number <p> Back in year 12 I chose a course that was more than 10 points lower than my rank as my first preference . Sure , my parents questioned me about it , and a few friends thought I was crazy not to use the marks I 'd worked for , but I was choosing something I actually wanted to learn about , something I found challenging , and that I was confident would lead me towards the kind of career I wanted . If I have any advice to give , its to look beyond the numbers . Research the courses , right down to their subjects and who teaches them , look at the university culture and where its focus lies , visit some places and above all , make sure you 're excited about it ! If you cant imagine yourself wanting to get out of bed to learn every day then you should probably rethink your options . No ones calling your mother if you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clear : the higher your ATAR the more choice you have , but that does n't  mean you have to use it like frequent flyer points and take the most expensive trip thinking it will be the best . Do n't  limit your expectations either way because with increased places , bonus points and plenty of alternative entry schemes , you can always find a way to get to where you want to be . And that might just be somewhere you did n't  expect . <p> Ready to get moving towards your dream career ? We have over 700 courses to choose from with and without ATAR requirements . <h> Ok . Now you know the score , I 'll give you some stats <p> Now that you have digested our big grain of salt , here 's a taste of what happened this round . And if you see something and you think you have a chance of getting into , its not too late but late fees will apply . Potential students can still apply through UAC but places will be limited .

These were mainly in education , arts and exercise and sports science . <p> Griffith University ( Gold Coast Campus ) had drops with an average of 11.43 per cent with courses spanning architecture , arts , business , communications , environment , digital media and government . Their biggest drop was in law , which went from an ATAR of 81.65 to 68.2 . <p> A total of 42 courses at Canberra University have increased by 2 points from 66 to 68 . These span the full range of study areas including arts , education , design , IT , medical science , commerce and international studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wales were adjusted to have minimum ATARs of 80 .

The Department of Education , Employment and Workplace Relations ( DEEWR ) has reported that several roles in the teaching and childcare profession are in demand nationally . As a trained teaching professional , you will not only have a career which empowers and shapes the future of up-and-coming generations , but you will also have a stable career .

Qualification requirements have changed too , with Australian childcare workers required to have a minimum of a Certificate III qualification by 2014 . <p> These changes spell good prospects for those with the right training and qualifications . If you are a patient and warm person who loves spending time with children , now is the time to train and begin your childcare career . <h> Secondary school teachers <p> According to DEEWR , high schools around the country have reported having difficulty recruiting teachers in some subjects , especially in maths and science .

A special needs teacher is qualified to develop programs that help children with a disability to develop and optimise their learning . <p> Recruitment is challenging for schools looking to employ teachers with special needs qualifications and experience . The dearth of special needs teachers is particularly pronounced in some regional areas . This profession can be challenging , but infinitely rewarding for anyone who wants to make a real difference in the lives of students affected by disability . <h> How to get into teaching <p> To become a teacher you need a passion for young people and the right qualifications .

@@71750880 @450880/ <h> Grass looks greener to one third of Australian workers <p> One third of Australian workers are planning to change jobs , according to a recent Hay Group survey . <p> This finding comes as further confirmation of employee dissatisfaction after a Drake International report from February 2010 found that as much as fifty per cent of Australian workers are thinking about changing their jobs . <p> During the economic downturn employees gritted their teeth and bore the brunt of more arduous conditions , thankful to have jobs at all . But the backlash has begun and the natives are getting restless . <p> With more jobs opening up , workers are starting to think of getting to a better place in their careers especially if the companies they work for havent done enough to take care of them during the tough times . <h> More jobs available <p> Around 28 000 new jobs a month have been created during the first five months of this year and the unemployment rate has remained steady at 5.2 per cent . <p> Office jobs have done particularly well , with job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year . Human resources jobs have also risen by about 80 per cent . <p> The growth in job ads for accounting , engineering and mining has temporarily stalled , and the sales and marketing sector withstood a 2.8 per cent decrease in June . The mining and engineering industries have almost certainly suffered as a result of the super mining tax controversy ( except in Queensland , where the sector rose by 10 per cent in June ) . <p> Some believe that the impending election is creating caution about hiring amongst employers , who want to see how workplace policy will be affected before taking on more staff . <h> The importance of employee engagement <p> Replacing staff is expensive . Hay Group estimates that it costs from 50 to 150 per cent of an employees salary to replace them so its worth trying to motivate workers to stay on . <p> Because of the threat of losing valuable staff members , increasing employee engagement has become a top priority amongst CEOs and human resources directors . According to the Hay Group report , those workplaces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with employee frustrations experience improved revenue growth , lower turnover and better employee performance . <p> William Werhane , managing director from Hay Group Insight , emphasises the importance of employee engagement . The workplace landscape has changed ; workers who , last year , were grateful to hold on to employment are sticking their heads above the parapet and gauging what the recovery means for their career prospects . This could spell particularly bad news for those companies who have failed to take necessary steps to implement effective enablement and engagement programs during the tough times. <p> Looking back to the last downturn in 2001/02 , Hay Group studies then saw that companies that kept a focus on employee engagement came out of the recession with better levels of motivation and loyalty , and a greater ability to attract and retain top talent , and this recession is no different , says Werhane . <p> Highly engaged and enabled workers undoubtedly create dramatically better business outputs , more loyal customers , and better financial performance during good times and bad . An enabling workplace can also actively deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could subsequently result in demotivated and frustrated staff who may start to feel the grass is greener elsewhere.

If it 's been a tough day I conk out and watch a DVD or play cards with friends . In the off-season I love to play golf and chill out at the lake . I 've finished school now , but when I was attending school I managed to squeeze all my study into the short rest periods in between training sessions . <h> How did you balance skiing and studying when you were at school ? <p> Up until Year 11 , I studied during school time and committed to skiing out of school hours . But midway through Year 11 , I began distance education and studied through correspondence so that I could concentrate more on my skiing . When Year 12 began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final year of the HSC into two years so I had time for both skiing and school . <h> What are the perks of your job ? <p> I spend a lot of time overseas as a world cup skier , so one of the perks is travelling for six months a year meeting lots of amazing people and experiencing different cultures in the countries I visit . I also take great pride in competing for my country . <h> What challenges do you encounter ? <p> Mogul skiing is a very high-impact sport , which can have serious consequences . Managing injuries is always a challenge , but we have a great team behind us working to keep us in the best shape we can be . If I 'm not skiing well , or I 'm facing injury woes , trying to balance my school or work commitments with training can become mentally draining . <h> What keeps you going in moments of doubt ? <p> It 's important to have a positive outlook , and to be confident in your abilities . Everyone competing shares a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I can gain confidence from in times of doubt . There 's always an exciting atmosphere surrounding competitions so it 's hard to get down sometimes . I set myself little goals all the time so that , as I achieve them , I can get closer to my end goal . <h> What is your goal for the future ? <p> My ultimate goal is to be successful at the 2010 Olympics . We have a great program in place my only other team mate , Dale Begg-Smith , won gold at the 2006 Olympics , and my Coach , Steve Desovich , is often regarded as the ' best coach in the world ' . So I am looking forward to a fast recovery from recent knee surgery , and achieving more top 10 results in World Cup events next season leading into the Olympics . <h> How do you get into the Olympics ? <p> We have to meet qualification criteria for this coming Northern Hemisphere season . Our first World Cup is in December 2008 and our last one is in March 2009 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the criteria has not been officially approved by the Australian Olympic Committee ( AOC ) yet , it will involve an accumulation of International Ski Federation ( FIS ) World Cup points . Points are gained from ' top 30 ' World Cup Competition finishes . <h> How do you prepare yourself before a competition ? <p> Prior to competition we generally have two days of training which we use to become familiar with the bumps and jumps on the course . In that time , we decide which course we will ski , what jumps to perform and the technique we need to get through certain areas . My discipline freestyle mogul skiing lasts around 24 seconds and in that time I travel 250 metres of moguls and do two inverted jumps . A split second mistake can make a big difference so it 's important that I know the course backwards , practise mental rehearsals and visualisation , and do a vigorous physical warm up . <h> Will you stay in the ski industry ? <p> I see myself working in the ski industry even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-impact sport that , as an athlete , the body can only last for so long . There 's not many people skiing at the elite level who are older than 30 . The skiing community is so great to be involved in , and I get great satisfaction from coaching and from helping the sport progress in Australia . I plan to start studying sports management and coaching science courses at university next year , so , once I finish skiing World Cup , I would love to remain involved in that capacity . 
@@71750906 @450906/ <h> Gerard Pratt - Assistant Manager of Events and Ceremonies , Australian War Memorial , Canberra <p> ' When I was younger I had two uncles who were in the navy and that was all I ever talked about . So since I was five , the navy was always something I knew I was going to do . ' <p> Gerard served in the navy for 17 years before joining the Australian War Memorial as a floor supervisor in the Visitor Services Team . He has worked in a few different positions at the Memorial and is now the assistant manager of events and ceremonies , which involves working on the Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies as well as many other special events and ceremonies that take place at the Memorial . He is still a member of the Navy Reserves . <h> Why did you join the navy ? <p> When I was younger I had two uncles who were in the navy and that was all I ever talked about . So since I was five , the navy was always something I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) where they were , what they were doing and how they were doing it . So as soon as I was old enough off , I went and enlisted . <h> What did you do while you were in the navy ? <p> I was working in communications . Initially I joined as a radio operator and my primary role was radio communications between ships and shore establishments through radios and satellites using automated teletype and morse code . In 2002 that position was amalgamated with the Signalman branch the people who communicate via visual signals such as semaphore , flags and morse code through flashing light and in addition the position took on IT as well . So we became super communicators because we did radio and visual signals and IT . <p> I did 17 years in the navy , and in that time I served ashore in Melbourne , Canberra , Darwin , Sydney and Nowra . I was also posted ashore to Dili in East Timor from January to May 2000 just after the Australian Forces went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an independent nation so that was pretty exciting . I also served in a number of ships , including the destroyers HMAS Brisbane , HMAS Hobart and HMAS Perth . My last sea posting was in HMAS Kanimbla where we were involved with the initial actions against Iraq in 2003 . <h> Why did you decide to retire from the navy ? <p> I loved the navy to death , and I still do , but while I was in the navy I rarely saw my wife and we wanted to have kids . A number of people with whom I 'd served said that if they had their time again they would have discharged and been there for their kids to witness first steps and that sort of thing and I thought there was something to what they were saying . I decided that I needed to identify a job before I got out , which is how I came up with the idea of working at the Australian War Memorial . When I got back from Iraq in 2003 I approached the Memorial and asked what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job there . They suggested I volunteer and do a Certificate IV in Museum Practices at the Canberra Institute of Technology ( CIT ) . So for just over two years I was a volunteer in the Discovery Room with all the school kids and , at the same time , I was completing the course at CIT . I was quite lucky because the navy were more than willing to accommodate my requests to attend CIT during normal work hours and also work at the Memorial as a volunteer . <h> How has your experience in the navy helped you in your current job ? <p> The navy is a big team and no-one works alone . I 've been a member of a team in every position I 've held here at the Memorial . It 's not as though I 'm working as an individual and doing my own thing I 'm part of a bigger team . Every decision that I make has a follow-on effect . In a similar way to being in the navy , you 've got to look out for your team-mates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills the navy helped me to hone such as time management and discipline in general have also been of great help . <h> What are you responsible for as assistant manager of events and ceremonies ? <p> The team I 'm in is responsible for the running of major ceremonies such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day . We put the main building blocks together and facilitate the events on the day to ensure that everything runs smoothly . We also conduct smaller ceremonies with veteran groups such as plaque dedications and wreathlayings . I also assist in coordinating visits by Presidents and Prime Ministers of visiting nations as well as prominent VIPs , heads of defence and politicians to the Memorial . Whenever we put on a new exhibition our team looks after the launch on the night prior to the opening . We also organise events such as the Memorial 's Christmas carols and things like our biannual Open Day . <h> How many people work in your team ? <p> There are six members of the Events and Ceremonies team from the manager down . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special exhibition is Lawrence of Arabia and the Light Horse . Our newest gallery , Conflicts 1945 to today , was opened a month ago by the Prime Minister and covers every conflict from the Korean War right up to the conflicts today in Iraq and Afghanistan . <h> What does the Australian War Memorial have planned for Anzac Day this year ? <p> For us , Anzac Day is pretty big . Last year we got 28 000 people to the Dawn Service and 18 000 to the National Ceremony . The Dawn Service starts at 5.30 am and finishes at 6 am . Then we have about four hours to turn the site around for the more formal National Ceremony at 10.15 am , which usually has the Governor-General , Prime Minister and a number of other VIPs in attendance . As per every National Ceremony at the Memorial , one of the highlights is the march-past by the veteran organisations , which this year numbers just over 70 different groups . <p> This year , the day before ( 24 April ) is also going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Armoured Regiment Association , also known as Black Hats , and the Olympic Torch will be passing through Canberra . There 'll be 600 or 700 Black Hats here for the plaque dedication ceremony on April 24 , which puts us under a bit more pressure , and as soon as we finish with the Black Hats we 'll turn around and look after the Olympic Torch and then we do Anzac Day . It will create a lot of extra work for us , but that 's the business we are in . <h> When do you start preparing for big events , such as Anzac Day ? <p> As soon as we finish Remembrance Day in November , we start coordinating with RSL ACT to plan Anzac Day in April . This means sending emails , making phone calls , organising audio and booking seating to make sure we 've got it all under control . There 's so much work going on in the background . Until I found myself in this team , I did n't realise how much work goes into making a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about 2 am on Anzac Day and finishes after 4 pm . At first I did n't think the long day would affect me , as I had previously done 18-hour days in the Gulf in Kanimbla , but by the time we 'd finished packing everything up after my first Anzac Day in the team last year , I was absolutely exhausted I got home and slept through my favourite Anzac Day footy game between Essendon and Collingwood . <h> Who has been the most impressive person you 've met in your job ? <p> Visitor wise to the Memorial , I would n't say anyone in particular , but there are certain visits that I 've been responsible for that I 've been proud to be part of . My first major visit by a prominent person was the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Tony Blair . Since then I 've been responsible for visits by a number of foreign Heads of State and Governments . Regardless of whether it 's Tony Blair or the President of East Timor , I think they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I actually get to chat to them all , I usually communicate with their organising team to make the visit happen . <p> From a work perspective , I would probably say our director , Steve Gower . He has taught me a lot about my position and what is required from it , be that a gentle push in the right direction or a subtle word of advice . <h> Do you need any particular qualifications or experience for this type of job ? <p> I think I kind of fell into this position . If you 'd asked me three years ago if I could see myself in an events career I would have said no . As it turned out , my training within the navy in teamwork and discipline put me in good stead for the transition from military to public sector life . By all means qualifications in areas like cultural heritage or conservation will assist you a lot if that 's the field you want to work in . I think I 've been quite lucky as I 've been in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success has been about hard work and a willingness to learn , which put me in good stead for this position
