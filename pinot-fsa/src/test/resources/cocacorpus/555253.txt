You can also use Mission Control or press Command-Tab to change your focus . <p> Working with the menu bar <p> Your MacBook will show a menu bar on every screen .

A data source contains the information that changes in each label , such as the name and address of each recipient . <p> Merge fields that you insert into the main document instruct Word where to print information from the data source . When you perform the mail merge , Word replaces merge fields in the main document with information from the data source . Each row ( or record ) in the data source produces an individual label . <p> The following procedure demonstrates how to perform a mail merge to create labels . <h> Step 1 : Create the mailing label document <p> Start a new document to create a new label , or open an existing document that you used previously to merge labels . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail merge .
