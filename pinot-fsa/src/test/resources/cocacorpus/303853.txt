Urgent was created to help advocate for NYCs Death Row dogs and cats . <h> How did Urgent get Started ? <p> Urgent started as a desperate attempt to save some dogs and it has turned into an enormous community of caring people , just as outraged as we are . ACC refuses to advertise animals about to be killed so we , at Urgent , took up the cause . We collect as much relevant information as possible on these forgotten animals and actively promote them through our extensive social media network . Since 2010 , Urgent has gained well over 70,000 Facebook fans and has helped find loving forever homes for thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . <h> Why We Do What We Do <p> Urgent believes that all ACC animals deserve compassionate , professional care , along with a sustained effort to place them into new homes . We believe that ACC has a moral and ethical obligation to earnestly explore every possibility before killing an animal . Advertising , community outreach , creative marketing , and harnessing the power of social media should all be effectively employed . Urgent also serves as a watchdog for the city shelter , documenting and exposing instances of neglect and systemic abuse of homeless companion animals that most private citizens are never aware of . Urgent is proud of our virtual community and we hope to continue to expand our advocacy for New Yorks most underserved animals . <p> Team Urgent at Skechers GoWalk 2015 <p> Karen Pepp with Pebbles <p> Together , we are fighting to reform the NYC shelter system and save the thousands of adoptable animals being needlessly destroyed each year . The battle is long and the list of casualties continues to climb but we will not give up not until there are none .

MEDICAL BEHAVIOR : 6/8/17 During her initial medical exam Apple was tense ENERGY LEVEL : We have no history on Apple so we can not be certain of her behavior in a home environment .

XPlace with a New Hope partner : Due to the warning and distance-increasing behaviors shown in the care center , the behavior department recommends Apple be placed with a New Hope placement partner who is able to provide an experienced adult-only foster home . A period of decompression is recommended to allow Apple to acclimate comfortably to her new environment ; force-free , reward based training only is advised when introducing Apple to new and unfamiliar situations . Potential challenges : XHandling/touch sensitivity : Apple has snapped when her paw was handled , showing discomfort with touch in certain areas . It is important to avoid touching Apples paws at this time and to be cautious when touching her in other areas as we do not know where he may have other sensitivities . Positive reinforcement , reward based training should be used to pair touch with good things such as food rewards in order to teach Apple to be more comfortable with this . XFearful/potential for defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need time to warm up to the handler as she initially presents as a fearful dog , avoiding contact , shying away from direct touch .

We recommend consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eliminating outside , and we advise to never punish Midnightly for accidents inside as it will just set her back in her training . Due to her history with the crate we do not recommend crating her for housetraining . XSeparation anxiety : From the information provided it is unclear if any of the destructive or elimination behaviors may be anxiety-related , but Midnightly has broken several crates and appears to be anxious when crated . We recommend taking a break from crates while Midnightly adjusts to her new home . If crating is desired in the future , she will need to build new positive associations with the crate . She should be fed and given treats in the crate , and should not be closed in it until she enters the crate readily and settles . The crate should never be used as punishment .

@@100709100 @4909100/ <h> Urgent 's Response to ACC 's New Placement Process <p> February 12 , 2011 <p> Before September 1st , when the ACC introduced its new Placement Process guidelines , complete with new colors and vague new behavior ratings , the animal rescue community could take comfort in one simple fact : no matter how corrupt , mismanaged and ignorant the ACC management was , even those animals that were most wronged by its staff and " behaviorists " had a chance at rescue. - Dogs and cats who were particularly scared of the shelter environment , and responded negatively to staff attempts at " handling " were routinely classified as Moderate , Questionable or Severe. - It was left to dedicated volunteers and rescuers to sift through the bullshit and attempt to figure out an animals true disposition. - Indeed , the reason the ACC has been so opposed to our Urgent Facebook page is that they hated the dissemination of observations that opposed their draconian decisions . <p> Now , the ACC has given themselves the power to condemn any animal they choose with a No Placement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public from saving under any circumstances. - Does anyone remember Oreos Law Assemblyman Micah Kellners bill to force kill-shelters to release an animal to rescue if one agreed to take it ? - You can bid farewell to such notions , because with these new Placement Process rules , the ACC is claiming power to kill an animal regardless of how many rescue groups may have placement. - Let 's say an animal is abused and requires careful rehabilitation and behavior modification. - This is a process that not all rescue groups can afford to provide , but to prohibit those groups that are capable from trying is effectively equipping shelter managers with loaded handguns and releasing them into the wards . <p> Surely with these six benign new letters , there must be some new degree of fairness , right ? - Well , the ACC left out the most crucial aspect of these new Designations : exactly which of these behavior scores will be eligible for the nightly Euth Lists ? - And another unanswered question : how exactly will the supremely unfair SAFER test factor into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards his food still be considered eligible to be killed for Temper ? - We cant forget Dr. Janezckos crowning contribution to the ACC in the summer of 2009 , when she unilaterally made all Moderate dogs and cats eligible to be killed , effectively making only animals who received As and Bs on their tests exempt from being killed for Temper. - Now that Janezcko is in the protective womb of the ASPCA with her new job , and the ACC is still without a Medical Director or Director of Operations ( the two titles she shuffled between to avoid liability ) who will make such decisions at the ACC ? <p> GREENanimals are those animals who were relaxed , easy to handle , and who showed no concerning behavior during the exam . <p> BLUEanimals are those animals who were tense and nervous but mostly still and relatively easy to handle during the exam . <p> YELLOWanimals are those animals who were nervous , actively resisted examination , and required the use of restraint equipment or techniques , but did not exhibit aggressive behaviors during the exam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint techniques and/or equipment and did exhibited aggressive behaviors during the exam . <p> REDanimals are those who exhibited severe aggression and required the use of significant restraint and/or sedation during the exam <p> Previously , contrary to all reason and fairness , the ACC used the SAME behavior classifications for animals during Initial Medical Evaluations as they did for SAFER tests. - This meant that if an animal was scared during Intake , they were effectively doomed by this result , as they would be fast-tracked to a SAFER which usually confirmed that they were indeed frightened . If a vet tech , with no training in animal behavior , declared that an animal was aggressive during Intake , stickers marked CAUTION are placed on a cage , scaring away volunteers or potential adopters/rescuers for the remainder of the animals time. - This new rainbow of nameless grades is in fact a step in the right direction toward fairness , but it is being thrown on top of a rotting foundation , where staff untrained in behavior have the power to make behavior ratings , and in which not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ending up on the Euth List for kennel cough. - Until the ACC promises a behavior evaluation for every animal before being able to kill them , Intake ratings such as these will hold an unfair weight over animals lives. - At the moment , there are TWO employees in all of ACC certified to perform dog SAFER tests. - There is not a single person certified to perform cat behavior tests. - You do the math . <p> We will touch on one last point , which is the four new " factors " that will affect an animals behavior classification : <p> 1 . Intake **26;232;TOOLONG sheets <p> 2 . Observations during medical exams and treatments <p> 3 . In-shelter observations from staff and volunteers <p> 4 . SAFER assessments for dogs and consistent cage <p> observations for cats <p> 1. - Oh , Intake questionnaires ! - This is a fancy term for Owner Surrender Profiles , which the ACC notoriously neglects. - Unless a new policy is enacted to force all ( not just a few ) front desk staff to extract useful information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with useless tidbits such as " Fed Dry Food " or " Spoiled " as the only observations after their years of owning a pet. - Any informed ACC volunteer will tell you that crucial information , such as THIS PIT BULL LIVED WITH TWO CATS or THIS DOG WAS SURRENDERED WITH HIS BROTHER is routinely ignored during " Intake Questionnaires " <p> 2. - Observations during Medical Exams ? - Raise your hand if you own otherwise adoring , gentle and obedient animal who becomes fearful or even aggressive during Medical Exams ? - Thought so . <p> 3. - Input from Volunteers ! - Does this mean that if a tireless member of the Compassion Program discovers that a dog on the Euth List for Temper is in fact loving and merely in need of a gentle touchthat the animal will be given a chance at Adoption or Placement ? - What about a dog who barks when the " behaviorist " approaches his cage , but volunteers actually have no problem coaxing the dog out of the cage each day with a soothing voice and a non-confrontational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in-shelter observations from volunteers " , right ? <p> 4. - As we asked above , exactly how much weight will the obsolete SAFER test still carry ? - Will emaciated dogs still be condemned to death due to Food Aggression two days after arriving at the ACC ? <p> The bottom line we all need to remember and press our elected officials about is this : the shelter is run by an inept and ignorant management staff , who should never , under any circumstances , be given the full power of life or death over a situation they can hardly be bothered to properly assess. - There is simply too much room for human error and laziness for the ACC to have the power to label an animal No Placement and not let rescue groups save lives . And if the ACC is going to cough up niceties like considering volunteers observations regarding behavior , then perhaps they should inform the volunteers about that. - Because standard operating procedure is for ACC management to ignore any volunteer email protesting a dog or cats placement on the euth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 'll find yourself in a disciplinary meeting begging for your volunteer position . <p> If you 're bothered by any of the unanswered questions raised in this note , please , by all means : write to : Julie Bank ( email protected ) , Richard Gentles ( email protected ) and Ellen Curtis ( email protected ) , and ask them. - Wed love to see their responses .

You founded the life-saving New Hope department in the ACC shelter system , and continue to fund it to this day. - With that said , we turn to you because this ship is sinking on your watch. - If there was any question about Julie Banks intentions , they were laid bare on network television for all to see . The dictatorial way that Julie manages the ACC has cost New Hope its most dedicated employee , and now conditions have reached State of Emergency proportions . <p> Patches FAILED by the ACC <p> For example , before today , there was no Manhattan New Hope department since Saturday. - The only employee left on Sundays called out sick , and then the department was off for Memorial Day. - Volunteers are being bombarded with emails from concerned rescue groups about what to do to save the dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euth list were talking about sick and injured animals that need to leave the shelter ASAP that have no way of getting transports scheduled. - Just today , the Mayors Alliance delivered an adult cat to a rescue group , and when the rescuer opened the cat carrier door , the cat was dead . <p> Prescott FAILED by the ACC <p> Last night , a mother dog named Mandy ( A897379 ) and her seven puppies with ringworm were on the euth list , but did not even receive a plea. - How were they saved ? - People saw the pictures and the euth list on this website. - While you , Jane , want the animals to get out of the shelter as soon as possible , before they can get sick or their existing condition worsens , the remaining New Hope staff prefers to play Russian roulette with the euth list. - They simply wait until a 4 month-old puppy gets sick and let the euth list sort him out , rather than try to find placement in advance . These are employees are paid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxpayers of New York . <p> LEXI FAILED by the ACC <p> Tonight , there are 28 dogs and 42 cats on the euth list in Manhattan and Brooklyn. - The Interim Shelter Manager in training , Melissa Webber ( a cronyism hire courtesy of Julie Bank Melissa is a good friend from the West coast ) took so long to make the massive euth list that it did not even go out to rescuers until 6:21PM. - That 's an hour and twenty-one minutes late in an already tight time window for rescuers. - Not a single plea was sent until 8:30pm tonight , and they were direct copies of the euth list into emails. - Euth list pleas are doubly important because many rescue groups do n't  receive the list , so rely on pleas to know who is in danger . To have a veritable massacre of adoptable , coughing dogs and cats of all ages and do next to nothing about it is unconscionable. - These are placeable animals if someone would do their job correctly . <p> Suzy FAILED by the ACC while a rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying because Julie Bank fired Emily Tanen without even having a replacement . The entire two years she worked at ACC , no one bothered to recognize how much work she did for the dogs until she was terminated. - Now we know. - If you were powerless to keep Emily employed , we beg you to figure out a solution to this black hole left in her wake. - We come to you in a time of desperation engulfing the ACC. - Volunteers and rescuers are on the verge of outright revolt due to the shockingly inept management by everyone from the Executive Director to the shelter managers to the failing New Hope department. - Staff , volunteers and rescuers are afraid to speak up out of fear of retribution and the scornful responses they receive from Julie if they come to her with suggestions or concerns . Jane , you are the only person with the power to fix this situation. - Something must be done , because the New Hope department is failing the citys animals who need them most .

Despite being a strapping boy at 72 lbs. , todays Butter is a shrinking violet . And as we walk along the snow-dusted path to the park , beautiful Butters amber tail stays firmly between his legs .

His family fell into unfortunate circumstance , as families often do , and Butter , well his life , it changed for good . But as I know well , and as Butters begun to see , change , while never easy , is often right . Butter has continued to open up since then , developing the old fashioned way , slow and steady , just churning along .

Once in the yard Butter revels in the white stuff , takes his treats gently , and grants me the honor of petting that gorgeous coat again and again . He is nothing but wags none more so than when he spots a furry friend playing in the pen adjacent to us , and drops into a play bow tempting her to join the game .

In the care center Walter displayed low energy . <p> RECOMMENDATIONS : New Hope Only XNo children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarding : Walters previous owner notes that he may growl/snap when his food bowl is approached . We recommend that Walter be left along while eating , and that food guarding behavior modification steps ( available at ASPCApro.org ) be utilized if this behavior is problematic in his future home . Nothing should ever be taken directly out of Walters mouth , and any time something is removed he should be rewarded with a high value treat or toy . He should be taught the " drop " cue and trade-up games . XDestructive behavior : Walter is reported to show destructive behavior in the home , such as chewing on furniture . We are unaware of what , if any , attempts were made to remedy this behavior but we suggest to future adopters that Walter will need to be provided with physical and mental stimulation and with a variety of appropriate and engaging chew toys so he can engage in necessary chewing behavior without damage to human objects . XHandling sensitivity : Walter has been noted to become uncomfortable with handling at times , especially when a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go slow and give Walter the option to walk away from any social interaction . Walter should never be forced to approach anything that he is uncomfortable with or to submit to petting or handling . It should always be Walter 's choice to approach a new person or thing . Walter would do best in an initially calm and quiet home environment and should be given time to acclimate to him new surroundings . XFearful/potential for defensive aggression : Walter has displayed all appropriate warning signals in his previous home when made uncomfortable . A period of decompression is recommended to allow Walter to acclimate comfortably to his new environment ; force-free , reward based training only is advised when introducing Walter to new and unfamiliar situations .
