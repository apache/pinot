Some commissioners say it was a last ditch effort to negotiate with a separate entity , the Sac and Fox Nation . <p> Sac and Fox Housing Authoritys Board of Commissioners Chairman Forrest Walker issued a statement this week in response to the denial of a request to vacate a 50-foot stretch of Kimberly Street by the Shawnee City Commission . <p> City Commissioners butted heads three-against-three at Monday nights meeting over whether to approve the item . Now the housing authority is scrambling to figure out how to continue progress of their $2.5 million project . <p> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrod made a motion to table the item for 30 days , so the Sac &amp; Fox Nation might " come to the table " in a separate issue regarding a proposed Bryan Street exit on Interstate 40 . He labeled the motion a " last ditch effort . " <p> With support for that motion from only Harrod , Mayor Wes Mainord and Commissioner Keith Hall , the item was not tabled . <p> After that , a motion was made to approve the ordinance request , but it failed , being supported only by Commissioners Linda Agee , Lesa Shaw and Micheal Dykstra . <p> City officials have agreed they support the $2.5 million housing project itself , the issue of dissent lies within a tactic being used by some commissioners to try to force negotiations with the Sac and Fox Nation . More importantly , the immediate future of the housing authoritys project has unwittingly become caught in the crosshairs . Randy Snead , Housing Authority compliance officer and project coordinator , said they were completely taken aback by the failure of their request . They went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance request was recommended by the city staff , " said City Manager Justin Erickson . <p> " It was the city who suggested it in the first place , " Walker confirmed . " Our proposed housing development is an appropriate use of its land , it meets all the standards of a quality infill development for the neighborhood , and it complies with all the building codes and standards of the City of Shawnee , Walker said . <p> Housing Authority officials believe they are being thrown into the middle of a tug-of-war that does n't  have anything to do with them . <p> " Were just another non-profit organization trying to do our job . Just because we are Sac and Fox does n't  mean we are run by the Tribe , " Snead said . <p> Walker said , " The Sac and Fox Housing Authority , though created by the Sac and Fox Nation , is not a department of the Tribe . It does not receive any of its funds for operation and/or management from the Tribe . We are an independent standalone quasi-governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act ( NAHASDA ) of 1996 . " <p> Chief of the Sac and Fox Nation George Thurman confirmed that the housing authority does not have any control over the Tribes decision-making . <p> Some of the city commissioners said they were unclear on the relationship between the Tribe and the housing authority , though the distinction did not appear to sway their views . <p> " Were just trying to bring ( Sac and Fox Nation Chief George Thurman ) to the table on the Bryan Street exit issue . Lots of people want that exit . I 'm not against the housing project , " said Commissioner James Harrod . <p> Commissioner Keith Hall shared Harrods stance . <p> " Its a good ( housing ) project . I just want to facilitate a meeting with the Tribe over the issue of the Bryan exit , " Hall said . <p> Others have a very different view on the matter . <p> " I believe if the City Commission receives a legitimate request and it is recommended by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strictly on that request . It should not be used as a tool to convince the requester to comply with other issues that are not relevant to the request . It is an abuse of power by the commission , " <p> Commissioner Linda Agee said . <p> Commissioner Lesa Shaw said during the City Commission meeting that the city should not leverage its position when individuals ask for approval of an ordinance . <p> " I , for one , am very displeased with the certain elected officials here today that would try to stop Sac and Fox from development , " Shaw said . <p> What 's at stake <p> Billy Komahcheet , executive director of the Sac and Fox Housing Authority , said the Sac and Fox Housing Authority has to have everything in line by Oct. 10 , 2015 , to keep the funding it has secured from HUD and the approved local bank loan to start the project . The delay ( because of the ordinance not being approved ) puts that funding in jeopardy if the housing authority ca n't secure another way to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic impact that a project this size can potentially bring to Shawnee and the surrounding areas is being stymied by an issue that is not directly related to the housing authority and they have no control or influence over negotiations with the Sac and Fox Tribe . The injection of $2.5 million in new dollars into the local economy was set to begin in September . Because of the commissioners decision , that is now being delayed . <p> Snead said with this project the Sac and Fox Housing Authority would be able offer affordable housing - calculated at 20 percent of gross annual income - for 23 Native American families who are presently commuting and on the waiting list for housing in Shawnee . <p> Komahcheet said there are currently 92 families eligible and waiting for housing opportunities in the Shawnee area . Although the majority of the applicants on the waiting list are from the surrounding towns such as Cushing , Stroud , Prague , Seminole and Oklahoma City , there are many that are currently located out of state - a few as far away as California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family ties . <p> What 's next ? <p> The situation potentially can be resolved a few ways . <p> Erickson said the City Commission may reconsider . <p> Three Commissioners voted against the ordinance request . Commissioner James Harrod said he will not change his vote unless he gets a response from Sac and Fox Nation Chief George Thurman depending on what he says . <p> Though Commissioner Keith Hall echoes Harrods sentiment , he did not directly say what his vote might be in the future . <p> Mayor Wes Mainord could not be reached for comment . <p> Erickson said the Sac and Fox Housing Authority can go to court to vacate Kimberly Street . <p> At this stage , Komahcheet said " We are hoping to possibly educate the city commissioners and hopefully get at least one to change their mind and possibly get it back on the agenda for consideration at the upcoming Aug. 3 council meeting . " <p> Komahcheet said that the Sac and Fox Housing Authority can put the land in trust and bypass the city altogether . <p> Even though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping that the situation can be resolved without that step .

Arbitrator Daniel J. Boudreau , former State of Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice , ruled in favor of the CPN in a dispute between CPN and the Oklahoma Tax Commission . <p> A judge ruled Monday that the Oklahoma Tax Commission ( OTC ) lost in its attempt to collect sales taxes from the Citizen Potawatomi Nation ( CPN ) . <p> Arbitrator Daniel J. Boudreau , former State of Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice , ruled in favor of the CPN in a dispute between CPN and the Oklahoma Tax Commission . <p> " Federal law protecting tribal sovereignty interests pre-empts and invalidates the state 's sales tax on CPN 's sales in question , " Justice Boudreau said in his decision . <p> " We are gratified to read the final decision by former Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Barrett . " It confirms what we 've said all along . The state government acted unlawfully in its attempt to tax tribal enterprises operating on Indian trust land . " <p> The tribe requested arbitration after the OTC filed a complaint in its Administrative Proceedings Division on May 28 , 2014 , seeking to revoke permits for sales tax , low point beer and mixed beverages from all tribal enterprises including FireLake Entertainment Center , FireLake Corner Store , FireLake Discount Foods , FireLake Express Grocery and Grand Casino Hotel and Resort . <p> The State of Oklahoma said CPN was obligated to collect , report and pay state sales taxes on sales at all tribal businesses under the gaming compact . The Nation disputed that , arguing that the State of Oklahoma was attempting to use the gaming compact to unlawfully impose state sales taxes on tribal land . <p> Boudreau stated in the arbitration award that the " Federal and tribal interests must be weighed against state interests . When a state imposes a tax on non-member activity on Indian land , the courts apply a flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalid . " <p> Specifically , Boudreau found that that the Nation has significant federal and tribal interests in CPNs self-governance , economic self-sufficiency , and self-determination . <p> " We have diversified our businesses so that our government revenue does not only depend on gaming , " Barrett said . " In order to support our government , provide services to Oklahoma citizens and create more economic development , we charge the same sales tax at our enterprises as the non-tribal communities near them . We do this not only to provide needed revenue , but because it is the fair thing to do . We do not want an unfair advantage created from a tax exemption . " <p> Boudreau also found that the State of Oklahoma possesses no economic interest beyond a general quest for additional revenue by seeking to impose a sales tax on the Nation 's transactions and therefore suffers no uncompensated economic burden arising therefrom . <p> In response , Shawnee City Commissioners weighed in on the decision . <p> Ward 4 City Commissioner Keith Hall said the decision was expected . " Arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but is often reversed when it goes to court . " <p> There is no impact on the city at all for now , Hall said . " I believe the state will still address this issue when compacts are negotiated at the time of renewal . This recent arbitrator decision does not impact the compact negotiations , " Hall said . <p> Ward 5 Commissioner Lesa Shaw said she did n't know all the details of the arbitration , but she believes the ruling was just . <p> " Indian tribes are domestic sovereign nations and should be treated as such , " Shaw said . <p> When the tax issue was brought up before the City , she said , " There were those of us on the City Commission who opposed this taxation based on our own personal understanding of tribes having sovereign rights . This arbitration ruling confirms that . " <p> She said , " I believe that Shawnee should consider tribes in the community decision-making process so that partnerships are formed and resources are shared . " <p> Ward 2 Commissioner Linda Agee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the ruling . " But , my voting record shows I opposed the adversarial approach from the beginning and tried to get commissioners to mediate and partner with the tribes instead , but I was in the minority , " she said . <p> As of press time , Ward 3 Commissioner James Harrod and Ward 6 Commissioner Micheal Dykstra could not be reached and Mayor Wes Mainord and City Manager Justin Erickson declined comment . <p> Barrett said the tribe already makes many contributions to the community . <p> " Our goal is to improve the quality of life in this Pottawatomie County , including the communities around us and we do that by creating opportunities for all people through quality jobs and increased services in our area of economic impact , " said Barrett . " Our economic impact is now more than $550 million per year with gaming as a reinvestment revenue source . It has allowed us to create 2,400 jobs in our rural communities , which in Pottawatomie County equates to 70 percent of all new job creation in the last ten years . "

Kelsey died Oct. 11 , 2005 , at her home near Meeker , where she lived with her mother and stepfather ; cause of death was blunt force trauma to the abdomen . At the time of her death , Kelsey was being overseen by the courts and child welfare workers because of suspected abuse . Kelseys father was returning to Oklahoma from the military when she died . In 2006 , he filed suit against DHS , its director and others , alleging Kelsey died because of failures at DHS . The civil case has been making its way through the courts for more than three years . " Me and my attorneys , Derek Burch and Joe White Jr. , settled with the state in federal court and received the maximum amount allowed by law , " Briggs told the News-Star Tuesday .

It will be up to a federal judge to determine if Kelseys mother , Raye Dawn Smith , 29 , is entitled to receive any of that money . Smith , who faced trial in July 2007 , was convicted of enabling child abuse in Kelseys death and is currently in prison . During her trial , jurors heard about the 10 months of Kelseys life before her death , including injuries involving a broken collar bone , two broken legs and numerous bruises . Following her trial , Smith said she did n't  hurt Kelsey and said , " I did n't  sit back and let it happen . " Kelseys stepfather , Michael Lee Porter , 29 , was initially charged with first-degree murder in the childs death . He is currently serving 30 years in prison after pleading guilty in February 2007 to enabling child abuse , although he blamed Smith for Kelseys death . Briggs said Smith should n't be entitled to any of the money . " I believe Raye Dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn was convicted of enabling Kelseys abuse and sentenced to 27 years in prisonshe does not deserve one red cent , " Briggs said . " I would be shocked if the judge gave her anything . All that Raye Dawn needs is to serve time in prison and think about all the pain she has caused , " Briggs added . The $100,000 part of the settlement was paid by Eastern Oklahoma Youth Services , which was under contract with DHS and had a worker assigned to Kelsey in the months before her death , with the last home visit occurring the same day Kelsey died . Court records show that both the state of Oklahoma and Eastern Oklahoma Youth Services continue to deny wrongdoing in this matter despite paying the settlement . Kelseys death prompted a new Oklahoma law in her name that was aimed at improving training of court-appointed child advocates and to makes judges more accountable for their rulings in child-placement cases .

" We 've had more than 61,000 people at the lake since July 1 and were planning to add an equestrian trail , " Dillon said . " We 've also had a lot of phone calls about deer hunting , so we will start opening it for that more too . " Just days before the annual Blackberry Festival and as the Fourth of July weekend began , the city of McLoud took on management of the Wes Watkins Reservoir . The reservoir was previously managed by the Pottawatomie County Development Authority . The decision to change management hands came after months of debates between PCDA board of trustees members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manager Jim Thompson and was finally decided by Shawnee city leaders . Shawnee city commissioners had the authority of deciding the lakes management , as the city is responsible for its care due to tax-free bonds issued to Shawnee to build a treatment facility for water it draws from the reservoir . But several PCDA board members did n't  believe the change was the right move for the lake and did n't  want to open it up as it is now . Previously , visitors had to pay to enter the lake area and the gates were locked at night . The lake also was closed from about November to late February or March . Now , visitors may enter the lake free , 24 hours per day , any day . Fees for fishing , camping and boating were lowered with McLouds takeover , as well . William Kiesel , a Midwest City resident , said he is especially fond of the lake and is very pleased with McLouds management of it so far . " Ive been coming here for several years but they would close about Nov. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , I missed all my cold weather camping , " he said . " I like camping in the colder weather because its not so crowded , its cool and its quiet . I 'm not much of a fisherman but I do it for something to do . Its quiet and relaxing now but it gets real crowded in the summer . " Kiesel said he was concerned at first when he heard there would no longer be a fee to enter the lake but said that fear is completely gone now . " I thought there might be more trash when they opened it up but there 's not , " he said . " They had lots and lots of rules before and limited access . Its prices are less expensive now and you can come and go as you please , 24 hours a day . Before , they manned the booth and you could go out any time but you could n't come back , so that 's an improvement . And its still nice and clean . But the water level seems down a little . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lake now too , although he also had some concerns initially when the idea of McLoud taking over was mentioned . " I have an annual pass that was issued by the Pottawatomie County Development Authority folks that is still honored by McLoud but I paid full price for it and it ends Friday , so I thought I ought to take advantage of it now , " he said . " Its free to come out and look around but there are still fees for some things they are just a lot cheaper . And if the Pottawatomie people had it , it would be closed right now . " Freeman said he rarely brought his boat to the lake prior to McLoud taking it over but will launch it in the upcoming new year because of reduced rates and because his daughter and 17-year-old grandson are staying with him while his son-in-law is stationed in Korea . " I come out here frequently and now I 'm going to introduce my grandson to the lake , " he said . " The people who ran it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  changed . But I 'm retired and on a fixed income , so every bit I can save helps . McLoud is doing a better job sprucing up the camping areas and the McLoud Police Department comes down here to police the area and makes you feel better . They have been real nice and professional and make you feel safe . " Freeman said he and his daughter , Angel Gumbiner , like walking along the shoreline to look for mussels and snails to take home to her aquariums , as well . But no matter what activities are added at the lake , he said one thing will definitely keep him coming back . " The best seller for me is them reducing the price , " he said .

Even though these letters are peppered with half-truths and misinformation , Mr. Crain is free to publish the letters because he lives in a liberal society . Beginning with the Enlightenment , liberal thought proposed that people should have the freedom to criticize their government and to elect the people they thought could best govern . However , citizens should be responsible in their criticisms . Mr. Crains June 5 letter attempts to hold President Obama responsible for an event in San Diego County which Obama had absolutely nothing to do with . Someone complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego County . A county code enforcement officer believed these meetings constituted " religious assembly " outside approved locations and therefore violated the countys land use regulations . He issued a citation warning of escalating fines if they did not stop meeting in the home . Since then , the county has issued a formal apology to Pastor Jones and has rescinded the warning citation , vowing to review regulations on religious assembly in the county ( SignOnSanDiego.com ) . No one involved in this incident suggested that it had anything to do with the Obama administration . In addition , Mr. Crain is so desperate to find fault with President Obama that he completely twists an informative statement by Obama . Mr. Crain says that " ( according to Obama ) we are no longer to be considered a Christian nation but we are one of the biggest Muslim nations in the world. " President Obama has not said that , " We are no longer to be considered a Christian nation . " When this made-up first part is omitted and the remainder of the sentence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was intended to be . The United States has 6.4 million Muslim citizens ( islamicpopulation.com ) , which means that it has the 32nd largest Muslim population among 195 countries in the world . Since the United States has 306.6 million citizens , about 2 percent of the population is Muslim . No one would say that the United States is therefore a Muslim nation . Mr. Crain might make more effective arguments if he would calm down , think more clearly about cause and effect , and be sure that his facts and quotations are correct .

The first of these varieties to be introduced to the market was " Endless Summer " a mophead ( big rounded bloom ) variety , a cousin to the standard " Nikko Blue " known for many years . Like Nikko Blue a gardener may influence the color of the blooms by applying Soil Sulfur or Aluminum Sulfate for blue blooms or Hydrated Lime for pink blooms . These shrubs are very dependable and beautiful in the garden . Plant them in light shade or morning sun areas with shelter from the hot afternoon sun . They will need regular moisture . The next variety is " Blushing Bride " which has large white rounded blooms that turn light pink as they mature . The main effect is white blooms . The same culture requirements for shade and moisture apply . Mulch is always helpful around plants that are sensitive to heat and dry conditions . Use pecan mulch if you are seeking blue blooms or bark or cottonseed hulls around those for pink blooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , " Twist and Shout " which has a lace-cap bloom , flat blooms of tiny centers surrounded by open florets in a circle , and " Light of Day , " with lace-cap blooms and variegated foliage .

That , and addressing safety concerns are the two main reasons the Oklahoma Department of Transportation will widen I-40 to six lanes from the county line west to the Interstate 240 split .

That project will begin with the moving of utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma County . That portion of the project is slated to begin in 2012 , with construction beginning in 2015 . Paul Green , Division 4 engineer for ODOT , said the interstate is being widened because of traffic counts and safety concerns . " We will widen I-40 from I-240 out to the Pottawatomie County line , " he said . " The traffic counts are getting to that point 55,000 . That Choctaw Road interchange backs up in the evening and backs up to 240 and backs up two interstates . " The current configuration of the interchange will be changed , Green said . " Right now , its what we call a folded diamond interchange " he said . " It will change to a diamond interchange . " This new configuration will help with traffic , Green said . The exit will no longer have any loops with the on and off ramps . Also in the plan is widening Choctaw Road to five lanes underneath the interstate , he said .

" The bridge itself is low and from time to time it gets hit . We need to address that . " That project will cost about $22 million and take from 20 months to two years to complete he said . " Were just beginning the design work now , " Meuser said . In 2016 , work will begin on widening I-40 from MM 167 to MM 170 , according to ODOTs eight-year plan . " Primarily , our focus is to get the interstate bridges replaced and get the interstate widened , " Green said . Reconstruction of the Harrah Newalla and I-40 exit will be slated for 2017 , according to ODOTs plan . Green said he did n't  want to forecast too far ahead because plans may change during the next eight years . This project , he said , has two key components for why its being done .

High yield Johnson grass plants can average two to four tons of production per acre and will range from 10 to 14 percent crude protein . The TDN when cut properly ranges from 50 to 60 percent . When cut and rolled up with Bermuda grass , it can make a welcomed increase in total hay production . Toxicity Johnson grass does have its own management problems . Nitrate toxicity and prussic acid poisoning are two of the associated problems with grazing or using Johnson grass for hay . Nitrate becomes a problem when hay is cut or forage is consumed from heavily fertilized pastures during or after a drought . This is especially true when pastures are fertilized just prior to the harvest of the forage . Cloudy weather , shading by other plants and frost may also increase nitrate levels in plants . Once nitrate levels reach toxic levels and it is cut for hay , that hay will remain toxic since the nitrate does not degrade over time in the dry forage . Prussic acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most often associated with problems of animals consuming the Johnson grass immediately after a killing frost . Though not as common , problems can also arise on new fast-growing Johnson grass shoots , especially following a drought period . More mature plants generally have lower levels of the toxin than young immature plants . Prussic acid , unlike nitrate , will dissipate out of the forage over time and hay dried down to 18 to 20 percent moisture will not contain toxic levels of the prussic acid . Methods of ridding Many producers do not want to deal with the headache of trying to manage around the difficulties these two toxins create and we receive many calls on the best methods of ridding Bermuda grass stands of this unwanted guest . Probably the cheapest and best method of getting rid of this grass is to graze it out of a meadow or pasture . Johnson grass by its nature can not stand constant grazing pressure .

Chemicals Chemical control may also be an option , although an expensive one . Using a wick applicator to wipe glyphosate on the plants from two directions can be very effective in controlling the plants . The Johnson grass must be given time to grow above the height of the Bermuda grass and should only be treated after a rainfall when the Johnson grass is actively growing . Another chemical option is the use of Maverick herbicide which has recently been labeled for use in Oklahoma .
