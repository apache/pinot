" <p> Every school has a readily accessible Student/Family Handbook which is used to periodically teach student expectations for behavior in multiple ways . <p> Every school vigorously engages in the implementation of Positive Behavior and Intervention Supports ( PBIS ) and seeks annual recognition for merit or distinction in such practices . <p> A theme or program of prosocial behavior or anti-bullying or character building is implemented school-wide which reduces or eliminates incidents of bullying and harassment . <p> The high school has a specifically designed curriculum tailored to each grade level which focuses on different elements of character education including anti-bullying .

School Resource Officers visit elementary schools throughout the year and are always on call for emergent events . We partner closely with the Oak Creek Police on all safety issues . They are a vital partner who is exceptionally cooperative . We communicate regularly and meet periodically to assure our goals are aligned .

The competition is meant for all students . Parents can help their child read those books that are too difficult for the child to read independently . Because this is a chance for students to read a variety of books , the subject matter in some books may not always appeal to all the students who are interested in participating . All books have been checked for age appropriateness through the American Library Association 's Journal . This provides an opportunity for parents and children to talk about the different ways of viewing and living in the world today and how that fits in with their individual family values . <p> There are 15 books on the book list for second and third grade ; there are 30 books on the list for fourth and fifth graders . Students who know their team members can split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read either 5 books in second and third grade or 10 books in fourth and fifth . Students are encouraged to keep track of story information by taking notes or completing a story map for each book read . Students can of course read all the books on the lists . <p> Book battles are conducted in the spring . Students sign up for their team in January or February . The three member grade level teams compete to earn as many points possible for their own team . The grade level team earning the most points at the end of the four weeks competes at a District Invitational in spring against teams from the other elementary schools .
