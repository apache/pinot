Which one you should use depends on the material that you 're hitting and what you are hitting it for . We try to explain what all the different types of hammers are , why you would want to use them and in what circumstances a particular hammer should be used rather than another type of hammer . We will also give you a few hammer safety tips and pointers on how to use a hammer safely . <h> Safety Advice for when Using Hammers <p> You use a hammer to hit things and therefore hammer safety generally involves making sure that you cleanly hit the thing you intended , and that any fragments from where the strike is made are contained safely , or protected against . <p> In many cases you will need to protect the object that you are hitting with your hammer so that it is not damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make using your hammer safer : <p> Wear goggles ; especially when you are driving in nails , breaking concrete or other materials that could shatter or fragment on impact . <p> Always use the head of the hammer , not the side to strike with . The metal is not hardened here , is much thinner where the handle passes through and can be damaged . The hammer is also unbalanced making it harder to make a clean strike and you will generally find it harder to see what you are striking too . <p> You hammer does need some maintenance . If the hammer handle is held in the head of the hammer with wedges these can work loose or the handle can shrink if it wooden . This means that the head can come loose and slip down the handle hurting your hands or even fly off . Tip : Soak the head of hammers with wooden handles to make the wood expand which will secure the head to the handle again . You might need to add new wedges if required . <p> The face can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck ; roughen the face with some abrasive paper to prevent this happening . <p> Protect delicate work from hammer blow marks by using a piece of scrap wood to adsorb the blow . Place the off-cut onto the surface you wish to hit and then strike this rather than the object directly ; it will protect it . <p> Always use the right hammer for the job you are undertaking ; It makes the task easier and will help to avoid possible damage to the hammer , yourself and the project that you are working on . <h> The Parts of the Hammer Explained <p> Although a hammer is essential a very simple tool , there is some terminology that has developed to describe the various parts . <p> The different parts of a hammer <p> Parts of a Hammer <p> The basic shape and design of a hammer has not change for hundreds of years . Traditionally the handle was made from wood , most commonly ash or hickory . Now this is changing with the introduction of other materials which can absorb the shock from the hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most cases the head of the hammers is made of metal and this is the part of the hammer that shows the greatest variation . Here are some of the common parts of hammer heads : <p> The different parts of a hammer head <p> Parts of a Hammer Head <p> Generally the handle is attached to the head through a hole in the head ( the eye ) . The handle is secured by driving wedges into the wood of the handle to make it expand and fit the hole tightly . This allows the handle to be changed should it become damaged . <p> These are the most common types of hammer that people use today , both for DIY and in the trade : <p> Claw Hammer <p> Claw Hammers are the most common type of hammer and probably the one that comes to mind when most people think about a hammer . They are very versatile and can be used for a great many jobs so are an absolute must for any tool bag . The most common weights are from 16 to 24 ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lever ; it generally has a notch which is used to lever out nails from timber . The claw is inserted under the head of the nail so that it catches - this can take a little jiggling about . The nail is then levered out by pulling back on the handle and using the curve of the claw as the fulcrum . The claw can be used to lever other things , such as floorboards , but excessive use can put strain on the join between the head and handle , so check this regularly . <p> These are different hammers with a variety of uses which are determined largely by the weight and strength of the head . They all have a similar shaped head with a cross or straight pein ( also spelled " Peen " ) on the opposite side of the head to the Bell ( or Poll ) . <p> Warrington , Joiners and Cross Pein Pin Hammers are all mainly used for wood working . The cross pein is used to start off the tack or nail . If you hold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to hit the head of the nail without hitting your fingers . <p> The cross pein allows you to gentle tap the nail between your fingers without striking a finger or thumb . The pein can be at right angles to the handle ( straight pein ) or parallel to it ( cross pein ) , but most commonly you will see the cross pein as this is most useful for starting off tacks and small nails . <p> The heavier cross or straight pein hammers are mostly used for shaping metal . <p> Ball Pein <p> These hammers are sometimes called engineers or mechanics hammers . They have a rounded , hence ball , pein which is used for shaping metal , closing rivets and rounding edges off metal pins and fasteners . <p> Peening , a metal fabrication process , is little used these days , and involved hardening a metal surface with repeated impact . This was mostly done by the flat face of the hammer , in fact . <p> Ball pein hammers range from 4 oz - 2 lb. ( 55 - 1100g ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 12oz ( 110 - 165g ) . The handles are traditionally wood , usually Ash or Hickory , although modern materials are now used as they suppress the vibration well . <p> Club or Lump Hammer <p> This is used for hitting cold chisels to break masonry or simply to bash things up like a tiny sledge hammer . <p> They are usually double faced and have a wood or resin handle . 2-3 lb is the typical weight , although they can weight as much as 4 1/2 lbs . These are a vital tool for a builder and will be used throughout a building site . <p> These are similar hammers to a club hammer , except they have a longer handle and tend to be a little heavier ( 3-14 lbs ) . <p> They are used for breaking up masonry , stones and concrete . They are also useful for driving in stakes . Real force can be delivered by swinging the hammer like an axe ; the longer handle will provide huge momentum and hitting power when combined with the weight of the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another hammer for minimising damage to the surface while designed to deliver the maximum power on impact . They generally work by having an internal cavity filled with steel or lead shot . This evens out the power of the impact in the blow , enabling a more powerful blow to be delivered without risk of damaging the target as reduces rebound when strike is made ; the head of the hammer stays on the surface begin hit . <p> Remember your hammer safety ! <p> Mallet <p> A mallet is a wooden block on a handle . It is used to hit and drive a chisel , knock in dowels or to tap wooden joints together . This is an essential tool for a joiner or carpenter . <p> They are typically made of beech ( a hardwood ) and are used where a metal hammer might do damage to the piece or project being worked on or the other tools , such as the chisel . <p> Generally the head will be slightly tapered to ensure correct contact with the piece being worked on . <h> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the most commonly used type of hammers , but there are a range of less frequently used hammers and hammers that are used for specialist jobs .

It has a spike at one end for putting nail holes in slates . At the other end is a hammer to knock in the nails which hold the slates to the roofing battens . In the middle it typically has a claw for pulling ( removing ) nails . <p> Roofers and Slaters Hammer <p> Scaling Hammers - These hammers are used for removing scale and build up from boilers and huge pipes . <p> Scaling Hammer <p> Scutch Hammers - A scutch hammer is used for scutching ( knocking ) off old mortar from bricks and paving . <p> Scutch Hammer <p> Tack &amp; Upholstery Hammers - These hammers typically have one magnetised or slotted head for starting off upholstery tacks , and then you can change round to normal head to finish the nail off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tack Hammer for Upholstery work <p> Brick &amp; Mortar Hammers - These hammers used by builders sometimes have a chisel ( pein ) on both ends , or sometimes they can have a hammer one end and chisel the other . Typically they are used for breaking bricks neatly . <p> Brick and Mortar Hammer <p> Drywall Hammers - A dry wall hammer will have a small axe on one end of the head and a hammer face on other . Axe is used for cutting plasterboard for pipes and making other holes or opening in the plasterboard . Sometimes they have a magnetic head for finding studs with screws/nails in , which can be very useful . Traditionally a lath hammer would have been used but now plasterboard is used there is no need to a lath hammer except in older buildings . <p> Drywall Hammer <p> Rubber and Soft Hammers - These are hammers that are used like mallets and are designed not to damage the surface which you are bashing , albeit walls , timber , chisels etc .

This is not to be confused with a Sprig Hammer which is used by picture frame makers . <p> Framing Hammer <h> Power Hammers - Nail Guns <p> These are power tools that drive in nails , tacks and staples , and are often called Nail Guns . They can be electric or powered pneumatically or by gas . They are designed to reduce the hard work where there are a lot of nails to be hit home , such as when fitting floor boards . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

In this guide you will learn about the different types of plasterboard that are available including normal wall boards , water resistant plasterboard , fire proof plasterboard , sound reduction or acoustic plasterboard and also impact proof plasterboard . We also tell you the different sizes and thicknesses that plasterboard come in . <p> Plasterboard , or drywall , is a remarkably versatile product consisting of gypsum plaster sandwiched between layers of thick paper . It is usually used on walls and ceilings . Plasterboard can be plastered over ( see our project on skim plastering ) or painted . <p> There are various types of plasterboard to cater for most situations found in the domestic or commercial environment . <h> What Sizes of Plasterboard are Available ? <p> Using plasterboard as a wall finish can be much cheaper than wet plastering . Plasterboard comes in several thicknesses including 9.5mm or 3/8 inch and 12mm or 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft x 4ft or 2.4m x 1.2m but smaller sheets , called plasterboard laths are available for easy transportation and ease of handling . <p> 15mm and 19mm sheets of plasterboard are not uncommon for boards which have a specific task such as fire proofing or sound insulation . <p> As well as the different makes of plasterboard for different situations , a different type of board is used when the surface is to be plastered as opposed to painted . <p> To avoid seeing any joins in the plasterboard wall , a tapered board is used when the wall is to be painted . This means the thickness of the board is reduced very slightly as one gets towards the edge . Two thin edges are butted up to each other and some plasterboard tape is stuck over the joint . <p> A thin layer of plasterboard joint filler is applied with a wide scraper and lightly sanded down so the surface of the filler finishes absolutely flush with the face of the board . This means the joint is not noticeable and the plasterboard tape stops the filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different Types of Plasterboard are There ? <p> The most common types of plasterboard are : <p> Wall Board which is suitable for most applications where normal sound levels , structural properties and fire specifications are found . Normal wallboard can be fixed at a double thickness to give greater assistance with fire and sound levels . It is usual to plaster onto the ivory face of the board and decorate directly onto the brown face but it makes no real difference which way round the board is fixed . <p> British Gypsum Gyproc wallboard - Image courtesy of British Gypsum <p> Vapour Barrier or Vapour Check Plasterboard which has a thin metallic film on the reverse of the sheet .

Usually fire resistant plasterboard comes with a pink face which can be painted or plastered . <p> Fire proof plasterboard - Image courtesy of siniat.co.uk <p> Water Resistant Board which has water repellant additives in the core making them suitable for a base for tiling some wet areas . This type of plasterboard usually comes with a green face and is not usually plastered .

We explain the different types of plaster you can buy , including Base Plaster , Browning Plaster , Hardwall Plaster , Bonding Plaster and Skim Plaster . How and where to use these different types of plaster and the plastering tools you need . <p> Once you 've constructed your Stud or Dryline wall it then needs to be plastered . Plastering is a difficult skill to learn and is nearly impossible to teach from a book . <p> The basics can be described but getting the wall level , flat and smooth is done by " feel " , rather than technique . The technique is important of course , and we will outline that here , but this is another of those jobs where practice is invaluable . Do not expect to walk away from a perfect job the first time you attempt plastering . <p> The plasters below are all Thistle plasters and made by British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if its good enough for the pros , it 's good enough for the DIY enthusiast . There is nothing particularly wrong with stores " own brand " plasters but Thistle plasters are no more expensive , and are generally regarded as the best . <h> Different Types of Plaster <p> Bonding Plaster : Bonding is an undercoat plaster . This means it is the first coat , or undercoat to be applied to a new ( or to be patched ) wall . When it is trowelled off , it is scratched with a nail to give a " key " for the top coat , or finish plaster to adhere to . Bonding plaster has incredible " stickabilty " and does not rely on an absorbent surface to bond to . <p> Bonding can be applied to really dense concrete blocks or engineering bricks and even concrete itself . These surfaces are where you would use bonding plaster as a scratch coat . Bonding does not need the wall underneath to be scratched or have a mechanical " key " and bonding agents , such as latex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonding plaster itself . <p> Bonding plaster <p> Browning Plaster : Browning plaster is also an undercoat plaster for use on more absorbent surfaces . <p> Browning plaster works much better on surfaces with a mechanical key and you will often see bricklayers " raking out " the joints of block and brick walls which are to have a Browning plaster covering . <p> Browning plaster <p> Hardwall Plaster : Hardwall is similar to Browning except that it offers a higher impact resistance and quicker drying surface . It is the most often used undercoat plaster these days , and can be applied to most masonry surfaces . <p> Hardwall plaster <p> Tough Coat Plaster : Even tougher than Hardwall as an undercoat plaster , and has a greater coverage based on the nominal depth of 11mm . Again , suitable for most masonry walls . <p> Tough Coat plaster <p> Dri-Coat Plaster : Dri-coat plaster is a cement-based plaster used when resurfacing a wall after installation of a new DPC . <p> Dri-Coat plaster <p> Multi-Finish Plaster : Thistle multifinish is a top coat plaster which is suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ideal for ( indeed , is manufactured for ) using as a finishing plaster when there are a variety of backing surfaces to be covered . <p> One Coat Plaster : Sometimes called patching plaster , this plaster is a mix of something like binding plaster and multifinish . It is designed to fill patches in one go and can be " laid on " to far greater thicknesses than normal undercoat plasters . Anything up to 50mm some manufacturers claim . <p> We would not advocate laying on at any more than 25mm . Once on the wall this plaster can be trowelled up to a very smooth finish and no further application is required . No matter how hard we have tried over the years we can not get as good a finish with One Coat as we can with two coat plaster work . But that 's our problem You have a try ! <p> Universal One Coat plaster <h> Mixing Plaster Base Coat and Top Coat to the Right Consistency <p> Mixing Base Coat Plaster <p> Mixing plaster the first time is a trial and error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs and being a plasterers laborer is the hardest job in the world .... Bar none ! The important thing to remember is to add the plaster to the water , not the water to the plaster . <p> Mixing base coat plaster is considerably easier than top coat or finish plaster . To mix base coat , you need a large container . Old timers use a shovel in a tin bath . Nowadays it is not uncommon to see basecoat being mixed in a cement mixer . The plaster should be mixed well and there should be no lumps in it at all ! <p> The consistency is up to you and we advise experimenting by mixing separate piles to see how you like it . It is worth the additional cost of a bag of plaster to get the job right . <p> Imagine the kind of mud that is so soft your wellies simply slide through it as you walk , but when you pick your feet up there is tonnes of it stuck to your boots .... That 's the kind of consistency you are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Getting finish plaster right is important . The average mix of finish plaster will be on a medium suction surface for approximately 10 minutes before it starts to go hard . When it starts to go hard , it goes very quickly . <p> When it is hard , and bumpy , there is absolutely nothing you can do with it except chop it off or plaster right over it . Its obviously important to get it right and this can only be achieved with practice . <p> A " wasted " sheet of plasterboard and a bag of finish plaster , or multi finish may cost 15.00 but you will thank the heavens you chose to practice . <p> Finish plaster is mixed in a bucket ( a 2 gallon builders bucket is ideal for novices ) with ( ideally ) a variable speed electric drill and a " paddle " . Paddles can be bought at all DIY stores or hired from your local hire shop . <p> Clean cold water should be put in the bucket first to about one third of the depth then finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the water . <p> The paddle , on a low speed , should then be placed in the bucket and moved up and down , and side to side , to mix the plaster . You may have to add more plaster to get a consistency to that of thick porridge . <p> Always have another bucket of water close , to you so that you can clean off your tools immediately . This includes the paddle . If you mix a new batch of plaster and there is still some of the old remaining on any of the tools , it will go hard much quicker . The mixing bucket should be cleaned thoroughly . <h> Laying on Your Base Coat Plaster <p> For novice plasterers the same technique can be used to divide the wall into manageable sections to plaster . Builders merchants can supply you with 10mm plaster stop beads which you simply fix to the wall . The beads can be fixed by placing a few small dabs of plaster on the wall and pushing the bead into it . After a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have any external corners to negotiate , external angle beads can be fixed in position to make these easier for you . Stop beads can also be bought at 3mm thick for application and division of the finish coat . <p> Ideally both coats of plaster should measure 3mm thick and if the wall is the correct , consistent thickness it will dry out uniformly , with no cracks . The same principle , once again , as demonstrated in our foundations project . <p> Before you start to apply plaster , damp the wall down with a large emulsion brush and water . Do n't  let the water run down the wall , just enough to make it damp . The application of undercoat plaster to the wall is called laying on . <p> The mixed plaster should be placed on your hawk , about 2 trowels full at a time . It is then " scooped " from the hawk to the steel trowel ( sometimes called a steel float ) onto the wall . Spread it about so it is slightly proud of the beads on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a float <p> Take a straight edge ( metal is better than timber ) and lay it over the two beads at the bottom of the section you have filled . Push the straight edge against the beads and pull upwards , sliding side-to-side as you go . Do not worry if some chunks come out as you drag upwards . <p> Levelling plaster with feather <p> Scrape the plaster off the straight edge back into the bucket and go back to your hawk and trowel , fill the holes and any areas that may be a little low . There should be some surface fissures , but not too many and none too deep . Repeat the process a couple of times until the section is full , flat and relatively smooth . Now move to the next section . <p> The metal beads are galvanised ( so they do n't  rust ) and will stay in the wall . There is no need to remove them . When you have done two or three sections the plaster should be beginning to go hard . When you can put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its time to " rub in " . This means getting the plastic float and rubbing in a circular motion over the wall to close any fissures still remaining . <p> Corner angle bead and stop angle bead fixed to wall <p> You will feel the surface go smooth under your touch and after a while you should be able to sense any depressions or high spots in the wall . You can add , or remove , a little plaster to put these right . <p> When you have finished you will have a smooth looking wall .... Seems a shame we are going to scratch it to bits in a moment ! Any narrow areas such as the gap between a door frame and an adjoining wall can be filled with one of the " small tools " shown above . <p> There is a great variety of small tools to get into various nooks and crannies around the house , and all are available from good tool stores . <p> If you have fixed angle beads to any external corners , the undercoat plaster should finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to use the same bead to plaster your top coat to . <p> After a couple of hours the undercoat plaster will be hard enough to scratch . There are special metal " combs " for this , but these are only really necessary when you are trying to cover over about 40 square m in one go . The average novice should aim for a maximum of 4 square metres in one go . <p> Take a nail , or a small screwdriver , and drag it lightly , in a coil shape , over the surface of the plaster . The scratch should be no more than 1mm deep and all of the wall should be covered with no more than 150mm between any of the scratches . Rub over the wall lightly once more with your plastic float just to flatten out the burrs caused by the scratching . <h> Preparing and Laying on Your Top Coat Plaster <p> Time to apply the top coat , or skim , once the top coat beads are in place . <p> If 3 or more hours have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea to damp the wall down again . This will give you a little longer to work with your top coat . <p> Firstly , you will need to mix up a batch of top coat . Again , this has to be to a certain consistancy , that of thick porridge and when layed on a flat surface should be self-supporting . <p> Mixing multi finish plaster in large bucket using a special purpose mixing paddle <p> Mixed multi finish top coat plaster plaster <p> Self supporting multi finish plaster mix <p> This is much more of a " feel " process and you should position yourself so you can see the thickness of plaster you are applying . Ideally you will apply the plaster in 2 layers . A very quick " flash " coat of 1mm , then a more deliberate coat of 2mm . <p> Lay it on as you did the undercoat . Try to get the plaster to an approximate even thickness , but do not spend time trying to get it perfectly flat at this stage . This is impossible . <p> Laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly as you can . Go back to the starting point and trowel over again getting the plaster a little flatter and smoother . Then again , and probably again . <p> Every time you re-visit , the plaster will have gone a little harder . It is the timing that is really important in top coat plastering or " skimming " as it is known . <p> Each pass on the hardening plaster should see more and more trowel marks and bumps disappearing . When the plaster is almost fully hard , your final pass will trowel it to a lovely flat finish . <p> Filling a hole in a wall <p> To assist with the last couple of passes it is perfectly acceptable to " flick " water on the wall using the emulsion brush you used to damp the wall down . This will assist in getting rid of trowel marks . <p> Do n't  worry if the wall still has one or two marks on it , when its dry , it can be sanded down lightly . <p> Exactly the same method is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of using metal beads as a guide to depth , you use the side of the hole you are patching . Simply run your straight edge over the wall . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624569 @1624569/ <h> An Explination of the Various Types of Paint , Varnish and Stains <p> Summary : Information on what types of paint , varnish and stains are available for use in your home , and an explanation about the benefits of using them . We aim to allow you to make an informed decision when you are choosing your paint , varnish or stain products . <p> The main objective of a paint is to create a film once applied to a surface . Once applied the film then has to do three things : <p> - Disguise the surface below - It has to stay glued to the surface - It must protect the surface below <p> This is achieved through the three main ingredients - The pigment , the binder and the carrier <h> Pigment <p> Provides the colour effects and hiding ability to the film <h> Binder <p> This has the job of binding all the particles together to form a continuous film when the paint dries and it also bonds the two surfaces together . In more traditional paints this used to be a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the paint type but in today 's more modern paints this is usually synthetic resins such as alkyd , acrylic , vinyl or polyurethane . <h> Carrier <p> This final ingredient makes the paint flow very smoothly as it is applied to the surface . As the paint dries this substance evaporates . <h> Paint Types <p> The main domestic paint types have different carriers . The Water-based paint types have the pigment and binder suspended in water as very tiny droplets . This tends to be a milk like , emulsion and is aptly named " Emulsion " ( In the USA this is usually referred to as Latex paint ) . As the water begins to evaporate the droplets coalesce and form the film of the paint . <p> The Solvent-based alkyd paints have the binder and pigment dissolved in a petroleum based solvent . These types of paint tend to take a lot longer to dry than the water-based paints ( In the USA these are know as oil , or oil-based paints ) . A characteristic of this paint type is the " painty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather unpleasant . With the great awareness at the moment concerning the growing health risks associated with the inhalation of solvents , these paint types are becoming rather un-popular . <p> Thixotropic , also know as non-drip , contains a range of additives to increase its performance . In this case the additives go towards allowing the user to load more paint onto a brush and a thicker paint film can be applied . One coat of this type can often be sufficient . <h> Paint Systems <p> The application of one coat in most cases is never enough and a paint system must be applied to ensure that there are plenty of coats . The nature of this system often depends on the paint being applied and the surface being covered . <p> The first coat will be a sealer and will be used where necessary to seal the surface . The second coat will be a primer , which will provide a good key for the paint film to adhere to.The third coat will be an undercoat , which builds up the film to form a flexible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth and final coat , the top coat , which provides the colour and actual finish <h> Varnishes and Wood Stains <p> In essence , varnish is basically a paint without the pigment applied to it . The majority of these are polyurethane based resins and are solvent based ( similar to oil paints ) . Acrylic varnishes , although water based , are becoming more popular for their environmental and health benefits . <p> Similar to paints , varnishes are also available with a satin/silk or high gloss finish , either clear or with the addition of a very small amount of colour . Varnishes with added colour are often intended to enhance the appearance of wood , or even give it some extra colour . <p> Varnish is also its own primer and undercoat , although in some cases it is better to thin the first coat with roughly 10% white spirit ( for solved varnishes ) and water for water-based varnishes . In most cases it is also better to apply this with a lint free cloth and you are able to rub the varnish into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush . <p> Once the first coat has been applied and it has dried , it then has to be keyed ( rubbed down lightly ) and a second coat is then applied ( without dilution ) . <p> Unlike paint , varnishes and stains are designed to soak into the wood . You can even apply a clear varnish to the stain to improve the finish and also make it more durable . These are also available in solvent and water based variations and also in a variety of colours and shades . <p> As mentioned stains are often applied with a lint free cloth . This aids in the blending and coverage of the finish , but you will have to work quickly to blend the wet and dry edges together to avoid any hard lines and overlaps . A water based stain will also raise the fibres on the surface of the wood which in many cases also spoils the evenness of the colour . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Understand the pro 's and con 's of using various types of spanner and wrench including adjustable spanners , pipe or stillson wrenches , socket sets and basin wrenches . Also you can see what each part of the wrench or spanner is called . <p> There are numerous types of spanners and wrenches for a variety of different uses . Spanners are known as wrenches in North America " we will use UK English when describing spanners and wrenches in this project on the whole . <p> A spanner or wrench is used for turning a nut , bolt or similar fixing that is turned to tighten . The spanner is used to grip the given fixing ( whether it is a nut , bolt , concrete screw etc .... ) and turn it , allowing you to apply torque and tighten the nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop forged steel and coated in chrome to stop corrosion . Higher quality spanners tend to be made from Chromium-Vanadium alloys and in some cases even tutanium . <p> Parts of an Adjustable Spanner <p> The Parts of a Pipe Wrench or Stillson Wrench <h> Spanner Sizes <p> The size of the spanner refers to the size of the nut or bolt that will fit into the jaws . They are either measured in Metric ( millimeters ) or Imperial measurement ( inches or thousandths of an inch ) . <p> Interestingly before around 1920 the measurement was made to the diameter of the threaded part of the nut rather than the outside of the nut . This is not something that we have seen ourselves , but we found this image on Wikipedia . It 's pretty obvious why that measurement system did n't last long ! <p> The old fashioned and modern way of measuring a spanner size - Image courtesy of Wikipedia <p> Old and new spanners compared together for size <h> Types of spanner and wrench : <p> Spanners <p> These tend to come in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most popular spanners for both DIY and Motoring jobs . They have an open C into which the nut fits <p> Ring Spanners are the spanners which hold the nut with a ring <p> Combination Spanners have a ring at one end and are open ended at the other end <p> A set of any of these types of spanner are usually inexpensive but very useful and a must for any tool box . <p> A socket set is a great way to have a collection of tools for tackling nuts and bolts . They are a great replacement for a spanner set and can be more compact and easier to carry around . They do tend to be a little more expensive and sometimes hard to use in awkward to reach places . <p> Socket sets generally come with a ratchet , which is a big help and will save a lot of time as it avoids the need to constantly take a spanner off of a nut or bolt ready for the next turn . The more expensive they are the more sockets and fittings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a socket set relatively cheaply that will cover pretty much every domestic situation . <p> Adjustable spanners can be used to fit a wide range of screws and bolts so save you having to carry around a wide range of different sized spanners . The issue is that they can be tricky to use as they might not lock tight onto the nut or bolt . <p> Aside from this small drawback they are very handy to have in the tool box for one good reason - More often than not you may only have one of each size spanner and when it comes to un-doing or doing up a nut or bolt they are great for holding bolt heads while you tighten the nut with a spanner . <p> Ratchet spanners are spanners that are a great labour saving device but they do cost a little more . There will always be a place in the DIY sheds and motoring stores for the ratchet spanner which allows you to undo a nut without taking the spanner off , kind of like a hybrid of a spanner and socket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for undoing the nuts and back nuts holding taps onto basins and baths . They come in two common types ; the basin wrench and the tap wrench with a T bar which is often used for finer and harder to reach tap nuts under basins and baths . They are both relatively cheap , but will save a lot of effort . <p> Commonly made of steel tube , the box spanner is typically used for removing spark plugs . They normally feature a six-sided ring-type head that fits the nut that has been pressed out of the steel tube during the manufacturing process . They are turned using a T-bar passed through the two holes in the middle . <p> Pipe wrenches are for large and heavy jobs . They are also known as Stillson wrenches or Stillsons . The beauty of using Stillson is the sheer strength of the grip the teeth on the jaws allow . As you have no doubt guessed they are used for pipe work , where the diameter of the fixing is typically larger than common nuts and bolts and the torque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An immersion heater spanner is an invaluable tool for a plumber . It has a large ring that is designed to fit around the element in a water heater . There are two main types of immersion spanner ; ring headed and box spanners. ( the one pictured here is the box head type ) . <p> While these are not really a spanner or wrench in the traditional sense , they are commonly used for the same purpose . They are useful for holding bolts still while you work on loosening the nut . They are for more lightweight tasks , although the larger more expensive mole grips can be relatively sturdy . <p> A strap wrench is used to hold pipes and other objects with a larger diameter . They are useful for objects that do not have a grip for a spanner or wrench to get a hold on . They are also useful because they can apply a relatively large amount of torque without marking the object .

The very act of turning the spanner puts a strain on the adjustment thread and this " stretches " the opening . Result ? The spanner slips off and either rounds off the end of the nut or breaks your knuckles ............... Sometimes both . <p> If you get the right spanner ( or wrench ) the chances of this happening are much less .

We explain the different types of screws available , where you should use them , including internally or externally , and why so that you can understand the importance of using the right screw . Knowing where to use different types of screws is half the battle and will ensure they hold fast . <p> Different types of screw do many different types of job and as with everything else in the construction industry and DIY world , the job is much much easier with the right tools , equipment and products . <p> Wood screws are great for holding wood but you should not use them for metal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

If the force is lateral , or pushing along the joint of the two materials being fixed , then a thicker screw should be used . <p> When using thicker screws or when fixing brittle materials including some hardwoods , the material can be prone to splitting . Obviously this is not a good thing , so it is wise to drill a pilot hole before screwing in your screw " find out about how to drill pilot holes in the project mentioned at the top of this page . <p> Consider also , the number of screws that you use .

Used for fixing the bottom of man made roofing slates so they are not lifted by the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan is an extremely hard varnish used to protect the screw against the elements . For this reason , black japanned fixing are used in garden gate furniture etc . <p> Variety of nails <p> Above Nails : Starting Left : Wire nail , the universal nail with a medium head that comes in many sizes up to 6 inch . next is a " cut nail , " cut from steel , its square section gives it a larger surface area and a better hold in soft masonry and mortar . This nail is also used as a " flooring brad " and is less likely to split wood . Next a " polypin " these are used specifically for fixing plastic facia boards and cladding . the annular , shank gives it a good hold in timber and stops it working loose with the contraction and expansion of the materials it connects . Next is a " lost head " , which as its name implies , can be driven into the timber and with a small head can easily be punched below the surface of the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but primarily external as the galvanised finish will protect against rust . Next is an " oval " used in carpentry because its cross section makes it unlikely to split the timber especially if you tap the point and blunt it a little . Next " masonry nail " Hardened steel for fixing to bricks , blocks and even concrete . Next , " galvanised clout " These are used when a fixed surface will come into contact with water .. Fixing plasterboard is sometimes done with these although there is a special jagged " plasterboard nail " which is galvanised without the large head . Also used to hold roofing felt in position . Next . " Copper clout " Mostly used for slate roofing . Next . " Sealing roofing nail " Almost the same as the " Polypin " but the head is flexible and will seal over roofing sheets . Next . " panel pin " Small nail used for securing light pieces of timber . <p> There are also " Annular ring nails " Which are essentially wire nails with rings around the shank which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mostly used to secure timber floors . <p> Different types of " Pin nails " include upholstery pins , with a large rounded head for securing fabrics .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roof bolt " A fibre washer bites down on the surface of the roofing material to keep it water tight . <p> Pipe brackets and cable clips <p> Hammer and frame fixings <p> The hole is drilled in the frame , the whole fixing is inserted and the screw is hammered through the frame into the masonry . There is also a different " frame fix " screw which looks almost the same but is screwed , rather than hammered in . " Chemical thread " This is a threaded bar with a hexagonal end . It is screwed into a hole after the insertion of a chemical resin . The last three are commonly called Wrall bolts or Fischer fixings after the main fixing manufacturers . A pre-drilled hole accepts these bolts , who 's outer sheath expands an the nut is tightened .

Quite pricey but .. if all else fails ..... <p> Above Top Image : Plasterboard Fixings . Left " easy driva " a metal or nylon fixing , the main section of which simply screws in to the plasterboard after making a small hole . The large thread makes it , in our opinion , the easiest and strongest plasterboard fixing . The screw next to it is " self tapped " which means that it cuts its own thread . These screws go into the middle of the main driva fixing ... Next , " spring or butterfly toggle " This needs a hole large enough for the wings to go through . They spring open at the back of the plasterboard and as you tighten on the screw , the " job " is clamped between board and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A large hole is drilled . The triangle is pushed together and passed through the hole , the screw then passes through the end of the toggle , into the point of the triangle , which has sprung open , and tightening the screw draws the point of the triangle to the back of the board , trapping the fixing . <p> Above Bottom Image : " hollow wall anchor " Exactly the same principle but the flexible metal body of the fixing is crushed against the back of the board by the turning of the screw . Right , the " hollow wall plug " Pushed into its hole , the screw opens up the end of this fixing , forcing the two lugs against the back of the board . <p> Please note that plasterboard comes in two thicknesses , half and three eighths of an inch .

This project will help you to make the decision to use a raft for your footing . We will help you to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using raft foundations . <h> Raft Foundations <p> Raft foundations ( sometimes known as Mat Foundations ) are a large concrete slab which can support a number of columns and walls . <p> The slab is spread out under the entire building or at least a large part of it which lowers the contact pressure compared to the traditionally used strip or trench footings . <p> Because of the speed and volume of houses required after the second world war , the raft foundation was widely used . The raft foundation was cheaper , easier to install and most importantly , did not require as much excavation as the usual strip foundations . <p> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules for raft foundations as there were for strip foundations . <p> This meant that to use a raft foundation , it had to be designed and approved by Building Control . This made the entire operation much more difficult and time consuming so raft foundations became less widely used almost overnight . <p> Raft Foundations - How to make raft foundations are made <h> When Are Raft Foundations Used <p> Rafts are most often used these days when the strata is unstable or ( because of this ) a normal strip foundation would cover more than 50% of the ground area beneath the building . There are also situations ( usually in areas where mining has occurred ) where there may be areas of movement in the strata . <p> They are much more commonly used in the construction of commercial building in the UK that they are for domestic homes , but can be used very successful in both situations .

There are a number of reasons why this is the case : <p> The foundation and floor slab is combined , which saves time and materials <p> Less excavation is required <p> Other reasons that make raft foundations preferable to footings are due to their engineering benefits . They are ideal for poor ground condition where normal footings would not cope well as they can not spread the load as effectively . <p> Related to this is that raft foundations can reduce differential settlement , where settlement occurs at different rates across the ground surface of the building , which reduces cracking and other more serious problems . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are not treated properly .

When moisture in the warm air within a room comes into contact with a wall or surface that 's cold or the air itself cools , then it can no longer hold the moisture in it and the water will condense out , usually onto a surface . This excess water on your wall or ceiling 's surface can then form damp . This can in turn make your condensation issue worse , as the damper a surface gets the colder it will get , as it will lose heat faster . This means that water is more likely to condense out from the air onto it , making the area more and more saturated . <p> These conditions are an ideal breeding ground for mould .

Well ventilated areas ensure that no cold air is allowed to rest in one place for too long where it will keep the area in question at a lower temperature than the rest of the room , reducing the likelihood of condensation occurring . <p> Condensation can cause black mould growth , among other things <p> Fix The easiest thing you can do to solve the immediate issues is to remove the mould from your walls using an Anti-Mould cleaner we 've found that the Mould Killer Spray from PRS gives reliable results . Next , you can wipe away any moisture from any affected areas such as window frames and walls to stop the problem getting any worse . Make sure that you wring out and dry any clothes you 've used outside , as drying inside will introduce more moisture back into the air . You should find and solve the cause of the condensation before doing any further repairs to make sure that the mould wo n't reappear in your repaired surface . Once you 've solved the cause of your condensation , ideally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall with the antimould cleaner and replaster . If you 're painting the wall , you can make absolutely sure that the mould does n't return by using an antimould emulsion , or adding an antimould additive to your wallpaper paste good formulations of both of these products are available from PRS . <p> Use some mould cleaner to remove the mould from your walls <h> If the air in your house contains a lot of moisture , reduce it or try to keep your house a bit warmer <p> Using the hygrometer we mentioned earlier , test the moisture content of the air in the room that has the mould in it . If the moisture content is high , it may well be that this is all that 's causing your condensation . There are many different steps that you can take to reduce the level of moisture in the air in your house we 'll discuss some here : <p> Add some ventilation and some draught proofing <p> In terms of a more long term solution to condensation caused by overly moist air , ventilation and draught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your windows and leave at least one open at all times . These are relatively easy to install - see our Trickle Vents project for more information on how to do this . If it is not possible to install trickle vents leave a small window open slightly as often as you can . <p> Inspect your rooms for any air bricks and ventilators - have they been blocked up or covered over ? If you find that some have then get them uncovered as this is probably not helping in terms of air flow around your rooms . <p> If you have a chimney that is not currently in use , this can contribute to your condensation issues if it is not ventilated properly . Your chimney stack should not either be open or capped entirely an open chimney will let rainwater in and a capped chimney traps cold air in the chimney void , creating cold spots on the chimney breast . Instead , you should ideally fit a chimney cowl to your chimney pots ( these are effectively caps with an opening that allows air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots altogether and instead fit a paving slab on top of the chimney stack , raised up by bricks to allow air to flow into the chimney but again keep the rain out . <p> If your fireplace is bricked up you should also have an airbrick inserted into the wall in front of the empty fireplace space . Ideally it should be installed 30cm above ground level . <p> Uncover or install air bricks to increase the ventilation in your room <p> Another solution is adding draught proofing and insulation . Draught proofing and insulation will help to keep your house ( and its walls ) a bit warmer at all times , which means that water is less likely to condense out of the air in your space . When it comes to insulation , the loft is a good place to start . Insulating your loft and loft hatch correctly can be one of the most cost effective jobs you can do to retain more heat in your house and it can have quite an impact on your heating bills . Ensure that you use the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct draught proofing fittings for your loft hatch ( more information on this can be found on the Energy Saving Trust website and information on potential grants for these improvements can be found on our sister site Be Energy Smart ) . <p> Draught proofing windows and doors can also go a long way in reducing condensation and quite a few other issues . Draughts that are allowed to enter a property due to poorly fitting windows and doors can keep that area at a lower temperature that the rest or a room and due to this , condensation can form - so ensure that any draughts are blocked up correctly with appropriate draught proofing materials ( NOTE : ensure that trickle vents are fitted to windows so that ventilation is under your control as you will still need some ventilation to ensure air circulation ) . <p> Draught proof your windows and doors to reduce condensation <p> Add some cavity wall insulation <p> Cavity wall insulation can be very effective in preventing heat loss and ensuring that rooms are maintained at a decent temperature , reducing the likelihood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a cavity wall ( seek assistance from a professional if you are not sure ) any properties built after the 1930 's should have one . There are many companies installing cavity wall insulation but please do your research and homework before commissioning anyone to do the work . A shoddy cavity insulation job can cause untold additional issues and cost a fortune to put right . You can find accredited cavity wall insulation installers who can give you a 25 year guarantee on the work on the Cavity Insulation Guarantee Agency 's ( CIGA ) ' s website . <p> During the colder parts of the year try to leave consistent low level background heating on in your home , in all rooms , even if there is no one there . This will ensure that all rooms stay at a certain temperature , reducing the likelihood that the air will get cold enough for condensation to occur . You may think that this will be expensive but with today 's modern heating systems it can actually work out cheaper . If your heating system is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot harder and for a longer period than it would if it simply has to top up your heating to the required temperature . In the absence of a more modern and efficient heating system you may also want to consider a thermostatically controlled heater , but try and stay away from bottled gas or paraffin heaters as these are guilty of pouring huge amounts of moisture into the air which will make your condensation problem worse . <p> Having the heating on consistently will minimise condensation <p> Adjust your cooking and washing habits <p> There are also certain daily tasks that increase the moisture content in the air such as cooking , showering and drying clothes . When cooking try to keep doors closed and lids on pans to minimise the level of water vapour in the air . <p> If possible ( weather prevailing ) try to dry all of your clothes outside , as drying clothing inside can pour a huge amount of moisture into the air . In the event that this is not possible try to keep your washing drying in a specific room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window open . Also ensure that your tumble dryer vent pipes vent externally either through a window or purpose built wall attachment . <p> When showering or bathing , again keep bathroom/shower room doors closed and a window in the bathroom slightly ajar . If you have an extractor fan in your bathroom ensure that this is switched on and that its filter is clear of any mould or dust . <p> Rearrange your furniture <p> In respect to furniture you want to ensure that air can circulate as freely as possible around items within a room , as if cold air becomes still , the water in it is more likely to condense out of it . Do n't push wardrobes , dressers , sofas etc .... right up against walls leave at least a couple of inches as an air gap . This will help to prevent any cold air and condensation developing . Believe it or not condensation can even cause mould in full wardrobes and cupboards ! <p> It may be that wherever in your house that condensation has settled on is cold , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've just mentioned , you can reduce the coldness of your windows and doors by draught proofing them , but what about cold areas on your wall ? These come into being for a number of reasons . You can check that your wall area is cold by using a heat measuring gun as mentioned earlier simply hold it against the area you think is cold and another area of wall and see whether there is a difference in temperature . The reasons that an area of your wall is cold may be : <p> Rusty/Dirty Wall Ties <p> During the building process , mortar can fall on your wall ties these are metal ties that tie the two walls of your cavity wall together and support them . If they get loaded up with mortar and other debris and any moisture collects on the internal side of the external wall , the dirty tie provides it with a direct route to the internal wall , where it can make your wall cold ( and damp ) . Similarly , the ties can rust over time this causes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined to , allowing cold air to enter the cavity via the external walls and make the corresponding areas on the internal walls cold . This can encourage water in the air inside your house to condense on this spot , creating damp . You can detect whether there are any wall ties near your cold spots using a metal detector if there are , you can remove the brick nearest to it and another one if it will be useful ( never remove more than two without consulting a qualified building professional ) . We 've got a guide to how to do this in our How to Remove a Brick project . If when you remove your bricks you find that your wall tie does have debris on it , you can remove the debris and replace the bricks , or if the tie is rusty you will need to replace it information on how to do this can be found in our How to Replace a Wall Tie project . <p> Debris in your cavity wall <p> If you have a cavity wall , this needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debris is left in the cavity when the wall is being built and it is then left to sit in the wall permanently . This debris allows any moisture that enters your outside facing walls to travel to your inner walls , where it can manifest as damp . You can check if there is debris in your cavity by removing a brick or two ( do not remove more than two bricks without consulting a professional ) from the area of outside wall that corresponds to your damp affected internal wall area . You can remove the bricks using the instructions in our How to Remove a Brick project mentioned above . Once you have removed the bricks , use a light to look inside the cavity for any debris , and remove any large objects you see by hand wearing some thick gloves in case some of the debris is sharp . You can remove dust etc. with an old vacuum cleaner . <p> Debris in your cavity is a common cause of cold spots and condensation <p> A poor cavity wall insulation job/no cavity wall insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gaps or holes in the insulation in your walls . This creates cold spots quite literally because those wall areas are not as well insulated as the surrounding wall areas . If you think this might be the cause of your problem , you will need to get an accredited cavity wall insulation installer ( find your local qualified installers on the CIGA website mentioned above ) to take a look and determine if this is the case . This issue is n't easy to fix you may well have to remove all of your own insulation and install a completely new set rather than trying to top it up in the wall areas where it is lacking . <p> Cracks in your mortar/broken bricks <p> General wear and tear can gradually crack the mortar , or pointing around your brickwork this can allow cold air and moisture to enter your cavity through your external wall and make your internal wall damp and cold . The face of your bricks can also splinter off over time in a process known as spalling this is when the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wet bricks freeze . In this situation , the water freezes and expands , splintering the face of the brickwork off . Again , this can make the wall more susceptible to allowing rainwater to enter the cavity through the wall , and in the case of spalling this can mean that the splintering happens over and over again , gradually wearing the brick away . <p> In the case of spalling or broken brickwork , you will need to replace the bricks again , you can use the Replacing a Brick project linked above for guidance on how to do this . To stop the spalling happening again , you can apply a brick waterproofer we use Ultra Tanking Slurry Powder to waterproof brickwork as we have found it give great results . <p> Your external walls are being exposed to high volumes of water <p> It may be that your walls are perfectly sound but that they 're being exposed to such high volumes of water that a significant quantity is entering your house through your external walls . The solution to this is to apply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powder we use as mentioned above is great because it 's breathable , so you can apply it knowing that the water that 's already in your bricks can escape . <p> Apply a breathable waterproofer to protect your bricks or masonry from damp <p> Issue - If you are experiencing any of this type of visual damage then the likelihood is that you have an issue with your damp proof course or DPC . This is a layer of waterproof material that sits in the brickwork across your house about 6 inches up from ground level to prevent rising damp from rising up into your walls . <p> Quite a few older properties ( 19th century and before ) were constructed without a damp proof course . This was mainly because the natural ventilation in the property ( windows and doors ) would provide enough air flow to prevent significant moisture build up . As houses became more airtight due to better fitting doors and windows and more effective insulation , the amount of natural ventilation was significantly reduced and water rising from the ground could not be ventilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave a tide mark above your skirting board <p> In the early days of dpc 's stone slabs and slate were the materials of choice and were layered between or beneath brick courses around 6 inches above ground level to provide a barrier to prevent damp rising up from the ground any further . Damp rises up in this way due to the porous nature of bricks and blocks which means that water can travel upwards inside the brickwork by capillary action . The moisture in the walls can also draw salts to the surface of the walls , which can absorb moisture from the air inside your house and cause further moisture to accumulate . The salts themselves can be quite large and therefore destroy the integrity of your plaster when they are drawn to the surface of your walls , meaning that often they blown your plaster in the affected areas . <p> Today more modern materials are used such as polythene , felt , bitumen or in some cases , an engineering brick ( a very densely constructed brick that prevents water absorption ) . These then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further . <p> A sound Damp Proof Course will protect your property from rising damp <p> Failure of a dpc can occur in various different ways . The damp proof course itself can fail , e.g. slate and felt can become brittle and crack , polythene can be split etc .... or in most cases the entire damp course itself is instead bridged . <p> Bridging occurs when the dpc is effectively bypassed by an object that is connected both above and below the DPC , providing ground water with a direct route around it . The most common occurrences of this are when a garden , grass area , path or set of steps or in some cases a porch or conservatory is constructed and butts up against the external wall . This then provides water and moisture in the ground a direct path around the current DPC and up into your walls . <p> If your property features a cavity then bridging can also occur here . During construction rubbish and debris such as mortar can fall down into the void and build up to a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When this happens moisture can then creep up through the debris and on up into the wall without having to cross the DPC . <p> Most of today 's modern building materials are focussed around waterproofing e.g. engineering bricks , treated timbers , gypsum plaster etc .... When you take the nature of these materials into account you can then see why , once the moisture is present in a wall , it can be a tough job to get it out as the waterproofing within the materials effectively holds it in the wall . Couple that with the fact that there is less natural air flow within a modern property and you 've got problems ! <p> Fix As you may imagine the only way to establish whether a broken or bridged DPC is the cause of your problems is to investigate each possibility . Firstly inspect the external walls of your property and examine your pdc closely . Look at the condition of the materials used are they cracked , brittle , split , do you even have one ? <p> In the event that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few choices . You can replace it like for like , e.g. digging out bricks/blocks and replacing the DPC with the same material - as you may imagine this can be a costly and time consuming process and will really need to be carried out by a professional with the correct knowledge . The second choice is significantly easier . There are quite a few chemical/cream DPC products available today and these can even be installed on a DIY level . The basic premise is to drill holes in both external and internal walls at roughly 125mm centres and then either inject ( if using a skeleton gun ) or pump ( using an injection machine ) the DPC chemical cream in until saturation occurs . The chemical cream is absorbed by the bricks and spreads within the brickwork to form a waterproof chemical layer . Once dried , you will then have a layer of waterproof bricks creating your new moisture barrier . <p> If you find that you do indeed have a damp proof course and it is in good condition then your issue may be bridging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good clearance ( 6 inches ) between it and the ground level , if not then you will need to dig back any grass , garden , pathway or other obstruction and give some clearance between the obstruction and your external wall . <p> You may find that the obstruction is being caused by something a little more permanent than some grass or a pathway - it may be a set of steps or even a porch or conservatory . As mentioned , the best course of action is to remove the offending object but this may not be possible , especially in the case of a conservatory ! In this instance you can use one of the previously mentioned products to create a new dpc above the obstruction . <p> When no evidence of an external bridge is found , your issue may be within the cavity itself . In order to confirm this there is really only one course of action and that is to inspect the cavity . On the external wall exactly opposite the affected area on the internal wall remove one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ) . This may sound quite drastic but is relatively easy as mentioned earlier , our How to Remove a Brick project has the instructions for how to do this . <p> Remove one or two bricks from your wall to examine the cavity for debris <p> Once you have removed your bricks use a mobile phone or camera to take some shots of the inside of the cavity and then inspect them . If you find any debris this will need to be removed so using your hands ( wear some heavy gloves as there may be sharp objects in there ) and a scraper for harder to reach objects , remove it . Once any rubbish has been removed , replace your bricks using suitable mortar . <p> Remove any debris you find in the cavity manually wearing thick gloves <p> One final point to make is that the issues you are experiencing may be nothing to do with your own property and may be down to work that has been carried out on a neighbouring property so it 's worth asking your neighbour(s) if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as filling a basement or crawl space below the ground level floor or have had any concreting or screeding carried out as this may very well have taken their floor level above your DPC , bridging it and allowing moisture a route around and up into your rooms . <p> As with the condensation issue above you will probably be left with some damp damage to the surface of your internal walls so this will also need to be dealt with . In the majority of cases any plaster will need to be removed from the affected area and the wall will need to be allowed to dry out thoroughly before replastering and redecorating to ensure no future reappearance . If the damp has caused mould or white salts to appear on your walls , there are a number of products that can be used to make absolutely sure that they wo n't reappear . Salt neutraliser can either be added to your replastering plaster , or painted onto the bare wall , and you can also buy an anti-mould cleaner and anti-mould emulsion to apply to your replastered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best place to buy antimould and antisalt products is through PRS ' online shop . <p> Issue - When damp patches and/or white salts are present across your wall rather than just in the lower area just above the skirting board , this is a sign that you have likely suffered or are suffering from some form of penetrating dampness which probably means that you may have a defect in the external fabric of your property . Salts that are confined to the lower area of your wall probably indicate rising dampness , which you can read about above . Water that is allowed to enter your house can wash salts that are present in most building materials out into the surface of your walls , and when the water dries out and evaporates , a white salty residue is left behind . The salts are whitish and can be quite large , erupting through the wall 's surface and blowing your plaster off the wall . <p> Damp can wash salt crystals out of your walls and deposit them on the surface <p> It 's also a good point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygroscopic , meaning that they attract moisture from the air . The build up of moisture then creates damp patches . You can tell if your salts are hygroscopic by whether they get damp and then dry out periodically this is the salts attracting moisture from the air when the air is moist enough . Hygroscopic salts are salts that accumulate in chimney breasts when fuel is burnt . If the chimney breast gets damp , these salts can get washed to the surface of the chimney breast or the surrounding wall area where they appear as smooth white residue and attract moisture . <p> Hygroscopic salts accumulate in chimney breasts and attract water <p> If you have crunchy salt crystals on your wall rather than hygroscopic salt residue , it is likely that you have penetrating dampness in some form . In this instance to find the cause of the penetrating dampness you will need to check your walls for cracks in mortar , your cavity for debris in the wall and any rusty or dirty wall ties , your roof for broken tiles and flashing and your guttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy check to start with is the condition of your brickwork and mortar . Take a look at the external wall opposite to the affected area on your internal wall , and check the bricks for any cracked bricks or mortar . If there is cracked mortar , you may have some subsidence so do get this checked out by a professional before attempting to fix it . <p> If your mortar is cracked you should also use a metal detector to find where your wall ties are if there is a tie near the cracked mortar , this may have rusted and caused the mortar to crack , as when the ties rust they also expand . <p> Ties can also accumulate debris over time or during the building process , which gives water entering your external wall a direct route to your internal wall . To check your wall ties you will need to remove a brick or two ( never remove more than two without consulting a building surveyor or qualified tradesman ) to get a better look at the state of the ties . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to Remove a Brick project mentioned above . If your ties have debris on them you can remove it ; if they are rusty you will need to replace them using the instructions in our How to Replace a Wall Tie project . <p> Check your brickwork for any cracks could be allowing damp in <p> In respect to checking your roof and chimney , ideally these checks will need to be done at source e.g. on the roof or at the guttering or wall level which will involve climbing to a height . If you are not comfortable doing this then please do n't as and mistakes could be very costly to yourself ! Instead hire or borrow a decent pair of binoculars and you can carry out your inspection from the safety of solid ground . Check your roof for broken flashing and broken or missing roof tiles as well as checking the mortar in your chimney brickwork if you have a chimney . To inspect your guttering correctly , ideally this should be done during wet weather so that you can easily spot any leaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or damage then you will need to get it fixed . Cracked mortar can be hacked out using a suitable raking tool or small chisel and then replaced with new ( take a look at our How to Replace a Brick project for more on how to do this ) and the same goes for roof tiles any cracked or damaged tiles should be replaced with new . There is quite a good YouTube video on roof tile repair by Russ Richards that runs through the basics . <p> Replace any broken or missing roof tiles as these may be causing your problems <p> If your flashing is broken you will have to either repair or replace it replacing it is the best option but is expensive as lead is so expensive . A cheaper alternative is to repair the breaks with flashing tape this is a waterproof tape specially designed to repair flashing . More information on how to repair your flashing using tape is available in our Repairing Lead Flashing project . <p> Replace any flashing that is cracked or missing <p> When it comes to guttering most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect they are " snapped " together . There can be quite a few individual parts to a guttering system and a rundown these can be found in our Plastic Gutters project . When leaking guttering joints are present this can sometimes be due to a broken or missing bracket , as during heavy downpours , the weight of the water in the guttering can cause the joints to fail . In this case you should replace or add a bracket to support some of the load and take it off the joint . <p> In some cases you can use silicone to seal over holes and splits in your guttering but this should really only be used as a temporary measure and not a permanent fix it 's best to do the job properly ! <p> Replace any cracked pieces of guttering to reduce your walls ' exposure to damp <p> It may be that your external walls are actually sound but that they are exposed to such a high level of rainfall that they just become damp to a level that causes problems on your internal walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waterproofer onto your brickwork the Ultra Tanking Slurry Powder we buy from PRS is breathable , which is ideal as you want the water that 's already in your bricks to be able to escape . <p> With the root cause of the penetrating damp sorted it 's now time to deal with the resultant visual damage . Most decorated and plastered surfaces do not fair too well with salts especially plaster . The salts can themselves burst through even the best rendered backing and once they have penetrated the plaster they then emerge through the decorated surface . <p> The best and most effective fix ( but as is always the case the most costly and time consuming ) is to remove all of the plaster from the damaged area and about 400mm beyond in all directions ( to ensure no salts are left ) , dry out the walls ' surface and then apply a salt neutraliser . Again there are many available such as Permaguard but we have found the best to be Property Repair Systems salt neutraliser . <p> If you have salts present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once you have applied the neutraliser and allowed to dry ( following manufacturer 's guidelines ) you can then replaster your plaster may already contain a salt neutraliser , making it unnecessary to apply it to the wall as well , and you can get salt neutralisers you can add to the plaster as well . A newly plaster surface should be left to dry out completely before any decoration is added as if it is n't then any decorated layer will eventually come off . Drying can take as much as 2 3 months so be aware of this , but once dried you can then go ahead and add the decoration of your choice . <p> NOTE : When heavy salts are present the salt neutraliser alone may not be enough to prevent any further build up . In this case you may need to add a mesh membrane over your walls ' surface before you replaster . The membrane will ensure that no further salt can cross into your plaster . <p> Issue This issue is quite similar to the one outlined above and shares some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but with a few subtle differences when it comes to the area around a chimney . <p> The act of burning fuels releases minerals and tars that have been absorbed by the fuels materials as they have developed in the ground over many years . The particles released when the fuels are burnt then come to rest on the inside of chimney void . <p> Over a period of time ( and when water or moisture is allowed to collect in the chimney void ) minerals and tars can seep or be washed through the chimney breast and onto the surface of your inner walls . You might be thinking that this sounds exactly like the issue outlined above but when tars and other fossil fuel extracts are involved they often leave a yellowy brownish stain . <p> Burning fuel can create tars which stain your walls <p> You may also find that this particular issue gets better or worse depending on the weather in that during times of extreme moisture or high humidity , effected areas become more apparent and when warmer and drier the issue seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or salts present in your walls are hygroscopic . This means that they are moisture attracting and can draw moisture present in the air in your room , producing , in some cases , additional damp . <p> Hygroscopic salts cause damp patches that appear temporarily <p> In some instances the presence of hygroscopic salts can be due to previous building usage so it 's worth checking out if your property has any history . Salt presence can be very common in buildings used previously as butchers or coal storage . <p> Fix Firstly you will have to establish if you have a penetrating moisture issue e.g. have you got a leak around your chimney breast producing visible marks or stains or drawing salts through the wall ? Check your roof tiles , flashings , mortar joints etc .... In the event that you do find anything this will need to be repaired . Once repaired allow the area to dry out thoroughly for as long as needed and then you can assess any damage to internal surfaces . <p> In some cases if you have gotten to the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in your wall 's surface then the plaster can be saved but if any decoration is already started to flake off and the plaster is crumbling then you will need to hack it all off , drastic as that may sound , it 's the best solution . <p> Once you have removed all the plaster and allowed the area to dry out totally , apply a salt neutraliser ( some examples of these mentioned above ) to the area and allow this to penetrate . Once thoroughly treated you can then replaster and redecorate but please let your newly plastered surface dry out totally before you do so . New plaster can take as much as a few months to totally dry before it is able to support paint or wallpaper . <h> Isolated Damp Spots on Walls <p> Issue If you have an isolated spot , the cause is likely to be one of two things . Either you have penetrating damp , likely caused by a fault in the external fabric of your home ( if this is the case , take a look at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your penetrating damp and solve it ) or you have a leak somewhere in your home . <p> Fix First and foremost you will have to establish whether you have a water leak below your property , your local water authority can assist you with this as you can ask them to run a check on your water main pipe and also those of your neighbouring properties ( including those that are up hill ) . This should be a free service and they will be able to tell you if there is a pressure leak anywhere indicating a water leak . They should also be able to test the water for you to determine its source ( e.g. whether its mains water , sewage water , waste from domestic drainage or naturally occurring ground water ) . In in the case that it does turn out to be a mains leak then a fix will have to be arranged through the water authority ( as you can imagine this could turn out to be a bit of a task depending on their terms and also depending on the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information ) . <p> You can also run some tests yourself start with your foul drainage firstly by locating your drainage man hole cover and lifting the lid . Run a tap to determine which channel is yours and once you know this for sure block the channel up with a bung ( these can be hired from your local hire store ) . Now fill a sink with water and mark the level and leave overnight . If the level has dropped this is a good sign that you have a leak . NOTE : Do not forget to remove the bung ! ! ! <p> With a potential leak identified the next task is to find out exactly where that leak is and the best way of doing so is to employ the services of a drainage surveyor as they will have specialist equipment and cameras that can be inserted into the drain to pin point the exact location of the damaged section of pipework . <p> You will also want to test your surface drainage and this can be done by purchasing some drainage dye ( available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that it is non-toxic ) . Place the contents of the bag ( following manufacturer 's instructions ) into each of your available drains and then fill them up with water . When it gets dark inspect as much of the external of your property as possible and look for evidence of the dye as it glows in the dark . If you find the dye in places that it should not be then you can then trace it back to the source of the leak . <p> Add dye to your surface drain to detect any leaks in your system <h> Damp floor <p> Issue The causes of damp floor problems can vary depending on the severity of the problem e.g. the floor may be slightly moist to the touch or you may literally have a puddle of water . A good place to start in establishing a cause is to inspect the outside of your property , your dpc and also any properties surrounding you . Do you have large amounts of water resting against your external walls ? Is your dpc damaged ? Do you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chemical DPC cream into your walls to install a new Damp Proof Course <p> It may also be the case that you have a water leak below your property and this is penetrating through the soil below your house and up into your floor or a neighbouring property is suffering from a leak and this is spilling over into your property . Again , use the checks described above to detect a leak below your house to check if your damp floor is being caused by a leak . <h> Damp Area Around Window and Door Frames <p> Issue - If the area around your windows or doors is damp , mouldy or cold to the touch , this may indicate that the wall area has a water problem . This issue may have been caused by gaps being present between the frame and the rest of your wall .

When a window or door is fitted in a cavity wall , the two walls must be brought together around the window or door frame to secure it . This is known as closing the cavity .

We explain the differences between the types of paint for all sorts of interior finishes . <p> If you 're new to decorating , the range of interior paints available can be somewhat overwhelming . See below for our guide on types of paint and their uses . <h> Painting Interior Walls <p> Paint and Products for Wall Preparation <p> Basecoat " This is an all-purpose preparation for walls . It will cover many imperfections including hairline cracks , stains and strong colours . Use this if your walls are in bad condition or painted in a dark colour . Paint over basecoat with emulsion . <p> Anti-Damp Paint " Some old houses have damp areas that you just ca n't fix . These are prone to mould , so use an anti-damp paint to protect walls and ceilings . Most anti-damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when the surface is damp . They contain anti-mould fungicides to help prevent mould . Paint over with emulsion . <p> Textured Paint " This is an alternative to a basecoat for covering hairline cracks and imperfections . These heavy paints will leave a permanent tough , textured finish . Can be painted over with emulsion . <p> New Plaster Paint " If you are painting new plaster , it is a good idea to use a specialist sealer or paint to start with . Trade paints are available which are designed to be used on new plaster and plasterboard . These are made so that they allow the plaster to breathe and continue drying out . <p> Topcoat Paints for Walls <p> Vinyl Matt Emulsion " Emulsion paints are water-based , easy to apply and come in a huge range of colours . Matt emulsion gives a flat finish , which will make tiny imperfections harder to see " shinier paints will reflect the light and show up uneven surfaces much more . Matt finishes are generally less durable than the glossier emulsions , will mark easily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matt finishes are available . Matt paint should always be used for ceilings . One-coat versions of emulsions are often available , which are a thicker solution . <p> Vinyl Satin Emulsion " Also known as soft sheen and mid sheen , satin emulsion is slightly reflective with a sheen to it , meaning that it reflects light more than matt . This makes it a good choice for darker rooms . Satin is a more durable option , allowing you to wipe off dirty finger marks and grease stains . <p> Vinyl Silk Emulsion " Silk emulsion has a much shinier , reflective finish so you need to be careful where you choose to use it . It 's not really suitable for reception rooms , as it is too reflective . Its wipe-clean properties makes it good for kitchens and children 's bedrooms . <p> Kitchen and Bathroom Paint " Many paint companies make specific kitchen and bathroom paints , as these rooms require specialist properties . Kitchen paints are Often available in a matt finish , but they are much tougher than a standard matt . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washable . Bathroom paints are made to withstand condensation and discourage mould . <p> Magic White/Pink-to-White " Painting pure white on walls can be hard work " it 's hard to see where you 've been , and easy to miss bits . Some paint companies have developed an emulsion that is pale pink when you paint it on , but dries to white . This makes the job much easier , allowing you to see easily where you 've already been . <p> Special Effects " A range of special effect paints are now available , including metallic , shimmer , glitter and suede effect . Shimmer and glitter effect paints are usually designed to be painted over a colour . Metallic paints often have a colour of their own , such as gold , silver and bronze . Suede effects come in a set range of colours . <h> Painting Wood and Metal <p> Paint and Products for Wood and Metal Preparation <p> Primer and Undercoat " Wood , metal and other surfaces require priming and undercoating before they can be painted with a topcoat finish . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercoat paints available . Some are designed specifically for wood , others are multi-surface , meaning they can be used on wood , metal and other surfaces " check the tin to make sure it is suitable for the surface you want to cover . Some are quick-drying but others are not , so be sure to check the drying time before painting over . <p> Topcoat Paints for Wood and Metal <p> Gloss " A tough , durable paint with a shiny finish , perfect for use on doors and skirtings , and often suitable for use on radiators and other metals . Check the tin to make sure it is suitable if you are painting anything other than wood . Gloss paints are available in a wide range of colours . Quick-drying , one-coat and non-drip versions are often available . <p> Satin " As with emulsion , satin wood and metal paints dry with a more subtle finish than gloss , giving a subtle sheen rather than a high shine . Satinwood paints are developed to be just as durable as gloss , and just as washable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint that is suitable for wood and metal , often including radiators . The eggshell finish has a soft sheen to it , and eggshell paints are often available in heritage colour ranges . <h> Painting Tiles , Radiators , Appliances , MDF and Floors <p> Aside from walls timber and metal items found in your home there are also many other items that require painting either for the sake of maintenance e.g. painting and sealing a garage floor or just to tidy them up and give them a new lease of life such as painting ceramic tiles in teh kitchen if you can not remove them or painting that nasty scratch on teh side of the washing machine . Some of these items and how they can be painted are as follows : <p> Tile Paint " Specific tile paints are available , if you want to brighten or cover up old tiles without the bother of retiling . These paints are designed to paint over tile surfaces and be durable . They also smooth over nicely , helping to eliminate brush-marks . Tile paints are available in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satin paints say that they are suitable for painting radiators with , but specialist radiator paints are also available . These are especially tough , heat " resistant and resist yellowing with age . Spray and brush-on versions are both available <p> Appliance Paint " If your appliances ( washing machine , fridge etc ) are looking old and tired , you could try giving them a coat of appliance paint to brighten them up . Specially devised to resist chips and scratches , and dry to a smooth finish without brush-marks <p> Melamine &amp; MDF Paint " Also known as cupboard paint , these paints are designed to cover melamine and will give old furniture and cupboards a new lease of life . If you ca n't afford a new kitchen , try painting your cupboards instead . Available in a limited range of colours , these paints have a durable satin finish that resists bruch-marks . More information on painting MDF can be found in our project here <p> Floor Paint " Designed for wooden and concrete floors , these paints are extra-tough and durable , developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited range of colours <p> Fire-Retardant Paint " Fire retardant paints are sometimes required by building regulations . These are available for walls and wood , and are available in a range of colours . Fire-retardant paints usually need to be purchased from a specialist supplier , who will help you with your requirements to ensure you have the right level of protection .

Cold spots can cause damp and mould to appear on your walls , which left unattended can result in damage to plaster and internal decoration . Their causes can be various but fortunately most are reasonably easy to cure , so if you have cold spots in your house then read on and find out how to get them sorted . <p> Cold spots on internal walls and damp spots on walls can be caused by a variety of different things , and in this project well discuss the cures for the full range of causes of cold spots and damp spots on your interior and external walls . The act of warm air within the room touching a cold interior wall will in most cases create condensation and damp spots which in turn can create other issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold spots as soon as you notice them . <p> In the majority of cases there are only a few reasons why cold spots and damp spots appear on walls . These are listed below along with details on the effects that cold and damp walls can have on your living space . <p> If after reading this guide you would still like some additional expert advice give Property Repair Systems a call on 01626 336108 . <p> The most common effects of cold and damp on interior walls are clusters of condensation ( in early stages ) , black mould , damaged plaster ( in extreme cases the plaster starts to blow off the wall ) and occasionally a build-up of a white salt like substance ( Hygroscopic Salts produce a white staining , and salts can instead present as a raised , crunchy salt deposit which can blow your plaster ) . <p> In the case of a Hygroscopic Salt issue ( hygroscopic meaning water attracting ) , these can sometimes be more pronounced around a chimney breast . Burning fuels produces mineral and tar by-products , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through walls and on to the internal surface of the walls . This means that hygroscopic salt issues are generally more likely on chimney breasts , and that this may well be the cause of your damp wall issue if you have a chimney in your room . Because hygroscopic salts are moisture attracting , this means that any salt deposits will create damp patches that come and go this is another good indicator for hygroscopic salts being your issue or at least part of your issue . <h> How to Cure the Cause of Cold Spots and Damp Spots on Your Internal and External Walls <p> Rusted or Dirty Wall Ties <p> Issue - As you may know , wall ties are inserted between courses of brick and effectively tie the two walls in a cavity wall together , which allows them to support each other . At the time of construction , mortar used to build the walls can fall and land on wall ties within the cavity . Over time this mortar can collect other rubbish , dust particles and moisture and then provide this moisture a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge . This creates a difference in temperature around the affected area compared with the rest of the wall ( a cold spot on the wall ) which can cause condensation which can then turn the cold spot into a damp spot too . <p> Wall ties can also rust due to prolonged exposure to moisture and water . When this happens , the rusting process can cause the tie to expand , causing the mortar that the tie is sitting in to break up , which creates a gap in the external wall . This in turn allows cold air and moisture to penetrate the external wall and access the inner cavity wall , again causing a cold spot on the interior wall which can attract condensation and become damp . <p> The wall ties between two walls can become thermal bridges and cause the mortar in the walls to break , creating cold spots on the walls <p> Fix The only way to properly inspect the issue and fix it is to locate the suspect wall tie ( the best method for this is to hire a metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably around the area where the damp patches are ) . Once you have located the wall tie inspect the area around it for damage to mortar etc .. Now remove one or two bricks from the outside wall ( information on this can be found in our Replacing a Damaged Brick Project ) ( NOTE : do not remove more than two - if you need to please consult with a reliable builder or surveyor ) so that you can clearly and easily spot any issues . If the tie is dirty then clean it off thoroughly , removing any debris or mortar that may be present . <p> Issue For anyone that has looked at getting their cavity walls insulated you will probably know from just a brief search online that this can be a bit hit and miss in terms of success . There are quite a few companies out there that ( being diplomatic ) may not necessarily have the correct skill set , knowledge ( what insulation to use , as there are several different types , and in what situations they should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what locations etc ) or tools to do it properly . If you are looking to get this done , make sure that you do your research first . <p> The effects of a poor job can be extensive . If the cavity is not filled to the correct height etc and gaps are left in the fill then this can cause temperature variations and cold spots in your walls , which as we have outlined previously can cause condensation , mould growth , hygroscopic salts , damp spots and other issues . <p> Fix As with the wall ties issue above , the only real way to check that this is causing your cold spots is to remove a couple of bricks from the outside wall directly opposite your cold spot or damp spot on the interior wall . If you are unlucky enough to find that gaps and air spaces are present in your insulation then there is not really a lot that can be done other than getting installers in to do a re-injection ( this may require the removal of the original insulation ) . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and see what they suggest , again be sure to to do your research to find a reliable company . <p> Penetrating Dampness <p> Issue The cause of this is really in the name . This issue occurs when damp and moisture penetrates a surface and affects those surfaces behind it . In most situations this is the result of failure in the pointing between the bricks or blocks of the outside wall , spalling ( cracked and crumbling brick faces ) or cracking in any facing render . In other words , a compromise in the integrity of the protective outside wall . Moisture and water that can then penetrate the wall can in some instances also bring in salts from the brickwork that go on to cause their own problems . Salts , as they are known , get drawn out from a damp wall as the moisture evaporates from the surface of the wall . <p> These salts are then left on the surface as raised , crunchy deposits on and in your plaster that can split your plaster . Damp spots on your wall are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose heat three times faster than dry walls . Again , this attracts moisture which condenses on the damp spot to make the situation worse . <p> Salts can get washed out of damp walls and blow your plaster off your wall <p> Fix If you find that you have damaged pointing mortar then it will need replacing ( see our Pointing and Repointing Mortar project for more information ) . Any damaged or spalling bricks will also need replacing . This is a fairly straightforward job and more information can be found in our Replacing a Damaged Brick project on the link above . <p> When it comes to damaged render this will also need to be fixed . The reasons for render failing vary , but the most common reasons are that there may be not enough of a " key " for it to grip on to on the surface beneath ( scratch coat ) , the scratch coat is of a different consistency to the top coat , the walls surface was not prepared correctly , it may have been laid in poor weather conditions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be the result of movement of the property over the years . <p> Cracks in your render can allow water in which creates damp and patches on your walls <p> In some cases render cracks can be repaired using suitable filler and the join sealed afterwards , but this repair will always be visible in most instances , even if you paint it . If you are not too concerned about this , then this could be an option . <p> If you have numerous cracks running all over the face of your render then the best option is to hack it all off and re-render ensuring that the surface wall is correctly prepared ( clean all mortar joints , face of the wall ( power wash if possible ) , remove any paint , and paint the wall with SBR bonding slurry . Rendering can be a tricky job so to ensure a good finish either practice first until you are suitably proficient or seek the services of a decent and reliable plasterer/renderer . You may be thinking that a complete re-render is expensive and you would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be somewhere around the region of 2500 - 3500 but to ensure you are rid of any cold spot and damp spot issues and have a great finish sometimes you just have to bite the bullet . <p> Pipes , Wires and Fixings <p> Issue Another cause of damp spots and cold spots in your room can be the presence of pipes , wires or fixings within the wall itself . On occasion during the construction of the property the builder/heating engineer may choose to run some pipe work ( normally central heating related ) within the cavity . Likewise , an electrician may choose to run some wiring ( possibly lighting related ) from a light switch , up the cavity and over the ceiling to a lighting fixture . This is not necessarily the best way to do things but it does happen . <p> Similarly there can be a massive amount of fixings , bolts and screws that are attached to the internal walls of a property , i.e. the walls of your rooms inside the house . Its not uncommon for these to go through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When this happens , any moisture or water that is present in the void , whether from leaks in your roof or cracks in your mortar , can have a direct path to the surface of the inside wall by settling on and running along the fixing , causing damp spots and cold spots on your interior wall . This issue can be a good indication that you are suffering from a leak somewhere , so at this point it would be a very good idea to carry out a thorough investigation and locate the source of any leaks and fix them . Any gaps around your fixings will also allow water and cold air into your void , which will contribute to any damp or cold spot issues you are having . <p> Pipes that run through your cavity can transport water to your internal wall and create cold and damp areas <p> Fix If its not obvious which fixing is causing the problem , its a good idea to remove a brick from the outside wall directly opposite the issue to see if you can locate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame . <p> The first course of action is to remove the protruding object from the wall and correctly fill the hole using a suitable solid filler ( if removal is possible ) . If it is not possible to remove the object e.g. its a heating pipe , then you will have to fill the gap around it fully . In this instance use flexible filler as the pipe work will likely expand and contract . <p> Fill any gaps around fixings and pipes in your walls with a flexible filler to stop water and air from entering the cavity and causing cold spot issues <h> How to Fix the Effects of Cold Spots and Damp Spots on Your Walls <p> White salts and Blowing Plaster <p> Issue - This is typically caused by a water or moisture leak . The leak itself can draw the salts present in bricks , blocks etc. through the inner cavity wall where they then create a visual impact on the walls of a room space . This can be more apparent around chimney breasts ( chimney salts ) where the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can condense on the inside of a chimney breast . Typically they will leave a yellowy brown residue due to the tars that are released from materials such as wood during the burning process . <p> These salts are hygroscopic in nature ( moisture attracting ) and not only manifest themselves as a white salty substance staining the surface of your chimney breast but also attract moisture from the ambient air within a room , creating damp spots and cold spots and even whole cold interior walls . These damp patches usually come and go with the changing humidity of your room , so if this is happening , its likely that hygroscopic salts are the cause of your damp issues . <p> Hygroscopic salts created by the burning of fuel in your chimney can cause damp and cold patches to appear on your chimney breast and walls <p> There is another type of salt deposit known as salts that appears as a crunchy , raised white deposit . These salts are deposited on the wall when a damp issue is present in your wall when the moisture evaporates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salts behind . These salts are usually created as a result of a leak or severe damp issue , and they can blow your plaster right off the wall . <p> Salt deposits caused by damp can blow the plaster in your wall <p> Fix If your salts are hygroscopic , that is , if your damp patches come and go , and there are no other damp issues apart from that , take a look at the state of your plaster . If its sound , then you are okay to treat your wall with salt neutraliser . There are quite a few available on the market at present but the best salt neutraliser we 've found is made by PRS - it produces consistently great results . <p> This will stop the salts appearing once it is dry , you can then redecorate.If your salts are hygroscopic but your plaster is blown , you will have to strip the plaster off and treat the underlying wall with salt neutraliser instead you can get salt neutraliser that you paint directly onto the wall , a salt neutraliser that is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a salt neutraliser that you can add to your plaster mix . <p> Salt neutraliser solution to mix with plaster <p> If you have salt deposits on your walls , or hygrocopic salts are n't  the only cause of your damp and cold walls , the first task to complete is to locate and repair any leaks and moisture points . Take a look further down this page for fixes for different moisture sources . Once this is done , you will then have to dry the area out , removing any damp spots on the walls and taking as much time as needed , in some cases several months . Heaters , ventilation , fans and dehumidifiers can help with this . <p> Once completely dry assess the damage there is a chance that if your damp spots are fairly minor then any plaster present or surface decoration will have survived once dry . If this is the case then you can leave the old plaster on and just treat for salts before redecorating . You can do this by applying a salt neutraliser to the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutraliser made by PRS as its a reliable solution . <p> Once the neutraliser coat on the wall is dry , you can then redecorate . If the damp has caused any staining on your walls , you can use a Stain and Damp primer on the area first to prevent the stains from showing through the newly decorated surface . Again , as with all things there are a great number of suitable products available on the market but we tend to use PRS Ultra Stain and Damp Primer Paint . <p> Stain and damp blocking paint <p> In most cases any consistent water or moisture ingress and damp spots to a plastered surface will damage it beyond easy repair and cause it to blow off of the wall so it will all need to be hacked off , removing the damaged area and also any affected areas around it . With all the plaster removed , allow any further damp areas beneath to dry thoroughly and where hygroscopic salts are present , treat with a salt neutraliser . You can get a pre-mixed salt neutraliser and plaster mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the plaster mix ( as mentioned above ) . <p> In extreme salt conditions it may also be necessary to apply not only the salt neutraliser but also an air gap membrane to prevent further salts from penetrating the plastered surface . These air gap or mesh membranes are effectively insulated and pitted plastic sheets that form an insulating barrier between your wall and the decorated surface . There is a varied selection on the market such as those made by Twistfix and Dry Wall and Floor but we use the Mesh Membrane from Property Repair Systems . <p> Attach a mesh membrane to your wall to stop severe salt problems showing through after repair <p> Now that you have dealt with your cold spot and damp spot causes , dried the area and removed any affected materials and prepped with a suitable product to prevent any further issues you can now replaster . As with all things DIY you can do it yourself ( practice first ) or get a plasterer in . At this point it may also be worth considering replastering with a lime based plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered , cover it with a suitable damp and stain primer and then you can redecorate job done ! <p> Low Level Damp Spots on Internal and External Walls - Rising Damp <p> Issue - As mentioned in the title , the tell-tale signs of this issue tend to be cold spots and damp spots on your interior walls just above the skirting boards ( normally damp to the touch or with a black mould build up ) and a build up of lichens and moss on the external walls . <p> Rising damp is , as the name suggests , damp that rises up from the water and moisture found in the ground . To prevent this from happening , a damp proof course ( a waterproof layer ) is fitted between courses of bricks about 6 inches up from ground level . The damp proof course itself can be constructed from a variety of different materials including slate , felt and plastic sheeting . <p> Most houses have a damp proof course installed when they 're built to prevent damp rising from the ground into the walls of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicator that either you do n't  have a damp proof course ( DPC ) installed , your damp proof course is broken in some way , or your damp proof course has been bridged . Bridging occurs when debris in the cavity void reaches above the level of the DPC and provides a route for damp and moisture to by-pass the DPC and carry on rising into the wall above it , or the external ground level or something attached to your external walls reaches above the DPC , allowing moisture a route around the DPC on the outside of the wall instead . These issues will need checking on the external wall , directly opposite the affected area on the internal wall using one of the following methods : <p> Confirm that you actually have a DPC , as especially in older properties , some houses have been built with no DPC . <p> If the DPC is not visible on the external wall dig down a few inches if possible to look for your DPC there . If you find it below ground level then you have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the external wall near the affected area , check these to see if they reach above the DPC . If they do , then there may be an external bridging issue . <p> If the DPC is visible above ground level , remove a brick or two ( no more than two ) and inspect the cavity for debris . More information on how to remove a brick is available in the project mentioned above . <p> Inspect the DPC for damage , wear and tear and compromising . <p> Check that there 's no debris in your cavity wall that 's reaching above your DPC and bridging it this allows damp to travel up in the debris and around the DPC <p> Fix The findings of your investigations will dictate what fix you implement . In the case that your Damp Proof Course is bridged externally , you will have to remove the obstructing object to expose the damp proof course once more . If this is not possible e.g. the obstructing object is a fairly recently constructed conservatory , then you will need to insert a new DPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this by drilling holes into your internal and external walls and injecting a special chemical DPC liquid or cream this is a chemical formulation that is absorbed into the brick . <p> Once in the brick , the chemicals join together with one another across the brick to form a waterproof layer . You can use one of the many DIY chemical DPC injection kits available on the market such as Permaguard , Twistfix etc . We tend to use the cream DPC formulation made by Property Repair Systems . This fix will also be the same if you do n't  have a damp proof course or if you have a DPC but its damaged . <p> Inject a new damp proof course in your walls to stop damp rising into your walls <p> If when you have removed bricks you find that your DPC has been bridged inside the cavity void by debris , you will need to clear all the debris out and ensure that no further rubbish enters the space . Use tough gloves to do this as some of the debris may be sharp . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once you have solved the source of water or moisture ingress you can then go about repairing the damage done by the damp spots . Dry out the area thoroughly taking as much time as needed for this and then assess the results . In light damage cases the plaster may be able to be saved . You can then treat the surface with a salt neutraliser if there are any salt deposits present , and you can remove any mould present with an anti-mould cleaner . <p> You can apply a damp and stain primer to prevent any staining caused by the damp showing through on the newly decorated surfaces . Once the treated wall is dry you can then redecorate as required . <p> Use an anti-mould cleaner to remove the mould from your walls surfaces before redecorating <p> If the damage to the plaster is too extensive then the entire damaged area will need to be hacked off and replaced . Any damp underneath will need to be dried out and then the walls surface treated as needed with a salt neutraliser if salts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the walls surface such as PRS salt neutraliser , or you can get neutralisers that you add or are already added to the plaster mix you 're using for replastering . If there are heavy salts present you will also need to cover the wall with a mesh membrane before you replaster . The membrane stops the salts from travelling into your plaster in the future . More information on attaching a mesh membrane to your wall can be found in our Mesh Membrane project page . <p> Damp Spots and Cold Spots on or Around Chimney <p> Issue - The normal causes of this are hygroscopic chimney salts . These salts , as mentioned above , mostly come from the materials that are burnt e.g. wood etc . The mineral deposits that build up on the inside of a chimney breast can seep through the wall and appear on the external chimney breast surface and create damage in the form of white and brown staining and salt buildup . These salts attract moisture and cause damp spots to appear on the chimney breast , which usually come and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the salt deposits are penetrating the wall could also indicate a leak , so you will also have to check any open chimney pots to ensure moisture is not getting in here and also cracked mortar , broken tiles , damaged flashing etc . More information on what to check to find what 's causing damp in your chimney area can be found in our Chimney Damp Project page . <p> Trace the source of the damp penetrating your chimney before repairing any damage <p> Another cause of cold and damp patches in your chimney area can be poor ventilation a chimney breast should be vented top and bottom to produce a decent air flow and prevent cold air becoming trapped in the void . If cold air is trapped in the void then your chimney breast will most likely be at a different temperature to the rest of the room , which in most situations will cause a cold spot or a cold wall where moisture in the air will then condense and cause a damp patch . This issue can be more prevalent if you have capped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had suitable ventilation installed . <p> Fix In the event that you have hygroscopic salts creating damp spots and staining on your walls or chimney breast , and your plaster is sound , then you can fix the salt issue by painting on a salt neutraliser as mentioned earlier . If there is any mould present you will need to clean this off with an anti-mould cleaner , and if there are any stains left by the damp and mould you can ensure these do n't  show through the new decoration by painting on an anti-stain primer first . <p> If the plaster is not sound , you will need to hack off any damaged plaster and then treat the underlying surface with a salt neutraliser and fit a mesh membrane to the wall before re-plastering if the salt deposits are heavy ( products to do so are mentioned above ) . <p> If you find that you do not have any ventilation in your chimney ( either top or bottom or both ) then you will need to add some , in the form of cowls for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of your fireplace if you have a blocked up fireplace . You should aim to insert your airbrick in the wall on the ground floor about 300mm up from the floor . If you have a suspended floor with a void underneath it may be best to position the vent under the floor as this will help to prevent draughts in room spaces ( ensure the void beneath the floor itself is also ventilated via air bricks in the external walls ) . <p> Add an airbrick to your blocked up fireplace to add ventilation and reduce chimney damp <p> In terms of top ventilation , an air brick should be inserted towards the top of the chimney breast on the outside wall of the property to allow any cold air to ventilate outwards . If your chimney pots are capped , you should replace the caps with cowls these are ventilated caps that do n't  allow rain to enter but still allow air to enter and leave . Cowls are available in a wide variety of styles and in different materials such as metal and clay . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation without letting rainwater and damp in <p> With the ventilation issues sorted you will have to dry the damaged area out properly - this may take some time . Now remove any wallpaper that may be covering the damaged area and assess the condition of the plaster . If the damage is not too bad then you can cover it with a damp and stain blocking paint ( suitable product mentioned above ) and then redecorate over the top . <p> If the plaster is too far gone then any damage will need to be hacked off and replaced with new plaster . Again if salts are present , treat with a salt neutraliser and add a membrane if necessary . <p> If you need any help finding the cause of the cold spots on your walls and curing them , please contact Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 and they will be happy to help with any damp issues you may have .

How and where to use different types of tiles such as on kitchen walls , floors and worktops , wet rooms and bathroom walls and floors . <p> In general , ceramic tiles give one of the most durable and hardwearing finishes that can be found in a home . Whether they are used for walls , floors or worktops they have a great many applications , sizes , colours , designs and shapes . <p> Aside from ceramic you can also find vinyl , lino and cork tiles ( these are mainly used for flooring ) . They also offer the same advantages in the ease that they can be laid plus the fact that they are a lot less noisy underfoot than their ceramic counterparts . <h> Ceramic Tiles <p> The most common application of ceramic tiles is in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls or the floor . This is mainly due to the fact that they are hardwearing , water resistant and easy to clean . <p> Often tiles are applied to the most vulnerable areas in a space e.g. the spashback around a sink or basin , in a shower or wet room etc .... but in the case of the latter you may find that the entire room is tiled from floor to ceiling . <p> Wetroom tiled floor to ceiling using large tiles - Image courtesy of dream-bathrooms.co.uk <p> Tiles applied to walls are generally quite thin but in some cases they can be a lot thicker depending on their size and whether they have been imported . <p> The most common type , of which you probably already have in your home , is the square tile but rectangular tiles are becoming more popular . <p> The designs found on tiles change in respect to current fashion trends and demand and interior design trends and techniques can also influence this . Plain tiles are one of the more popular choices as in most cases these are not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built up to create larger designs . These are know as " feature panels " . These can create quite a sizeable visual impact if surrounded by plain tiles . Some ranges known as " insert tiles " can carry molded bathroom accessories such as soap dishes and toilet roll holders . <p> The surface of a ceramic tile is no longer as highly glazed as it once was as you are now able to get semi-matt finishes that quite often feature a textured finish . <p> Floor tiles with a textured and matt finish <p> Tiles can also be purchased with two different corner effects - square edge and round edge . Round edges were traditionally used for exposed edges and square were used in all other areas . <p> In most cases today tiles are either the universal type or the standard square edged variety . Both of these types of tile usually feature two adjacent glazed edges so that they can be used for perimeter tiles also . <p> Traditional square edge ceramic wall tiles <h> Tiles for Floors and Worktops <p> Ceramic floor tiles have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , especially in high traffic areas e.g. porches and hallways .

Dry rot identification is essential if you want to remove any problems for good so in this guide we show you how to diagnose the causes of dry rot , what the difference between dry rot and wet rot is and what the correct dry rot treatment is for timber , stone and brick . This guide also includes pictures for help with identification . <p> Dry rot is a fungus that , once it enters your house , can cause a great deal of damage to your timber . As with most issues that affect the structural integrity of your house , early detection and prevention are a lot easier and more effective than treating the issue when it 's been given time to develop - here we give you a guide to dry rot identification and dry rot treatment and also the causes of dry rot complete with plenty of dry rot pictures , as well as guidance on how to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content below you would still like some further expert help and advice please give Property Repair Systems a call on 01626 336 180 . All advice is free with no obligations . <p> Dry rot can colonise your timber and damage its structure <h> What is Dry Rot ? <p> The term " dry rot " is somewhat misleading - this type of fungal decay was historically named " dry rot " to differentiate between rots that occurred in " wet wood " ( i.e. newly felled timber ) and " dry wood " ( i.e. timber ready to be used in building ) . In fact , dry rot needs for your timber to be wetter than it should be to establish itself - typically your timber will need to have a moisture content of around 28 - 30% for the fungal spores ( usually appearing as an orange dust ) to germinate and produce hyphae , strands that develop into a fungal body known as a mycelium . Once the fungus is established , it only needs for your timber to have a moisture content of over 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that can travel across stone and brick to find more timber to colonise . <p> Dry rot if left untreated can cause your wood to crumble away - early detection of the rot is key to saving the timber <p> This fungal colonisation causes what is known as " brown rot decay " - and the fungus that most commonly causes dry rot in the UK is known as Serpula lacrymans . The decay happens because the fungus feeds on your timber - it extracts water , hemicellulose and cellulose from the wood , leaving a brittle " skeleton " structure behind . This decay cracks the wood in a fine , square pattern , and also makes it crumbly and a darker or browner colour . <p> Eventually , the wood will crumble into dust , which obviously could well cause parts of your house to collapse . The rot wo n't affect your masonry at all as it does n't feed on it - it simply travels through it . Dry rot can be present in your walls for months or years before the fungus appears on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no fungal bodies on your walls there may be rot in the wall itself - the easiest way to detect any rot in your walls is to use minimally invasive tools like Dry Rot Detection Sticks if you have any reason to think that your timber is or has been damp . <h> What Causes Dry Rot ? <p> Dry rot occurs when your timber has been dampened for some reason - there are two reasons for this happening : <p> Your house is old and was built with non-kiln dried timber . Kiln dried timber must have an average moisture content of 20% or less to be classified as such and is now compulsory for internal building work . An old home may also have clay roof tiles which do not meet current Building Regulation water permeability standards and non-British Standard materials which may or be less effective at keeping water from outside your house from entering your timber <p> You 've had moisture enter your timber as a result of a damp problem <p> Wood that has a KD symbol has been kiln dried , making Dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no damp issues in your house <p> Even if your damp problem has since been solved , as mentioned above any Dry Rot that colonised whilst your timber was damp may well still be there . Any and all of the damp problems that can affect a house can dampen your timber - examples include Rising Damp , Penetrating Damp , and damaged chimney and roof flashing . If you have n't had a damp problem but think you have Dry Rot , this indicates that you do have a damp problem somewhere in your house - the area of your house affected by the rot will be a useful indicator of the type of damp problem you may be facing . Take a look at our Damp pages for more information on solving any damp issues in your home . <p> Damp problems can make your timber damp enough for Dry Rot to colonise <p> You must make sure that any damp issues are solved before you try and treat your Dry Rot - any treatments will become ineffective if your timber gets damp again as they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <h> What 's the Difference Between Dry Rot and Wet Rot ? <p> Wet Rot is caused by different fungi to Dry Rot , and it is generally easier to treat because it can not travel across dry areas to reach other timber - it is confined to the damp timber area it originally colonised . Wet Rot also colonises timber that has a higher moisture content than the timber that Dry Rot colonises - this means that if your timber is really damp and then dries out some , Wet Rot will stop colonising it ( as it is too dry for it ) but Dry Rot will then move in as it is now " dry " enough for Dry Rot to colonise . <p> Dry Rot Pictures and Images <p> Dry rot fungal body on an outside wall <p> Dry rot fruiting body on a timber beam <p> Dry rot causes cube shaped cracks in your wood <p> Wet Rot vs .

This is why if you hire a surveyor to assess your rot damage , they will need to strip back some of your walls to examine exactly how far the rot has spread . <p> This is obviously far from ideal , and so it 's great that there are products on the market that can allow you to detect any dry rot in your timber without stripping back your walls . Fugenex Dry Rot Sensor Sticks are available from PRS here and these can be insert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue dye in the stick 's stem ( see the pictures below ) turns yellow in the presence of oxalic acid , a product which only dry rot produces in any significant quantity . Not only does this mean that it detects dry rot without you having to strip back your walls , but it also helps you to identify whether your rot is wet rot or dry rot if there are fungal bodies or cracks in your timber but you 're not sure which type of rot is present - this is because wet rot does not produce the level of oxalic acid that the sensor reacts to . <p> Dry rot starts producing oxalic acid before it has done serious damage to the wood , so with any luck you will be able to detect your Dry Rot with the sticks while the wood is still able to be saved with treatment rather than having to be replaced . <p> To use the sticks , insert them into pre drilled holes in your wall that are 8mm in diameter and 110mm in length and leave the sticks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't matter whether the stick is inserted along or across the grain of your timber , and you can insert the sticks in the outside facing surface of walls too . <p> If you 're inserting the sticks in internal walls , a little bit of space should be left around the stick as it may swell - in external walls this is also ideal but you will need to be careful not to leave so much space that rainwater can enter . There is no minimum depth for the sticks to be inserted to , but it is ideal to insert them so that their full length is inside your wall ( 110mm ) . <p> Insert Fugenex Dry Rot sensor sticks into your wall to detect Dry Rot <p> The dye on the sensor stick turns yellow when it is exposed to Dry Rot <p> A close up of the dye change that indicates the presence of Dry Rot <p> The sensor stick 's stem can also be read with a damp meter to identify if there is a damp problem currently present in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like further confirmation of exactly which rot is present and how far it has spread , PRS can offer you some expert guidance free of charge or put you in touch with your local rot specialist to come and take a look . If you do have Wet Rot rather than Dry Rot , more information on how to treat this can be found in the Wood Protection Association 's guide to Rot for Homeowners . <h> Dry Rot Treatment and Repair <p> There are a number of ways you can treat and repair dry rot-affected timber . Remember that if there 's any indication that there is a damp problem in your house , you will need to find the cause of this and treat it before treating and repairing dry rot damage . This is because any new damp will dilute the treatment chemicals that you have applied - the dilution will happen because all of these chemicals are water soluble so that they can enter damp masonry and timber . <p> If you do have Dry Rot present in your house , you should use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot has spread in your house . If you 're sure that the rot is only present in exposed timber , i.e. exposed joists , then you will need to just treat the timber itself , along with any masonry that the joists are in contact with . <p> Obviously , if your timber 's structure has been severely damaged by the rot , you will need to replace it ( or get it replaced by a building professional ) . More information on which timber to use for different applications is available on the Timber Trade Federation website . <p> Once this is done it is still a good idea to treat the surrounding masonry and timber as fungal strands may have already entered that area too - they can be invisible to the naked eye if they are small . <p> If you have visible signs of dry rot on your wall as in the pictures above , or your sensor sticks indicate the presence of dry rot within the wall , you will need to strip the plaster off the wall and treat the bare wall underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products available for dry rot treatment in timber .

They can be bought " pre-finished " or ready to paint . <p> Available for both the interior and exterior , most merchants and DIY sheds have a range of flush doors which offer simplicity with a great finish . This type of door tends to be the most common door type found in more modern and contemporary properties as their clean , flat design tends to compliment a more minimalist look . <p> One of the best features of these types of doors is that you can reduce them in size , add to them and due to their popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , many after market products can be purchased such as locks and other furniture , all available in many different styles and for many different applications . <p> Flush doors can come in solid format which is a door made of solid wood or hollow format which is lightweight and comprised of two layers of thin timber separated , usually , by a lightweight card honeycomb core . <p> Panel doors are doors which are divided into panels set back from the door face . There can be any number of panels and they can form any number of patterns . <p> Panel doors can be made out of timber sheets set into a timber frame structure or by fixing pressed hardboard sheets onto the frame of the door itself . <p> Although in the past they were not regarded as very stylish and often their appearance was rather bland , today this has changed as there are a huge range of styles available including half single glazed and also in a huge range of colours and material types and due to this they now tend to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bought to conform to firecheck safety standards and come in different varieties of timber . <p> Panel doors need not have square panels and many interesting shapes can be moulded and formed to create this style of door .

@@41624587 @1624587/ <h> Types of Paint Brush - The Different Kinds of Paint Brush Used Around the House and How to Use them <p> Summary : Learn about the different types of paint brush and when to use them . This project explains the different types of brushes that are available and how you should use them to get the best possible paint finish . There are a huge range of different paint brush types , so it is worth knowing which is the best one for the job that you are doing . <p> Recognising and choosing different types of paint brush for different jobs is something even the pros have trouble with now . Largely this is because brushes have got so much cheaper over the last 10 years it is now possible to buy reasonable quality brushes for such a low price it is cheaper to throw them away when the job is finished than it is to spend time cleaning them properly . This is , however , still not true of the top quality brushes used by the top quality tradesmen and it is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning their paint brushes . It may even be a question you want to ask them when you are getting quotes for a decorating job . <p> Paint brushes are made from either synthetic fibres or natural hairs . Natural hair brushes are usually Chinese Hog or badgers hair and are recommended for use with oil based paints as they flow more smoothly and actually paint on the surface rather than simply " spread " the paint about . Synthetic brushes , e.g. Nylon or Ployester can be used with all paints but their use with water based , emulsion paints , is more usual . Chinese hog bristles absorb water which makes using them with water based paints very difficult and getting a good finish is almost impossible . Other natural fibres used for good quality paint brushed are Camel hair brushes , Squirrel hair brushes and Sable hair brushes . <p> Specialist , Badgers hair brushes are probably the most expensive brushes and have the softness to allow an excellent finish with oil based paints and all varnishes . When used properly they do not leave brush marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great finish . These are expensive compared to the throw away synthetic brushes but are much easier to clean and take care of . <p> Paint brushes come in a variety of sizes for different uses . A 6 inch ( 150mm ) brush would be great for painting a wall with emulsion but not a great deal of use for painting skirting boards . Different paint brushes also have different handles . Paint brushes with wooden handles usually reflect the cost of the brush and are better , and easier to hold while plastic handles do tend to reflect a cheaper brush . <p> The two real problems with cheaper brushes is that the bristles tend to be stiff , leaving brush marks in the surface , and the bristles can fall out . This is a huge hindrance when painting a tricky door or window frame and add hours to the painting when picking hairs out of new paintwork . Always look at the ends of the bristles when choosing a paint brush . Good quality brushes have split ends . This splitting of the ends is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be collected and delivered to the surface in a much more even and smoother way . The more a brush is flagged the more paint it will hold and it will leave paint on the surface rather than brush marks . A further sign of a good quality brush is tapering on the bristles from a thicker end inserted into the handle to a thinner " business " end . <p> A good quality paint brush will also have bristles of varying lengths . This also helps to hold more paint and release it more smoothly onto the surface . Cheaper brushes contain single thickness , generally unflagged bristles . The best synthetics are Nylon and Polyester brushes . These are usually tapered and multiple sizes are used in the brush to give a better paint holding quality .

In this ferrule there are tiny ( in good quality brushes ) wooden wedges which spread the bristles apart a little to give better paint holding quality . In poor quality brushes these wedges are bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialist painting jobs like painting windows and cutting in edges , smaller , cut end brushes can be used .

@@41624589 @1624589/ <p> Summary : In this project we show you how to treat rising damp using a range of DIY rising damp treatments . We 'll take you through the different causes and signs of rising damp as well as how to treat each of these with different rising damp solutions . <h> What is Rising Damp ? <p> Rising damp is moisture present in your walls as a result of water in the ground underneath or next to your walls rising up through the fabric of the wall , whether it be brick , block or stone . The water travels upwards through the wall as a result of capillary action ( where water is sucked through a small opening such as a tube or hole ) through the tiny holes in the brick or stone . The water stops rising at a height where gravity counteracts the upwards force of the capillary action . This rising damp usually reaches a maximum height of 1.2m , but the effects of the damp , such as salt deposits , may be seen higher up due to the presence of non-breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , renders and paints . <p> How rising damp can rise up from the ground and on up into your walls <h> What are the Signs of Rising Damp ? <p> Typical signs of rising damp rather than other damp problems are a tide line of yellowish or brownish staining or blown plaster in the lower area of your wall above your skirting board . You also might have damp or rotting skirting boards or flooring . You may see white , fluffy deposits in your plaster these are salts which the damp has washed out of your bricks and into your plaster . Black spots of mould may also appear on on the damp areas of your wall . <p> A yellow or brown tide line above your skirting board is one of the signs that you may have rising damp in your walls <p> As damp evaporates from your walls it can leave salt deposits behind these are another sign that you have a damp issue <h> What Causes Rising Damp ? <p> Rising damp problems often occur as a result of not having a Damp Proof Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to age or inadequate installation . A Damp Proof Course is a waterproof layer in your wall ( or both walls if you have a cavity wall ) , ideally about six inches from the outside ground on your external wall and under your raised timber floor or near your concrete floor on your internal wall ( so both DPC 's are on the same level ) . This layer repels water a variety of different DPC 's are available and will be discussed in this project . <p> A damp proof course will stop rising damp from rising up into your walls it is a waterproof layer that sits between your bricks across your house <p> You may be experiencing rising damp even if your Damp Proof Course is functioning well in this case the DPC may be breached - that is , there may be something attached to your walls that is allowing water to travel around the Damp Proof Course and continue moving upwards . It may be that there is an area of ground next to your external wall that is higher than your DPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps ) which is attached above the DPC , allowing water to travel up through this and cross to the wall over the DPC . There are several other ways your DPC might be bridged . Your internal plaster may be directly connected to a solid floor at the bottom on your internal wall . Your cavity wall may also have debris inside of it , whether it is leftover building materials or something else . If this debris reaches above the DPC 's then this can create another bridge for moisture to travel from the ground over the DPC and up your wall as rising damp . <p> Rising damp can happen as a result of debris present in your cavity wall bridging the Damp Proof Course and giving water a way to travel around the DPC and up into your walls <p> Remember that your damp problem may not necessarily be caused by rising damp there may be another source of water that you are not aware of . A telltale sign that your damp is not rising damp is if the damp patches are higher up than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which case you may be suffering from penetrating dampness instead . To be sure that rising damp is the issue you 're facing , take a look at our other project page Damp Diagnosing and Analysing project page . <p> Uneven damp patches higher on your wall than 1.2 metres may mean that you have penetrating dampness in your walls instead of rising damp <h> How Can I Find Out What is Causing my Rising Damp ? <p> If , at any point during the diagnosis process you feel that you need some additional insight or advice please call Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 . They will be able to offer you assistance free of charge . <p> You should first check that you have a Damp Proof Course this will usually be visible outside your house as a line 6 inches above the ground . If you do have a DPC , check that there are no structures bridging your DPC examples include higher outside ground or outside steps that are higher than your DPC and internal plaster that directly meets a solid floor . The rising damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  have a DPC or their DPC is higher up than yours , allowing the damp to travel around your DPC . <p> If you do not have a damp proof course or it is bridged or below ground level this could be causing your rising damp problem <p> As mentioned earlier , your DPC may also be bridged internally . This happens when your cavity wall becomes filled with debris , which can happen during the building of your house . This can reach higher than the level of the DPC , allowing water to travel up it and over the DPC , then it can travel , via the bridging material , through the wall to the inside . You can check for this by removing some of the bricks on your external wall ( do n't  remove more than two bricks without consulting a tradesman or surveyor ) . Using a phone with a light or a camera , take a look around the cavity . If there is debris there , you can take this out by hand if you can reach it ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and use a bar to drag any out of reach objects closer to you . To get smaller bits and dust out , use an old vacuum cleaner . Once the cavity area you have access to is clear , replace your bricks . <p> Brick wall with brick faces blown off <h> Treating Rising Damp <p> As with all projects on DIY Doctor , we don t recommend that you deal with the effects of a problem without first tackling the cause . You need to identify the cause , deal with it and then carry out the necessary repairs to deal with the effects . Carrying out a quick-fix for rising damp , ( e.g. repointing or painting over the damp ) will just make the job more expensive in the long term and will mean you need to do the job all over again at a later date . <p> If you 've established that your rising damp is caused by a blocked cavity wall , unblock your cavity as described in the section above . <p> If you know that your Damp Proof Course is bridged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try to remove or adjust whatevers causing the bridge so that it only reaches below the DPC , i.e. digging a trench that 's six inches deep by your house if your Damp Proof Course is buried in the ground currently . In this case , make sure that water does n't  pool in the ditch you 've created , as this will cause its own damp problems . <p> If you cant remove the object breaching your DPC or you have an absent or faulty DPC , the best way of treating your rising damp is to damp proof in other words , to install a new Damp Proof Course in your walls . This can be the first DPC your house has had or installing one above your existing one if you have a structure breaching your DPC that you ca n't move , you 'll need to install a new DPC above the structure instead . You can try to top up an existing damp proof course but this is n't advised as you need a continuous waterproof layer without breaks and this fix does n't  guarantee that , meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical formulation Damp Proof Courses are installed in liquid form a popular choice for DIYers <h> Dealing with Damp - The Different Types of Damp Proof Course <p> When houses are built with a DPC the builders will usually fit a sheet Damp Proof Course made from stainless steel or plastic its obviously harder to do this once the house is built , though you can vibrate stainless steel sheet into your walls using saw cut slots if you want to this will however need to be done by a tradesman . There are plenty of easier retrofit DPC options available these include : <p> Water repellent chemicals These are creams , gels or pastes that need to be injected , which are suitable for DIY and professional use on all types of wall <p> Pore blocking salt mixture This is a cement based mortar , which again needs to be injected and is mostly suitable for professional use and only on stone walls <p> Osmotic water repellence This can be passive or active and is done via embedded wires and is mostly suitable for professional use only <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIY damp proof treatment solutions <h> How to Install Your Damp Proof Course to Stop Rising Damp <p> Whichever method you choose to use , you will need to install your DPC on both your internal and external walls if you have a cavity wall . The level at which the DPC is installed needs to be at least 6 inches above the level of your outside ground and at the same level on your inside wall if your outside ground level is higher than your internal floor level , you need to make a trench in your ground by your external wall deep enough that your DPC can be level with your concrete floor or under your raised timber floor inside . If this is not possible , you will need to install the internal DPC above your floor level so that it is level with the outside DPC , which means that you will need to tank ( waterproof ) your internal wall below the DPC line to minimise any water ingress in that area . More information on solving damp issues below your DPC can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however your walls are configured , you will need to remove any skirting boards and the plaster on your internal walls up from your floor level to where you want to install your DPC . <p> The easiest and most practical DIY rising damp treatment to use in your DPC installation is , as we 've mentioned , the chemical water repellent DPC available as a liquid , cream , gel or paste . <p> Water repellent chemical formulations <p> You will need to drill holes between 10 and 12mm diameter into your wall , either in the mortar , brick or stone . <p> Drill the external and internal walls separately or in one go by drilling across the cavity from the outside if you have a cavity wall . <p> Read your DPC liquid/creams specific instructions to decide this and your drilling pattern , as well as whether your wall needs to be damp for the liquid/cream to work . <p> Inject the solution using a high pressure pump for liquid formulations or a low pressure hand operated skeleton gun or manual pump for cream , gel and paste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp wall over a few months to form a water repellent layer . Because this barrier stops any more water from rising above it , this allows your wall above the DPC to dry out and stay dry . <p> Fill the holes you have made in your walls with a mortar into which you have mixed a water proofer this adds an extra layer of waterproofing and means that the walls finish is returned almost to how it looked before the holes were created . <p> Make sure you allow your mortar to dry out properly before treating the wall for any salt deposits and replastering if necessary . This method is quick , neat and easy , with the resulting DPC being barely visible . <p> First , drill holes that are 10-12mm in diameter varying this according to the DPC manufacturers instructions <p> Fill the holes with a chemical formulation DPC this is a cream/paste/gel being used with a skeleton gun <p> You can also use a hand pump to pump in your chemical formulation Damp Proof Course <p> Pore blocking salt mixture <p> Drill holes 18-20mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only really suitable for stable , thick stone walls . <p> Mix the cement based mortar with water to make a slurry and use a plastic heavy duty injection gun to inject this into the holes . The mortar sets , giving off lots of heat , and forms a series of solid plugs in your wall . These mortar plugs release water repellent salts which over a few months travel through the wall and block your masonrys pores , preventing any damp from rising . This technique calls for the use of mortar guns and expensive , large drilling equipment so it only makes economic sense for a professional builder to use this method to install a Damp Proof Course . <p> Osmotic water repellence <p> Old versions of this system used wires that were prone to corrosion , but the new Lectros Active System uses titanium wire linked to a transformer and a mains supplied control unit . The wire is run around the walls like a ring main . Again , holes are drilled in the wall , either externally , internally or both . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these loops are inserted into the holes . The wire is then hidden in raked out mortar joints or specially carved out chases and the wire is earthed . The wire is secured in the holes and the chases with a special mortar that increases the conductivity of the system . When the system is switched on , electricity passes through the transformer and the anodes and to earth , which sets up an electric field that repels water . This technique again requires expensive and large drilling equipment and so is only really economical for tradesmen . <h> How to Repair Your Walls after Treating Rising Damp <p> Now you 've sorted the cause of your rising damp , you can move on to tackling any repairs you need to carry out on any parts of your homes interior that have been affected by the damp . If your plaster is stained but sound , you may be able to redecorate without replastering , but you should check that the plaster is dry ( or leave it to dry ) before doing so and check that the walls do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once you 've treated your rising damp , check that your plaster is sound , and if it is , check your walls for mould and salt deposits as you will need to treat these before redecorating <p> Salts build up on the wall as a result of the salts in the brick being drawn out of them by the damp and into the plaster , where they form fluffy white deposits . As long as the salts have n't structurally damaged the plaster too much you can just treat your walls for them using a salt neutraliser ( typically we use the salt neutraliser available from Property Repair Systems ) before redecorating . Just paint the salt neutraliser on and wait for it to dry before redecorating . <p> Apply a salt neutraliser to make sure that salts do n't  reappear on your walls <p> If the plaster is n't sound any more , strip off your plaster to 30cm above the highest damp point on the wall use the back of your hand or a damp meter to determine this . When you 've stripped your plaster off you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances you can either brush the wall down , apply your Anti-Mould cleaner or Salt Neutraliser and then replaster , use your salt neutraliser and anti-mould cleaner and fit a mesh membrane before replastering , or you can add a breathable , waterproof render to your wall before replastering . You also have different options for your salt neutraliser you can either paint it directly onto the wall , replaster using a plaster that contains salt neutraliser already or add your salt neutraliser to your plaster mix . Look for a neutraliser that you can apply in the way you want to and always follow the manufacturers instructions . You can find more information on how to fit a mesh membrane to your wall in our How to Install a Mesh Membrane DIY Project . <p> Fit a mesh membrane to your wall to ensure that salts do n't  reappear in your plaster in the future <p> To add the render , brush any residue off the walls , and fill any holes and cracks using 4:1 washed , sharp plastering sand and cement . If your walls are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhesive like BondAcryl concentrate to stick the render to the wall . Dampen the walls a little and apply your render at a half-inch thickness maximum your render should be 3:1 washed , sharp plastering sand and fresh Portland cement mixed with 1:40 Renderproof waterproofer ( Renderproof is available from PRS here ) and water . Make plenty of scratches in the damp render surface using a trowel . When this layer is solid without being dry , add a second layer in exactly the same way . You can add multiple layers until you have reached the thickness you want . While its damp add a skim coat of Board-Finish or Multi-Finish plaster do n't  add water or polish it . Wait a month to decorate with a thin layer of breathable ( not vinyl ) emulsion if desired . In about three months time you should be able to repaint or wallpaper the wall . <p> Use a waterproofing agent such as Renderproof to make a breathable waterproof render for your walls that you apply after treating your damp and before you replaster <p> If you need any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repair Systems on 01626 336180 .

Some work does not require planning permission ; however it must still comply with building regulations . <p> Sound can travel through the walls , ceilings , stairs and floors of a dwelling . So they need to be constructed in a way which resists the transmission of airborne sound waves and any impact sound . Impact sound would include walking across the floor in a block of flats , or climbing stairs in attached properties .

One person 's idea of noise nuisance may not be the same as another 's . So while Councils have a duty to help prevent noise nuisance it is important to try to find a non-confrontational way of resolving the situation before it escalates towards using official channels and legal action . <h> Causes of Complaint <p> Noisy Neighbours <p> Neighbours may play loud music , television , or computer games while remaining completely unaware of how sound travels . Ironically if you are a quiet neighbour they will have no idea how their own sound is travelling , because they never experience the transfer of sound . Talk to them and if necessary invite them round while their music is on next door ! <p> Barking Dogs <p> Dogs are a valuable deterrent to burglars , as well as being great companions , but where they are left on their own , or not properly controlled their incessant barking can be very disruptive for neighbours around where they live . <p> Burglar and Car Alarms <p> Who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going off in the middle of the night ? Obviously if they are doing their job and the instances are rare this is not really a problem you can do anything about , but if your alarm is faulty you should get it fixed . <p> Nightlife <p> Nightclubs and pubs should make reasonable attempts to make sure their clientele do not disturb the neighbours . This will also be reflected in the timings for music licences etc . If you find there are regular disturbances you should speak to the landlord to see what can be done . Private parties that are irregular and infrequent are just part of life , but if they are getting gout of hand , going on too long or are regular disturbances you can take action . Try negotiating with the neighbours first though , but leave it until the day after the event or it might get very heated . <p> Open Air Events <p> There are many music festivals and concerts in the summer months .

Typically noisy work is allowed Monday-Friday 8am-6pm and Saturdays 8am-1pm . For large civil contracts this is sometimes altered by consultation with local residents , and if there are a large proportion of shift workers in the area , these agreements may need to be altered . <p> DIY <p> DIY is basically building work carried out by amateurs . Just because you are Doing it Yourself it does not mean that the rules on noise pollution do not apply . Work should be planned to make sure noise is reduced during anti-social hours .

Learn about the advantages and disadvantages of the types of piling that are used for constructing domestic buildings and homes , particularly Replacement and Displacement Piles . Types of pile explained simply so you can find out what are replacement and displacement piles , when and why should they be used and the factors affecting the use of piles in general . <p> Piles are generally used to spread the load of a building through soft and/or unstable ground , to firmer ground further down . Piles are usually made of concrete , either precast or poured in-situ on site . <p> In domestic housing situations the concrete or steel piles are joined at the top with a reinforced concrete beam , commonly called a ring beam . The ring beam sits on top of the piles and allows the superstructure , I.E. Brickwork and/or Blockwork to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reinforced ring beam <p> Piled Foundations are used for either economic or structural reasons , when it is necessary to transfer the load to a deeper more stable area of ground . When the load can not be supported by shallow foundations then piles can be used . <p> They are also used to anchor structures that are likely to be lifted or pushed over , such as chimneys and other tall constructions . Piles are needed where the lateral force on the building needs to be anchored to stop the building falling over sideways . <h> The two Types of Pile Construction <p> Essentially there are two types of pile : <p> Replacement piles : These are piles which are put into holes dug or augured out of the earth . The concrete , or steel , simply replaces the earth , clay etc .... which has been excavated . <p> Displacement piles : These are precast or pre-formed piles which are driven into the ground by a huge piling hammer . These displace the earth they are driven through . <p> When choosing a piling system for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision on . <p> The load ( or weight ) of the building or structure to be supported <p> The Cost of piling versus other foundation types <p> The physical possibilities of getting very heavy piling equipment to the site without causing more disruption such as noise or further instability to a structure etc .... than necessary <p> The condition of the ground and surrounding strata <p> Piling is being used more often these days than in past years . This is largely because of the huge increases in cost of carting away the many tonnes of soil required for a normal strip or raft foundation . <p> The closer together piles are placed , the less the diameter of each pile needs to be and in some cases , especially in situations where a lot of subsidence has occurred , piles can be drilled through existing floor slabs to stop them sinking any further . This type of piling is called mini piling . <p> Micro piles , usually even smaller diameters , are used where access is very much restricted . Piles can also be used when underpinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other issues that have caused instability . <h> Understanding the Types of Pile <p> There are a number of different piles that are used in different circumstances . Which is used will depend of the ground conditions at all levels and the type of the structure to be supported . <p> Here are a number of the most common pile types explained so that you can understand the considerations involved in the selection in a particular type of pile : <p> End Bearing Pile <p> These are piles that transfer the load of the building through the soft , compressible strata or soil at the surface to the harder bedrock below it . With end bearing piles the stability of the foundations is achieved by creating a secure footing into the solid , uncompressible strata , which is usually the bedrock under the loose soil . <p> End bearing pile going through soft soil and embedding in harder soil <p> These are very common types of pile , and generally the most easily understood . <p> Friction Piles <p> Where is in not possible , either economically or physically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used ; a friction pile . <p> Friction pile going through increasingly stiffening soil <p> There are two forces at work here - As the pile is driven into deeper soil , the soil is compacted and offers great strength which offers some of the end bearing , load carrying capacity of the straight forward end bearing pile . <p> However , this alone is not enough . There is extra load bearing capacity derived from the friction of the pile in the soil that it is in contact with " much like a nail driven into a piece of wood that becomes more secure and held fast the further that it is driven in . <p> Settlement Reducing Piles <p> These are piles that are designed to offer stability against settlement and subsidence . <p> Settlement reducing piles supporting sagging foundation <p> They are generally used in conjunction with other foundation types , such as the raft foundation , to offer more stability . They reduce the sagging effect in the centre of foundations by reinforcing the soil below and creating leverage which counters the sagging movement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide stability to tall structures by anchoring them firmly into the ground . The pile will counter act the lateral forces that the building will experience from such forces as wind etc .... <h> Factors Affecting the Type of Piles Used <p> The main factors that determine which type of pile will be used is as follows : <p> Location of the Pile and the Structure it will Support <p> For structures that will be over water ( such as jetties , piers , and wharfs ) driven displacement piles are the best solution . When it comes to using them on land there are other considerations to take in to account . <p> Displacement piles are generally the most cost effective but can not always be used as driving them in will cause vibrations that will affect surrounding buildings . In these situations bored replacement piles are typically used . <p> For large structures , where large diameter piles are going to be needed , it is often cheaper to bore the piles into place . <p> When piles are required for existing structures then jack piles are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing foundations and then adding sections of the pile under the building that are then pushed down into place using powerful jacks that drive each section into the ground . <p> Inserting piles below a foundation using a powerful jack <p> Cost of Adding Piles <p> Cost is always an important consideration in any building project and especially so when you are involved with piling .

In this project we take a look at injected cavity wall insulation , also known as pumped cavity wall insulation . We show you how it is injected into the cavity wall space of your property and what potential savings this will give you on your heating bills . Also learn about how to identify if your property has a cavity space by the way in which the bricks have been laid and also what problems can occur if the insulation is injected incorrectly such as bridged cavities and the resulting damp issues on internal walls . <p> Cavity walls were first built in the UK in late 1920s . Before then , all external walls were solidly built in brickwork or stonework or a combination of both . The width of the cavity , which is bridged by wall ties between the inner and outer leaves , is 50mm ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties and replacing them in our Wall Ties project . The outer leaf of the wall is usually 112mm facing brick and the inner leaf is 100mm block-work . <p> Insulation and wall ties in a cavity wall - Image courtesy of ecohomecentre.co.uk <p> The cavity itself can provide both sound and heat insulation but in recent years the efficiency of cavity wall insulation has been increased by the use of other materials . A side benefit of this is that the inside of the house will require less heating so reducing the amount of carbon emissions by using less electricity or gas . <h> Main Types of Cavity Wall Insulation <p> Essentially , there are two different types of cavity wall insulation and they are as follows : <p> Foam Cavity Wall Insulation : Very similar to expanding builders foam in nature , this form of insulation is again pumped into a cavity via a pressurised pumping system but unlike the below method the holes required to pump into the cavity can be much smaller making it a much better solution for properties constructed from engineered bricks as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those with smaller and narrower cavities such as new builds ( with existing sheet insulation ) and stone built properties that may have random cavities <p> Polystyrene Bead Cavity Insulation : Small beads commonly known as EPS beads ( expanded polystyrene beads ) , they are pumped into the drilled holes in your outer cavity wall together with a mix of adhesive . When the beads settle down the adhesive cures and bonds them together creating an insulated barrier within your cavity . The installation of this type of insulation must be carried out in line with BBA ( British Board of Agrement ) guidelines <p> As with any form of cavity insulation it is vitally important that it is done properly as if it 's not it can lead to a whole host of issues including damp issues which as I 'm sure you can imagine , trying to remove it once it 's in there is a nigh on impossible task . <h> Does Your Home have Cavities in the External Walls ? <p> Different materials are used to insulate the cavity depending upon whether the house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were changed in 1982 and now all cavity walls built since then have been insulated . Only houses built between say 1930 and 1982 may have cavities that are not insulated now . <p> The insulation can be installed quite easily by drilling holes through the external outer leaf of the wall and pumping mineral glass/wool fibre , foam or polystyrene beads or similar into the cavity . <p> The holes are drilled at regular intervals in the wall and are patched up in matching mortar afterwards . A good point to note here is that the mortar or substance used to patch the holes up afterwards will need to be waterproof in nature or sealed . <p> By drilling a hole in your outer cavity wall you are effectively compromising its repellent qualities so whatever is used to fill the holes needs to be of the same standard . If not then water and moisture may be allowed to pass in and on to your inner cavity wall causing damp problems . <p> The size of the house determines how long the process takes but a standard three-bedroom detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finding out whether an existing wall is a solid or a cavity wall can be determined quickly . In a cavity wall , the external face will consist entirely of bricks where the long face of the bricks are on view " except where an ornamental feature has been created . This is known as Stretch Bond . <p> If the " end of a brick " appears in the bonding pattern , the wall is a solid one as in English or Flemish bonds . For more information about bonds and how bricks are laid look at our project on laying bricks and blocks . In new houses glass wool or rock wool panels are inserted as the external wall is being built . <p> How to tell if your wall has a cavity or has used the Flemish Bond <p> How to tell if your house is constructed using a stretcher bond <h> The Potential Saving for Filling a Cavity Wall <p> It is claimed that about 30% saving in heat costs can be achieved by insulating the cavities in walls producing savings of over -100 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually available from the installer . <p> Government grants are also available for this type of insulation work . The grants that are available will vary from time to time and depending on where you live . A great place to start to see what you are eligible for is to look on the Energy Saving Trust website . <h> How is Cavity Wall Insulation Injected <p> The principle of injecting insulation into your cavity wall is very simple but in practice is it quite hard to achieve cost effectively . This is why it is often better left to the professionals who will know how to get the right amounts of insulation into the cavity and overcome problems such debris in the cavity and cavity wall extraction ( Cavity wall extraction is when material such as old , ineffective insulation needs to be removed ) . <p> Once an assessment has been completed and your exterior walls have been confirmed as suitable for having insulation injected into the cavities , then the process can begin . <p> We recommend that you make sure that you complete the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme before you start , but any professional installation company will be able to help you with this . <p> The first step is to drill into the cavity . This is done at appropriate places across the wall so that the insulation that is injected will fill the whole cavity . <p> Drilling into the cavity of a cavity wall - Image courtesy of cavitech-uk.com ) <p> Calculations about the amount of insulation that will be needed should be done . This is important because if too much or too little insulation is injected into the cavity then the performance of the insulation can be affected . Also it will not be cost effective to use more insulation than you need to . <p> The insulation is injected into numerous holes in the wall , which are then sealed up once enough insulation is in the cavity . <p> Filled holes that were used to inject cavity wall insulation - Image courtesy of wikipedia.org <h> Cavity Wall Problems and Damp <p> There has been a lot of information about cavity wall insulation in the press over the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already had their cavities filled . <p> On the whole it is a solution that offers a very quick payback , typically within a couple of years and will improve the comfort of your home significantly . <p> There have been some highly publicised problems with retrospective cavity wall insulation which have tended to make people wary about having their walls filled . On the whole the majority of homes with cavity walls should be suitable ; however there are certain situations when a home is not . Here are a few of the main reasons for damp entering the cavity which will make them unsuitable for insulation : <p> Walls are exposed to driven rain or are unsheltered : When the wind drives rain on to the side of a house the rain is likely to penetrate the wall and enter the cavity . The rain might hit the walls of a house periodically , but if the home is exposed and unprotected then this will happen frequently . The more frequently it occurs the more likely it is that it will cause the cavity to be damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is damaged or weak : It is likely that any moisture will be able to penetrate into the cavity quicker if the wall has been damaged or the pointing is old and degraded . Even when walls are not exposed to driving rain , they will get some water on them , and if the wall is not in a good condition this will seep through into the cavity eventually and wet the insulation <h> Why is Damp in a Cavity a Problem ? <p> If moisture gets into the cavity it can wet the insulation and cause what is known as a cold bridge . This is where heat is conducted across the cavity as the insulation has become ineffective . This makes the internal wall cold and prone to condensation and damp . This can occur if there is debris inside the cavity , particularly if it conducts heat well , as moisture in wet insulation does . <h> Moisture in the cavity is a problem because it can <p> Directly cause damp by seeping through the cavity into the habitable area of your home <p> Cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on internal walls as moisture condenses from the warm air inside your home <p> Reduced the effectiveness of the insulation in the cavity considerably through the cold bridging effect and heat is conducted out of your home making it colder <p> As mentioned , if you are considering getting injected cavity wall insulation , just make sure that you do your research first . Although this could technically be a DIY job we do not in any way recommend it . <p> To get the insulation into the cavity correctly is quite a skilled job and should only be done by someone with the correct equipment and the required knowledge to ensure that it is done properly and that the cavity itself is filled evenly with no gaps . <p> As stated at the top of this project , the consequences of a botched job can be disastrous and can result in damp damage to internal decorative surfaces , damaged plaster , black spot and fungal mould growth and even worse case damage to structural timbers and corrosion of wall ties . <p> To these ends make sure you select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and its cavities and they also chose to use a material that will not bridge the cavity and transfer moisture onto your internal walls . If possible , also go for an installer that offers an insurance backed guarantee on their work and the materials they use . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

This project explains the conditions that can cause black mould on wall and ceilings in bathrooms , showers and kitchens to grow and what can be done to try and stop , in mnay cases , the condensation that causes it . Also find out about methods of black mould treatment and removal and also what you can do to prevent it from appearing again . Get rid of your black mould problem once and for all . <h> Bathroom Mould <p> The growth of black mould growth on bathroom ceilings and walls is a sign of condensation , and in bathrooms there is generally plenty of that ! The warm , air laden with moisture comes into contact with a cold surface and that cools the air so that it can no longer hold the moisture which then condenses on that surface . This is why condensation is typically found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice on condensation and how to prevent it here . <p> If there is enough condensation and especially if the environment is slightly warm such as on a bathroom ceiling or wall then black mould can grow . <p> Bathroom ceilings covered in mould have long been a source of concern for our users . There are three ways to stop the condensation and therefore the likelihood of mould growth : <p> Reduce the moisture that is created and circulates in the air <p> Ventilate to remove the moist air before the moisture can condense and cause problems <p> Heat and insulate your home so that there are less cold surfaces and the air is kept warm enough to hold the moisture so reducing the amount of condensation <p> There is no avoiding the moist air in a bathroom so it is virtually impossible to reduce the moisture content in the air . Ventilation can be effective and an efficient extractor fan will help reduce condensation enormously and therefore the likelihood of mould growth . Other ventilation such as opening a window may not be practical especially in winter when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insulation may be expensive and potentially unaffordable in the circumstances , but they are an option . <p> This means that condensation and black mould are most often found in bathrooms , particularly those that are poorly heated and ventilated and especially when insulation properties are poor making the ceiling a particularly cold surface . When this is the case and mould has started to grow it is very difficult to stop it . <h> How to Stop Mould in Your Bathroom <p> If you can not cure the problem by reducing the levels of condensation either by ventilating or using the heating , there is another solution . This is to kill the mould and treat your walls to prevent it 's future growth , despite the high levels of condensation . <p> There are 3 relatively simple steps : <p> Paint your walls with a mould killer or steriliser to kill off any mould present on the walls and then clean off ( following the instruction on the product that you choose ) <p> Paint on a barrier solution <p> Once the barrier solution has dried you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additive with any emulsion you choose to stop the mould coming back <p> For a relatively small cost and effort it is possible to stop mould growing on your ceilings . <p> Mould Eradication Kits <p> There are quite a number of products now available on the market that will allow you to eradicate the mould completely . With good fungicidal properties a room of up to 40 square metres can be protected by most available mould eradication kits . A large bathroom measures 4m x 5m which is only 20 square metres . <p> In most cases the kit will contain all the products that you require to remove and then ensure the black mould does not return . <p> Application will follow the same process that we have described above ; sterilizing the ceiling first , then providing a fungicidal barrier over which you can re-decorate your bathroom . Please follow the instructions and usage directions that will be provided with all products and will tell you exactly how the product should be applied . <h> Black Mould on Bathroom Ceilings <p> Understanding what mould is will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a type of fungus . Threads , like very dense cobwebs , grow together on a given surface and some of them are fertile enough to produce spores . Spores are carried by moving things including air and especially warm air , which is always found in a bathroom . <p> The warm air travels upwards depositing spores on the ceiling . The spores settle and grow to become mould . The conditions mould likes best are when temperatures are above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity is above 70% and have a guess where those conditions are found ? ! <p> This is important because other than the unsightly stains that the mould causes the spores can also cause respiratory problems . This is why you should never try and scrape away the mould ; this will release the spores into the air in the form of a fine dust which can cause breathing difficulties especially if you are prone to respiratory problems . <p> Black mould that is found in habitable rooms , especially bedrooms , in a much more serious condition , due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The treatment is the same , but much more urgent . Thankfully this is less common <p> The other thing to understand is that this is a fungus and like many other fungi , black mould will cause a nasty odour ; this is a distinctive musky smell . <h> How to Keep Black Mould in Check <p> It is possible to keep black mould in check relatively cheaply and easily . There are a number of solutions that will kill mould , although you may have to keep doing this on a regular basis to prevent it returning : <p> Good old fashion bleach : Mix 4 parts water to one part bleach and apply liberally to the affected area . The bleach will kill the mould but be careful what surfaces that you apply the bleach to as this can damage paint . If you are unsure test it on a small unseen area first <p> Mould and mildew products : These are generally very efficient at removing the mould stains and killing the mould . They are readily available and will vary in price and effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not be bleach based so should not affect the paint work ( always read the instructions ) . These are less effective at removing the mould stains , but are quick and easy to apply so are excellent to ensure that the mould does not return by giving a precautionary spray periodically <p> In summary , if you can stop the condensation you will stop the mould . This is very often hard to achieve and this is where you have to resort to treating the mould itself . There are a range of solutions that you can employ so you do n't  have to have an unsightly bathroom ceiling covered in mould . Other than the aesthetic benefits , there are definitely health benefits from reducing the spores by removing mould from bathroom ceilings . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

We are often asked for condensation solutions and obviously if you have a condensation problem in your home you want to know how to avoid it , and how to treat the damage that is caused by condensation on walls , windows , curtains and even clothes . <p> If at any point you feel that additional expert advice is required , we work closely with a company called Property Repair Systems and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our users . Just give them a call on 01626 336180 . <h> What is Condensation and How Does it Form ? <p> However , before we explain all that , we first want to define condensation . So what is condensation and what causes condensation ? Basically it is when water , which is already in the air , settles on a colder surface and makes it damp or wet . Over time this moisture can lead to damage by peeling paint off windows , and walls . This window in Bath , Somerset was in a house we were called to a few years ago , it was fitted with metal windows which are notorious for condensation , and you can see what happened to the paintwork ! <p> Condensation on windows causes flaking paint around window frames and windowsills . Flaking paint is a common symptom of condensation <p> The damp conditions also encourage the growth of mould spores which thrive in these moist places . This often leads to black sooty mould on windows , but you might also notice mould on walls , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up over time . <p> All air contains water vapour , but the amount of water air can hold is determined by the temperature of that air . This ratio is called the relative humidity . Hot air is able to carry much more moisture than cold air , so as the temperature of air rises it is able to hold a greater volume of water . The water comes from everyday activities including , bathing , cooking and washing . Even our breathing causes condensation , and this is why car windows steam up when you sit with the windows closed and the fan off . <p> Once the air is saturated with water vapour ( at any given temperature ) it will deposit beads of water ( condensation ) onto any surface that is cold enough . The temperature of the surface at which this moisture will form is called the dew point . ( For an example , take a cold glass bottle out of the fridge , and it will soon become wet . When the weather is hot the condensation can literally run off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happening is on bathroom pipes we look at how to avoid this in more detail further on in this project under Best advice for Fixing Condensation problems . This pipe ( pictured below ) is typical of many bathrooms in the UK . The cold mains-water comes into a warm bathroom where the water vapour in the steamy room condenses on the pipe , often leaving a puddle of water below it . This can be so bad that you might think you have a water leak from the pipe . <p> Condensation forms on cold pipe work in kitchens and bathrooms leading to flaking and discoloured paint <p> You can see this effect outside too . Where the dew point is close to the ground , to a small layer of damp air , dew , or frost will be formed . Where a larger amount of air is involved , mist or fog will arise . If this happens to air that is rising in the atmosphere , and therefore expanding , then clouds will form . <p> If this happens in the home .... It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed in the order they are most likely to occur . In other words , in the places most at risk of condensation forming and the way the condensation affects that area . <p> Black mould on carpets can be a symptom of condensation but is more often a sign of penetrating damp especially if you do n't  have any of the symptoms above <h> Diagnosing Condensation <p> Is it rising damp or condensation ? Let us look at the rising damp myth , which is that all damp at low level must be rising damp . Let us be clear here , it is rarely rising damp , it is usually condensation although it can also be penetrating damp where water is getting in through damaged or shoddily built areas such as through a roof leak , cracked render , failed wall ties , damaged brickwork or badly fitted window frames . Rising damp may occur in certain circumstances but it is very rare in modern housing . <p> Rising Damp or Condensation Busting the Rising Damp Myth <p> Question - " I have wet walls at low level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rising damp " <p> Answer - Heat rises so the lower part of the wall is where the surface is cooler and more likely to suffer from condensation ; also water always tries to travel down to the lowest point , so if the condensation is running off the walls it stands to reason the lower part of the wall is most affected <p> Question - " I have black mould on my external walls and not on the internal walls in the same room , so it must becoming in from outside " <p> Answer - The interior surface of external walls tends to be the coolest surface in the room , so they naturally attract condensation . <p> Question - " I have black mould growing at the bottom of my walls it must be rising damp coming in from underneath the floor " <p> Answer - See the answers above . If you live in a house without a damp proof course , or if you think your damp proof cause is damaged or compromised , then it could be rising damp and you can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live in a modern house or a flat above the ground floor it is most unlikely to be rising damp and you should keep reading to find out how to be sure you have condensation not rising damp or a leak . <p> Question - " My walls are wet , not damp or mouldy , so it ca n't possibly be just condensation " <p> Most damp walls in modern housing are caused by condensation . You can usually tell by the pattern of the damp and damage , but do not be fooled by the amount of water involved . Some people think they must have a leak because their walls are so wet , but condensation can release a huge amount of water , so that is not a good gauge of whether the problem is condensation or water ingress . <p> As discussed above black mould growth is the most common effect of condensation , but mould can appear in many other colours on carpets , clothing and wood . <p> This picture ( below ) shows the effects of condensation in the corner of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the black mould climbs and concentrates on the coldest part of the wall an outside corner . If this was rising damp it would most likely form at the same level on the whole external wall . <p> Condensation will often settle on external walls causing mould on walls in this classic pattern , which shows where the walls are coldest <p> One other causes of damp walls you could consider is where a wall tie in a cavity wall has become compromised and is allowing water to travel along the tie from the external wall to the internal wall . We explain damp being caused by wall ties more thoroughly in our Damp in Cavity Walls DIY and information project . <p> If you are in any doubt how your walls are getting wet then you could perform a simple test . Clean and dry the area and then tape a square of aluminium foil over a test patch , about 30cm ( 1 foot ) square should do it , and use Gaffer tape not Sellotape . Leave in place for a day or two . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside you may have a leak , if it is wet on the external surface then it is likely to be condensation . <p> If you want something a bit more scientific then you can buy Fugenex Damp Protect indicators where you feel that you might have a problem with damp , and you are not sure whether it is condensation or a leak . <h> Preventing Condensation <p> Now we have defined condensation , you know what the problem is , and what the symptoms are , the next thing you want to know is how to prevent condensation . Put simply ventilation is the cure . <p> How do I Stop Condensation ? <p> As soon as warm air , containing vapour , hits a cooler surface , it will condense . This is most obvious on windows , mirrors and wall tiles , but condensation on walls and ceilings is also happening a lot of the time , quite unnoticed . <p> If we insulate our homes and warm the house thoroughly , then this should not happen I hear you cry ..... But it will ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation . The warm air , containing the water vapour , will rise and circulate around the room until it finds a cooler surface , unless we let that air out and some cooler air in . <p> In order to ensure that there is good ventilation in your home , a change of air is recommended in all rooms of the house once a day , at the very least . <p> Improved ventilation can help prevent condensation forming and aid in resolving problems like wet internal walls and black mould issues . However for a total solution there are some products and equipment that you can use to solve the problem . <p> In these simple steps below we tell you all you need to know about preventing and treating condensation . <h> Condensation Problems and Solutions <p> There are plenty of DIY condensation solutions that you can use in your home . They do not need to be expensive , and treatment will depend on the problems you are experiencing . Preventing condensation forming in the first place is the easiest solution , but in this section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As previously mentioned condensation in our homes is most obvious on mirrors , single glazed windows and wall tiles , but it may also happen on walls and ceilings , particularly in areas of high humidity such as kitchens , utility rooms and bathrooms . <p> Measure Relative Humidity <p> The amount of water vapour in the area is the key to condensation forming . The moisture content of the air is known as Relative Humidity or RH . In order to avoid condensation we need to keep the moisture content of the air between around 55-65% Relative Humidity . <p> If we insulate and warm our house thoroughly , you might think that condensation will be avoided , but unless we keep the moisture content of the air below level then condensation will form on the coldest surface . You can measure the moisture in the air using a Hygrometer , otherwise known as a Home Humidity Monitor pictured below . These are available online from Property Repair Systems . <p> Hygrometer or Home Humidity Monitor <p> These Home Humidity monitor models have a memory feature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether your relative humidity level is going up or down . This will also help you gauge which household activities are causing the most condensation . <p> Use a Dehumidifier to Remove Moisture from the Air <p> To control the Relative Humidity we need to balance heating with ventilation , or use a dehumidifier to extract moisture from the air . Use a Hygrometer to show you the actual Relative Humidity level in the room . If you are not able to measure the RH it makes getting the right balance between heating and ventilation difficult to achieve . <p> A dehumidifier is an electrical mechanical device which removes moisture from the air using the same system of condensation that causes all those problems ! A fan sucks air into the machine and passes the moist warmed air from the room over a cooled plate , the moisture in the air then condenses on the plate and runs into a tank within the machine . The tank in the dehumidifier will need to be emptied periodically ( depending on the amount of moisture in the room ) but it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safely left to run if you can not be in while it dries the area . <p> A dehumidifier will quickly dry out a damp room and can be wheeled into each area of the house ( although care should be taken using electrical equipment in kitchens and bathrooms ) <p> You need to close windows and vents when you are running your dehumidifier , otherwise you will be trying to dehumidify the world . <p> Using a dehumidifier is an efficient way of removing moisture from the room if you are suffering severe condensation problems . Most Dehumidifiers give off some heat ( like a fried ) however we have known them to lower the room temperature , so it is not necessarily any better than opening vents and windows to ventilate the room in terms of keeping warm in your home . <p> Dehumidifiers can also be quite expensive to run , so they are really only a temporary measure . You do n't  have to buy one as they can easily be hired from your local hire centre , and are useful to employ when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Once the room is thoroughly dried out you can then just use ventilation to keep condensation at bay . <p> The vents come in two halves , one for the inside and one for the outside of the window . Several holes are drilled through the top of the widow head to allow air passage into and out of the room . <p> There are integral flaps fitted so the vents can be closed in really cold weather , and insect grills keep all the creepy crawlies on the outside ! We fitted them to our old house in Frome , Somerset , which had timber single-glazed windows which were prone to condensation ( see below ) . <p> Trickle vents come in two halves and fit either side of the window allowing ventilation without opening a window to solve window condensation <p> Tips To Stop Condensation <p> Effective condensation control is all about lifestyle , once you get the situation under control you will start to automatically put into place the measures that will stop condensation forming . <p> Here is our quick guide to condensation prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , especially external walls which are often the coldest in a room . Keeping furniture a little further away from the walls means the air has a free flow around the room . <p> Do not fill cupboards to bursting point , again , allow the air to flow . <p> Make sure that your loft insulation is not blocking the ventilation provided by the gap between the facia boards and the house wall . In modern houses there are often purpose-made ventilation grilles and vents in the loft , and you should keep these clear of blockages . <p> Install cavity wall insulation to help eliminate cold spots on the internal walls . You must first ensure this complies with building regulations for your home . <p> Have central heating or underfloor heating fitted if possible . <p> Have heating thermostatically controlled wherever possible . <p> Ventilate tumble driers externally , or have a self-condensing model <p> Install extractor fans in the kitchen and bathroom . The best models are available with a humidistat control , which means they are automatically triggered to operate when the humidity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . <p> If you already have trickle vents make sure you open them for the majority of the day to allow a change of air and improve ventilation in the home . <h> Best Advice For Fixing Condensation Problems <p> Effects of Condensation <p> Condensation is an underestimated cause of damage to our homes . When people find they have a damp room with black mould , they usually assume it is a leak or rising damp that is causing the problem . However condensation can cause significant damage to paintwork and wallpaper , and flaking plasterwork . So once you have the relative humidity under control you will need to repair the damage once you have sorted out your underlying condensation problems . <p> Treating Black Mould <p> The main symptom of condensation is black mould on walls and ceilings . This can show up as small black spots or in bad cases can make the whole area black and ' sooty ' or you could get mould which is white and fluffy which looks a bit like the walls have tonsillitis ! This is unsightly and damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your health too . People who are sensitive to irritation , such as asthmatics , can be adversely affected by the airborne spores , so removing the mould is a must ! <p> Black mould or mildew will thrive in the moist conditions created by condensation and as well as damaging your paint and wallpaper it can be harmful to your health ( pictures courtesy of Property Repair systems ) <p> Property Repair Systems recommend that if your walls and paintwork have been damaged by black mould you should first thoroughly clean and treat the area , and then redecorate with anti-condensation paint . We look into how to do this in more detail in our guide How to Treat Black Mould below . <p> You need to use a solution of anti mould cleaner to wash the affected area to kill the spores and help to prevent the mould regrowing . <p> This should be done before you attempt to redecorate , as simply washing off the mould with detergent and then redecorating will not kill the spores and the mould is likely to regrow , even through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you have dealt with the underlying problem of condensation . <p> Firstly , spray the effected area with ACS Anti-mould killer spray cleaner and leave for the manufacturers recommended time so that the solution kills the mould and any remaining spores <p> Thoroughly clean the area , preferably with sugar soap ( mixed with water to the manufacturers specifications ) or detergent with water to remove any grease . Wear Rubber gloves and a breathing mask . <p> Rinse to ensure that the area is grease-free . <p> If this has n't  removed all the flaking material then rub the area down with fine sandpaper so that you have a smooth sound surface . <p> If you have sanded the area , rub down with a dampened lint-free cloth to remove all the dust . <p> Using the ACS Scrub out Mould Growth solution , treat the area fully making sure that you work the solution into any nooks and crannies with the brush attachment provided . Allow it to dry without washing off <p> Next , prepare your top coat paint . Add the paint treatment supplied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then mix it in thoroughly to ensure that you get an even coverage across your surface <p> ACS Mould Killer concentrate and cleaning bottles with spray head and with scrubbing head <p> Once that dries you are ready to paint your top coat ( using the paint mixed with the concentrate you previously created ) . To help to avoid black mould reforming on your newly redecorated walls and woodwork , use anti-condensation paint . This is special paint which is hygroscopic , allowing the paint to breathe and makes it ideal for kitchens , bathrooms and shower rooms . Alternatively you can incorporate anti-mould additive to your choice of regular paint for a similar effect . <p> If you are replacing damaged wallpaper it is best to strip off the old wallpaper and treat the walls as above , and then to simply repaint the walls rather than replacing with wallpaper , because mould loves to grow on damp wallpaper lining . If you feel you must hang wallpaper r again then use an anti-condensation wallpaper and anti-fungal ( anti-mould ) wallpaper paste . <p> Treating Efflorescence <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skim plaster coat , masonry or stone in your walls . This can cause efflorescence or salting , which shows up as a fluffy or crystalline coating on the surface of the wall . <p> If this has happened to your walls you should sand off the salts and then paint on salt neutraliser to neutralise the salts before redecoration , so that they do not simply reoccur and damage all your hard work . There are many types of salt neutraliser available but we tend to use Property Repair Systems Salt Neutraliser . <p> Salt neutraliser to treat efflorescence on internal walls <p> If you think the salting might be caused by penetrating damp then you need to find out for sure what is causing the damp . You can visit our Diagnosing Damp Project or you can consult a structural engineer . <p> If the problem is diagnosed as penetrating damp then you will need to look at damp proofing before you try to treat symptoms such as efflorescence and mould . <h> Decorating after Condensation Treatment <p> Once you have got rid of your condensation problem ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have dealt with all that horrible black mould then you are ready to pick out paint colours and start redecorating . <p> Anti-Mould Emulsion You can purchase low odour anti-mould coating , from Property Repair Systems . This paint combines modern paint technology to make it breathable , plus highly advanced and proven biocides . The paint is guaranteed to protect the surface against unsightly and unhygienic black mould even when there is persistent condensation . The anti-mould biocide is combined throughout the paint film and it is formulated for toughness , elasticity , water resistance and durability . <p> Anti-Condensation Coating For areas which are not subject to abrasion and washing such as ceilings , the underside of roofing sheets , steel building frames , pipework and ducting , and the inside of cupboards , you can use Lecros Anti-Condensation Coating . This Anti-condensation Coating inhibits condensation by absorbing moisture and improving insulation . It also contains a biocide to protect the paint in the can against mould growth . <p> Anti-Condensation Wallpaper These are specially formulated wallpapers that inhibit mould growth and allow walls to breathe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually tough and hardwearing . They are as easy to hang as normal wallpaper so they are a DIY solution to condensation . <p> There are also foil wallpapers which can be hung on the wall first before papering over with normal paper , but these are not really a condensation solution . They are more suited to areas with no damp proofing or penetrating low level damp such as basements . <p> Condensation has caused the wallpaper to peel off this wall , and mildew is growing on the paper causing discolouration <h> Practical Tips to Stop Condensation <p> Hopefully in this project we have provided you with a load of DIY condensation solutions which will help you deal with condensation , but because it is so long we thought we would give you a quick round-up . <p> 10 Step Guide to Stop Condensation <p> Ventilate your house change the air once a day . Open a window , or fit trickle vents . Where you have trickle vents fitted make sure you leave them open . <p> Fit a fan , and use it make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showering , use your kitchen extractor fan when you are cooking . <p> Do n't  dry washing indoors - if you have a tumble dryer make sure it is properly vented or buy a self condensing model . <p> Use a Dehumidifier to quickly dry out an area that is very wet . <p> Use a low cost digital Hygrometer to help you keep your humidity between 55-65% this is the best environment for comfortable living . Do n't  forget you can use memory setting to monitor levels of relative humidity in your building throughout the day . <p> Cold spots are building defects and may indicate failing wall ties , so use an infra red Thermometer to find any cold spots , as well as badly insulated and damp areas . <p> Test walls and floors with a Damp Meter to make sure that you do n't  have water ingress or leaks . <p> If you have wet walls and want to be sure you have condensation use Condensation Test Strips in affected areas . They will change colour if condensation occurs , ruling out some other types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subject to mould growth , with Anti-Mould Cleaner prior to redecoration . <p> Incorporate Anti Mould Concentrated Additive to all paints that you use ( unless you are using Anti-Mould Paints ) . <p> Again , if you need any additional advice or assistance please give the experts over at Property Repair Systems a call on 01626 336180. 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Learn how to prepare the exterior walls , choose the right paint and then complete the decoration of your home . We make some suggestions about the equipment you will need for painting the outside of a house . Painting outside walls is an easy DIY job if you are well prepared and know what you are doing . <p> A fresh coat of paint can really improve the exterior of your property , brightening it up and making it look much tidier . <h> Choosing the Right Paint for Exterior Walls <p> You need to use specialist exterior masonry paint , which is available in a range of colours . If your property is attached to another , it 's worth discussing colour with your neighbour " depending on how the buildings are joined , if they are different colours it can look a bit strange . <p> White and cream are the most common colours to use , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white can be very unforgiving " not only will it show every speck of dirt , but it can be blinding in bright sunlight . <p> Painting the exterior of a house <p> Try to buy enough paint at the start " check the square metre coverage on the container . New render will soak up a lot more paint though so allow for this if necessary . <p> If you live in a listed building , or if your property is in a Conservation Area , you may need to get permission to alter the exterior , so make sure you check this before you start . <h> Preparation for Painting Outside Walls <p> As with most painting jobs , the preparation is the most important part of the job " if a surface is not adequately prepared then the paint will not adhere and you will end up having to start again from scratch . Walls must be clean and dry before you start painting . <p> If there is any mould on the walls , use a wire brush to scrub it off with a bleach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust , dirt and cobwebs . <p> If the walls have been painted previously , remove any flaking paint with a pressure washer or wire brush . Use exterior filler to repair any cracks , and move any climbing plants and trellises out of the way as much as possible . Be sure to let the surface dry completely before you start painting . <p> If the surface is flaky or powdery , use a stabilising primer ( for exterior masonry ) first . <p> Make sure you have a nice , dry day and as much time as possible " this is not a job that can be rushed . Make sure the area around the house is clear of pots and anything else that might get in the way . If you have water butts , make sure you can reach behind them or empty and move them . <p> Mask window and door frames , and any other areas that you need to avoid getting paint on , such as faschia board " see our Masking Up project for help with this . If your house faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and signs up so that people will avoid the wet paint and ladders . <h> Equipment for Painting Exterior Walls <p> If you have space for it , a scaffold tower will make life much easier and is a lot safer than using a ladder " contact your local tool hire company . If your house is very tall you may even need full scaffolding ; if this is the case it may be worth getting a quote from a professional decorator . If you are going to be using a ladder , make sure you read our Ladder Safety project before you start . <p> A roller is the quickest tool to use for coating large areas , but if the surface is rough then a wide brush may be easier . Long extension handles are available for rollers which will make the job much easier . <p> You 'll need a small brush for getting into hard-to-reach areas such as behind down-pipes . A paint canister is very helpful if you are up a ladder , as exterior paint containers tend to be very large and unwieldy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old clothes or a coverall as you are bound to get splashed with paint , no matter how careful you are . <h> Get Painting Your House Walls <p> After all that preparation , at last it 's time for the easy and fun part ! Always start at the top and work your way down " this way you can be sure to catch any drips and runs . <p> Cut-in around the edges with a small brush first , then get to work with your roller or large brush . Try to follow the sun around the building , giving it a head-start to dry off the walls , and make sure you have enough time to complete a wall in one go otherwise you may see a visible line where you stopped then started again . <p> Work your way across the wall in metre-square sections , making sure you do n't over-reach . Ensure you load your roller or brush enough to give a good thick coat of paint , but not so much that it drips and runs . <p> If you are using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with specks of paint ! <p> When it comes to painting behind downpipes , wrap an old newspaper around the pipe so that you do n't get paint on it <p> Most exterior paints require at least two coats , but check the manufacturer 's instructions regarding second coat and drying time . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624597 @1624597/ <p> Summary : A DIY guide to Artex Removal from DIY Doctor . How to remove Artex from ceilings or walls quickly , safely and with little mess . We tell you about removing Artex with a steamer or using Eco-Friendly Eco Solutions products to make stripping Artex easy and safe . We also give advice on Asbestos in Artex , and about plastering over Artex if you do n't want to remove it . <h> Removing Artex With a Steamer <p> Artex is a waterbased covering , usually used to decorate ceilings , and generally brought to a textured finish with the use of a brush or comb . Some older artex may contain asbestos and it is extremely unwise to sand down or scrape without seeking the advice of an asbestos specialist as this can potentially damage your health . Contact your local council for help with this . <p> Once confirmed that the artex is 100% safe and can be removed safely with no risk there are several ways this can be done . Firstly it can be " steamed " off using a wallpaper steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow process . It can not be done at speed or with the steam plate left in one area too longif it is , there is a possibility of damaging the ceiling or wall behind it and also the risk that the artex will liquify and run everywhere . <p> If done carefully and with some care steaming will enable you to soak and strip without damaging either yourself or the surface you are working on . Place the steamer plate on the surface for several seconds at a time , testing very frequently with a hand held scraper to monitor how soft it is getting and then scraping off once soft enough to do so . <h> Removing Artex using Eco Solutions XTex <p> One of the quickest and easiest ways that we have found to remove artex is with this amazing product . Simply paint over the artex , on a horizontal or vertical surface , and scrape off when softened . <p> Xtex is a British products that has been design and is made here in the United Kingdom . <p> XTex is great for removing textured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago . It is a safe products as it does n't  create dust from asbestos which can be harmful . It is made by Eco Solutions using advanced " science not solvents " approach it is water based product . <p> If it simply a textures coating you 're trying to remove it will only take 1530 minutes . For coatings that have been painted over with several layers of paint you might have to leave around an hour . If there are numerous layers of coatings and paint then it may take a little longer , possibly overnight . <p> If you would like to purchase X-Tex then please check it out in our very own store : <h> Plastering Over Artex <p> Artex can also be plastered over ( See our project on skim plastering ) Firstly make absolutely sure that there are no flaking or loose sections of the artex , or indeed ceiling/wall . Then remove all obviously " high spots " of artex , where the stipples hang down . You can do this using a hand scraper or wall scraper and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand it down and get it as flat as possible as this will further aid in the final finish and also the ease in which it can be plastered over . Again , before you do this , please , please ensure that the artex you are working on does not contain any asbestos . If you are unsure , get it checked out before you start ! ! <p> The wall or ceiling can then be painted with a coat of PVA adhesive , which can be bought in gallon containers from the builder 's merchants or larger DIY stores . <p> Dilute the PVA at 1 to 1 with water and stir well . Paint this on the ceiling/wall with a large emulsion brush . This can be left to dry , which will only take about an hour . Make sure you have covered the entire surface . Untouched areas will produce plastered areas that will be hard almost as soon as the plaster touches them ! <p> We suggest two coats of this pva solution will give an excellent seal to the ceiling . Artex is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly . The pva will not only help the adhesion of the plaster , but it will dramatically slow down the rate of moisture absorption , giving you more time to " work " the surface . <p> It is a good idea to wear an old pair of rubber gloves when dealing with plaster . It is not good for your skin ! Place dust sheets everywhere and be careful where you stand . If wet plaster gets on your shoes , before you know it the house is covered . If you are attempting a ceiling try and get hold of a couple of milk crates , they are just the right height , and very stable when upturned . <p> Skim plaster is bought in bags of 25kg ( Smaller bags can be bought for patching ) and the mixing instructions are on the bag . Mix to a creamy consistency using an electric drill on slow speed and a " paddle " attachment that can be bought at most diy stores . Apply to the ceiling/wall using a hand held board ( hawk ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be placed on the hawk , then cut into a small section of this with the trowel held at 90 degrees to the hawk . Tilt the hawk towards you while pushing and " scooping " the trowel and plaster away . Once you have the plaster on the trowel , spread it evenly on the surface . Do not attempt to smooth it at this stage . <p> Before attempting the above , we suggest you first mix up an eggcup full of skim . Place this on an off cut of some kind that you have prepared with some pva . Spread it out and mark the time it takes to go firm but not hard . This is the point at which skim can be made smooth and the trowel marks will disappear . <p> Once skim is hard the only way of smoothing it is by sanding . As with all of our projects , the money spent on practice is a tiny amount compared to the amount it takes to put a job right that has gone wrong . " Stop end " beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stainless beads , which can be fixed to the surface and allow you to divide your plastering area into smaller , more manageable sections . Their flat top gives you an edge to work to and finishes flush with the surface of the plaster . When decorated they are not visible . <p> Start smoothing where you started skimming , you will have to repeat this procedure over the surface two or three times to get it absolutely smooth . When the plaster gets quite hard , you can spray or flick a brush with some water on the surface , this will give you an extra couple of minutes to work the surface . <p> Use a half-inch , wet ( water ) , soft paintbrush to define corners and the abutment of the plastered surface to any other . Wipe any mess on non-pourus surfaces with a wet cloth , take up the lumps etc and it will dry to a fine dust . This can be wiped again and will go . Leave any mess on pourus surfaces until the lumps are dry and then pick them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Do not attempt to put too much plaster on either hawk or trowel . <p> Spread the plaster to a ceiling not directly above your face . <p> Get a covering on that is uniform in thickness ( no more than 5mm ) so the whole area goes firm at the same time . <p> It is impossible to get plaster smooth on its first application to the ceiling . Do not attempt to do this . Get an area covered uniformly and wait until it starts to get firm . Then it can be smoothed . <p> Plastering is very hard work indeed . Mostly because of the speed it has to be carried out at &amp; also because it involves a lot of body movement . Please make sure you have divided the room onto manageable areas . You really do only want to do this once . <p> For an absolute novice we would suggest that a ceiling area of 2m x 2m is the maximum that should be attempted in one go and a wall area of 2.4m x 2.5m . As we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice before you attempt the real things . This can save you a lot of time and money in the long run . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624598 @1624598/ <h> What is efflorescence ? <p> You may have noticed wall stains on your exterior brickwork and wondered " what are they " ? <p> If they are white deposits like the ones in the picture below then they could be caused by efflorescence . Efflorescence is one type of white deposit found on masonry . It is formed when water reacts with the natural salts contained within the construction material and mortar . The water dissolves the salts which are then carried out and deposited onto the surface by the natural evaporation that occurs when air comes into contact with the surface of the wall or floor . <p> Damaged Brickwork caused by efflorescence on brick <p> Sometimes Efflorescence is confused with spalling - this is damaged brickwork where the surface of the bricks starts to crumble because of Freeze/Thaw action , after it has become saturated in the winter months . However this is a different problem to efflorescence ( also known as " salting " ) . You can read more about spalling in our project on freeze/thaw damage . <p> Damaged Brickwork caused by weathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , masonry and concrete , caused by salts being washed out of construction materials , and being deposited on the surface of building materials by the evaporation process of water . <p> Efflorescence itself is not causing damage to the wall but it will damage any paintwork or wallpaper that you put over interior walls affected by efflorescence . Salting on bricks , and other construction materials , can also look unsightly on external walls . However this build-up of salts on the surface of the wall is a sign that the wall has been wet , so you will need to investigate what has caused the damp that has led to the efflorescence . <h> What is the Cause of Efflorescence ? <p> You can find efflorescence on brick , concrete , or stone walls or floors . Efflorescence or salting can be found on fresh plaster too . Salting on fresh plaster can look white and fluffy . As mentioned above the cause of efflorescence is water reacting with the salts in the plaster ( or other building materials ) and can occur after a water leak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can read more about how condensation can affect your home and cause efflorescence on walls , in our Condensation Project . Additionally , if you would like some extra help and advice on condensation , efflorescence and the causes of damp then you can call Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 . <p> Preventing Efflorescence of Brick and plaster may not be possible , if it is caused by materials getting wet in the building process then you may need to simply allow the surface to dry fully and then treat the surface . If you have a leak or a high level of condensation then you can remove the cause of the moisture and treat the salts to neutralise them , and this is the only sure fire way of effective efflorescence prevention . <p> Stained or Damaged Brickwork - External Walls <p> If you have white marks on external walls it could be Efflorescence or Free Lime . <p> Under normal circumstances white , fluffy efflorescent salt occurs in relatively new buildings because the brickwork was not protected from the weather during construction . The brickwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished this water finds its way out of the porous bricks in the wall by evaporation , it leaves the salts behind on the surface of the brick when it evaporates . <p> Where this is the case the salts can be brushed off the wall and they should not re-occur . However , in cases where efflorescence is caused by a water leak , for instance where lead flashing is damaged , or masonry joints are missing , thereby allowing water to continuously enter the construction material , then efflorescence will continue to form . In this situation the cause of the efflorescence must be found and eradicated , because otherwise the unsightly salts will continue to form and more serious damage could occur because of the water ingress . <p> Treating Efflorescence on External Walls <p> The most effective treatment for efflorescence and free lime staining on external wall surfaces is time . The natural weathering of the surface will remove the staining if you are patient . If you have a serious build up of deposits on a wall , a good scrub with a stiff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this treatment a soft dry brush to make sure you dust off all the salts from the wall entirely . <p> If salts are not completely removed from the surface of the wall , they can stay in the pores of the brickwork and dissolve again when it is wet , causing further staining . There are some brick stain treatments which generally contain acid and involve getting the surface wet again , and so this also gets the salts wet again . This dissolves the salts and carries them into , not out of , porous surfaces . <p> Stained or Damaged Brickwork - Mortar Stains <p> Mortar stains on brickwork can be caused by builders leaving residual sand and cement on the wall during construction . <p> Unlike Efflorescence mortar stains are best dealt with by using a brick cleaning acid . These are available from most DIY stores and all Builders ' Merchants . You can apply the acid in diluted or undiluted form depending on the level of staining and then wash off , follow the instructions on the tub . Take precautions by wearing rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used with care . <p> For large lumps of mortar , a little gentle persuasion with a hammer and chisel will take them back to the surface of the wall , then you can give it a quick rub with a wire brush to take you down to the stain . The brick cleaning acid should remove the stain easily . Do not " attack " large lumps with acid . <p> Efflorescence on Internal Walls <p> Efflorescence on plaster can cause white marks on internal walls and it can occur behind paint and wallpaper . <p> These white , fluffy salts that are " crunchy " to the touch and where they occur beneath wallpaper or paint the crystals are strong enough to push these coatings off the plaster , we say they " blow " the plaster . This kind of sulphate crystal build-up can occur in any building , of any age , where water is passing into the structure . This water will find its way out of the wall through evaporation leaving the salts behind . The salts can be brushed off , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Efflorescence on plaster where salts have blown the paint off the wall <p> In this situation you need to find the cause and repair it . You can buy Salt Neutraliser treatment ( pictured below ) and this is covered further in our How To Treat Efflorescence section . This will prevent salts recurring providing the underlying cause of the problem has been fixed . It will not pass through paint so you will have to rub down the surface to get back to the bare plaster , render , stone or brick before you start treatment <p> Salt Neutraliser can be used after the cause of the damp has been eliminated , but this will only be successful if : <p> There is no more water passing through the wall . <p> It is applied to bare plaster , render , stone or brick . It will not work if used on top of paint or wallpaper . <p> If it is efflorescence - other causes of white patches should be investigated and ruled out ( see what is efflorescence above ) . <p> Other Causes of White Patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these other causes of white patches : <p> White patches on an internal blockwork wall <p> An external water leak - before you treat for efflorescence check for the following causes of penetrating damp : <p> whether there is a leak from a gutter or downpipe <p> if a cistern overflow is running <p> if window frame mastic missing <p> or a mains pipe is weeping <p> Penetrating damp - Before you treat the symptoms of efflorescence check for these building defects which may be allowing water to get into the building from outside : <p> Mortar breaching the cavity in a double skin wall , this could allow water to travel from the external wall to the internal wall <p> a blocked wall cavity ( see above ) <p> damaged wall ties <p> a high abutting garden wall <p> poor pointing <p> Damaged to walls and pointing can allow damp to penetrate <p> An internal water leak - before you treat for efflorescence check the following possible internal leaks : <p> radiator pipes <p> sewerage pipes <p> mains water pipes <p> Free Lime - the result of mortar or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making . <h> Redecorating after Treating Efflorescence <p> Damaged Wall Plaster - How to Rectify <p> If the damage to the wall is localised than patching may be possible , however generally the affected areas need to be hacked back to the bare wall .

You will usually find that the salts will come away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases start with coarse grit sandpaper and down to fine one , to make sure you have a sound surface before you redecorate . <p> Wipe down the wall with sugar soap ( make sure you mix with water to the manufacturer 's specifications ) or you can use detergent and water .

They may also include a combination of the above . The common alert types for home security system are as follows : <p> Bells-Only Alarms : This alarm type normally only features an alarm system . When a sensor is tripped e.g. a door is opened or a motion detector picks up movement then the system will trigger the alarm bells to start ringing and alert anyone in the surrounding area . The disadvantage of this is that it depends on whether anyone does actually take notice and respond <p> Notification Alarms : When the system is triggered a response is either sent to a monitoring centre or an email or text message is sent to a designated phone number or email address alerting the recipient to a potential break-in . Speech dialers also fall under this category and they are designed to call a set of phone numbers until they receive an response or can leave a message . <p> When it comes to the sensors or detectors , home security systems tend to use two main types : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attached to either side e.g. the fixed window or door frame and to the opening section and when closed create a circuit but when they are separated i.e. the circuit is broken the alarm is activated . These types of sensor can come in a range of different types and styles . An example can be seen below : <p> Magnetic catch door or window alarm <p> Interior Passive Infrared Detectors ( PIR 's ) : These detect movement and body heat within a defined arc and then activate an alarm , like the one shown below . This is the most common type of detector used in burglar alarms . As with most modern systems they can either be hard-wired to the main control panel or they can operate wirelessly <p> PIR motion detecting alarm <h> DIY Alarms <p> If you are a fairly competent DIYer you will be able to fit a self-install security system , with no problems . This is a great option if you are on a budget . <p> DIY security alarm kits are available in a vast array of options such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker to install , but both feature upgrade options such as extra PIR 's , magnetic contacts , cameras and remote controls . <p> Most kits are also available as bells-only or notification versions . The latter may be a little tricky to setup as it might involve configuring app 's and sim cards etc .... so reading and following the instructions is essential . <p> One thing to note is that it is very unlikely that you will be able to use a DIY installed kit alarm kit in a monitored setup ( see below ) . Most companies supplying a monitored service will insist that the system is installed by one of their own engineers . <p> With either type you can ' personalise ' your system with a PIN that activates and deactivates the alarm . <p> There are no on-going monthly fees with a DIY package , as there is no control centre involved . <p> Yale wireless alarm DIY installation kit <h> Monitored Alarms <p> The main benefit of a monitored alarm is that if it goes off you know it wo n't be ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone back to sleep if we hear and alarm in the night ? <p> Monitored alarms are linked to a security centre that is manned 24-hours-a-day . They will alert one or more of your nominated key holders . <p> These alarms are fitted by a professional who is recommended by or employed by the security company . <p> You pay a monthly fee depending on the service you choose . These monitored burglar alarms are more expensive than off-the-shelf kits and you have to factor in the monthly fees they attract , but if you live in a vulnerable property you might think the extra money is well spent . <p> There are now quite a few companies supplying these services both local to many regions around the UK and also some of the more well-known national brands such as ADT and in most situations most will offer a maintenance contract for your alarm system . This can include remote error checking and also on-site checks and repairs . <p> There are normally several levels of security cover when it comes to paid for services : <p> Keyholder Monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depending on the level of support you have , the company will either send out one of their own security officers to inspect your property or contact your nominated keyholder . <p> In terms of your nominated keyholder , common stipulations are that they need to be within a 20 - 30 minute car journey from the property ( so they must be capable of driving ) and have a set of keys that will enable them to access the property . If you change your locks then you must supply your keyholder with a new set , this is your responsibility ! <p> It is also your responsibility to keep the monitoring company up to date with the name(s) and contact details of your chosen keyholder and also supply second and sometimes third options if the primary contact is unavailable or away . <p> Police Monitoring <p> This level of support ensures that not only is your monitoring company notified to any breaches in your security system but also your local police station ( normally contacted by the monitoring company ) . <p> Under most contracts , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the property must be tripped ( e.g. a door sensor and a motion detector ) . <p> Although this sounds like a great feature there are a few things to be aware of in that firstly your monitoring company must be registered with the local police , secondly that this does not necessarily ensure that the police will attend in a timely manner as it depends on what else they are dealing with at the time and thirdly if they respond to three false callouts within 12 months then you will be struck off the list and they will not respond again . <h> Cost of Installing a Burglar Alarm <p> You can buy single magnetic alarms for windows and doors and these cost around -20 each . <h> GSM Alarms <p> First of all let 's do some explaining . What is a GSM Alarm ? Well GSM means Global System for Mobile communications . So it does n't need a phone line , it works with a SIM , like your mobile phone . These days GSM alarms are designed to let you use your mobile phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are different options available including GSM temperature detectors and flood detectors . <p> When a sensor is tripped , this can then trigger the system to send notification to a mobile device and also to a control centre , depending on whether you have a monitoring contract or not . <h> CCTV Systems <p> CCTV means Close Circuit Television . If you own your property it is perfectly legal to install a CCTV system . Just check if you require planning permission . <p> The camera should only be trained on your property , and not your neighbour 's property , unless they give their permission . <p> Just be careful where you are pointing your cameral , any cameras trained on areas beyond your property boundaries could amount to harassment , and they could contravene The Human Rights Act . <h> Panic Button <p> Panic Buttons bring peace of mind to the elderly and vulnerable . A panic button does what it says on the tin . If you hit the panic button , it will raise the alarm . <p> You can get wall-mounted panic buttons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with a personal alarm worn as a pendant . When activated it dials one or more of the programmed contacts as well as alerting a customer security centre . <h> Dummy Burglar Alarm Box <p> You can fit a dummy alarm box on the outside of your house , which may deter a small-time opportunistic burglar . However professional thieves can tell the difference between a working alarm system and an empty plastic box sitting on the outside of your house . <p> This device is not likely to work very effectively , and you wo n't benefit from reduced contents insurance premiums either , so you 're probably better off spending the money on better locks for doors and windows to secure your home better . <h> How To Identify ' At Risk ' Areas <p> Different types of homes have different weak points when it comes to home security . <p> A house with large gardens may have large areas around ground floor windows that are badly lit at night . This will allow intruders to pick an easy access point without been seen . So security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home security measures . <p> In a second floor flat , the main at risk area would be the hall adjacent to the entry door as this is the only reasonable entry route . A door entry system with a video link might be the best solution here . <p> A terrace house with a long footprint could benefit from detectors at the front and back doors . These may have magnetic contacts on each door or PIR 's positioned on the walls opposite . <p> In most homes the front door is generally deemed the most likely entry/exit route . So it makes sense if you are fitting a home security system to have the control sited near the front door so you can activate it easily when you leave your home . <h> Using Exterior Lighting to Improve Security <p> Outdoor lighting is a simple , cost-effective , way of protecting your property against both vandalism and burglary . It 's fair to say that intruders would much rather go about their business in the dark ! <p> The different types of outdoor security lighting include : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion sensor lighting is activated when someone walks within the detection area . The light will come on for a set amount of time , and then if there is no more movement it will turn off until it detects movement again . <p> Halogen PIR security light <p> Dusk to Dawn Security Lighting <p> ' Dusk-to-dawn ' lighting provides all-night illumination . The time that the light comes on can be set by a timer or is activated by a light sensor . These will not alert you of any movement on your property , but they should make your home much less attractive to burglars . <p> Dusk-to-dawn outside light <p> Hi-Lo Security Lighting <p> ' Hi-Lo lighting ' switches on automatically at dusk using a light sensor . This light is less bright than the full setting , which is triggered if it senses movement or body heat within range . Hi-Lo lighting effectively combines the two systems above . <p> Do n't forget to include back doors and side alleys when you are fitting security lighting . <p> It is convenient to have motion sensor lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your keys , but do n't forget the main purpose is to show up any likely burglars . Stand outside your home in the dark and check which areas might benefit from a security light . <p> Hi-lo outdoor security light with PIR sensor <p> Solar and LED Energy Saving Options <p> The majority of the cheaper security lighting available will either use a Halogen bulb or domestic-type bayonet or screw in bulb . If these lights are left on for long periods during the day or night this can mount up in terms of energy usage and costs . Fortunately today , most security lights are available as LED 's so it 's worth shopping around . They will be more expensive to purchase but will save you a fair bit in the long run . <p> On a comparative level a 20W LED security light will use 90% less energy than its 400W counterpart . <p> As well as LED options , many outdoor lights are available in a solar version meaning that not only can they be easily fixed in any location ( as you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to run ! <p> LED security floodlight with PIR <h> Need any more help ? <p> Visit our security projects section for more advice on fitting home security systems , burglar alarms and door entry systems , new locks and cameras . <p> If you want to secure your home you will find a range of home security systems and products in our online store . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624600 @1624600/ <h> Choosing a Shower - The Different Types of Shower Explained <p> Summary : How to choose the right type of shower for your home . If you 're wondering which shower is right for your , we cover all the types of shower including electric , mixer , power showers and thermostatic showers . Understand the options and fitting to choose from so you get the right one first time . <p> Before choosing a shower , it is important that you understand the way the hot water is already heated in your house . Some showers can not be used with some heating systems . Our project on domestic hot water will help you identify your system . Once you have done that , you can choose your shower . <h> Electric Showers : <p> Electric showers can be used within any domestic water system . They , in most cases , are connected to the mains cold water and an element within the shower heats the water as it passes through the unit . If you can arrange a clearance of 10 metres from your shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can fit an electric shower to this . In this situation the shower must have an independent cold supply from the tank . <p> The water at your mains entry must have a running pressure of min 1 bar , must flow at a rate of 8 litres per minute and have a maximum static pressure of 10 bar . Most electric showers will be configured for these water bye law stipulations but it is as well to check with the manufactures instructions . <p> Your shower must be connected to the mains via a 15mm water pipe and it is just as well to install an isolation valve in this run . The valve can be turned off if and when maintenance is required to the shower and this removes the need for water to be turned off at the mains , disrupting all other water uses . A description and installation of isolating valves can be found in our bathroom project page . <p> The electrical connections to an electric shower are covered by many regulations . An electric shower must be installed on its own circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First you must check that your fuseboard is capable of providing the current necessary and must be rated above 60 amps . An RCD ( residual current device ) must be installed as , either part of your existing fuseboard , or separately , interrupting the circuit to the shower . Connection to the fuseboard should be by means of a MCB ( miniature circuit breaker ) . Fuse , switch and cable ratings are also vital and we would suggest that 10mm cable is used for all installations . This makes upgrading your shower much easier in the future . <p> Showers up to 7kw may carry a 6mm cable as long as the shower unit is within 18 metres of the fuseboard . Fuses and switches should be rated at 32 amps . <p> Showers up to 8.5kw may carry a 6mm cable as long as the shower unit is within 18 meters of the fuseboard . Fuses and switches should be rated at 40 amps . <p> Showers up to 9.5kw carry a 10mm cable to units within 35 metres of the fuseboard . Fuses and switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should carry a 10mm cable to units within 35 metres of the fuseboard . Fuses and switches should be rated at 50 amps . <p> In all cases the circuit should be interrupted by a double pole pull cord switch with a neon on/off indicator and a mechanical indicator should the neon fail . <p> It is essential , in all cases , that the shower supply pipes are independently cross bonded to earth . <h> Mixer Showers : <p> Mixer showers are so called because they will mix the existing hot and cold water , in a special valve , before it is available at the shower head . They are suitable for either low or high pressure ( check with your supplier that the mixer valve you buy is suitable for the system you have ) . They are available as surface mounted fixtures , where the pipework is easily installed on the top of your existing surface , or flush mounted , where the valve is seen , but the pipework is hidden behind the surface . They are then ideal to install in a new shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . <p> To operate correctly both the hot and the cold water need to come from a source operating at the same pressure . Both can come from a mains fed system , ( combi boiler or multi point water heater and cold mains ) or both can come from tank fed water ( immersion and cold storage tank ) . If one supply must come from high pressure and one from low pressure , a pressure balanced mixer valve can be installed . <p> A mixer shower will not increase the flow of water to your system . If your water flows from your taps at a poor rate , this is the rate it will feed the shower . <p> A drawback to installing a mixer shower is the fact that it will usually be connected to pipes which supply water to other points . When the other points are used ( taps , toilet cistern etc ) the flow rate to the shower will be affected . This in turn will affect the temperature of the water coming out of the shower and , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to scalding . This can be overcome , with a low pressure system , by laying separate pipes to the valve from both hot and cold supplies and making the shower water independent . You may need to contact a plumber for this as it will mean installing a special flange in the top of your hot water cylinder . In the case of a mains fed mixer a thermostatic valve is recommended . Mixer showers can not be pumped from a mains pressure system ( combination boilers , multi point heaters ) but they can from low pressure systems . There are mixer shower valves especially designed for combination boilers , ( pressure balanced mixer shower ) please see your local plumbing retailer for details . <h> Thermostatic Mixer Showers : <p> A thermostatic mixer shower incorporates a pre-set thermostat that will sense a dramatic change in temperature and rectify the situation . Some advanced thermostatic mixers will even cut the water off when a failure in flow is detected . Most thermostatic mixers also a have a temperature limiting device to stop very high temperatures being selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in various shapes , sizes and designs and perform the task of opening up or shutting off a given water supply e.g. a hot or cold supply . Some examples of shower valves can be seen below . <p> Shower Valves <h> Power Showers : <p> Power showers are mixer showers with integral pumps which increase the rate of flow from the shower head . They can only be installed on low pressure , tank fed systems . The cold water tank should be no less than 50 gallons if it supplies many outlets , a 25 gallon cold tank is acceptable for the shower alone . A dedicated hot and cold supply is necessary . The water supply must always be above the unit to ensure that the pump is always primed and does not have to suck any air . <h> Shower Pumps : <p> There are two types of shower pump . The first is a single impeller pump , with one driving blade which pumps the water , as it is mixed , to the shower head . This means of course it must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place therefore to install the single pump is in the loft as it must be above the mixer valve . This can lead to problems with the cold temperatures in the loft freezing the water and it can not be insulated because it needs a free air flow . For this reason a twin impeller pump was introduced . This is connected to both the hot and cold water before they reach the mixer valve and can be sited , ideally , in the airing cupboard . Most pump manufacturers will specify that the pump must be within 4 metres of the hot water cylinder and at least 30mm below the cold tank . Pumps , as with power showers , must have a dedicated water supply that serves no other outlets . They must also be connected to the hot supply with an anti aeration flange such as an Essex or Warix ... In general a Surrey flange should not be used as it can restrict flow to the pump inlet . An electrical connection is needed and should be taken from a switched , fused spur on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5 amps . <h> Shower Cubicles <p> Most should be familiar with the humble shower cubicle . Again , these can come in a vast range of shapes , sizes , colours , materials and designs to suit pretty much any given taste . <p> They 're main function is to keep all the water and moisture generated in a shower within the cubicle and away from surfaces that may otherwise be damaged . Some examples can be found below : <p> Corner shower unit <p> Glass corner unit <p> Chrome corner shower unit <p> Walk in shower unit <h> Drainage : <p> Drainage for the shower water can be provided by an existing bath or shower tray waste , but must be via a 40mm diameter waste pipe and discharge into a foul water drain . This pipe , in this diameter , must travel no further than 3 metres before entering the soil stack or discharge gulley . It can not be mixed with the rain ( surface ) water drainage . Above the ground floor , to comply with building regulations , a deep trap ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow trap of 38mm may be used . This is to stop the water in the trap being siphoned out by water running quickly through another section of the waste pipe .

@@41624601 @1624601/ <h> Laying Bricks and Blocks &amp; The Different Types of Bonds Explained <p> Summary : Learn how to lay bricks and blocks correctly . This project will explain the different types bond that is used for a range of brickwork and blockwork bonds . This is a guide to the types of bricks and when they should be used and what bonds that you should use . After reading this project you should have a good understanding about how to lay bricks in almost any circumstance . <p> Before you can start your build you first have to lay a suitable foundation . There are several types of foundation and to make sure that you have the correct one please view our Foundations Project and follow the guidelines . <p> The actual construction of a cavity wall can vary but in all cases ( Building Regulations Approved Document A ) the leaves of a cavity wall must be a minimum of 90mm thick with a minimum 50mm cavity in between . <p> The two skins of a cavity wall are held together by wall ties built into the mortar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is between 50 and 75mm wide the ties should be placed at a maximum spacing of 900mm horizontally and 450mm vertically . If the cavity is between 76 and 100mm wide the ties should be positioned at maximum intervals of 750mm horizontally and 450mm vertically . The ties should always slope towards the outer skin very slightly to stop any moisture in the cavity being able to travel towards the inner wall . <p> The wall ties are often used to hold sheets on cavity insulation in place and the type and thickness of this insulation will be dictated by the Building Control officer . <p> The cavity , in a cavity wall , is there to prevent moisture from traveling from the outside skin to the inside skin . The cavity also , in almost all cases , is used to insulate the internal wall against heat loss from inside . <p> It is important when building cavity walls to keep the cavity free from debris at all times . Even a dropped trowel of mortar can collect on a wall tie and transfer moisture and cold temperatures across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years about damp and cold spots on walls in an otherwise warm room . This is usually the result of a transfer of cold temperature from the outside wall to the inside via what is known as a bridged cavity . This can be particularly noticeable at the sides of window and doors ( reveals ) where the cavity is closed to allow the fixing of the frame . <p> Cavity Wall Cross Section Side View <p> Cavity Wall Cross Section Top View <p> The left hand diagram above shows what can happen when two very common things occur during the construction of a cavity wall . First a lump of mortar has fallen from the trowel into the cavity . This has obviously gone unnoticed and when the insulation has been added to the cavity it can not get down to the required DPC level . The mortar has bridged the cavity allowing moisture and cold temperatures to pass between the skins of the cavity wall . At the same time , while the garden was being dug , a heap of spoil was left against the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DPC . <p> As a consequence of these two very regular occurrences , ground water can rise up into the soil heap which is probably already damp anyway . This moisture can soak into the brickwork above the DPC and , via the mortar in the cavity , soak into the internal wall . This makes a section of the internal wall cold and even damp allowing the warm air in the room to condense in this " cold spot " . Because the wall is covered by very porous plaster this damp cold spot can be home to any number of mould spores which will soon show as a dark moldy patch which , no matter how hard you scrub , will not go away . <p> The right hand diagram shows , looking from above , how a cavity wall is returned to close the cavity when meeting a door or window opening . It is at this point that there is least insulation and cold temperatures can travel through the walls . A vertical DPC inserted between the two walls will stop any damp from getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to condensation forming on the wall . <h> Types of Brick <p> Most bricks are made from clay . This type of clay is imaginatively titled , Brick Clay . Clay bricks ( and tiles ) are very durable and extremely versatile . In days gone by when bricks were shaped and fired by hand in small batches , different coloured clays , of different compositions , from different areas were used brickwork was as much of a visual delight as it was practical . With the increasing demand for housing larger and larger automated factories are producing more and more standard bricks and the effect is , for the most part , purely practical construction . <p> Special bricks are still available and experimentation with different clays is advancing brick technology to keep up with the demands for increased durability standards from the EU . <p> Architects and Planners these days are insisting on re-developing the traditional style of house ( and other ) buildings using techniques and appearances which <p> are sympathetic to existing local styles . This may mean that the demand for clay bricks will rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 it dropped from 5,000 million to 2,750 million , just over half . This huge drop in the production of clay bricks is accounted for by the huge rise in concrete products used today together with a massive increase in timber and plasterboard internal wall construction . <h> Common Bricks <p> The term " common brick " comes from the fact that , although they are fired hard enough to use for most brickwork load-bearing operations they are of a lower quality than facing , or engineering bricks . No attempt is made to control their colour and their composition is such that they should not be used below ground . <p> They are used mostly for indoor partitions and for parts ( or skins ) of walls that will not be seen . They are lighter in weight than facing and engineering bricks . Their use is , as described above , being overtaken somewhat by the use of concrete and lightweight blocks for internal partitions . <h> Engineering Bricks <p> An engineering brick goes through a more elaborate process of clay selection , careful crushing , firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The process delivers a brick which is has very high compressive strength with very low water absorption . Engineering bricks can be used underground and are often laid as a damp proof course . They are rated in two classes , A and B with A being the strongest and least absorbent . This type of brick is used in situations requiring the strongest of work . <h> Facing Bricks <p> There is a number of different types of facing brick but generally they are the " face " of the building . They are hard burned to give them strength and durability which they need to withstand the hugely varying temperatures and climate available in the UK , not to mention the acid attack from smoke and soot from any number of furnaces and cars . <h> Stock Facings <p> Stock Facings , or stocks , are a soft , irregular facing brick produced by pressing wet clay into sanded moulds . It is by using sand to release the stocks from the mould that gives them their soft texture and slightly irregular shape . <h> Wirecut <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tightly packed clay is pushed through a die where it gets its perfectly rectangular shape . The face is then added . The block or column of faced clay is then wire cut into individual bricks and fired in a kiln . <h> Waterstruck <p> Waterstruck bricks are released from the mould by water . They contain no holes or frogs and have smoother edges . <h> Handmade <p> As you would imagine , these bricks are hand-made . An extremely expensive process which , as the clay is folded into the moulds , produces distinctive creases ( smiles ) in the brick . Handmade bricks are used in the most prestigious of buildings . <h> Reclaimed <p> Another brick that does exactly what it says on the tin . Reclaimed bricks can be a variety and mixture of the above facings . The fact that they have been used once and reclaimed gives them creases and marks which will add something to any building they are used on . Because reclaimed bricks tend to come from older buildings they are often in imperial , rather than metric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger , modern walls , so special reclaimed " panels " are often inserted . <h> Specials : <p> Special bricks are so called because they are made to fulfil a specific task . An example of a special is a bull nosed brick shown in the diagram . This type of brick is used to finish off the top of a wall or even as a window cill . Other often used specials include plinth bricks , copings , arch keystones and many others . Brick companies can make a brick into almost any shape you like as long as you are prepared to pay for it . <p> Bull Nosed Brick <p> All bricks have different uses but all need to withstand a certain amount of wear and tear . Bricks are crush tested to determine their usability and the crush testing result for each brick type is an average figure based on the crushing of twelve bricks of that type . Crushing strength is measured in Newtons per mm square and the softer of facing bricks will have a crushing strength of about 3 4 N per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 145 N per mm square . <p> As different bricks are used for different conditions , and in different walls , so different ways of laying them are employed in different situations . Some walls are laid so you can only see the ends of the bricks , some in a way which only leaves the sides visible . These different ways of laying bricks are called " Bonds " and the most popular are listed below . <h> Brickwork and blockwork bonds <p> Bonding , or tying together individual bricks and blocks can be done in a number of ways . However it is done it is imperative that the maximum strength possible for the task of the wall is obtained . Some popular bonds are shown below together with an explanation of where they are most likely to be used . Brickwork or blockwork bonding should be laid out dry before you start to make sure the bond works . Sometimes bricks should overlap the brick below it by half of its length ( half bond ) . Some brickwork types use a quarter bond where one brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full brick . Believe it or not buying a pack of dominoes for three pounds , and practicing brickwork bonds with them can save you a great deal of time and money when it comes to building a retaining wall in the garden . <p> The Different Faces of a Brick <p> The long face that you can see in a brick wall is called the Stretcher face . The shorter " ends " are called Headers . Stretcher bond is the most commonly used in house construction because of the economy of bricks it allows and the speed in which this bond can be laid in most constructions which only require a single ( half brick ) skin . <p> Two stretcher walls can be built back to back and tied together using wall ties to form a double ( single brick ) skin . This type of tie is called a collar tie . This is a way of getting an attractive face on both sides of the wall but not the strongest method of producing a single brick wall as the ties between the skins are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Course <p> Stretcher bond uses 60 bricks to the square metre in a half-brick , or single skin wall . This is obviously doubled to construct a double skin , or One-brick wall . <p> You can see clearly in the diagrams how each brick in the stretcher bond overlaps the one below it by half of its length . Turning corners with stretcher bond is simply a matter of placing one brick at right angles to another . This automatically continues the half bond . To finish off the ends of the wall a brick is broken in half ( half batt ) and laid to keep the end of the wall in line vertically . <p> Stretcher bond is not the strongest of bonds however and if a wall of any length is built , piers must be inserted to maintain strength . <p> First Course Of Bricks Laid <p> Second course of bricks laid <p> Alternative First and Second Course <p> There are two ways to end a stretcher wall with piers . The first , above , shows the use of a half-batt in alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-quarter batt . <p> In some brickwork bonds a gap develops which is not the same size as a full or half brick . In these cases a brick is cut to fit the gap and this cut brick is called a closer . Some bonds do not work at all without closer 's and the same size/type of closer is used in every ( or every other ) course . Where the closer has common usage it is often named , and " King " or " Queen " closer 's are often seen as are half and three-quarter batts . <p> Half Butt <p> Queen Closer <p> King Closer <p> Frog <p> Most bricks used for home construction in the UK have indents in the top of the brick . This indent is called a frog and if bricks are laid to British Standards , as they should be , the frog should be laid upwards and filled with mortar . British Standard Code of Practice BS 5628-3 states . " Unless otherwise advised , lay single frog bricks with frog uppermost and double frogged with deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This maximises strength , stability and general performance of the brickwork . <p> Frog Layed Upwards and Filled with Mortar <p> When the frog is laid upwards , the load is evenly spread throughout the width of the brick all the way down to the foundations . If the frog is laid down , the load is forced to the outsides of the brick . The recommended maximum number of brickwork courses to lay in a day is 16 . <p> Other bonds used in home or garden construction are : <h> English Bond : <p> English bond ( also known as Ancient Bond ) requires quarter bond work in its construction of a course of stretcher bricks and a course of header bricks laid alternately . It is the strongest brickwork bond . It is however , one of the most expensive because of the labour time . The Victorians , when building many of their classical gardens , introduced a variation on <p> English Bond <p> English Bond , called English Garden Wall Bond which introduces the course of headers in between five courses of stretchers . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker to build . <p> It can be seen from the diagram that English bond requires closures on each course to maintain the bond . This type of closure , a brick cut down the middle of its length , is called a Queen Closer . <p> First and Second Brick Course <h> Flemish Bond <p> Not quite as strong as English Bond but used for is visual affects , Flemish Bond is laid using stretchers and headers alternately in each course to give it a quarter bond finish . Flemish Bond also has a " garden wall " variant in so much as the number of stretchers in between the headers can be increased . <p> Flemish Bond - Elevation <p> Flemish Bond Fist and Second Course <p> As stated before the most common bond used today is Stretcher Bond and for DIY purposes this is a perfectly adequate bond especially for use in the garden . The problem with single skin Stretcher Bond is that it has very little strength when pushed from back or front . Despite this is it often used as a retaining wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of soil . Our brickwork project is about building a garden wall and shows you how to lay bricks . <p> Last year Diydoctor received 4,820 questions regarding building retaining walls . Over 50% of those questions were sent because the retaining wall which was already in the garden had ceased to retain ! <p> &gt;Quetta Bond is a brickwork bond designed specifically for the Industrial use of retaining and load-bearing support . This bond can be easily adapted for garden use where a very strong , attractive retaining wall is needed . <p> Quetta Bond <p> The wall is built as shown using stretchers and headers and the voids created by this bond are filled with concrete . The first course of this type of wall is built laying the bricks onto the concrete foundation before is has set . Steel reinforcing rods are driven into the concrete foundation , through the voids and further courses built up around these rods . When the voids are filled you are left with a very attractive , very strong garden wall which will retain pretty much anything you throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Tensile bars are recommended ) can be bought at any builders merchants and easily cut with a hack saw . <p> For extra strength with any type of wall , a galvanised steel mesh can be laid into the mortar course . A little like chicken wire this mesh is called Expanded Metal Lathing and is available from Builders Merchants in sheets and in rolls . For the DIY enthusiast it is far more useful in rolls which come in various widths ranging from 50mm to 450mm . The mesh can be cut with a hacksaw or tin snips and can virtually double the strength of some walls . <h> Honeycomb Bond <p> This bond is used for decoration in garden walls as shown but serves the useful purposes of allowing some visibility and also creates less resistance to strong winds . <p> Honeycomb Bond <p> To finish the top of a wall a course of bricks is often laid on one of their stretcher edges . This is called , again inventively , a Brick On Edge course . Another way of finishing a garden wall is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angled top to allow the water to run off and , as with window cills , usually overhang the brickwork slightly so the water does not run down the face of the brickwork and stain it . Coping stones can be seen in our Laying Bricks project <p> Finishing Layer <p> Coping Stones <h> Blockwork <p> Concrete and lightweight blocks are widely used in all areas of building and DIY . They can be bought with a " Fair face " for work which is seen . They are much quicker to lay given that 1 standard block is equivalent to 6 bricks ( For buying purposes there are 10 blocks to the square meter when the block is 440mm x 215mm ) These dimensions are the same as two bricks and 1 mortar joint wide , by 3 bricks and three mortar joints high . This allows blocks and bricks to be used ( and bonded ) together in a simple way as can be seen in the stepped foundation diagram in the first chapter . <p> Blockwork <p> Blocks come in various thicknesses and the extension we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick . Blocks can be laid flat and walls built using flat blockwork Stretcher Bond are incredibly strong . Special blocks are used for various applications and one of the most common of these is the " Hollow " block . The hollow block can be laid as it is and the voids used as an insulation quality , or the voids can be filled with concrete to make a very strong wall . <p> Concrete blocks are almost always used in foundation walls as they are so much cheaper in terms of labour time to lay . <p> A word of warning to the DIY bricklayer here . Concrete , or any other blocks , are not easier to lay than bricks . Getting a block level , on a flat level mortar bed is every bit as difficult , if not more so , than laying a brick . Bricks can be picked up and lightly pushed into a bed of mortar with ease . A block however may take some " persuading " with a hammer or the handle of the trowel ( not recommended ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place will make it move in another and then the block will start to rock . <p> Because of their weight , hitting a block will cause the one underneath to move also and laying a block wall , even though the blocks are heavy and cumbersome , requires a light touch . We would not recommend laying more than 5 courses of blocks in one go . <h> Lightweight Blocks <p> Lightweight blocks can be used in conjunction with all types of building . The blocks have all of the qualities needed to satisfy the Building Regulations both inside and outside , load bearing and non load bearing . <p> The strength of lightweight blocks in very deceptive and their compressive strength , needed to form the load bearing inner skin of a cavity wall , is far more than is required . The lightweight nature of the blocks allows them to be picked up and laid with one hand , a huge bonus when you are laying blocks and your back will thank you for using them at the end of a long day . <p> Thermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lightweight blocks and their ability to deaden sound makes them perfect for modern domestic internal use . The thermal resistance qualities alone can save a great deal of money on other insulation . <p> Cutting lightweight blocks could not be easier . They can be cut to any shape or size using an ordinary carpenters saw . Do yourself a favour though and do n't  actually borrow the carpenters saw to do it.Buy a cheap saw at the DIY store ! Lightweight blocks can be drilled as easily as wood and the only real problem is getting a strong fix to them for shelves , cupboards etc . However special light=weight fixing plugs can be bought from Builders Merchants which are literally screwed into the blocks and then normal screws fixed inside those . <p> Lightweight blocks are considered t be non combustible giving them a great rating in the fire resistance section of the Building Regulations . Their ability to withstand sulphate attack allows them suitability in the ground and their resistance to frost has been proven time and time again . Freeze-Thaw action has already been mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to lose compressive strength under the conditions associated with freeze-thaw . <p> Lightweight blocks have millions of tiny air pockets in their structure but these ar not connected making them able to withstand damp conditions well . <h> Glass Blocks <p> Glass blocks are now widely used . These can be laid as normal blocks , i.e. with sand and cement joints , or by using special frames and spacers which usually come in kit form with the blocks . If laying glass blocks with sand and cement it is as well to remember that glass has no porosity at all and if care is not taken a wet mortar mix will very soon squeeze out all over the face of the blocks . Glass blocks can be laid indoors or out and are an excellent way of letting light into a space while still keeping that space separate from others . They come in a variety of sizes with a clear or frosted finish for maximum privacy . Glass blocks are tested to see how long it takes before fire makes them unstable and they are also tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct block is chosen , will keep them within Building Regulation guidelines . <h> Scaffolding <p> Scaffolding , in the tube and fittings form , should not be attempted by any DIY'er . There are many reasons why a normal tube scaffold should not be put up in a DIY way . Scaffolding is not only a trade in itself but it is a very dangerous one and if a <p> Scaffold Tower <p> scaffold is not put up 100% correctly , the results can be fatal . In 2003/4 , falls from height accounted for 67 fatal accidents and nearly 4000 major injuries ... and yes .... it could be you . <p> Tower scaffolds can be bought , or hired , to complete jobs at home safely . Scaffold towers are easily portable and can be carried , in lightweight sections , directly to their place of use . Most have lockable wheels so once a job like cleaning out gutters is started , the scaffold can simply be pushed further down the line allowing safe access to all parts of the project . <p> The tower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work at between 1.2 and 4m and is absolutely idea for most work around the home . Platforms sit at height from 1.2. to 1.6m bringing most first floor operations within easy reach . These towers , or podiums , can be erected by a single person but to erect higher towers two people should work together . <p> Scaffold towers of all kinds can be purchased but it is more usual , in a domestic/DIY situation to hire them . <p> In 2005 regulations have been bought in to cover working at height . A copy of these Health and Safety regulations can be seen at this web address **30;40;TOOLONG <p> The bond that you choose to build your wall with is up to you but its a good idea to practice your brickwork before you start a major project . <p> Many of the frequently used brickwork bonds can be seen in the chapter on brickwork and blockwork so this project is simply about the technique of actually laying bricks . The same technique is employed whatever you are laying and there are a few important things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not level , do not bash it with a trowel , hammer or anything else . It may be that while you have bashed that particular brick into position , you have knocked several others out . However " robust " a brick wall appears , while its wet it can move all over the place if not handled properly . This is especially true of heavy blocks . <p> If your bed of mortar is the correct depth and the mix is pliable enough you should be able to place the bricks down gently and with a gentle twisting motion , get them into the correct , level position . Now and again a gentle tap is required with the handle of a trowel but after this tap a bricklayer will always stand back to make sure nothing else has moved . If time and care are taken over the first few courses the rest of it gets easier . If the first few courses are not level in any way , it becomes a really hard job to get a nice finish . <p> To make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber batten the same length as the proposed height of the wall . Using the measurements outlined in the Brickwork chapter , mark the proposed courses onto the batten working from the bottom up . See where the last mark comes to on the batten and measure from there , to the end of the batten . Whatever is left over can be " made up " by increasing the depth of the mortar in each bed joint slightly ( a bed joint should be no more than 15mm ) or if it is easier to add another full course , the bed joints can be made a little thinner . We would not recommend laying a joint of less than 6mm . <p> Check the level of your blocks <p> As you build the wall check not only the line , level and how upright the wall is . Check the level across the width of the wall . Bricks and blocks can show level along their length . Can show , by looking at the spirit level , to be perfectly upright both from the front and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look and the job is dreadful . This is always because the wall is not level across its width . The bricks tilt one way and then the other but at least one part of the brick is touching the spirit level so the wall appears to be correct . After a few years you get the hang of " feeling them down " but until then the spirit level , in all directions , is the best friend you have . It may look a little exaggerated in the diagram but , if you want to try it yourself , you will see it is not ! <p> In the sequence of images showing the laying technique , you will see a small " boat " level across the wall . This is carried just to make sure of a perfect level across the wall . <p> To begin laying , place some of your mix on a " spotboard " close to the wall . Use your trowel to roll the mortar down the heap until it forms a sausage at the bottom . Slide the trowel under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position for the first course of bricks . <p> Use the point of your trowel <p> Use the point of your trowel to form a V in the mortar bed . If you have seen our project on laying ceramic tiles you will know that this V allows for displacement of mortar as you push the brick down . Once again the same principle is applied to many jobs . <p> Place the bricks carefully <p> Place your bricks carefully , but firmly onto the bed . Push down with a slight twisting movement leaving a bed of 10mm under the brick . Place the spirit level at the back ( or front ) of the bricks to check they are being laid in a straight line . Make sure you fill the joints between the bricks . <p> These bricks are being laid to stretcher bond and once two or three courses are built its time to check for plumb on the end . Do this on every course . <p> Bricks layed to Stretcher Bond <p> Check the wall every course <p> The wall needs to be checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends , on every course . You can see the boat level in the picture also . If the wall starts right , it should end right ! <p> The first course is laid throughout the length of the wall with the ends built up to about 5 courses . These ends then become known as corners . When the corners are up they are used as a template for the rest of the wall by stretching a string line ( Bricklayers lines , and line pins ) can be bought from all DIY store . The pins are pushed into the mortar joints and the string stretched between them . The bricks are then laid so the top edge of each brick is touching the line . If your corners have been built properly , the rest is easy . Do not use a line for a wall that is over 6m long as it will sag in the middle . For walls this long you need to build another " corner " in the centre of the wall .. <p> For walls over 6m long , build another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " mortar " to watch various films on the art of bricklaying and mixing mortar . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

@@41624605 @1624605/ <p> Summary : In this DIY guide , find out how to construct concrete strip foundations for a building , what they are , how wide they need to be ( thickness ) and who you need to contact to inspect them to ensure they comply with building regulations for foundations . Includes a handy table of standard foundation sizes , foundation depths and foundation design . <h> What are Strip Foundations ? <p> There are many types of foundation . Differing ground conditions , proximity of trees , backfilled land , soil types , proximity of drains , wind speeds , all dictate the form our foundation work will take . This project will deal only with the strip foundation , the most common and widely used . Indication will be given here where strip foundations may not be suitable . A strip foundation is quite simply a strip of concrete placed in a trench . The absolute minimum thickness of this strip is 150mm . <p> Please note that all of the loading figures given here may not apply to your project and should be checked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary . <h> When can I use a Strip Foundation ? <p> The building regulations for foundations give a clear list of rules under which strip foundations are suitable . This is conditional upon the walls the foundations support which are placed centrally on their respective strip of concrete : <p> a ) There is no " made " ground ( imported soil etc ) or wide soil strength variation in the loaded area ( floor area of the construction or " load " ) or weak soil patches likely to cause foundation failure . <p> b ) The width of the foundation strip is in accordance with Table 12 of approved document A1/2 in section E1 of the building regulations . ( This table can be found below ) <p> c ) , d ) and e ) deal with the chemicals in the soil and the British Standards that the concrete should meet to be approved in these conditions . We will deal with this later . <p> f ) The concrete strip thickness is equal to or greater than the projection from the wall face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper level of a stepped foundation overlaps the lower level by twice the height of the step , by the thickness of the foundation or by 300mm . Whichever is the greater . <p> h ) The height of the step is not greater than the thickness of the foundation . <p> I ) The foundation strip projects beyond the faces of any pier , buttress or chimney forming part of a wall by at least as much as it projects beyond the face of the wall proper . <p> Step Foundations <p> Foundation Strip <p> If you can meet all the requirements of the above then , with the Building Inspectors approval you should be able to use strip foundations . <h> Things to Consider When Using Strip Foundations <p> Trees : <p> Existing trees draw a considerable amount of moisture from the ground , this is especially important in clay soils . The ground will actually rise and fall ( even without trees ) in differing conditions and in a dry summer the trees will continue to draw water from the ground , shrinking the clay further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree between Winter and Summer . <p> Where a tree has been chopped down , in clay conditions , the ground can swell up to 150mm as the roots are no longer drawing water from the ground . This can of course affect the foundations and any drains within the root zone of the tree . It is an accepted rule of thumb that , wherever possible , and using strip foundations , that the structure is kept away from the tree/s by at least as much as the height of the tree itself . British Standard 5837 suggests that special precautions are taken ( unless investigation shows them to be unnecessary ) with foundations that are to be constructed within an area equal to the expected height of a tree at maturity . Where trees are in rows , this may be increased to 1.5 times the height of the tree . These precautions may include piling the foundations , or other measures deemed necessary by the building inspector . It must also be remembered that dead trees will eventually rot underground and this can lead to depressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Distance between tree and building <p> Mining : <p> If there has ever been mining in the area , a special check will need to be made with local authorities as to the extent of the works . <p> Foundation sizes are determined by the load placed on them . This load is spread throughout the property and comes to bear on the walls which are actually sitting on the foundation ... For example , the weight of the roof , a particularly heavy part of the structure , is spread , via roof trusses to the walls of the structure . This is the same with the suspended floors contained within the property . This " loading " is calculated for the property and the foundations are designed to suit . However , the nature of the ground will have a great deal to do with this design criteria . To this end a table is produced within the building regulations for foundations , which dictates the size of the foundation for a certain loading in certain ground conditions . This table is called Table 12 Minimum width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Load When Designing Strip Foundations <p> The load is measured in Newton 's , units of force , which are calculated by taking the weight of the structure in kilograms , and multiplying it by 9.81 , a figure which , in effect , is the maximum pressure gravity will place on that structure . <p> To design the foundations , it is therefore necessary to know the load of the building and this is measured in 3 ways : <p> Dead Load : This is the force attributed to the total structural mass of the building as mentioned above , roof etc . This will be the weight of all the materials multiplied by 9.81 to give Newton 's . <p> Imposed Load : This is the force that will be imposed on the property in the way of people , furniture and fittings . The loading of snow ( snow load ) will come into this category and an allowance for this in all foundation design will be included in the calculations . Generally , for the design purpose of domestic properties , 1.5 kN/square metre is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to flat roofed buildings , while on roofs pitched over 30 degrees an allowance of 0.75kN/square metre is normally made . <p> Wind Load : There are so many variables here it would take forever to explain the calculations . If you are dedicated enough to want to know , the " dynamic force " calculations can be found in BS CP3 , Chapter 5 Part 2 ( 1972 ) . For our purposes , and assuming the build to be of relatively low rise , in a normal , reasonably sheltered environment , a figure of 1 kN/ square metre is acceptable . <p> Using these figures it is reasonably safe to assume ( and given the ground conditions outlined in Table 12 ) that the total force from a traditional two storey dwelling to the ground will not exceed 50kN/ meter , with a bungalow of the same construction , not exceeding 30kN/m . <h> Table 12 " Minimum width of Strip Foundations <p> NOTE : For minimum width column , width is in mm for total load in kN/m offload bearing wall of not more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 70kN/m <p> Type of Subsoil <p> Condition of Subsoil <p> Field Test Applicable <p> Minimum Width in mm <p> Rock <p> Not inferior to sandstone , limestone or firm chalk <p> Requires at least a pneumatic or other mechanically operated pick for excavation <p> Can not be moulded with fingers , requires **25;72;TOOLONG spade for removal <p> *250 - *300 - *400 - *500 - *600 - *650 <p> Clay or Sandy clay <p> Firm <p> Can be moulded by substantial pressure with the fingers and hand dug with graft or spade <p> *300 - *350 - *450 - *450 - *600 - *750 - *850 <p> Sand / Silt sand / Clay sand <p> Loose <p> Can be excavated with a spade .

This is an incredibly complex procedure for normal mortals involving punching shear ( the tendency of the weight to want to punch a hole through the concrete base ) and tension ( tendency of the base to bend under the weight ) calculations , crushing strength of aggregates and all sorts ofmathematical procedures . The crushing strength of concrete in most domestic foundations is measured at 15-20 Newton 's per square mm . The nominal mix forhouse foundations is called a C15P mix ( P = Portland cement ) and is comprised of 1 cement , 2 sand and 6 coarse gravel . See our mixing concrete project for more information and calculation tables . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Strip Foundations Rest with the Local Authority <p> It is a general rule that the depth of the foundation will be equal to , or greater than , the distance from the front face of the wall to the edge of the foundation . This is indicated in the diagram below but the concrete depth will , never be less that 150mm . In some cases , reinforcing steel may be introduced into the strip foundation to allow a lesser depth of concrete . This will be a design situation . It must also be remembered that , if building the foundations in block work and/or brickwork , space must be found in the trench to stand and build . It is considered normal practice , in ground of the required bearing strength or better , to introduce concrete strip foundations of 600mm wide and 250mm deep . This will cover almost all eventualities in a domestic build and should only a single story be planned , the opportunity to extend vertically is not removed .

It is also worth noting that 600mm is a standard size for a digger bucket ! <p> The choice of filling the foundation trench with concrete is now given in most cases . And in most cases it is much cheaper to do so . The cost of the labour involved in laying bricks and blocks to ground level , together with the materials involved , is usually greater than the cost of pouring the concrete to the required height which , in most cases , is to within two brick courses of finished ground level . <p> The diagram below shows the basic construction of a strip footing . The walls constructed below the ground are subject to pressure from the earth in both directions and are treated as retaining walls .

We run you through the steps of treating wooden worktops and how to oil worktops correctly to ensure that they last . Also included are tips repairing , resanding and restoring wooden worktops . <h> Oiling Treatment , Care and Maintenance of Hardwood Worktops <p> At Diydoctor we have received many questions asking which varnish should be used to re-vamp or repair a wooden kitchen worktopThe answer is NONE ! <p> Timber worktops should be prepared without any application that is likely to chip or crack as if damaged they will harbour germs and become extremely unhygienic in no time and to these ends , in this project we will deal with how to oil worktops and kitchen work surfaces . <h> Oiling a Hardwood Kitchen Worktop <p> Hardwood worktops must be thoroughly treated with at least three coats of protective wood oil , to all sides ( including the underside ) , prior to installation . It is also beneficial to apply as many coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the area which will absorb the most moisture . An extra three to four coats should also be applied around tapholes , sink cutouts and areas of heavy use or exposure . <p> Oils are best applied by using a lint-free cloth rather than a brush . A lint-free cloth is any form of material that will not deposit any particles on the wood - an old T-shirt is usually ideal . <p> Treated hardwood kitchen worktop <p> When applying the oil yourself , it is best to apply several thin coats rather than one thick application . Always work the oil into the worktop in the direction of the wood grain for best results.After applying the first coat , you will probably notice that some areas are wet and others dry . This is because the wood will absorb the oil at different degrees in different areas . Wait for 15minutes and then run the cloth over the entire surface again to ensure an even spread . Do not allow large pools of oil to dry on the surface . <p> Apply the second and third coats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying time in between coats . If the surface feels slightly rough in certain areas , or if you wish to develop a smoother surface , then we recommend that you apply a further coat of oil using either a green nylon scouring sponge or wire wool . <p> Worktops can be finely sanded between coats ( 120grit - 180grit ) . However , work surfaces should never be sanded finer than 180grit . To do so will prevent any future applications of oil from penetrating the surface . <h> Aftercare and Maintenance of an Oiled Worktop <p> Ongoing care and oiling of the timber brings out and enhances its appearance as well as protecting the wood surfaces from wear and tear . <p> Your new worktop should be treated with oil every week for the first six weeks , and at least once every three months thereafter . If you think your worktop needs oiling more regularly then feel free to apply as often as you like - you can not overdo it . This simple procedure will maintain the colour and lustre of your hardwood worktop and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always apply thin layers using a lint-free cloth and remove any excess oil after 10-15mins . <p> If a worktop is fitted over a Belfast type sink , oil should be applied monthly or whenever beading of water no longer occurs on the worktop surface . <p> Water spills and other liquids should always be mopped up immediately to prevent stains to the surface - especially during the first few weeks of installation . We advise keeping a tea towel handy solely for this purpose . <p> Worktops should be cleaned regularly using washing-up liquid and warm ( not hot ) water . Apply the water sparingly and wipe dry afterwards - water should never be left to stand on wooden surfaces for long periods . <h> Some Do 's and Don'ts <p> Never use multi-purpose cleaning products that contain chemical cleaning agents and especially avoid scouring powders . A green nylon scouring sponge can be used for cleaning purposes but the area may require re-oiling afterwards <p> Always use a chopping board for food preparation - cutting directly onto the worktop will damage the surface <p> Hot pans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto a wooden work surface - always use granite inserts , hot-rods , trivets , pan stands or heat-resistant mats to protect the worktop from scorch marks . Direct contact from iron , steel or copper vessels can also stain the timber surfaces and should therefore be avoided <h> Renovating or Repairing Damaged Wooden Worktops <p> If your worktop is damaged , or very badly in need of renovation , it can be sanded down with some fine sandpaper . For best results , slightly dampen the surface before sanding . For larger , more extensive damage/dents etc , coarser paper can be used but then graded down to fine for the final sanding . The oil is then applied as above . <p> Worktop oil is generally a natural product made from various vegetable oils , which , mostly , are solvent , free . <h> Oils Used for Worktop Treatment <p> The oils that can be used to treat wooden worktops include : <p> Danish Oil : Mixture of various oils such as Tung and Linseed . Danish oil provides great protection is by far the easiest oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found in China , parts of Africa and in some South American Countries . Tung Oil provides excellent protection but is more difficult to apply and requires a much greater drying time <p> Linseed Oil : Extracted from the seeds of the flax plant by steaming and crushing them . Raw linseed oil can be boiled to make the drying process faster . Linseed oil usually requires more applications than other oils as it dries out far quicker <p> Teak Oil : Mixture of natural oils from vegetable products <p> Remember never apply varnish or paint to a surface that may be used to prepare food and always use a chopping board on wooden worktops .

They will be please to offer help free of charge with no obligations . <h> Woodworm Treatment Advice and Woodworm Diagnosis <p> There are three types of woodworm beetle in the UK and we have pictured them below for easy identification and to help you diagnose the different types of infestation if you think you have woodworm evidence in your home . Pictured also is the damage each one causes to the timber , because it does differ for each different type of woodworm . <p> The Common Furniture Beetle which is what we normally refer to as woodworm . <p> Common Furniture Beetle larva <p> Common adult Furniture Beetle AKA Woodworm <p> Damaged caused to timber by common furniture beetle <p> The House Longhorn Beetle is rarer but much more destructive , more on this later in the project . <p> Longhorn Beetle larva <p> Adult Longhorn Beetle <p> Damaged caused by Longhorn beetle <p> Last but not least the Death-Watch Beetle , which is the one that sounds the worst ! We explain the process for treating this destructive beetle at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Damaged caused by Deathwatch beetle <p> The first thing you will notice is that they are all beetles and not worms at all . I think most people realise that the worm bit in woodworm refers to the larvae state when the beetle is a grub that looks more like a maggot , so is known as a wood ' worm ' . <h> How to Detect Active Woodworm <p> There is a common misconception that woodworm is inactive once the holes appear in the wood . While it means that that particular ' worm ' has grown up and left the nest as a beetle it does not mean there are not more in the wood , and in fact that same beetle may be back to lay its eggs starting the whole woodworm lifecycle off again . <p> So , how do you tell if the woodworm is active or not ? If the woodworm is still active there will be signs of droppings or frass , which looks like fine sawdust , around the affected area . <p> I remember carrying out work for a letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woodworm that was in the furniture that she lay in wait for confirmation of the beetles emerging so she could confront the landlord with it . Indeed she captured her evidence and brought it into the Letting Agent 's office in a jar , at which point the landlord had to agree to treat the woodworm ! <h> Common Furniture Beetle or Woodworm <p> If you see very small holes scattered across the surface of timber or furniture , you have evidence of woodworm . There are usually a cluster of holes and each hole is around 1-2mm wide . <p> As mentioned at the beginning , these holes are where the adult beetle has emerged from the wood after spending the primary part of their lifecycle as a larva within the wood . They are therefore known as emergence holes or exit holes . <p> While woodworm is in the larval state they tunnel their way through the wood . The damage they do is mainly cosmetic unless there is also damp in the wood , or the timber is very slender . Obviously it is still better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause for alarm if you find evidence of this common furniture beetle . <p> As the name suggests they are the most common species of woodworm . They attack softwood timber like pine but they are very at home in plywood and may stay within it for prolonged periods of time especially if the conditions are slightly damp . <p> Woodworm and Damp <p> While conditions do not need to be damp for woodworm to survive they will certainly thrive where the timber is moist . Therefore damp floorboards or loft timbers are prime real estate for woodworm , but of course they will also make a home in our furniture , and because this is under our noses we are more likely to spot woodworm damage in furniture . <p> Beetles are most likely to choose untreated wood to lay their eggs so you are most likely to find woodworm in furniture where the polish or finish has worn off , and where it is kept in damp conditions . However the woodworm will live in other conditions , so do n't discount it just because the conditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in furniture but you have other timber in the house that makes a better home for the beetles to lay their eggs they will find it ! So it is much better to treat when you see evidence of woodworm . <p> Many contractors use a chemical called Permethrin but this has unpleasant vapours and smells and it is also hazardous to other insects and even mammals , which is a consideration if you have bats in your belfry . Bats are a protected species and it would be illegal to carry out work or treatments that would cause harm or disturbance to roosting bats , so bear this in mind if you are treating woodworm in your loft or attic . <p> Normal Treatment <p> If you are using powder dilute a 5% solution and apply two coats of the Boron Ultra 12 by brush or spray . Allow each coat to dry before applying the next . <p> The 1kg bag pictured above dilutes in water to make 25 litres of Boron treatment at 5% solution . This should be applied until the area is fully wetted but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately four square metres per litre of solutions . <p> Make sure you wear a dust mask and gloves , and avoid splashing the solution on bare skin . <p> Preparing the Boron Solution <p> The Boron Ultra 12 powder can be dissolved at the following rates to treat the following areas . Use our Handy Preparation Table below <p> Quantity <p> Makes <p> Covers ( in 2 coats ) <p> 100 grams <p> 2.5 litres <p> 5 Square Metres <p> 200 grams <p> 5 litres <p> 10 Square Metres <p> 500 grams <p> 12.5 litres <p> 25 Square Metres <p> 1 Kg <p> 25 litres <p> 50 Square Metres <p> 2.5 Kgs <p> 62.5 litres <p> 125 Square Metres <p> For commercial use the Boron Ultra 12 can be mixed and used at 10% solution , which is useful where infestation is heavier . For DIY use see Heavy Infestations below . <p> Boron Gel treatment is available from Property Repair Systems for DIY purposes as a 5% solution and for trade at 20% in quantities of 500ml , 1 litre and 2 litres . See the table below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush liberally to the affected area , but do not leave excess on the timber as it can crystallise .

This is known as the re-entry time The guideline is set by the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) . <p> Caution <p> While pets , birds and fish are not at risk from Boron-based preservatives , Permethrin-based woodworm treatments can be harmful to pets . It is absolutely lethal to fish even in minute quantities . Permethrin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high street stores . <h> House Longhorn Beetle Woodworm <p> For those of you who do not live in Surrey you will be pleased to know that the House Longhorn Beetle ( Hylotrupes Bajulus ) is not very common in the UK . <p> If you do live in Surrey and you have woodworm you should be very careful to make sure you get correct diagnosis of your woodworm . <p> Where the House Longhorn Beetle is in evidence it prefers roof timbers and only attacks softwoods . Unlike the Common Furniture Beetle the larvae of this species causes holes and tunnels in the wood that are much bigger than the furniture beetle and infestation does cause severe structural damage to the timbers . <h> Woodworm Treatment - House Longhorn Beetle <p> Do not attempt to treat infestations of the house Longhorn Beetle as a DIY task . As it is so destructive it should only be handled by a professional who can advise on the structural damage caused as well as the treatment necessary . <p> For a qualified Timber Treatment company you can find your nearest PCA Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with details for your nearest registered member . Call them on 01626 336180 . <h> Death Watch Beetle Woodworm <p> Death Watch Beetle sounds so terrible but in fact it is not a serious as a Longhorm Beetle infestation . <p> Death Watch Beetle is relatively common in Southern England , whereas the North of England and Scotland are largely unaffected . It tends to infest hardwoods such as elm and oak . Imported timbers are more likely to be attacked , with French Oak being a particular delicacy for the beetles . However once it is over here it will also lay eggs in softwoods . <p> This woodworm prefers its timber to be damp and even wet . It is especially happy if there is also fungal decay ( wet rot ) in the timber too . Funny what sort of home some species like is n't it ? So to truly thrive this beetle wants conditions that you would not want in your house in any event , so it is not a very common pest for that reason . <p> Unlike the Common Furniture Beetle this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more difficult . The Death Watch Beetle is also much more destructive while it is feeding on the timber and can cause severe structural damage to timber including large structural timbers . <h> Woodworm Treatment - Death Watch Beetle <p> The feeding patterns of the Death Watch Larva will leave sections of the timber hollow so to find out which areas need treating tap or ' Sound ' the timber with a hammer . <p> You will be able to hear the difference between solid timber and any hollow sections . <p> Test these hollow areas by drilling into the affected areas with an 8 - 10mm diameter auger , so you can establish the parameters of the infestation . <p> When you have worked out where you need to treat you can inject Boron Ultra Paste into the affected areas . <p> The guide is also provided in the treatment kit from PRS provided with the Boron Ultra Paste . See below for an example of the pattern of holes to be drilled to ensure even treatment : <p> Example of a Drilling Guide for Treating Timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fill the holes you have drilled with Boron Ultra Paste . Making sure the hole is completely full from the bottom to the top , using an extension tube ( see below ) . Cap off the hole with a timber dowel or plastic cap . Remove any excess paste with a cloth to prevent crystals forming . <p> Using special extension fitted to tube to fill the holes with Boron Paste Gel from Property Repair Systems <p> Treat the Surface <p> Once any paste left on the surface is dry , brush on two coats of Boron Ultra Gel to all affected areas . Apply the gel onto sound timber by at least 300mm all the way around the area that was subject to attack . Allow each coat to dry in between coats . <p> Monitor <p> Because the lifecycle of the Death Watch Beetle is so long , you should continue to check for infestation on an annual basis for at least ten years . <p> If you spot signs of activity you will need to re-apply any treatment where necessary using the above pointers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with Death Watch Beetle , you do need to get the treatment into the core of the timber .

The washing machine will be connected to this run of cold pipe as it needs mains pressure to work properly . The mains pressure of the cold water is much greater than that of the hot water and we can use this greater pressure to push any air locks back to the hot water storage tank . <p> Disconnect the cold water hose from the back of the washing machine ( Turn the valve off first ) .

Now check the flow from the hot tap at the kitchen sink and the air should have been dispelled . If not repeat above . If , after 3 attempts , the problem is still there , please contact a plumber from our directory ( Locate a specialist ) . There may be a problem with your system . <p> If your washing machine only has the cold connected , another way of utilising the higher cold pressure to clear an air lock is by connecting the cold tap to the hot tap .

In order to get maximum value from your brushes you should clean the paint from them after use . This project explains how you can care for your brushes and remove old oil or water based paint from the bristles or look after them over night so they are ready for use the following morning . <p> Cleaning and restoring paint brushes can be a real chore but life can be put back into those expensive brushes you thought you would have to throw away . To get maximum value from your brushes you can follow the instructions below . <p> Cleaning brushes immediately after use is the best option if possible , but if you are continually using the same brushes during the day , with breaks only for lunch and tea , then remove as much surplus paint as possible and wrap the brush in cling film . Stopping the air getting to the bristles will allow them to stay workable for quite some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get as much paint out as possible by brushing it on newspaper , wiping with a rag and pushing the brush hard against the edge of the paint pot and sqeezing out as much paint as possible . You can even lay the brush flat on the newspaper and push down the length of the bristles with a paint scraper . <p> Rinse any water based paints under a running tap . Slightly warm water is best and work your fingers through the bristles as you flush . A drop of fairy liquid will not hurt and the water should be crystal clear before you finish . <p> When you have been using oil based paints , put on some household rubber gloves and tip some white spirit into a paint kettle or bowl . Put the brush in and work the white spirit into the bristles well . Repeat in clean white spirit until it remains fairly clear . Only a little white spirit is needed in the bottom of the bowl or kettle but remember white spirit is cheaper than good paint brushes . When you are sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , soapy water , work the bristles thoroughly and finally rinse out under a warm tap . Shake as much of the water out as possible and run the brush gently up and down a sheet of newspaper . Wrap the brush , in its natural shape , in 5 or six sheets of newspaper thickness and hold together with an elastic band . <p> If a brush has been left for a long time then it should be soaked in brush restorer ( See directions on the restorer ) until soft , then the above instructions should be applied . <p> Different paints can be removed as follows : <p> Cellulose : Amyl acetate , bought from the chemist will act as well as the more expensive , off the shelf , acetone <p> Varnish : Methylated spirits <p> Rubber : Petrol <p> Polyurethane : Paraffin or white spirit <p> Oil : Paraffin or white spirit <p> Washable distemper : Weak solution of vinegar <p> Always double check the cleaning instructions on the paint you are using , and once the brush is clean , lay flat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stand your brushes on their bristles even if in water for re-use on the next painting session . Drill a small hole through the handle and pass some string through to hang them .

Special cleaning aids are available which clip into an electric drill and " spin " the surplus paint out .... Take some time to look around at the various products available , they generally work out cheaper than buying new brushes all of the time . <p> Please remember to dispose of any used brush cleaning fluids in a sensible manner .

We also explain what products can then be used to ensure that no damp issues return in the future and your chimney repair job is a complete success ! <p> A damp chimney breast problem can present itself in a number of different ways and for a number of different reasons . Some signs include brown plaster staining on your chimney breast or you might have damp patches on your chimney breast that come and go . <p> Other visual signs can be a damp chimney breast and ceiling , damp walls either side of your chimney breast , damp in your loft or attic space around the chimney area or even damp halfway up a chimney breast . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this project well help you diagnose what 's causing it and guide you through the steps to resolve the problem for a successful damp cure or chimney repair . <p> If after reading this guide you still need some further assistance , please call Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 and they will be more than pleased to help you out . <p> Damp chimney breast issues are normally caused , diagnosed and fixed in a similar manner to ordinary damp issues , but with a few subtle differences and potential causes . Due to the job that a chimney does , namely removing smoke , fumes and soot from heating sources ( fuel burning etc. ) the particles and by-products of this can cause their own damp problems to appear in or on the chimney . Its a good idea to firstly establish that you have a damp problem at all , and this can be done in two ways : <p> For a reasonably accurate measurement of the moisture content in your chimney breast you can use what 's called a " Damp Meter " . The meter itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick the prongs into the damp area and on the face of the meter it will show a percentage of damp content in that area . You can buy a range of damp meters and hygrometers here <p> Relative Humidity Hygrometer This is a piece of kit that can be used to test the moisture content of the air inside your room , which can be useful in helping you to understand which moisture source is causing your damp . <p> Back of Hand Another method is to use the back of your hand to firstly check the affected chimney area and then reference it against an unaffected dry area . Use your judgement to assess how damp the area is . <p> You can insert a damp meter into your wall to test for damp and moisture content <p> Before you can go about putting right any damage caused by the damp in your chimney you will first have to ensure that the source leak/moisture point is located and repaired . If the origin of the issue is not completely fixed then any repairs will be short lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damage and also any funds spent , as a few months later you will just have to do it all over again . <p> Your checks will have to be thorough as what 's causing your damp chimney can in some situations be a little hard to spot , and of course it might even be more than one issue . Below you will find a list of items and areas to look at . <p> You may be thinking that some of the chimneys features are going to be hard to see without physically climbing onto your roof and you would be right ! If you do indeed have the correct ladders , the correct knowledge of where to step as to not cause any further damage , know how to use a ladder safely ( see our ladder safety project for details ) and have the confidence to climb on to your roof then it is best do this , but if you do not have ALL of the aforementioned skills and items then do not attempt this as you will likely cause damage to your roof and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get up onto your roof then borrow or hire a decent set of binoculars as these will allow you to view your chimney almost as well . <h> Damp Chimney Breast Causes What to Check <p> Open or Capped Chimney Stack <p> The first thing to check here is to see if your chimney stack or chimney pots are open-topped or capped . If they are open-topped and your chimney is not in use there is the chance that moisture is entering through here and travelling to the base of your stack , causing damp in your chimney . The tell-tale signs of this are damp around the base of the chimney breast , as the moisture rises up from the inside . This can make it seem like a DPC ( damp proof course ) problem but in fact the issue is coming from the top as opposed to the bottom . <p> The best way to check that this is the problem is to remove a brick from the base of the chimney breast and access the inside to see if there is moisture present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding a vented cap or cowl to your chimney pots and seeing if this resolves the issue . For a cheaper option , you can instead remove your pots and add a paving slab on top of the stack instead , raising it up on all sides by about 2-3 inches to provide ventilation . If you 're planning on using the chimney in the future , cowls are a better option . If there is debris in your chimney breast clear this at the same time as this may be causing DPC bridging . <p> Similarly , if your chimney pots or stack are capped and sealed at the top , are they ventilated ? ( i.e. is there a sealed cap or mortar covering the top of the pot ? ) If not then this could be causing condensation to build up in the chimney stack due to cold air being trapped in the void , meaning that when your house warms up , condensation then collects to form damp on the chimney breast surface . Again , the way to remedy this is to replace your caps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a raised paving slab directly on top of your chimney stack . <p> Add cowls to your chimney pots to shield against rain and add ventilation <p> Chimney Stack Mortar <p> Is the mortar around your chimney stack or at the base of each pot in good condition where it enters the chimney ? Can you see any splits or cracks in the mortar ? If you can see cracks then there is the chance that water or moisture is entering through here and either running down the inside of the stack causing damp in the chimney stack itself or then running out of mortar cracks inside your property and causing damp issues on your chimney breast this way . Even if this is not the root cause of your issue , its certainly not helping so will need repointing to prevent future problems . <p> Mortar missing from your chimney stack can allow damp to enter <p> Shared Chimney <p> Do you share a chimney with your next door neighbours ? If so then there is the chance that any work that they have carried out is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word burner without inserting the correct flue or they may have blocked up internal ventilation . Have a polite chat and ask them to confirm any work they have carried out relating to the chimney area , even going back a few years as occasionally chimney damp issues take quite some time to become apparent . <p> In the event that they have carried out some work on the chimney and it looks like this may be the cause of your damp issues you will have to come to an agreement on how it is fixed . Be as amicable as possible as there is huge potential for disagreements , especially where money is concerned . <h> Check Your Roof Area Around the Chimney Stack <p> Lead Flashing <p> The lead flashing used on your roof is effectively there to seal any joints around the roof where it meets a wall or a chimney stack . Check to see if the lead used to seal your roof to your chimney stack is cracked , coming away from the surface or looks in poor condition . Typically lead is lapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuous run , and over time these joints can become weak and split , or in fact the lead itself can become weak and crack . <p> You should also check whether inside your roof space you can see any day light coming in around the stack this is where the lead has failed . You should also check inside your roof for any signs of water leakage or a build-up of a white salt-like substance ( hygroscopic salts ) as this could indicate flashing failure . <p> Check that your chimney flashing is in good condition <p> Typically lead is used in flashing because it is very malleable ( easy to shape ) , long lasting , low maintenance , good with extremes in temperature and is relatively wind resistant . All of these features help to prevent the penetration of water via wind pressure , gravity and also tension on a surface . <p> Although lead has quite a few advantages in terms of sealing it can be very expensive and as you might imagine there are now quite a few substitutes available on the market that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to flashing there is no better substance than lead itself . <p> If you find that your lead is damaged then it will need either replacing or repairing . As mentioned replacement could be very expensive but to ensure a proper fix this is your best option ( more information in our Chimney Flashing project ) . If due to the cost this is not an option , you can buy " Flashing Tape " from most builders merchants or your local DIY store . In the past we have used flashing tape from Sylglas which we have found to be rather good . <p> You can then stick the tape over the split or crack to seal it more information on how to use flashing tape to carry out this repair is available in our Repairing Lead Flashing Project page . <p> Sealers ( silicone etc. ) can also be used to seal any other small gaps but as said most of these substitutes are no match for using lead and doing the job properly . <p> Guttering <p> Broken or blocked gutters can cause rainwater to filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your chimney . <p> If you have a broken gutter , in heavy downpours water can run down the face of a wall and seep into any splits or cracks in mortar , presenting as damp in your chimney breast . If you live in an area where rain is common then the sheer act of lots of water running down your walls can over time can cause also cause your chimney to become damp as water can be physically sucked into it ( by capillary action ) . <p> You should also take note of whether your guttering downpipes drain away from the property or they simply create a huge puddle right next wall , as this may also be causing your damp issues . <p> Inspect your guttering for any splits or cracks , poor joints on any down pipes or broken brackets ( sections of guttering can sag and cause joints to fail when you have broken or faulty brackets ) . <p> Inspect your guttering for cracks and faults which could be exposing your walls to moisture and damp <p> Damaged Tiles <p> As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems including damp in your chimney . Tiles are used to create a watertight covering for your roof , and if one or more become damaged or dislodged then this can give moisture and damp a direct route into your property . <p> In some cases the damp issues on your chimney breast are quite a distance away from the actual source of the leak so make sure you check the quality of your tiles across your entire roof . <p> If you find you have any split , broken or missing tiles then the best course of action is to replace the tile with a new one . Replacing a tile can be a bit of a tricky job so it may be best to bite the bullet and call in a roofer . <p> Broken roof tiles can allow damp into your roof timbers <h> Inspect the Chimney Breast Itself to Identify the Cause of the Damp <p> Ventilation ( capped or sealed chimneys and bricked up fireplaces ) <p> The ventilation for a blocked up fireplace can usually be found on the wall in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor ( occasionally in properties with an under-floor void , the vent will be under the floor as this helps to reduce draughts ) . To find out more about closing off or blocking up a fireplace , have a look at this project . <p> When a chimney is capped and blocked up or an internal fireplace is bricked up this then removes some of the original ventilation , and if this is not compensated for then this can create condensation and then damp issues within the chimney stack or on the face of the chimney stack e.g. in your loft space . <p> A poorly ventilated sealed chimney can cause new chimney damp issues in the form of condensation build up or in some cases make existing damp issues worse . The chimney should be vented at both the top and the bottom . This then prevents cold air from being trapped in the chimney void as air is still allowed to flow through the chimney . <p> Any capping , sealing or bricking up that a chimney has had should itself be ventilated . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your chimney pots or by adding a paving slab directly on top of your chimney stack this will need to be raised by about 2 or 3 inches to allow air to circulate . Ventilating your chimney top can be a little tricky as it will involve you climbing onto your roof and fixing the vented cap , cowl or slab to the chimney stack . You may need the services of a roofer to do this . <p> Add a vented cap or cowl to your chimney pot to increase ventilation <p> You can ventilate a blocked up fireplace by adding an airbrick or vent to the wall in front of the fireplace this can be added to the wall about 300mm up from floor level or you can add it below your floor if there is an underfloor space to minimise draughts in your living area . <p> The addition of air bricks and vents is a little easier than adding ventilation to your chimney top . To do this you will need to remove a brick or bricks from the chimney breast or bricked up fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation within the chimney void ( a link to our Removing a brick project can be found above ) This should help minimise any damp in your chimney breast that has been caused by poor ventilation . <p> Add an air brick or vent to your blocked up fireplace to add ventilation at the bottom of your chimney <p> Wood Burning Stove/Gas Stove not functioning properly <p> If you have a wood burning or gas stove in use you have to ensure that the chimney is correctly lined . The act of burning fuels ( wood , gas etc. ) can create massive quantities of water vapour that progresses up the chimney stack , getting cooler as it moves upwards . If your chimney is not correctly lined then this will be allowed to rest on the inside of the stack , condense on the colder areas towards its top and form condensation , potentially causing damp in your chimney breast . <p> In this case any issues should be more evident towards the top of the chimney stack as opposed to near the base , and will in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt crystal build-up or brown plaster staining on your chimney breast . <p> NOTE : Burning fuels produces fumes that can be potentially fatal if not removed from the property correctly or if there insufficient air within a room space . This can cause a potentially fatal amount of Carbon Monoxide to build up , so please take precautions to minimise the level of fumes present in your living space . <p> If you are suffering from damp issues in your chimney area and you have either a wood or gas burning stove installed then get your flue inspected right away ! ! There may be no issue with the flue and the cause may be poor ventilation up the chimney stack itself , but do not chance it - get it inspected now . You can find a qualified engineer to check that your chimney is working correctly over on the National Association of Chimney Engineers website . <p> Damp Proof Course <p> Does your chimney breast have a DPC ( Damp Proof Course layer of slate or plastic between brick courses about 6 inches above ground level ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DPC around the chimney breast . If you do n't  have a DPC around your chimney breast and water and moisture gets inside the stack and is allowed to sit at the base , or the ground beneath your chimney breast is damp , then this damp can rise up into the walls of your chimney breast ( rising damp ) . <p> Check that your chimney breast has a DPC if not its a good idea to insert one <p> You will need to drill some holes into the brick of the chimney breast at 6 inches up from ground level and inject a damp proofing cream using either a skeleton gun or a manual pump . <p> This cream soaks into the brick and the chemicals in it join up with one another to form a waterproof layer in the brickwork your new DPC . We tend to use DPC cream from Property Repair Systems as we 've found it to produce the best results for retrospectively adding a damp proof course . <p> Inject a DPC cream into your chimney breast <p> Another cause of your chimney damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is where rubbish and debris within the chimney or surrounding cavities rises above the level of the DPC in your chimney breast this can give moisture a direct route around the DPC and up into the chimney breast , causing damp in your chimney . Make sure that any debris has been removed to make sure this is n't causing the damp problem . <h> Visual Signs of Chimney Breast Damp and How to Repair Them <p> In the section below you will find a description of a variety of visual ways that damp around a chimney breast can manifest itself and how each of these can be diagnosed and fixed : <p> Issue - If you have yellow or brown stains or marks that are appearing on ceilings that join to your chimney breast and spreading outwards then you may have a water leak . Check the flashing on your roof around the chimney stack for splits and cracks and repair or replace your flashing if required as mentioned above . <p> You should also access your loft space and check the chimney breast and see if its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged pointing that needs repairing or possibly even open chimney pots that could do with a chimney cowl being added to prevent the rain from entering whilst allowing ventilation . Note that the issue of rain entering chimney pots is only an issue if your chimney is not in use , as an active chimney will evaporate this moisture . Also be aware that just because there is no evidence of a leak around the immediate chimney area , water or moisture may be getting in and running along to the chimney area to form damp so ensure that your checks are thorough ! <p> Open chimney pots may be allowing rainwater to enter your chimney <p> In the event that you cant find any evidence of water or moisture penetration then another damp problem inherent to chimneys and the areas around chimneys is the presence of hygroscopic salts ( sometimes known as Chimney Salts ) . These are usually deposited as a result of burning fuels . <p> As we all know fuels generally come from the ground ( e.g. coal , wood etc . ) . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb salt minerals , sulphates , nitrates etc . When the materials are burnt these salts and minerals are released and settle on the inside of the chimney . Over a period of years these salts can then penetrate through the brick or block-work of your chimney breast and onto your inner walls . <p> The salts themselves are hygroscopic ( moisture attracting ) and when present on your chimney area they attract the moisture within a room space and can create damp patches on your chimney breast . Any staining caused on these patches , in most cases , is the result of soot and other particles that have also managed to creep through the wall over a period of years and this is also occasionally due to the type of room e.g. kitchens with generally high humidity from cooking where water vapour can contain food particles . <p> Another typical indicator of hygroscopic salt contamination is the fact that the damp patches will in most cases be more apparent during wet weather or more humid conditions . <p> Hygroscopic salts can present as white staining on chimney breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with varying degrees of difficulty . Most of the internal walls of a house are plastered and once damp and moisture have been allowed to sit on or penetrate into a plastered surface for a period of time ( including plasterboard ) , that surface will never be the same again . It will all need to be removed and you will have to re-plaster from scratch . <p> Before you can re-plaster you will have to deal with the salt issue itself . Remove all the damp plaster from the affected chimney area and any surrounding areas and take it right back to the bare wall behind . Allow the wall to dry out thoroughly , giving it as much time as is required , in some case this can be several months . Decent ventilation , fans and a dehumidifier will help . <p> Once your wall is as dry as it can be , you will then need to apply a salt neutralizer ( allowing to dry and penetrate in accordance to manufacturers guidelines ) . There are quite a few available on the market with varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt neutralizer from Property Repair Systems . <p> You can also get salt neutralisers that are already in the plaster you use to replaster your wall or they can be added to the plaster . Once all is dry and treated you can now go ahead and replaster your chimney area and redecorate as required . <p> Use a salt neutraliser to stop salts from appearing in your wall <p> In very extreme situations where the salt contamination is extensive it may also be necessary to apply an Air Gap Membrane . This is a lining membrane ( supplied on rolls similar to wallpaper ) that is fixed over the walls surface after you have applied salt neutraliser . The membrane then acts as a barrier preventing any further salts from penetrating through . We also have used the Mesh Membrane from Property Repair Systems which works well . <p> Apply a mesh membrane to your wall to be sure that salts wont reappear on your wall <p> In the event that your original chimney breast plaster survives and dries out okay through the use of ventilation , fans or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing it . Apply the aforementioned salt neutralizer to the plaster surface ( after stripping any wallpaper or paint ) and allow it to dry ( following manufacturers guidelines ) correctly you may need to give it up to a few weeks ! Once dry you can then redecorate again but beware this may be a short lived fix . Ultimately the best course of action is to knock all the plaster off and do the job properly ! <p> Stains and Marks around the Base of Chimney Breast ( Rising Damp ) : <p> Issue If you have damp patches that appear just above your skirting boards that appear no higher up the wall than about 1.5m then the chances are that you have rising damp . There are several different potential causes of this the first being that you may not have a DPC ( damp proof course ) installed into your chimney breast . As mentioned above some older chimney breasts do not have a Damp Proof Course installed . To check this access the area around the chimney breast from inside and outside if possible - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it then the chances are that you do not have one , although it may be worth a second opinion from a reliable tradesman . <p> Another issue could be that the DPC is being bridged . During the build process or over time , rubbish and debris can collect in the base of the chimney stack or in adjacent cavities and any moisture or water that descends down can seep up through the rubbish , allowing it to travel around the DPC and back up into the wall creating the damp in your chimney breast . To check whether this is occurring you will need to remove one or two bricks and access the chimney breast to have a look inside it for any debris do not remove more than two bricks without consulting a reliable tradesman or property surveyor . <p> Brown stains on your lower wall are a sign of rising damp <p> Fix If you have found that you do not in fact have a Damp Proof Course in your chimney breast then it is a good idea to add one . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches up from ground level and injecting a chemical cream DPC into the holes . This is absorbed into the brick to form a waterproof chemical layer in the brickwork . There are quite a few DIY chemical DPC kits available today that can be quite cheap and easily to install by anyone with a bit of DIY knowledge There are quite a few products of this type on the market , one we tend to use is mentioned above . <p> Once the Damp Proof Course has been added to your chimney breast you will have to allow the area to dry out thoroughly for as long as needed . Depending on how bad the damage to plaster , wallpaper etc is you may then need to remove it all and then replaster and redecorate . If there are any white salt deposits present , be sure to add a salt neutraliser as mentioned above . <p> In the case that you have debris and rubbish in the chimney breast void the only choice is to clean it out . After removing one or two bricks ( do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission of a reliable surveyor or builder ) . <p> Using a torch , mobile phone , video camera etc. get some images of inside the breast . If debris is present , clean it out thoroughly wearing tough gloves to protect your hands from any sharp objects and allow it to dry properly . You can then replace the bricks and redecorate . Also confirm that water is not being allowed to access through the stack or pots . If water is entering your chimney pots this way , simply add some chimney cowls to your chimney pots these stop the rainwater ingress whilst allowing ventilation . <p> Inject your cream DPC into the holes you have drilled in your chimney breast <p> Plaster Blowing off Walls or White Salts Present on Surfaces <p> Issue If you are suffering from very bad damp issues in your chimney , then in most cases this will cause some damage to the plaster as plaster once applied to walls and dried does not mix well with water . This means that any of the damp causes above could be causing your plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster damage then this is most likely down to a water leak so you will have to use the checks listed above to trace and find the leak and fix it . <p> Have a good look inside your roof for possible leaks <p> If you have a white , salt-like staining present on plastered surfaces or even on bare brick or block surfaces then the damp you are seeing could be down to an extreme case of Hygroscopic Salts as mentioned above , so also be aware of this if you are unable to find any leaks . Hygroscopic salts are deposits created as a result of burning fuel in your fireplace these can travel to the surface of your chimney breast . <p> Hygroscopic Salts attract moisture in the air within a room and create visible damp patches or make the surface damp to touch . These patches usually come and go . <p> If the salty deposits you 're seeing are crunching and stand out from the wall , these as deposits known as salts . These are created when water in your damp wall evaporates on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can erupt through your plaster , blowing it off the wall . <p> Salts can blow plaster off your walls <p> Fix - Once you have resolved the cause of the damp ( and either fixed the leak source or established that its down to a salt issue ) remove all the damaged plaster from the chimney area and any affected surrounding areas ( if any ) and allow to dry thoroughly for as long as needed . <p> If the cause is leakage , once dried out correctly you can replaster and then redecorate , but if the damp was caused by hygroscopic salts or you had salt deposits present then you will need to first add salt neutralizer to the walls surface to prevent any further salts penetrating through . Strip back your plaster to the wall you can then either add your salt neutraliser directly to the wall or add it to your replastering plaster you can also get plaster mixes with a salt neutraliser already added . We use the salt neutraliser manufactured by PRS as we have found it to produce consistently good results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up you will also need to add a membrane to the wall 's surface before replastering to further prevent any future salt ingress ( as mentioned above ) . You can then replaster over the membrane . Once you have added the salt neutralizer ( and membrane if required ) and allowed it to dry ( following manufacturers guidelines ) you can then go ahead and plaster and redecorate your chimney area . More information on salt neutralizer and membrane can be found above . <p> If after examining the damp in your chimney area following the guidelines above you are still unsure about the cause of the damp and how to fix it give Property Repair Systems a call on 01626 336180 .

@@41624617 @1624617/ <p> Summary : Condensation on toilet cistern and pipework in bathrooms and how to solve condensation issues . In this guide you will learn about the most likely causes of condensation on toilet cisterns and pipework and also provide some handy tips on how to drastically reduce condensation buildup in high moisture and humidity areas such as the bathroom . <p> Condensation under toilet cisterns can cause unseen problems . The warm air in the bathroom hits the underside of the toilet cistern and cold water pipes and condenses immediately ( for more about this see our project on condensation ) . <p> DIY Doctor has devised a method of minimising condensation on toilet cisterns and cold water pipes . This is a huge problem for some houses and can lead to bathroom carpets and floorboards actually rotting from the constant drip of water from the water pipes and cisterns in the toilet or bathroom . <p> Once the floorboards are wet is is only a matter of time before the joists themselves begin to suffer and if you find yourself in this position you might want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have an excellent video on this page about replacing floorboards under a toilet . <p> Rotten bathroom floor under dripping cistern condensation <h> Problems With Cistern and Pipe Condensation in Modern Bathrooms <p> It seems to be a modern trend to put the toilet cistern out of site . This cistern can be hidden inside a false wall or have a purpose made boxing made around it to keep it out of sight . <p> While this makes the whole bathroom look much neater and tidier it can lead to huge problems if the toilet cistern and cold water pipes are not insulated . Condensation is far less dangerous when it can be seen and rectified but if it is happening out of sight , all sorts of damage can result . <h> How to Stop or Reduce Condensation on Toilet Cisterns and Water Pipes <p> Boxing in Pipes <p> Use boxing and insulation to warm cold water pipes <p> If the condensation problem exists in your bathroom or toilet , boxing in the pipes where ever possible can help . This might warm the water going into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipes and/or place insulation inside the boxing also . You can find out more about pipe boxing in this project . <p> The hot humid air from the room condenses on the colder water pipes and underside of cistern so any insulation you can use will make things better . Boxing on it 's own however can be dangerous as you can no longer see the condensation forming . Do n't forget to insulate as well as box in the pipes . <p> Adding Hot Water to Your Toilet Cistern <p> There are fittings available in the US called anti-sweat valves which can add a little hot water to your cistern when the cold water enters after you have flushed . This can be expensive and if it is a loo which is not used often , can be a complete waste . <p> This anti-sweat valve can be achieved by connecting your hot water basin or bath supply to the water feed as it enters the cistern . The hot feed should be controlled by an in line service valve ( such as that used on a washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of hot water mixing with the cold as it enters the cistern . <p> Remember , the cistern only needs to be at the same temperature as the air outside to avoid condensation . <p> The problem as mentioned above , is that , in any relatively small room , the air gets quite warm . Warm air carries moisture ( as stated in our condensation project linked above ) which will condense as soon as it hits a cooler surface . The toilet cistern , being full of cold water , is a cold surface as are the cold water pipes running to the cistern , the basin and the bath . <p> Add hot water to toilet cistern via a service valve <p> Ventilate the Toilet or Bathroom <p> The universal answer to condensation in bathrooms , whether it is on the cistern , the pipes or the tiled walls , is of course to ventilate the room to keep everything at a fairly equal temperature but the problem still exists in small bathrooms ; therefore we need to make the surface of the cistern warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Extractor fans will not only remove foul smells from the bathroom but circulate the air at the same time . This draws the hot air up to the fan where it can escape without condensing . <p> It is important to ensure you have some fresh air entering the bathroom regularly , as with every other room in the house . <p> Regular air changes avoid condensation much more easily than any other method . Opening the windows at least once a day is effective insurance against condensation . <p> The DIY Doctor Method for Curing Condensation on Toilet Cisterns <p> Buy a yoga mat ! They can often be bought at car boot sales and ( after the onslaught of new years resolutions regarding losing weight , getting fitter etc ) and websites like Ebay and Gumtree . Go for the thin , very dense kind . <p> Full details on our fix can be seen in the video below . <p> Firstly and most importantly , turn off the cold water via the isolation valve if you have one . If you do not , turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve for ease in the future . There is an excellent project , complete with video , on fitting and isolation valve here . <p> Use isolation valves to turn water off to toilet cistern <p> You can strip out the contents of your cistern , or simply work around them . Flush the cistern to remove as much water as you can then , and using a sponge or rags etc , wipe out the cistern until it is completely dry . Then use a hairdryer to warm up the inside . <p> Toilet cistern condensation countered with a yoga mat <p> Flush the toilet cistern out as much as possible . <p> Get to the cistern parts by removing the flush unit <p> Remove any removable parts , such as the flush unit , from the cistern . By the way it is not a very difficult job to remove the toilet completely , dismantle it and work in comparative ease . See the video on replacing a toilet in this project here to see how this can be done . Sponge out last of water and dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be removed from toilet cisterns <p> Cut the yoga mat into sections which will fit on the inside of the cistern and stick them in place using a suitable waterproof glue or sealant . We advocate the use of a sealant called Forever White which is excellent for this purpose . <p> Cutting yoga mat to line toilet cistern <p> The inside of the cistern needs to be completely dry for this to work properly . Make sure none of the mat fouls any of the moving parts of the cistern . <p> Using sealant as anti condensation on toilet cistern <p> When your toilet cistern is lined it should look a little like this . Leave it for 8 to 10 hours for the sealant cure completely . <p> Safeguard against condensation by lining your toilet cistern with an old Yoga mat <p> The yoga mat acts as insulation on the inside of the tank which gives the outside an opportunity to warm up . The cold water within the cistern will find it 's way between the walls of the cistern and the inside of the yoga mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will keep the outside of the cistern warmer . <p> It is vital therefore , that you use a sealant which will definitely hold the yoga mat in place . There is just no point in using a cheap sealant at the yoga mat will come unstuck which will not only allow your cistern to start sweating condensation again , but it could foul the moving parts of the toilet . <h> Avoiding Condensation on Cold Water Pipes <p> Cold water pipes are , obviously , colder than the warm , humid air in the bathroom and as such are prone to just as much condensation as the cistern itself . This problem can be effectively reduced in a couple of ways other than the boxing in method we spoke about at the top of the page . <p> Method 1 is to lag the pipes in the bathroom just as you would if they were in the loft . There is not always the room for this underneath a toilet cistern but if there is the lagging can be disguised by painting it the same colour as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15mm pipe lagging <p> Method 2 takes up a lot less room but is not quite so effective . It is however , considerably more attractive ! The tubes in the image are called pipe snaps and they are pre-curled strips of plastic which can be cut to length easily as shown in the video . They simply clip over the pipe and make it just a touch warmer and less prone to condensation <p> White pipe snaps to hide and warm copper pipe 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Understand the benefits and when you can use these different wall coverings . <p> Those with a textured or embossed surface . These types of covering are usually designed to be painted over after they have been applied to the wall . <h> Printed Paper <p> This is exactly what it says on the tin - Paper with a printed design that in some cases can be slightly textured or embossed following the same lines as the design or it may even have a surface texture applied during its manufacture . Cheaper variations of this may be rather difficult to hang as they are prone to tearing and stretching . <p> The more expensive types , including hand printed , are a lot better in this respect , but you have to be careful during the hanging process to avoid getting paste on the face of the paper . Largely regarded as the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using 2 bonded sheets of paper . <p> All of these types can be wiped clean and are also quite easy to strip if needed . <h> Washable Wallpaper <p> This type of paper is similar to Printed Paper but has a thin clear plastic coat applied to it during manufacture . This then makes it water and stain resistant . The plastic coating can withstand sponging and washing ( gentle rubbing but not scrubbing or use of abrasives ) . <p> As with printed wallpapers , these can also be textured or embossed . These paper types are ideal for steamy conditions such as bathrooms or kitchens . <p> The main drawback with this type of paper is that it is rather difficult to remove due to the plastic coating preventing water penetrating and softening the paste . However , scoring or marking the paper can aid with this . <h> Vinyl Wall Coverings <p> This form of paper consists of a plastic film onto which the design is printed . As with the other paper types this can also be textured or embossed and in some cases a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this creates a wall covering that is much tougher and hard wearing than a washable paper . Stains and marks can be scrubbed and removed , only if the paper is hung correctly in that you have to be careful not to lift the seams through over soaking . <p> Many of these papers come ready pasted and due to their plastic layer are extremely easy to strip , leaving the paper backing on the wall . <p> Ideal applications include hallways , landings , children 's rooms and staircases and any areas that are prone to brushing and scraping due to their hardwearing nature . <p> Due to the above advantages , these paper types tend to be much more expensive than the first two types . <h> Foamed Vinyl Wall Coverings <p> The main characteristic of these paper types are that their surfaces are aerated with tiny bubbles to produce a slightly cushioned feel . <p> They may also feature heavy textures or embossing of the surface that in some cases imitate materials like wood grain . These paper types are also warm to the touch thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which also makes them an ideal choice for spaces that are prone to condensation . <h> Flock Wall Coverings <p> These paper types are generally either printed papers or more of a vinyl that feature a very characteristic raised pile effect , generally made of fine wool or silk fibres on paper types and generally synthetic fibres on vinyl types . This very closely resembles a velvet texture to the touch . <p> The paper types have to be hung with great care as they are rather delicate , but the vinyl types are extremely tough and hardwearing and need slightly less care . <h> Foamed Polythene <p> This type is very distinctive in that it does not feature a paper backing . Instead , to hang this type of paper , firstly you paste the wall and then apply the covering to it , brushing the covering into position as required . <p> The lack of backing makes this paper very light and also means that the surface can be washed , but it is rather fragile so rough scrubbing is to be avoided . <p> Removing the covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped from the wall . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Damp patches on internal walls of your home can be a real pain , not only due to the fact you get ugly looking marks on your walls but also the fact that moisture and damp patches on walls can also produce mould . This can in turn be detrimental to your health , as mould spores have been linked to quite a few issues such as asthma and allergies - so its not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you require some additional assistance after reading this project guide please contact Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 for further advice free of charge . <p> Its also a good point to note that if you do have damp on your internal walls then the fact that it is there will make a room feel colder and more uncomfortable to be in damp walls lose heat three times faster than dry walls . <p> The reason for you getting damp on your inside walls can be various and in most situations the cause of the internal damp will either come from the top of the house ( roof area ) or from the bottom ( ground area ) , however there are occasions when the damp can come from the walls themselves . <p> We will now go through the most common causes of damp appearing on internal walls and also cover some methods for stopping the damp from entering your walls . <h> First Assess Whether Your Damp Wall Area is Actually Damp <p> The first task you will have to carry out is to assess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can be done two ways : <p> Back of Hand Although not the most accurate way to measure damp on your walls it will give you a good idea of how bad the damp actually is . Touch the back of your hand against the damp area and gauge the level of dampness . Now touch the back of your hand against a dry area on the wall and compare the two . This will give you an idea as to how bad the damp on your wall actually is <p> Damp Meter These are handy little gadgets that feature two prongs on the base and a level indicator on the front . Stick the two prongs into your damp wall surface and leave for a while . The level indicator on the front will then display the percentage of damp within the walls surface . <p> Another handy instrument is a Relative Humidity Hygrometer . Position it in a room and the reading on the front will give you the moisture content level inside the room space . This is quite useful in situations when you are experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an initial reading and then monitor the drop in moisture as you implement fixes to resolve any damp issues . More information on testing your walls is available on PRS website , along with a range of damp testing solutions available to buy . <p> If you do detect damp , do n't  rush to treat it without finding the cause first , as this greatly affects what you need to do to treat your damp effectively and what tools and materials you 'll need to buy . <h> How To Find the Cause of Your Internal Damp and How To Fix it <p> Penetrating Damp <p> Cracks in walls and Mortar or Render Whether this is the cause of your internal damp issue or not , this is still a problem ! ! If you have cracked mortar in your walls or chimney stack then water and moisture has the potential to enter your property and cause untold damp and rot damage . <p> Mortar joints missing from a brick wall can allow water to get in and make internal walls damp <p> If it is allowed to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then these can rot out and cost a small fortune to put right . <p> Check all of your outside walls ( using a decent pair of binoculars for the higher areas - these can be hired if necessary ) for cracks in the mortar joints of your brickwork , chimney pots and chimney stack . <p> If you do find any cracks or faults in your mortar then they will need repairing . Rake out the joints using a plugging chisel or small bolster to a depth of around 10 15mm . Using a suitable mortar mix ( information for this can be found in our Mortar Mixes project ) re-point the damaged mortar joints with new mortar . <p> In the case of broken/cracked mortar around chimney stacks and pots this will also need to be replaced . Carefully chisel off the damaged areas and replace with the aforementioned mortar mix , using the Mortar Mixes project above for more information . <p> If you have cracks in your render then this can be a little trickier . In the case of large cracks these will need plugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rendered surface then it will gradually erode the inner surface away and create further cracks and eventually render will start falling off , creating a larger and more expensive repair job . <p> In the majority of cases render repair can be quite a time consuming job so for an interim fix you can seal over the crack with a silicone based sealer . This is also the case for larger cracks where you can seal the crack void and surrounding area with a silicone sealer . <p> Once you have some time to correctly repair the crack you can simply remove the silicone filler and proceed with the repair . <p> In respect to the correct repair method , any cracks should be filled with a render mix of the same grade and consistency as the current render on the wall ( premixed render or render patching compound can be purchased for this job . Products include K-Rend and Euromix . We have never used these products so can not confirm how competent they are ) . <p> Fill any cracks with your mortar or pre-mixed mortar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no moisture is allowed to penetrate your repaired area its also worth considering covering the area with a sealer or waterproofing agent . <p> If you have coloured render then this is another element that needs to be considered . You will have to try and create a matching colour to patch any cracks . As you can imagine this can be really tricky so be prepared for the fact that the repaired area is going to stand out . One possible solution for this is to then paint your property using a suitable exterior render paint or cement based paint . Use our project on matching mortar to get the correct colour <p> Roof Tiles and Flashing As with the above , broken or ineffective flashing ( the lead sheeting that covers the joint between your roof and wall and chimney stack and roof etc. ) can cause water ingress which results in damp patches on your internal walls . Using a decent pair of binoculars ( either borrow or hire ) check all the flashings around your roof and chimney stack for cracks and separation from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing faults then this will need to be repaired . Ideally any cracked flashings need to be replaced with new flashings . Lead is very expensive and this can be a pricy job , but ultimately flashing replacement is the best course of action . <p> Check lead flashing for and splits and cracks allowing water to penetrate <p> In the case that you do n't  have the funds to do a replacement right away then there are alternatives available . Flashing Tape is a fairly good short term fix for sealing cracks . Its effectively a waterproof tape with an adhesive underside that you can stick over the crack , sealing it over . We have used a few of these in the past and found Sylglas to be one of the better ones . See our project on lead flashing for more information on this . <p> In the case of cracked and broken tiles these will also need to be replaced as any cracks present can allow water to penetrate into your roof area , run down rafters and down into cavities and cause all manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile ( clay , slate , concrete etc. ) will dictate how this is done . In most cases the tile will be nailed to the roofing battens below and , sometimes on old properties , fixed in place with mortar so you will need to break the nail off using a suitable slate ripper or hacksaw blade to cut the nail off or chip off the mortar with a suitable hammer and chisel . With the nail(s) removed slide the tile out and replace with a new tile . <p> Once replaced fix the tile in place , or in the case of slates , instead of nailing back in ( as you will be unable to access suitable nailing points ) cut a suitable length lead strip ( about an inch longer than the length of the tile when positioned in place ) and nail to the roofing timber . Lead strip or galvanised metal is better to ensure that it does not rust . <p> Guttering The purpose of your guttering is to ensure that any excess water that runs off of your roof is channelled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a suitable area . <p> If the guttering becomes ineffective water can then run down the outside walls of your home and if this is allowed to consistently happen then eventually the walls themselves will suck the water in by capillary action causing damp patches on your internal walls . <p> Using a pair of decent binoculars check all of your guttering for defects cracks , splits , leaking joints , holes in down pipes , broken brackets etc . If you find any of these then get them fixed as soon as possible . <p> Blocked guttering can cause water to overflow and make your walls and roof damp <p> Service Fixings Most objects that are fixed to the internal walls of your property are done so using screws , bolts and other such items . In some cases these fixings protrude through the inner walls and into the cavity void . If there is any damp present within the cavity area ( leaks from above , cracks in mortar etc. ) then this water and moisture has a direct route into your wall if it is allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in the cavity . This moisture and water can then cause damp to appear on your internal walls . You can get guidance on fixing to masonry on this project page . <p> Be careful to drill the correct length hole when fixing to external walls <p> To resolve these issues remove any fixings that enter the cavity area and seal any holes left with a suitable waterproof filler e.g. mortar with waterproofing agent , silicone etc . This should then prevent any further damp issues appearing on your internal walls . You can find out how to apply silicone sealant here . <p> In the event that you can not remove the objects then make sure that the area around the object is sealed tight . Use a flexible filler to do so such as silicone as rigid fillers can crack with the movement of your home and changing temperature . <p> You can use a silicone gun to waterproof around window and door frames <p> Rising Damp - This can be a tricky problem to both diagnose and cure . Many people and some experts diagnose damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it at all . <p> Classically , rising damp is damp that rises up through the ground into the brickwork or stonework of a wall through capillary action ( the act of the water molecules sticking to the walls surface and surface tension holding the molecules together and helping them move up the wall inside the pores of the bricks ) . To stop rising damp being an issue some houses have Damp Proof Courses ( DPCs ) , which is a waterproof barrier inserted into a houses brickwork all around the property at about 6 inches from the ground . <p> It is believed by some experts that rising damp does not exist at all as technically walls constructed with engineering bricks should be impervious to capillary action due to the density of the brick material itself . <p> It is also argued that many Victorian properties were constructed with no damp proof courses for the reason that rising damp did not exist . However many of the construction materials used at that time such as lime mortar , lime plaster etc. are very breathable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , in this case , would then be allowed to naturally evaporate through the breathable surfaces . In light of this some houses from this era were constructed with a slate damp proof course . <p> With modern techniques , houses and buildings are constructed using materials that should be impervious to water and moisture e.g. bricks fired at a high temperature , Portland cement , Gypsum plaster , plastic damp proof course and concrete slab membrane etc . In the case that moisture does penetrate say the damp proof course , then as it works its way up the wall there is very little scope for it naturally evaporate due to the moisture resistant qualities of the materials involved . It is thought that at this point rising damp can occur . <p> Engineering bricks can be used to build a damp proof course <p> In the event that your current damp proof course has failed or has been breached ( via an attached structure stretching across the DPC and providing the damp an alternative pathway around the DPC ) a good option for repair is inserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical mixture into your internal and exterior wall . This may sound like a fairly intensive job and you would be right but it can be done at a DIY level by anyone with a little savvy . <p> The basic principle in terms of DPC injection is that you drill holes in the external wall at the level you want the new DPC to appear at ( 6 inches above ground level ) and then you inject the chemical cream DPC in using a suitable application gun ( e.g. a skeleton gun ) . The holes themselves should be around 12mm in diameter and around 20mm deep at centres of 125mm ( this may vary depending on the manufacturer of the DPC more information on chemical DPC injection is available here . <p> Once the external walls are treated you then have to treat the internal walls using the same process . In terms of the holes you have now drilled in your walls , with external holes these need to be left for as long as you can , at least 2 weeks to ensure correct drying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum of 2 weeks ( preferably longer ) . Once you have ensured that the liquid filled holes that make up the DPC are dry you can then fill the surface of the holes you have drilled . Use a suitable mortar mix with a waterproofer added and ensure that you push the mixture well into the holes to ensure they are properly filled . <p> The chemical DPC itself is just a waterproof chemical similar to the likes of silicone or other waterproofing chemicals . When it is pumped into the hole you have drilled , the bricks absorb the substance ( as they are porous ) and this essentially makes them waterproof the chemical bonds to itself within the brick to form a waterproof layer . <p> In most cases the chemical DPC comes in tubes similar to those used for silicone or decorators caulk . You can also get chemical DPC injection machines . These are similar to pumps that then pump the chemical agent into the wall . The applicator guns are a little easier to use if you are not experienced in using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses there are quite a few on the market and as with most products some are better than others . Examples of products available include Permaguard , Twistfix etc . Historically , we tend to use a product called Quick Cream as we have found this to be about the best and its BBA ( British Board of Agrement ) approved . <p> Cold Spots Giving Rise to Condensation and Salts <p> These issues are arguably one of the most common causes of damp on walls . Condensation forms when warm moist air within a room touches a cold internal wall or surface . It then cools rapidly and then condenses back into water . This condensation then sits on the internal walls surface and creates damp patches on the wall . <p> Now that we know how the condensation forms we have to find what is causing the cold spots that are causing the condensation to appear . This can be caused by several defects . Firstly , are there any cracks in the mortar on the external wall around the area where the damp is appearing ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated area on the internal wall , stopping it from warming up with the rest of the room . If there are cracks in any mortar then this will need repairing using the methods outlined above . <p> Is the condensation appearing on a chimney breast ? If so then this example of condensation could be caused by a poorly ventilated chimney breast . If you have bricked up fireplaces or a capped chimney stack then this may be preventing any cold air that is trapped in the chimney void from escaping and thus keeping the area at a consistently cooler temperature than the surrounding air . In this case , again , moisture can then condense on the chimney breast surface and cause damp on your wall . <p> In this case , the ventilation provided by the open fireplaces and the act of fires drawing air up the chimney stack is no longer present and air can become static so we will have to introduce some new ventilation in order to get the air flowing again and the air warmed up . Air bricks can be inserted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the top of the chimney breast on the external wall . This will then introduce an air flow and prevent static cold air sitting within the void and keeping the chimney area cold . <p> Keep chimney pots vented and allow air to circulate to prevent damp by using chimney cowls <p> The wall around your chimney can also be prone to suffering from Hygroscopic Chimney Salts . Salts and minerals released from fuels burnt on a fire can settle on the inside of the chimney breast and over time seep into and through a wall onto the internal wall surface . Tars and deposits that are also present on the inside of a chimney breast can also be drawn through along with the salts . The salts themselves appear as a white salt-like build up while stains from tars and deposits appear as a yellow/brown stain . <p> You may be thinking the salts are damp and make the affected area damp when they are present , this is not the case . The salts themselves are hygroscopic in nature which means that they attract moisture from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the internal walls . <p> In terms of a fix the likelihood that any plastered surfaces have survived this are pretty slim . If it can be caught in the very early stages and dried out then there is the chance that you can simply treat the area with a salt neutraliser , allow it to dry and then redecorate but in all honesty the correct fix would be to remove all of the plaster from the damaged areas right back to the walls surface and then to treat the wall itself with salt neutraliser to prevent any further salt ingress . You can then replaster and redecorate with confidence knowing that future damage has been prevented . <p> The salt neutraliser is a substance removes the salts and then prevents any further salt formation . There are quite a few different salt neutralisers available online or in your local DIY store but we use the salt neutraliser from Property Repair Systems as we have found this to be the best of the bunch - some of the other brands produce inconsistent results . <p> In some instances salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection and further minimise the chances of salts forming and causing damp to appear on your internal walls you may want to add a membrane to your wall before replastering . After you have treated the walls surface with salt neutraliser you can then fix a membrane over the area . The membranes themselves usually come on a roll ( similar to wallpaper ) and feature a dimpled surface . There 's a guide to the different types of membrane available as well as a chance to buy them here . <p> If you need any help finding the causes of condensation and damp patches on your internal walls and would like further information on how to stop your walls getting damp please contact Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 .

@@41624620 @1624620/ <p> Considering the volume of rain that the average UK home has to deal with each year its no wonder that occasionally some homes will suffer from damp and mould problems on their internal walls . What causes damp walls and mould on walls can vary and includes such things as broken or breached damp proof courses , cracked roof tiles , guttering problems , cracks in mortar and joints , broken and cracked lead flashing , broken and compromised or ineffective drains , hygroscopic salts etcIf you then couple one of these causes with poor ventilation ( poor or non-existent air flow ) , then any damp walls will struggle to dry out , even if the original source of water has been repaired . This is when wall mould problems can develop . <p> Damp and condensation can cause black mould to appear on your internal walls and window frames <p> In the majority of cases wall damp and mould problems can be dealt with pretty easily and can be caused by something quite obvious when you have pin-pointed the source of the moisture . In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there is a basic list of things you can check to rule out the most likely causes . <p> Cracks in your wall can let in water , making your wall damp which encourages mould growth <p> You should never simply seal over damp walls and mould with products such as liquid sealers or tanking . It may solve the damp problem on the internal wall , but without repairing what is causing the damp itself , the damp will still be present and in most cases will spread to other areas such as roofing timbers and cause much bigger and ultimately much more expensive issues a building must be allowed to breath and sealant prevents that . <p> Moisture is present in pretty much every building material and the act of evaporation controls the majority of this moisture content . If a building is sealed then it will not be able to breathe and if it cant breathe then moisture can not evaporate and it will simply sit there and manifest itself into any number of further damp and mould problems in your walls . <p> Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to prolonged exposure to damp and mould it is also possible that your health will be affected too . <p> Damp walls can result in the growth and spread of black mould on your walls and this can be harmful to your health . The spores that can be emitted by mould on internal walls have been linked to quite a few health issues including breathing problems ( asthma ) , infections , and allergic reactions and some moulds can give off toxic spores that can pose even greater health risks . <p> Black mould growth on walls can be very bad for your health especially in extreme examples such as this one <p> As you can see from the above , both damp and mould can be a serious problem and the source of the wall damp needs to be located and fixed . Once the source has been repaired you can then go about fixing the resulting damage done by the damp to any decoration and also remove any traces of the black mould from the walls . Below you will find a selection of potential causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair them and redecorate so that they no longer pose an issue ( NOTE : some checks involve checking your roof . If you do not have the correct ladders or the confidence to climb up there please hire/borrow a decent pair of binoculars as these will allow you to see everything you need to ) . <p> If at any point in this project you feel that you need an expert hand , give Property Repair Systems a call on 01626 336180 . All help and advice is free of charge and comes with no other obligations . <h> Possible Causes of Wall Damp and Black Mould how to Fix them <p> Damp Proof Course Not Present , Bridged or Broken : <p> Issue - This is most commonly the cause of rising damp . Is your damp and mould appearing on your walls just above your skirting boards ( in most cases below 1.2m in height . Rising damp will very rarely get above 1.2m as gravity takes over and the damp can not continue upward ) . If so then you will need to check that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do , that its not faulty or bridged . <p> As the name suggests the damp proof course provides your home with a waterproof layer that prevents water and moisture from traveling up your wall . In the case of a vertical damp proof course , which inserted where the external wall meets the internal wall , the water is prevented from traveling through the wall . <p> Some older properties were constructed without a damp proof course installed so you will firstly need to check and see if your property actually has one . A DPC can be either constructed from slate ( older properties ) , felt or plastic . In very rare cases , lead damp proof courses are installed . You should visually be able to see it on the outside wall between courses of bricks close to floor level . A damp proof course " should " always be a minimum of 6 inches ( 150mm ) above ground level . If you are unable to see after thorough investigation , it may be that you do not have one . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be the cause of the damp and mould on your walls <p> As with the majority of materials , things degrade and break over time and this is also the case with DPCs . With a slate DPC , this can break and crack over a period of years and the same goes for felt DPCs . Weather can also play a big part here in that consistent and prolonged exposure to sun and rain can cause slate and also felt to become brittle and break up . When it comes to plastic , this is usually a little more hard wearing , but again can fall foul of constant exposure to the sun . Visually assess the condition of your damp proof course is it split , cracked , breaking up ? Does it show signs of splits and cracks that run into the mortar ? If so then moisture may be finding its way in and up into your wall where it is manifesting itself as damp and encouraging mould growth . <p> From the outside of your property make sure that the ground level is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing obstructing it e.g. an existing structure such as an outbuilding or a path . If your DPC is below the external ground level then the overlap of the ground with the DPC is giving water and moisture a direct route around the DPC and up into your wall . <p> Mortar left in your cavity can give damp a direct route to your internal wall <p> Internal DPC bridging can also be an issue . This happens when debris and rubbish collect in a cavity void and build up to level that is above the DPC ( similar to the issue above but inside the cavity as opposed to being on the outside of the external wall ) . The debris itself is usually created at the construction stage where the builder drops mortar down inside the cavity . Additionally over a number of years rubbish such as birds nests , pieces of brick or stone , mortar etccan build up and provide moisture with a direct path around the DPC and up into your wall to create damp and mould on your walls . <p> Fix The fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case that you do not have a DPC then it may be a good idea to install one . You may be thinking that this sounds like a huge job and may be envisioning lifting your property up and installing a plastic sheet between brick courses . In years gone by this may have been the only consideration but today there are quite a few products available that can allow you to inject a damp proof course instead . There are quite a few available on the market but one that we quite like and have used numerous times on different jobs is the Quick Cream DPC from Property Repair Systems . Although quite an involving job ( and normally carried out by specialists such as Property Repair Systems ) it can be done by anyone with a little DIY savvy . <p> If you have pinned the source of your damp wall problem and resulting mould problem down to the fact that your DPC is broken then the only real solution here is again to inject a new one using either the Quick Cream mentioned above or a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area but results and actual solutions are not guaranteed . <p> You can install a new DPC by injecting Damp Proof Cream <p> When it comes to bridging of your DPC in the cavity , you guessed it , the only solution here is to remove the debris . To do so you will have to remove one or two bricks from the external wall . This is quite easy to do but do not remove any more than two bricks . If you need to remove more than two , then please first ask a reliable builder or a surveyor for expert advice . Once you have removed your bricks inspect the cavity using a mobile phone or camera ( with a light ) to see if there are any obstructions . If any are present then clear any debris in the cavity with your hands ( make sure your wear some tough gloves as there may be sharp objects in there ) . For items you can not reach use a bar or scraper to drag them towards you . An old vacuum cleaner also comes in handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed and the cavity is clear you can replace your bricks . <p> Remove any debris from your cavity to prevent water ingress into your walls that creates damp <p> If you have identified external bridging as your problem then as in the case above it will need to be removed . Dig back any soil , paths or garden areas if they are connected to your outside wall and their level is higher than the DPC . You should aim to leave a decent gap between them and your external wall . Also ensure that any water that may now collect is drained away correctly and will not simply sit there and cause further issues . If you are unable to remove the obstruction e.g. its an extension , then you are really only left with one choice inject a new DPC above the old one . <p> Mortar - Cracked and Broken Mortar Joints : <p> Issue - The external wall of your house is essentially its protective outer skin , fending off the elements and keeping you dry and warm inside . The potential weak points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortar joints . <p> Over a period of years and due to exposure to extremes of weather or movement of your property , these mortar joints can crack , causing gaps which provide moisture and cold air with a direct route onto the inside cavity wall . <p> As you may have guessed , if moisture is allowed into this area then it can penetrate through the inner cavity wall and on to the internal walls of your rooms , causing damp problems and then additionally mould problems on your walls . <p> Cold air getting into the cavity can also cause its own problems . Cold air can cause parts of the internal wall to have a different temperature to the rest of the wall surrounding it . This is known as a cold spot . In this instance condensation is likely to form when the warm moist air in your room touches the cold area on the internal wall . This results in black mould growth on your walls . <p> Cracked mortar can let damp enter your walls <p> Fix The only fix for this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to rake out ( carefully - do not damage or chip the bricks ) the old mortar using a mortar rake for very loose items ( minimum of 10mm ) or a plugging chisel or bolster for the more stubborn bits , and then a wire brush for a thorough polish up . With the joint cleaned of any remaining debris you can go ahead and repoint ( information on this can be found in our Mortar Mixes project ) . <p> Hygroscopic Salts - Moisture Attracting White Salts : <p> Issues - This is a problem that is largely associated with areas around the chimney ( due to the minerals contained within fuels such as coal and wood etc. ) but can occur anywhere . Minerals are present in most building materials and when exposed to moisture and water for prolonged periods they can be washed out of the wall and appear as a salty white substance on your walls . If you are experiencing this on your walls then there is a good chance that you have a leak somewhere . When present around a chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tars and deposits from inside the chimney are also drawn through . <p> Sometimes also known as " Efflorescence " , they can appear as white stains on the face of some brickwork . <p> You may also find that the salts themselves seem more evident during periods of bad weather or high humidity . This is mostly due to the fact that they can be hygroscopic in nature ( moisture attracting ) and any moisture present within a room is attracted and absorbed by the salts , thus creating damp and black mould on your internal walls . <p> Hygroscopic salts can cause white staining and damp on your walls <p> Fix The first thing to do is to trace and fix any leaks present . Once you have done this , you will need to remove all of the damp plaster from the affected area , right back to the walls surface behind . Then , treat the area with a salt neutraliser . These can usually be purchased from most builders merchants or specialist damp proofing companies but we tend to use Property Repair Systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best results . <p> Where extreme salts are present , it may also be necessary to install a membrane over the top of the walls surface ( once you have added your salt neutraliser ) before replastering . The membrane will prevent any further salts from penetrating your newly decorated surface . <p> Roof Tiles and Flashing - Broken Roof Tiles and Cracked Flashing : <p> Issue - This as you may expect is quite a common source of leakage and water ingress as , like the walls of your home , the roof forms part of the outer protective skin of your home . As with the cracked mortar issue with walls , once this skin is compromised by cracks in tiles or splits in flashing 's , water and moisture can access the inner areas and filter down through ceilings , run along joists and also run down into the cavity void and create damp and mould on your walls . <p> The first job to do is check your roof for any damage . The best way to do this is , as mentioned above , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can view your roof in detail from the ground . Obviously its best to inspect your roof when you 're actually on it but special ladders and a whole host of safety issues come into play here . If you have the necessary skills and knowledge to do this then go for it or if you have the funds available to pay for the services of a good roofer then this is a good choice , but in the absence of these , binoculars are the best option . <p> Inspect your roof for missing and broken tiles <p> Look for broken flashing around your roof and chimney <p> Inspect every part of your roof and identify any damage or wear that may have occurred over the years . Make a note of where it appears . Once your inspection is complete refer to the damp and mouldy areas on the internal walls and trace back to the damaged area on the outside to see if the two match up . Also , get up into your loft space and perform a close inspection of the inside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also water and evidence of dripping water ( stains , runs etc . ) . If it looks like any damage you have found is not the root cause of the leak then you will have to look elsewhere , but at least you can tick this one off ( if you did find damage to your roof , even if it looks like this is not the cause then you will still need to get it repaired as it could cause issues in the future ) . <p> Fix In the event that you have found broken tiles and flashing 's and it looks like these are the source of your problems then these will obviously need to be sorted . As we have mentioned several times , working on the roof can be dangerous so it may be best to locate a reliable roofer in your area and get the job done professionally . <p> If you do have the skills , safety knowledge and experience to do the job yourself then replacing your broken tiles can be relatively easy . There are quite a few resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof tiles , One good example of the principles of this is the Tile Roof Repair video by Russ Richards on YouTube . Certain types of roof tile are fixed in different ways and also the age of certain properties will influence how tiles are fixed to the roof , so be aware of this , but the video does supply a good outline of what 's involved in most situations . There are also certain glue/repair products available on the market that will allow you to repair cracks quite easily but we have never used any of these so can not comment on their success , as we tend to replace broken tiles its definitely the best course of action . <p> When it comes to flashing obviously the best job is to replace any damaged sections , but if you factor in the cost of a roofer ( if you cant do it yourself ) and then the price of lead then this can be expensive . In light of this you can instead buy and use flashing repair tape that you can simply stick over any splits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these ( such as Sylglas ) and have found them to be quite good and produce a good , effective waterproof seal . You can find out how to repair your flashing using flashing tape in our Repairing Lead Flashing Project page . <p> Guttering -Leaks , Blocks etc <p> Issue - If you have defective guttering this can also be a quite common cause of damp and black mould formation on internal walls . Guttering is designed to channel excess rainwater away from your property to a suitable drainage point . If the guttering fails , then rainwater can run down the outside walls of your home and over time with constant rainfall , a wall will suck water into it via capillary action . Once the water has penetrated the outer cavity wall it can seep into inner walls , causing your damp and mouldy patches on your walls . <p> Blocked guttering can cause water to overflow onto your walls <p> The best time to check your guttering is when its working , so this does mean putting on a coat and going out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every joint between each guttering section , the stop ends and down pipes . Also check all the supporting brackets to ensure that none are broken , as if they are then the weight of the water in heavy downpours can put too much weight on a joint and cause it to fail . <p> When doing your inspection , look for any water spilling over the edges ( possible blockages ) , water dripping down from horizontal sections ( possible joint failure , splits or cracks ) and water running down the outside of down pipes ( joint failure on the running outlet ) . Also check any 90 degree bends . In some situations there is too much of a distance between downpipes and in heavy downpours the bend will act as a bit of a bottleneck where too much water is trying to get round it at the same time and will be forced over the edge . <p> If water is spilling over the side of guttering sections then this is a good indication that there is a blockage . The only way to resolve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blockage has been removed and as much debris has been removed as possible it is also a good idea to then wash the area down with a hose to clear it all thoroughly . <p> Where water is spilling over on a 90 degree bend then you may need to install another downpipe near the section . Again this is a fairly easy job that involves removing a horizontal section , cutting out enough to fit a running outlet and then fitting a downpipe . Ensure that all the joints are sealed correctly and also ensure that your new downpipe drains into an existing drain , as you do n't  want this to drain into the ground and cause additional damp problems . <p> Drainage - Poor Drainage , Sitting Water etc <p> Issue - Its one thing to channel excess and unwanted water and moisture away from your property but once you have done so you then have to ensure that it is draining away from your home correctly and not simply sitting there or saturating the ground , as in this situation you are leaving yourself open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drains become blocked or ineffective then water will not drain correctly . <p> Check all of your drainage points inside and outside your house including overflows , sinks , toilet wastes , downpipe drains , shower and bath drainage , drainage pipes running through walls ( internal to external ) , and look for weeping in joints , blockages , blocked grates , overflowing , splits , cracks and condensation . Around these areas also look for evidence of leaks , puddles etc. and then trace them as far as you can to see where the water is going . You can find more information on how to test your drains for leaks in our Tracing Leaks project page . <p> In the event that you find damaged external drainage this could be a little trickier and may require the services of drainage professionals . <p> Condensation can also be a source of damp and mould . When checking all your pipework also take notice of any condensation that may be present on any cold feeds to taps and valves . Condensation can collect and then run down pipework and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this instance your pipework will need to be lagged and insulated . More information on condensation can be found in our Condensation project . <p> Black mould on cold water pipes caused by condensation <p> Poor Ventilation <p> Issue - This is n't obvious but quite a common cause of damp and mould nonetheless . More often than not , damp and mould is caused by poor ventilation when there a capped chimney , a blocked up fireplace or simply not enough vents in your walls . When in use a fireplace provides ventilation in a room and also ventilation for itself ( the fire draws air up the chimney ) . When you cap off a chimney stack or block up a fireplace without adding a vented chimney cowl or airbricks during the covering of the fireplace you are removing this ventilation . <p> When this ventilation is removed , cold air can become trapped in the chimney breast void and cause the chimney breast to be at a different temperature to other walls of the room . It can also keep that particular area of your wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is warmer ( e.g. when the heating comes on ) . <p> When this happens , moisture in the warm air in your room can condense on the colder area on the wall and create condensation , and , in most cases , mould . <p> Black mould caused by poor ventilation <p> Other ventilation issues can include unwanted ventilation gaps around windows and doors , cracks in walls , holes made by fixings such as hanging baskets , wall mounted cupboards , pipe fixings etc . When this occurs , areas around the gap in the wall on the internal wall can be at a different temperature to the rest of the walls in the room . This is known as a cold spot , and again this can cause condensation , damp and mould to appear on your walls . You can find out more about cold spots on our Cold and Damp Spots project page . <p> Outside chimney flues can also in some cases cause condensation . If you have a flue that runs up the outside wall of your property check the surrounding areas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is off before you do this ! ! ) <p> Fix Firstly check around your rooms for any signs of ventilation do you have airbricks installed in your outside walls ? Has your chimney been capped with no openings at the top of the chimney ? Check any bricked up fireplaces to make sure that air bricks have been installed in the fireplace area on your internal wall and also in your loft area to see if air bricks have been installed in the chimney breast . <p> If you can not find any evidence of ventilation then some should be added . An air brick should be inserted into your internal wall on the ground floor in the area where your fireplace is , roughly 300mm above floor level . This is to provide ventilation to your fireplace behind the wall . If you have a void below your ground floor e.g. a floating timber floor , then the air bricks should be inserted here . Ensure that there is adequate ventilation in this area and that you have air bricks installed in external walls . <p> If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in or out at the top , you need to add some ventilation here as well . If there 's a chance you might use the chimney in the future , the best thing to do is to add a cowl in place of the cap this ensures that rain wont enter your chimney but also means that when a prevailing wind strikes the cowl , that air is drawn up the chimney and out . If you 're not planning on using the chimney again , a cheaper option is to remove the cap and the pot and to place a paving slab on top of the chimney stack , raising the slab up by two or three inches on all sides so that air can enter and exit the chimney . <p> In the case of any unwanted gaps , these should be repaired correctly or filled . Replace any rotting window sills or door frames and ensure they are correctly sealed all around the edge . Repair any split or broken mortar by raking out the joints and replacing with new . Also check the affected area for fixings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once removed fill the hole with suitable sturdy filler ( mortar if necessary or solid filler ) . If the item can not be removed ( i.e. its a cupboard ) then ensure that the fixing holes are totally sealed and air tight . <p> Fix any gaps in your walls with filler <p> It can be a little tricky to judge how effective additional ventilation will be , as if it is added unnecessarily then this itself can cause rooms to be cold and draughty , not only making them uncomfortable to be in but also possibly creating further cold , damp and mould on your walls . <p> If you are unsure about adding additional ventilation then it may be best to speak to a professional first . There are many damp specialists out there but make sure you do your research first and find a good one . As mentioned we tend to work with a company called Property Repair Systems as we have found them to be highly knowledgeable and reputable in all aspects of damp and related issues . <h> Repairing Damage Caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined above we have suggested one or more fixes to resolve the potential cause of the issue . Below you will find information on how to repair the actual damage that has been caused by any wall damp and mould to your internal decoration , as well as suggested products that can be used to prevent re-occurrence of the issues . <p> What to do if Your Plaster is Structurally Sound <p> If the damp and mould present on a plastered wall surface was not left for long periods of time , once your plaster has dried out there is the chance that it will be okay . Check the plaster to see if it is crumbling , split or cracked . If not then you should be okay to redecorate over it without replacing it . <p> If mould is also present on any of these walls then in most cases these areas will also need to be treated with an anti mould killer to ensure that no mould growth will reappear . As with most products in the building industry there are many , many available such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Dettol Anti-Bacterial Mould and Mildew Remover , all with varying degrees of effectiveness . We have tried quite a few over recent years on various damp recon jobs and the PRS Mould Killer Spray is about the best we have used ( hence the fact that we work very closely with PRS as a company ) . <p> Remove the mould from your wall using mould cleaner before redecorating <p> You may also have salt deposits on your walls as discussed above . If they are Hygroscopic salts ( indicated by white stains and damp patches that come and go ) and your plaster is sound , you should apply salt neutraliser to the affected areas in much the same way as the mould cleaner check that your mould remover and salt neutraliser are compatible with one another before applying them to the same surface . The other kind of salt deposit that can appear on damp walls is known as salts and appears as a result of water washing minerals out of the brickwork . It presents as a fluffy , crunchy deposit that will easily blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely that you will have to strip your plaster away and replaster . <p> Use salt neutraliser to remove any salts on your wall before redecorating <p> What to do if Your Plasters Blown <p> In the event that the plaster has suffered exposure to damp on your walls for long periods of time then the chances are that it will be too far gone to be simply decorated over . If it is split or cracked , crumbling away or if when you tap on it , it sounds hollow , then it has blown off of the walls surface below and the entire affected area will need to be removed . <p> Chip off all of the plaster from the affected wall area and also any damaged surrounding areas right back to the walls surface below . If the bare wall has mould on it , clean this off first with mould remover as mentioned above you can do this right away without waiting for the wall to dry if its damp . If there were any salt deposits present in the plaster , you should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either by painting it on or adding it to your plaster . Some plasters also come with salt neutraliser already included . Read the instructions of both your salt neutraliser and your mould remover to make sure that they can be used together its very unlikely that you will have problems but its best to check . If you had a severe issue with salts , its a good idea to fit a mesh membrane on your walls surface before replastering more information on how to do this is available on our Lining Damp Walls project page . When you have finished treating your wall , leave it to dry completely and then replaster it . <p> Strip any damp plaster away right back to the wall and leave it to dry out <p> Redecorating Your Wall <p> When it comes to redecoration you have a few options . If all the damaged plaster and decorated surface has been completely removed and allowed to dry totally , the replaster has been completed to a high standard and you can confidently say that all the damp and mould affected areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be visible . If you then want to make doubly sure you have covered all the bases then you might want to consider ( if you are painting ) an anti-mould paint as this will protect you from any future mould growth . There are many available on the market and there 's always a good selection in most DIY stores but in all honesty some are okay and some are no good at all . One that we use is called Anti Mould Professional Paint from PRS ( and it also comes with a 5 year guarantee ) . If you want to use your own paint PRS also supply an additive that can be mixed in with the one you have selected ( and they supply an additive for wallpaper paste ) . <p> In respect to paint choices , if you are decorating in a kitchen or bathroom ( high humidity areas ) try to go for an oil based egg shell as it does not allow the absorption of moisture and water . <p> If you want to be totally sure that your wall mould wont return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damp and Mould Marks and Stains <p> Stains and marks are an inevitable result of damp and mould on your walls as both issues can leave residual marks on a walls surface . In the case that you do not replaster then you are leaving yourself open to the possible re-emergence of the mould ( as the spores can remain in the plastered surface ) if you do not treat the area with a suitable mould killer ( mentioned above ) to ensure that all the spores are totally gone . Once you have treated the wall with mould cleaner , you may be faced with mould-related stains and marks to deal with before you redecorate . <p> If in the past you have repainted over a damp area you may have experienced the problem of the outline of the damp patch still showing through ( the boundary edges ) , this can be even more problematic with hygroscopic chimney salt problems where tars have been drawn through to internal walls ( yellowy brownish stains ) . You may have also found that no matter how many times you paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To ensure that this problem is totally resolved the best course of action is to remove all the plaster from the area and replaster and redecorate . Obviously there is a cost involved here and this may not be a practical option . If not then there are a wide range of stain blocking primer paints available for damp and mould stained walls ( as mentioned above ) . You can paint or spray on a primer like this and it should stop any marks appearing on a newly decorated surface do make sure that you 've allowed your wall to dry post-mould cleaning before applying it though . <p> If you need any further assistance in finding what 's causing damp and black mould to form on your internal walls , please contact Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 .

@@41624621 @1624621/ <p> Summary : Partition , stud wall and plasterboard building ; How to build a simple dividing wall . How thick is a stud wall is a very common question we get and this project will help you understand the dimensions and thickness that your internal walls should be . <p> Building a partition or non load-bearing wall is great way of dividing space . These are also called stud walls . The easiest way to build a partition wall is to make a timber frame and put plasterboard on the face . <p> Side View of Partition Wall <p> There are two thicknesses of plasterboard . 9.5mm and 12.5mm . If using 12.5mm the studs must be placed no further apart than 600mm and if using 9.5mm then 400mm is the maximum ( if using plasterboard on a ceiling always use 12.5mm as it will not sag ) . These two distances will allow you to move the studs very slightly so that a piece of plasterboard ( usually 1.22m wide ) can be fitted into the centre of a stud if a join is necessary . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75mm x 50mm . This is personal choice and largely based on the space you have . Using 100mm timbers with 12.5mm plasterboard and 3mm of skim plaster , the final thickness of the wall is 131mm. ( a little over 5 inches ) . Sawn timber can be used , there is no need to use prepared timber . <p> Internal timber door frames , or liners as they are known , can be bought in kit form from the builders merchants . They are available at 105mm ( 4 + ) wide or 131mm ( 5+ ) wide . The liners can be assembled to fit standard door widths of 2ft 3ind and 2ft 6ins . <p> Plasterboard should be joined on a stud or noggin , and we advise that Drywall screws are used rather than nails . Use a battery operated screwdriver to fix the screws at no more than 400mm centres in both horizontal and vertical planes . <p> Cables for switches and sockets can be " built in " to the wall void by drilling the correct sized hole through the studs and noggins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These clip to the plasterboard and do not need to be fixed to a stud or noggin . Insulation can also be packed into the void to a ) keep heat in a room and b ) to dull any sound . This is particularly useful if you are partitioning off for a bathroom . Insulation must not be placed around cables . <p> The first timber to be positioned is the head timber . It can be fixed up through the ceiling into the ceiling joists if the joists are running the right way . That is , at 90 degrees to the wall . If the joists are running in the same direction as the new stud wall , then we advise marking the position of the head timber on the ceiling , and then cutting the plasterboard out between the lines to insert timber noggins at 400mm centres between the joists to fix the head timber to . Use a pad saw to cut the plasterboard and be mindful of cables and pipes in the floor void as you cut . <p> Once the head timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side of it . Mark the position of the sole plate on the floor in 3 places along its length . Fix the sole plate using number 8 screws ( 3 inch ) to a wooden floor or 4inch to a concrete floor . See our project on Fixing to Masonry for instructions on this . The screws should be no more than 600mm apart . <p> The two end studs can now be fixed to existing walls using the same methods . <p> The vertical studs are cut to length and fitted tightly in between the head and sole plates . They can either be screwed into the two plates with the screws at an angle ( side fixing ) , or ( as shown in the diagram below ) a noggin can be inserted between the studs . The bottom noggin serves two purposes . It keeps the studs secure and allows a larger area for skirting boards to be fixed . 100mm number 8 screws should be used when screwing studs and noggins to each other . <p> Putting Joint Tape Over Joints <p> Plasterboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto studs and noggins . <p> Take care to measure your room and plan the partition wall first . You will then be able to work out how much timber and board you need as well as knowing where your studs and noggins are going to fit . The joints of the board are covered using a special plasterboard tape which is a very fine mesh . It is called " Scrim " and comes in a self adhesive roll for ease of use . The Scrim is taped over the joints , as shown in the diagrams below , allowing the joints to be plastered over without fear of cracking . <p> Why not go to our video section on repairing holes in plasterboard and watch a film on repairing drywall for a practical demonstration . There is also a video on " taping drywall seams " in our taping seams section . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Find out what a paint pad is , when they should be used and how to use them correctly . They have benefits over using traditional paint brushes and rollers is used properly and can help you to get a fantastic finish . <p> For many years a brush was the only option when it came to painting a room . Then came rollers , and what an innovation they were , saving time and giving more even coverage . Now , the latest paint applicator is the paint pad . Find out more about them in our guide below . <h> What Is a Paint Pad ? <p> A paint pad is a flat , usually rectangular paint applicator . It has an easy-to-hold handle on the back , and the front is foam covered in short , densely-packed bristles . <p> Paint Pad <p> Paint pads come in different sizes , so that you can pick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do . There are different handle types available too , so you can choose the one that you feel most comfortable with . <p> You can buy replacement pads to fit onto the handle , so when the pad gets old and worn you can replace it . <h> Why Use a Paint Pad ? <p> Paint pads are easy to use , provided you have the right equipment . Buy a pack that has a tray with a built-in roller . This enables you to make sure you get the right amount of paint on the pad . <p> Paint pads give good coverage and a smooth , even finish . They are much cleaner to use than rollers , as there is no spray . They do need reloading more often than rollers , but they still do the job quickly . <p> Because of the smooth finish they give , paint pads are particularly good for ceilings . Make sure you get one that you can attach a long handle to , to make the job even easier . <h> How to Use a Paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have protected the floor and any furniture left in the room , and wear old clothes . Paint pads are less messy to use than rollers , but with any painting job there is a risk that some paint will somehow end up where it 's not meant to be ! <p> For the best results , use a specialist paint pad tray , which has a built-in roller . Even if you ca n't get a specialist tray , a normal paint tray will be better than nothing . Pour some paint into the tray , and draw the paint pad over the roller . This will transfer paint from the tray underneath onto the pad . If you are using a standard paint tray , dip the pad in the paint and wipe off the excess . Make sure the pad is evenly covered , otherwise you 'll get a patchy finish . <p> Paint pad paint tray with roller <p> Start painting in a corner of the room .

Therefore if you set the ridged pad slightly away from the edge of the plastic frame and wipe it before you use it up against an adjacent painted wall , you should not get paint on that adjacent wall . <p> However , because you have left a slight gap between the ridges pad and the plastic frame , thereby not allowing the pad to meet the adjacent painted wall , there will be a thin line of unpainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you move the ridged pad flush with end of the plastic frame you will end up transferring unwanted paint onto the adjacent wall ; better to cut in with a brush first and then use the paint pad . <p> This is great advice , thanks , Robert 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

@@41624625 @1624625/ <p> Summary : Known by many as a ring main , this project shows how to wire a ring circuit or final circuit as it is correctly termed . If you need to know how to wire a domestic house then you will need to know how to wire a ring main circuit . This project explains what a final ring circuit or ring main is , and how you should correctly wire them up and connect it to the consumer unit . Also find out about the various rules and regulations such as the Part P regulations that you must adhere to when performing electrical work . <h> When is a Ring Main not a Ring Main ? <p> Ring main is a term which has been used for years , and will continue to be used for many more years , but it is incorrect , it 's just easy to say ! <p> The correct terminology for Ring Main is either Final Ring Circuit or Ring Circuit , however , now you know that we will continue to refer to it in the most common parlance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire a ring main , final main , ring circuit or final circuit ring <h> What is a Ring Main or Ring Final Circuit or Final Circuit ? <p> A ring main , or final circuit , is exactly what it says on the tin . It is a ring of cables , usually 2.5mm carrying twin and earth wires , circling your home , carrying the mains electricity to sockets on the way . It gets the power from the consumer unit and delivers it to the sockets . <h> How Does a Final Ring Circuit or Ring Main Work <p> As both ends of the ring are connected to the same terminals at the consumer unit , the current runs in both directions imposing less of a load on the cables . Electricity loses power over long lengths of cable and trying to put too much power through a cable which is not designed for it is dangerous , so a ring main delivers power from both ends to keep the load as light as possible . <p> Wiring a socket correctly in a final ring circuit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power your home is a radial circuit . They are not so common in the UK but are used extensively abroad as the ring main , or final ring circuit does have it 's drawbacks . <p> The radial circuit can be turned into a ring circuit by completing the wiring back to the consumer unit and similarly the ring main , or final circuit ring can be turned into two radial mains by removing a section of the ring . <p> This is one of the failure points of a ring main or final ring circuit which is identified below in the pros and cons of using a ring or radial circuit . <h> How Can I Tell if my House has Radial Circuits or Ring Mains ( Final circuits ) <p> We would like to thank one of our forum members for answering this question in our busy electrical forum and you can see the answers to many more questions there . <p> Identifying a radial circuit and a final ring circuit requires a test . A sparky ( electrician ) will disconnect the wires in the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and return terminals . <p> Sockets on a ring main have at least two sets of wires connected to them , but spurs may also have two sets of wires and so do sockets on a radial circuit , all except the last one anyway so counting cables on the back of sockets is not a safe way to identify a ring circuit or ring main . <p> Ring circuits are normally fed with a 30 or 32 amp fuse or MCB , but if feed is supplied through a 4mm cable then the spurs could also be feed with 30 or 32 amp fuse or MCB . <p> If the circuit was originally a ring main but this has become broken and is now a spur or radial main then it could be fed with 2.5mm and 32 amp fuse . <p> Even though the sockets are connected to two cables or 2.5mm and supplied by a 32 amp fuse or MCB it can not be guaranteed that it is a ring main or final circuit . <p> In short if you can not correctly test whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit then you should not , under any circumstances be working on it . The UK is the only country in the world to work with Ring Mains , or Final Ring Circuits and without the correct testing equipment and knowledge of procedures it is impossible to tell the difference . <p> Ring circuits usually protected by a 32 amp MCB <h> Testing for a Ring or Radial Circuit <p> As we all know , electricity is dangerous and potentially lethal , so you have to have the necessary knowledge in order to work with it . <p> If you understand this paragraph then you are able to test yourself . If you do not , leave it alone . <p> Turn off all power to the ring circuit you want to test . Choose a socket and plug in your kettle , or some other appliance you now to be working . Undo the face plate and pull out . You need a socket with only two cables in the back . If there are three , move to another socket , testing again that it is off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the two live wires . Switch a multi meter to ohms . If you do not know how to use a multi meter you should be nowhere near the electric circuits of you home ! <p> Put the muti meter tails on each of the live wires . Your reading should be 0 Ohms or at least a very very low reading indicating there is no resistance and your circuit is a ring circuit with complete continuity . <p> If your multi meter shows resistance you are dealing with a radial circuit . <h> Restrictions on a Ring Main or Ring Circuit <p> There are still restrictions on how much power and for how long , a ring main or final ring circuit may carry . This is reflected in the maximum distance a cable may be used for and the fuse rating it is given . Please see cable length restrictions below for more information . <p> A separate ring main is usually installed on every floor of a given property to make sure things are kept safe and it is only when , for example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs ring main , to feed a socket or light on a downstairs circuit , that things can get tricky . For the rules that govern how t is can be dne , please see our Part P project linked to above . <p> Switched fused spurs can be used for cookers , showers , dishwashers and washing machines <p> A switched fused spur is also used when connecting a cooker hob , dishwasher , washing machine or fridge to the circuit . It allows the appliance to be switched on and off from a position above the worktop , or at least a more easily reachable position than the socket they are plugged into ( which is normally located below worktops and behind the appliance ) . The switched fused spur interrupts the socket and allows it to be switched on and off . <h> Cable Used for a Ring Main or Final Ring Circuit <p> A ring main uses 2.5mm cable comprising of a live , neutral and earth . This is called two core and earth cable . The 2.5mm is the measurement of the cross sectional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable type can be seen below and shows the live , neutral and earth wires . <h> Floor Area for a Ring Main or Final Ring Circuit <p> The floor area a ring main serves is also governed . This is because the regulation people have some idea of how much power and lighting we can expect to use in such an area . The maximum area for a ring main is 100 square meters . <p> An average house has a footprint of about 64-70 square meters so this allows for the continuation of the ring into a porch or garage etc . The ring main must be protected by a 30amp fuse if it is on a cartridge fuse board , or a 32amp MCB fuse . <p> The cable itself can be up to 60 meters long if it is protected by a cartridge fuse and 50 meters long if protected by an MCB . <p> Clip cables properly with cable clips <p> There is no limit to the number of sockets you can have on a ring main but there is a limit to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wiring between them .

Cable ties are very versatile - this project will help you to see their full potential . <p> Cable management is just one use for cable ties and these versatile pieces of equipment warrant a page all on their own to describe the multiple uses they can be put to . Cable ties are also very cheap which makes them a great cost effective solution to many jobs around the home or workshop . <h> How to Use Cable Ties <p> The beauty of a cable tie is their ease to use .

You will also be able to hear the teeth clicking rapidly over the ridges as you tighten the tie . <p> How to use a cable tie - The different parts <p> If it does n't catch you simply need to remove the pointed end , turn over the cable tie and replace the pointed end into the head from the right direction . <p> Pull back against the cable to tighten it and move the head down the cable tie as far as it will go . Once the cable is tight and secured you can then cut off the excess loose end . This is not absolutely necessary , but it will neaten things up . <h> Different Types of Cable Tie <p> There are a huge range of types and size of cable ties . It is worth trying to get the right size cable tie for the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get the smallest cable tie that will definitely do the job . This will make it easier to handle and less expensive . <p> If your cable ties are too small , you can get around this on a temporary basis by linking 2 or more cable ties together into a chain and then using this chain of ties as if they were one larger cable tie . <p> Most cable ties are made from moulded nylon , however there are some that are not , depending on the type of tie and it 's intended use . The main different types of cable ties include the following : <p> Coloured Cable Ties : Coloured ties are incredibly useful for grouping together different cable groups or items to be able to single them out easily . You can quickly see which cables are destined for a particular location or use in a larger bundle . We have used these ties as office key rings to identify different sets of keys easily <p> Marker Ties : These are typically nylon ties that have a flat plat that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is holding . Marker ties have so many uses there just is not room to mention them all here . From rose bushes to sandwiches there is nothing that can not be identified with a marker tie . Of course they are very handy for marking sure you know what a particular cable or bunch of cables are and where they go too ! It is possible to get cable ties pre-printed although this is more expensive and generally required a larger volume to be purchased . Printed cable ties do not require any imagination to work out the number of uses . These ties can be printed with names or numbers ( or both ) for easy identification . These are known as security ties <p> Cable tie with marker <p> Velcro Cable Ties : There is the Velcro cable tie . These ties are re-usable and with a 150mm ( 6 inch ) strap can also be used for a variety of jobs .

They tend to be a little more expensive but the benefit is that you can use them again . They have a little nylon catch fitted to the head which can be released to stop the teeth biting into the head . This allows the cable tie to be undone .

You will learn how to regularly brush your patio and paved areas to ensure they remain free of dirt and dust , how to wash your patio or paved area and what to use , how to clean and maintain any joints and also how to remove moss , lichen and algae to give your out door area that new show home look . <p> Regardless of what type of paving you have " be it slabs , concrete , shingle etc. it will require maintenance to keep it in tip top condition . In some cases a little hard work with a brush and some soapy water can really give tired and un-cared for pathway a completely different look . <p> When it comes to stains found on paving and patios these are often a result of overspill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls etc. will have been built on or around the slabs . <p> In this case , occasionally lumps of mortar will have been spilt or dropped on the slabs and by the time the builder has realised its gone rock hard . <p> In other situations you might not be dealing with mortar stains and spills but other marks such as algae , lichens and moss . This can accumulate over time when water is allowed to sit in specific areas . <p> In the case of algae , this really needs removing as quickly as possible as when it gets wet or damp it can become very slippery and poses a potential danger to anyone walking over it . <p> Weeds can also be a common problem and can grow on top of paving and in joints if left to their own devices and not treated the second they start to rear their ugly heads . If dirt and debris is allowed to settle on top of a paving surface then it is only a matter of time before something takes hold and starts to grow . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tidy <p> Brushing <p> By regularly brushing your patio over , this will remove any debris and dirt that is sitting on the surface . By removing this you will then prevent any seeds from germinating as they wo n't have anything to take root in . <p> The action of brushing will also break off any small weeks that have just started sprouting preventing them from growing any further . <p> Brushing up leaves and debris will help to prevent and weed growth or growth from Moss and Lichens <p> Weeding <p> It is pretty much inevitable that at some point a weed will take root and grow . Whether it 's due to not having time to brush or whether you away for an extended period of time , it 's going to happen . <p> When you do get a chance to attend to them make sure that you pull up any weeds that have taken root , taking as much of the root with the weed as possible . <p> Also , remove any weeds that have taken root in any joints . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take some of the sand with it . Once all weeds are gone and you have cleaned and swept the area you must then replace the sand in the joint , do not leave it partially filled . <p> Weedkillers can also be a good solution as , obviously , they will kill any weeds when sprayed . In terms of which weedkillers to use , the best are either contact or systemic killers : <p> Contact : This type of weed killer is usually fast acting and will kill most things that its sprayed on to as it is absorbed through the leaves and stem etc .... <p> Systemic : These weed killers tend to be a bit slower acting but are generally much more thorough as they work their way through the entire plant right down to the root <p> If using a weedkiller , please ensure that you read the manufacturer 's instructions in terms of when and where it can be used , especially if you have children and pets around . <p> When it comes to weeding the best solution is always to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidy and free from as much dirt as possible . <p> Grass growth in patio joint <p> Cleaning and Power Washing <p> Along with simple brushing , the occasional scrub down soapy water can work wonders ! Washing up liquid is the best to use but you can use certain floor cleaners , just make sure that they are acid free as acid based cleaners can react and damage some concrete or stone surfaces . <p> This method simply involves a bucket , some water , a brush and your chosen soapy cleaner . Using either hot or cold water , fill up your bucket and mix in your soap solution and then chuck some over a small area ( work in small areas at a time ) . <p> Using your brush , scrub the surface backwards and forwards , applying some downward pressure to the brush . The scrubbing action and soap combined will loosen any surface dirt and grime from your paving or patio . <p> Once you have scrubbed over all the surface use clean water to wash any debris away down a near drain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden areas as in some cases the soap cleaner may contaminate soil and kill plants . <p> If you are lucky enough to have a steam or pressure washer , this can be very handy . This will allow you really give your paving or patio a deep clean . In much the same manner as the washing up liquid and brush method , work your way over the surface of your patio or pathway removing as much surface grime as possible . More information can be found in our power washing decking project . <p> Be careful of any detergent that you use as again , this may damage the surface if it contains certain chemicals and also be careful around your all-important joints . <p> An ill-aimed power washer can clear a sand-filler joint in seconds and can also damage some mortar joints if they are old and a bit crumbly ! Also , depending on the size and pressure that the washer exerts , do not dwell too long in one place . <p> If you have a large industrial size pressure washer , some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this would be enough to seriously damage some types of paving so ensure that you gently sweep backwards and forwards over any surfaces . <p> Brush cleaning a patio area using bleach <p> Joints <p> As we have mentioned already , the joints that make up your paving are one of the key area . They help to stabilise everything and hold it in place to create a solid structure . <p> Also , if they look tatty and worn they can completely ruin the look of your patio or driveway area . <p> To these ends it is important to keep any joints clean , clear and in tip-top condition : <p> Remove Weeds : Pull out any weeds that have started growing , removing as much of the root as you possibly can . Again , sweep the area thoroughly removing any dust and debris as this will prevent weeds growing on your patio area that could then spread to the joints <p> Fill Gaps in Joints : If you have sand filled joints then in most cases pulling out weeds will take some of the joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refill the gap with a suitable jointing sand or compound . In the case that you have mortar filled joints , over time these can crack and crumble and weeds can take root . As before , remove any weeds and hack away any loose or crumbling mortar ( be careful you do n't damage any slabs or bricks in the process ) and fill any gaps with a suitable mortar mix <p> When it comes to sand-filled joints the use of a jointing stabiliser can be invaluable as this will help to bond the sand particles together preventing the wind from blowing them away and also any light surface wear from eroding the joints too much ( emphasis on light wear ) . <p> Although a joint stabiliser will help to bond sand filled joints it is not in any way , shape or form a resin or glue so wear from cleaning , footfall etc .... will occur but at a slower rate . <p> Joint in patio where mortar has fallen away and weeds now grow <p> Sealing Paving and Patios <p> Many , if not most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be quite porous in nature ( water and moisture absorbing ) . If installed correctly they look fantastic in the early years but as time progresses they soon start to look old and tired due to moss , algae and weed growth . <p> As I 'm sure you have gathered by now , they require regular maintenance to look their best that includes sweeping and washing but there is also another step that you can take to aid their looks and longevity and that is to seal them using a specialist patio sealer ( or block paving sealer in the case of block paved surfaces ) . <p> There are many different paving and patio sealers available on the market today including those for more specialist paved surfaces such as Indian sandstone , Limestone and Travertine surfaces . <p> Due to the vast selection of different sealers it can be a little confusing to know which one to use for your particular surface so always check the manufacturer 's suggestions on the packaging and using the wrong sealer could potentially destroy your paving or patios surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface and remove its ability to absorb water , moisture and other substances such as oil etc .... as this will certainly delay the growth of any weeds , algae 's or lichens . <p> Once sealed , your surface should then have the ability to repel or resist ( depending on manufacturer and type of sealer " this is worth checking as there is a difference ! ) water and moisture and oil etc .... <h> Removing Mortar and Cement from paving and Patios <p> Unfortunately , like many jobs that involved dried cement and mortar , the only way to remove any lumps is by using a hammer and bolster chisel . This needs to be done carefully as banging the hammer down on the chisel on top of a paving slab can easily crack it if it is not supported adequately . The same can be said for thin , unsupported concrete . <p> Holding the bolster chisel at around an angle of 30- , position the tip at the base of the concrete or mortar you need to remove . If the chisel is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will simply dig into the surface of your path or patio . <p> Hold the bolster chisel at around a 30 degree angle to remove dried on mortar from patio and paved surfaces <p> Additionally , ensure that the tip of the chisel is flat and level with the surface of your path or slab . If it is at a slight angle e.g. one corner of the blade is higher than the other then it may cause the lower angle to dig into the surface and damage it . <p> With the bolster positioned correctly , tap the striking plate gently with the hammer to gauge how well the mortar is stuck down . Occasionally , a gentle tap will be enough to shift it . If not , tap a little harder with the hammer . <p> If you are unlucky enough to find that the mortar or cement is stuck hard and fast then the only choice you have is start at the top of the lump and gradually chisel your way down , removing as much as you possibly can . <p> Once you have chiselled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush and get stuck in . Brush the mortar repeatedly until your reach the surface of your path . Be careful at this point as , again , you do n't want to damage or mark the actual surface of the path . <p> Once all the lumps are up and you have removed as much of the remainder as possible with your wire brush you may be left with a stain on the paving or concrete . To remove this you can use a brick or patio cleaner . <p> Follow the manufacturer 's instructions when using this substance and also pay attention to any materials that it should not be used on as you do n't want to mark or stain any surfaces . <p> When working through the above steps please ensure that you wear the appropriate safety clothing such as a mask and protective glasses and gloves and follow the instructions on the container when using any cleaning substances . <h> Algae , Moss and Lichen Build up on Paths and Patios <p> Removing Algae from Paving and Patios <p> I 'm pretty sure anyone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete driveway or almost any other outside surface , if they went outside and checked it now that somewhere on it will be a green patch of growth . In most cases this will be Algae . <p> As said , almost all patios or paved surfaces will feature a degree of algae growth but it can be more extensive in wetter climates as the algae itself thrives off the fact that moisture , particularly rainwater , will dissolve some of the minerals in the surface its resting on that it can then feed off of . <p> In respect to ridding your surface of this growth , one of the best and most effective cleaners is ordinary house-hold bleach . <p> Get yourself a bucket or watering can and create a diluted mix of water and bleach at about 50% . Next , sprinkle the mixture over your paved or patio surface and leave it for a few minutes to get to work on the algae . Over large surfaces you can use a yard brush to spread it around evenly . <p> Once it has had a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then need to rinse it off using clean water . Where the growth is quite established you may need to repeat this process several times until it lifts the algae from the surface . <p> A few points to note is that you will need to be careful when using bleach as it is harmful to both you and any of your surrounding lawns or gardens . In the case of a spillage you will need to wash and dilute with clean water and if you get any on yourself seek medical help right away . <p> Again , this is not a " be all and end all solution " , you will need to do this every few months to ensure no significant re-growth . <p> Algae growth on patio slab <p> Removing Moss from Paving and Patios <p> In most situations moss growth is down to the fact that dirt and debris has been allowed to rest on a surface . Unlike algae and lichen that tends to adhere to a surface , moss grown on top of it in the affore mentions dirt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth is to keep your paving or patio area free from dirt buildup . On a regular basis , give it a good sweep or even hose down to remove any dirt traces that will allow moss to take root . <p> Another typical growth haunt is in the joints between paving slabs and brick and block paving . Not only does dirt and debris tend to build up in these areas but the sand in the joints themselves collects moisture providing the ideal environment for growth . <p> It 's always best to deal with the root cause of an issue like this but we should also mention weed killers . As with most things today , there are numerous types available on the market and most of them are pretty effective when it comes to killing off the moss itself , but one thing you have to be aware of is if the solution features ferrous sulphate . <p> If so then its best avoided when it comes to use on such surfaces as , regardless of the surface type , it will most probably leave a rust-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the presence of the iron or ferrous . <p> When it comes to washing down , again , as in the case of algae above , house-hold bleach is the way to go . Mix up a solution and spread over the surface and leave for a few minutes and then wash down with clean water . <p> Lichen growth over surface of patio slab <p> Removing Lichen Build up from Paving and Patios <p> Lichen growth normally appears as black or white spots on a surface and when tiny can often be mistaken for stains . It 's not until growth has been allowed to take place for a period of time that it becomes apparent that the issue in actually lichen . <p> The main characteristic of a lichen is that you will find it almost impossible to remove from a surface without scrubbing with a stiff brush or even wire brush . This is obviously not a road you want to go down due to the inevitable damage that will be caused to your patio or paving surface . <p> Again , as with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are specialist fungicidal cleaners available but in most cases they will achieve the same result as using bleach and a scrubbing brush . <p> Due to the sheer clinging force of lichen growth it is very unlikely that you will be able to shift it with one bleach application and a scrub . Instead , repeating treatments over a period of time is the way to go . <p> Working in small areas to start with , apply a diluted bleach solution to the area and allow it to sit for around an hour . Then , wash off with soapy , boiling water whilst giving it a good scrub at the same time ( do n't forget to wear old clothes , goggles and gloves ) . <p> You will need to work your way around the entire effected area over time until you have removed as much as you possibly can . In some cases , you may not be able to remove the lichen at all and if so , replacement of the slab or blocks will be the only way to go , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You should also be aware that even if you are able to remove the lichen the chances are that it will leave a mark . This is due to the fact that the lichen has removed some of the minerals from the surface while it has been feeding off of them . Again , you may be able to clean the surrounding areas enough to match but if the pigment itself has been affected then it will always be noticeable . <p> Moss growth over tarmac surface 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

A definition of a Soakaway , and how it fits into a drainage system , to make a Low Environmental Impact Drainage solution for surface water . <h> What is a Soakaway ? <p> A soakaway is simply a hole dug into the ground , filled with rubble and coarse stone which allows surface water to percolate back into the earth close to where it falls . As part of a full drainage system it is an efficient and low environmental-impact way of dealing with surface water ( also called runoff , rain water or storm water ) . There will be a pipe leading into the soakaway , from the area where there is excess water , like a gutter from a roof , a driveway drain or a French drain . <p> Soakaway construction is a low environmental impact solution to drainage because it is uses few materials . As this drainage system deals with the surface water in the area where it is occurring , you are avoiding the need for processing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also avoids the need for chemical treatments before being returned into the eco system .

The soil around where the soakaway is planned must be granular , with good drainage properties . It is pointless sinking a soakaway in clay , because what you will actually be building is a pond ! <p> Detail of a Soakaway Pit <h> Why Build a Soakaway ? <p> If you have areas of your drive or garden that are waterlogged , or you have standing water building up against walls you will need to think about installing drainage to remove surface water , preventing water damage and damp to your buildings . <p> If you are using hard landscaping in your garden , including building a driveway you must make provision to ensure that surface water is dealt with as part of the building project , rather than being directed into the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soakaway provides a Sustainable Urban Drainage System ( SUDS ) which complies with this regulation .

It requires surface water to be collected and treated where it falls ( and even reused where feasible ) . <p> A soakaway often complies with this requirement for a low environmental " impact solution to this problem . <p> Where Should I Dig My Soakaway ? <p> Most Local Authority Regulations will stipulate that Soakaways must be at least 5 metres from any habitable building . <p> It is best to locate it on the lowest part of your garden , or land , as this will mean that you have less digging down to do . Having said that you do not want a run of pipe that is longer than you need , or that has a change of direction in it , unless you have to . Both of these situations will make the pipe more susceptible to getting blocked . <p> You also need to bear in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploratory pit to check that the water table is below your intended site for your soakaway " otherwise the water you direct there will not have anywhere to drain out to . <p> Here the Water Table is Too High " Your Soakaway Should be Constructed in Well " Drained Ground and Above the Water Table <p> Land Drainage Pipe <p> The pipe flowing into soakaways should be at least 75mm diameter , which is the minimum pipe size for any surface water drainage . However 100mm is the recommended size , therefore while you are laying pipework you might as well make it 100mm to be as effective as possible . <p> Digging The Trench <p> Your soakaway pipe should be laid to a fall of 1 in 40 . So for every 4 meters of pipework the trench should slope down by 100mm . <p> The Soakaway Pipe Should Fall at a Rate of 1:40 <p> You can dig the soakaway pit and drainage trench by hand , using a shovel , or you can hire a mini digger to do the work for you . We recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> How Big Should The Soakaway Be ? <p> The size of the soakaway should be a minimum of 1m x 1m x 1m below the bottom of the incoming pipe . Other than that it depends on how much water the soakaway will be processing and the perculation rate of the surrounding soil " i.e. how quickly the water will soak into the soil around the soakaway . <p> The hardcore ( stone infill ) should completely surround the pipe , and finish approximately 100mm above it . <p> An impervious layer should then be placed on top of the stone , such as thick polythene , tarpaulin , or even a bed of concrete ( A1 below ) . Topsoil can then be placed on top of this layer to restore the garden level ( A below ) . <p> Detail of a soakaway showing the construction of the soakaway pit in cross " section with rubble infill , impervious top layer and topsoil covering <h> Soakaway Crates <p> What Is A Soakaway Crate ? <p> Due to the popularity of drainage systems such as the soakaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products available on the market that have taken the principals of construction of the affore mentioned drainage types and refined them . One such product is known as the Soakaway Crate ( or sometimes known as Aquablocks , water blocks or soakaway drainage crates ) . <p> These are very handy products in that they effectively take the place of the rubble infill in the soakaway pit . They look very similar to large milk crates but with a bit more constructive stability and are purchased in a flat pack form that you then simply clip together to form a box shape . <p> Soakaway crate <p> The two different colours of green and blue that they come in , in most cases signify where they can be used ( can vary so check manufacturers usage instructions ) and also in two different types " green and blue .

This will allow water to pass into the void of the crate but keep any soil and sediment out as this will eventually fill your crate and prevent it from draining correctly . <p> With your hole now lined you can now place your soakaway crate in , but just before you do you will notice that on one end of the crate there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock out the inside of this circular area to allow your drainage pipe to slide into the inside of the crate . <p> With the hole lined and drainage pipe inlet exposed , slide the drainage pipe into the crate and then insert the crate into the hole and wrap it in the membrane so that the entire surface of the crate is covered .

Using a paint brush in this way , i.e. for detail , is called cutting in and this is dealt with in our project about choosing a paint brush . <p> Rollers come in varying widths , from about 90 mm wide to 450mm and all have their uses . There is no correct or wrong width for any given job but the obvious thing to remember is the larger the surface , the wider the roller . <p> Paint rollers come in two parts .

The length of the hair on a roller is called the nap or pile of the roller . <p> Cheaper paint roller sleeves have cardboard tubes onto which the skin is stuck . This cardboard can get damp and break down allowing bristles and foam to work loose .

@@41624636 @1624636/ <p> How are amps worked out ? How do you know which fuse to put in ? What are kilowatts ? What part do volts play ? Just a few questions we get asked at DIY Doctor many times a week . Most will be answered in a project we have planned called : How does electric work , but for now we will deal simply with amps , kilowatts and voltage . Click on any blue links to get through to other relevant projects . <p> If you are embarking on any electrical projects in the home please see our project on electrical safety ( mentioned above ) and regulations . In particular please study the project on Part P of the building regulations . <p> Fuses are placed in a circuit to act as a weak point which will melt if things get too hot . This stops fires happening after a cable overheats or an appliance explodes . If the current flowing through a cable is too great for either the size of the cable , or the appliance it is feeding , something has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ..... Ergo , its important the right fuse is put in ! <p> A normal house hold fuse is rated at 13 amps . An amp , short for ampere is a unit of electrical current . An electrical appliance needs to have electricity flowing to it to work . How much electricity it needs to work , is measured in amps . It is very important to know how many amps each piece of electrical equipment in your home draws from the power supply because there is only a finite amount of power available before things start to cook ! <p> Choosing the right fuse <p> If you know how many amps an appliance needs , you know which part of the system to get the electricity from and which fuses to apply and which cables and wires to use to stop it , the fuses or wires overloading or overheating . <p> To work out how many amps an appliance needs to draw from the supply you need to know the Wattage of the appliance . A watt is the way of measuring the rate at which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even light bulbs , are marked with a Wattage . To stop the numbers getting too big , 1000 Watts equals 1 kiloWatt . ( Watt being the name of the guy who sorted it all out in the first place ) . To find out what size fuse to use to protect an appliance you need to know the wattage and the voltage available . Most homes in the UK are served by a 230 volt supply . The super speedy fast kettle we have in the DIY Doctor office is rated at 2500 - 3000 Watts. ( 2.5 -3kW ) We must take the larger figure for safety . 3kWatts is then divided by the voltage to give us the current rating of the cable and fuse . <p> 3kWatts divided by 230 = 13.04amps . <p> As 3000 Watts is the maximum it is safe to put a 13amp fuse in the plug . The cable size is determined by looking at our other projects . This is how amps are worked out . If you know how many amps are available , eg you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you are unsure of what you can put on this circuit , you can do the calculation the other way round . Multiply the voltage by the amps and this will give you the maximum number of Watts you can place on the circuit . <p> If your lighting circuit at home is protected by a typical 5 amp fuse you can multiply this by the voltage to get 1150 Watts . Now you can work out how many bulbs , and of what size , it is safe to have in your fittings . For low voltage lighting see another project . <p> A cooker circuit is slightly different from this however . Should you be trying to work out the size of cooker you can buy , a cooker , of 12kW or 12,000 Watts , with all rings blazing and the oven and grill firing out juicy steaks can potentially use a whole shed full of electric and should need a 52amp fuse to protect it . <p> 12,000 divided by 230 volts = 52 amps <p> But , the chances ofl every part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principle , called The Diversity Principle , is applied to the cooker circuit . For the diversity principle to be understood you must assume that the first 10 amps of current are always needed by the cooker .

The actual demand will then be , 10 amps ( used all the time ) added to 30% of the remaining 42amps ( =13amps ) making a total of 23 amps . If the cooker control unit has a 13 amp socket as well as the cooker switch ( see our cooker connection project ) another 5 amps must be added , making 28 amps .

How to fix a dripping tap including how to change a tap washer or tap seals and reseating a tap . Descriptions , explanation and parts diagrams on how to change tap washers , and the different types of washers and taps . This project also includes information on how to grind down valve seats and how to open a tap valve when it is jammed or stuck . <p> One of the most common problems encountered in the home and still one of the most misleading ... " Change the tap washer " we are told ... <p> Here is a secret ! 99% of the time a dripping tap has nothing to do with the washer which , because is it rubber , is as good as the day it was installed . The problem is normally the valve seat which the washer sits on when the tap is closed . The pressure of the water tries to force it under the washer and little by little it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiny little canals are formed in the seat which allows water to pass under the washer and out through the tap . This is very often caused by hard water and can quite often be eliminated in the future by visiting www.eddy.uk.com . We have detailed below the full procedure for changing a washer and re-grinding the seat . First , turn off the water and , if it an upstairs tap , open one of the taps downstairs to drain the pipes : The principle of " tap operation " is the same with most taps and the diagram below can be referred to for the names of various parts . <p> Individual elements that make up a pillar tap <p> The main internal elements of a tap including the circlip , jumper , washer and seat <h> Tap Indicator Covers <p> Most modern taps have the hot ( red ) and cold ( blue ) indicators on the top . These usually hide the screw which holds the handle on . The handle also acts as a cover for the valve . Before you start to dismantle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stop you losing anything down the waste . <p> Prise off the top cover with a screw driver to expose top screw <p> On most tap indicator covers , if you look closely around the edge you will see a little recess . Using a flat edge screwdriver insert the flat edge into the recess and wiggle it under the cover and prise it up . In some instances there wo n't be a recess so you will just have to use a very small screwdriver and gently slide it under the indicator cover to prise it off , being careful not to damage it . <h> Removing the Tap Head <p> To remove the tap head , simply prise off the tap indicator cover and remove the retaining screw beneath it . Once the screw is removed the tap head should then pull off . <p> Removing the cover and indicator will show the screw which can be undone <p> Once screw removed the handle should then come off <p> Occasionally , once the retaining screw has been removed the head of the tap will still not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick on the tap spindle and become jammed . <p> In this instance it 's always a good idea to firstly get some WD40 or other easing fluid and spray down into the area where the screw fixes in and also into any other areas around the tap handle/cover and also up under the bottom edge of the cover if possible . Leave for ten minutes or so to allow the fluid to penetrate and try to remove the head of the tap again . If you are still unable to get it off try applying more easing fluid . <p> The last result if after trying the easing fluid option is to lever the tap head off . As you might guess this can be quite tricky to do and the potential for damaging items is high so proceed with care and caution . <p> Using a large open-ended spanner ( or similar ) , wrap a tea towel or cloth around the largest open end ( to prevent damaging the tap or tap head ) . Now find or cut a block of wood or similar sturdy object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where the block of wood will be resting on the worktop or edge of the sink and wrap this in a tea towel or cloth . Position the open end of the spanner underneath the tap head and the block of wood under the shaft of the spanner ( keeping it as close to the tap as possible ) . <p> Now push gently down on the other end of the spanner , pushing the tap head up . Keep the spanner as close to the main body of the tap as possible so the force you are using is as vertical . <p> As said , be very careful when doing this and also ensure that wherever force is being applied you have added additional support to compensate . <h> Tap Valve or Tap Headgear <p> The next step is to release the valve , but first make sure the tap is wedged firmly in position ( if it moves while undoing a tight valve nut , it may loosen the water connection underneath ) and place a cloth over the tap to avoid scratching the metal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't allow the tap to move while undoing the headgear <p> Tap valve removed <h> Tap Washer <p> Some valves have a small retaining nut for the washer , as this one has .

Most washers are symmetrical and turning the old one over will give you a new surface to work with . <p> Individual elements that make up the tap valve <p> Tap Valve Seat <p> The operation of the tap handle , opens or closes the washer against the seat , which is a small shelf just inside the body of the tap . <p> Tap valve Seat inside pillar of tap <p> Tap Valve Seat Grinder <p> If your tap has been dripping , more often than not , small canals will have been eroded into the metal of the seat .

Glue Size ( sometimes known as primer or sealer ) will seal and prime the new plaster , stopping it from soaking up the adhesive and making the surface easier to paper on . If you do n't do this , it is likely that the adhesive will just be soaked up by the porous new plaster , and the paper wo n't stick .

In extreme circumstances the only solution may be to drain a radiator and allow any air or blockages to escape , find out hoe to do this also . <h> Why do Radiators Need Bleeding ? <p> Sometimes air can enter a central heating system and prevent it from working to its maximum efficiency . Normally you can tell this with a simple test . <p> When your heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom and cold at the top then there may be air in it . This usually happens when new water has been added from either the feed and expansion tank or simply when its topped up as a result of de furring or periodic maintenance . <p> Towels placed around radiator bleed valve to prevent carpet damage <p> Air can also be created in a central heating system by the blades of the heating pump spinning round . This air can cause air locks and stop the hot water and ultimately the heat from traveling around and completely filling your central heating system . <p> In the case of radiators it can prevent the warm water circulating from the base all the way up to the top . The usual remedy is to bleed your radiators or in some extreme cases totally drain them . <h> Bleeding a Radiator <p> Bleeding and draining radiators can sometimes be a little awkward and messy so we advise that you have some old towels , a jug or pot and also some kitchen roll or a cloth . <p> Protect Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor around the drain plug area to capture any spillage ( as seen above ) . <p> Occasionally old radiator water can be quite dirty and discoloured and if you have a light coloured carpet you do n't want to risk the possibility of any spillage ! <p> Turn off Your Central Heating System <p> NOTE : Radiators should not be bled or removed with the heating on so turn it off . Not only should you do this to prevent boiling water from squirting all over you but by not turning the heating off and trying to bleed a radiator you could inadvertently suck more air into the system . <p> Also , if your heating system features a header tank make sure that you have not cut off the water to this . <p> Old type radiator bleed valve <p> What Radiator do I Bleed First ? <p> Depending on the layout of your home will depend on what radiator you start at . If you live in a house with 2 floors ( an upstairs and a downstairs ) you will have to start with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthest away from the boiler and once you have done this you can then move upstairs using the same method . <p> If you do have any air in your radiator it will rise to the top . <p> Locating a Radiator Bleed Valve <p> On one side of the radiator there is a small square plug called a bleed valve . Depending on how old your radiators are will depend on what type of bleed you screw you have . <p> The old type can be seen in the image above , with the new type valve further down the page . <p> If you have an old type valve you will need a special key ( see image below ) to fit this bleed valve ( imaginatively called a radiator bleed valve key ) and it can be bought from most DIY stores . <p> If you have the new type valve then a bleed valve key should also fit this , but if you do not have one then you can use a flat head screwdriver ( not ideal as you have a little more control with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key <p> Loosening the Bleed Valve <p> Bleed valves can be quite delicate and on inspection you may find that yours is damaged and you are unable to loosen it with either a key or screwdriver . <p> In this instance you may have to loosen the large nut that surrounds the bleed valve ( can be seen in either of the 2 bleed valve images to the right ) using a suitable sized spanner or an adjustable spanner . This can be quite tricky so only resort to this if you have no other option . <p> Holding your kitchen towel or cloth below the bleed valve ( to catch any leakage ) turn the key anti-clockwise about a quarter of a turn ( old type valve or turn screwdriver anti-clockwise with the new type valve ) and if there is air in the radiator you will hear a hissing sound as it escapes . <p> As soon as the hissing stops a dribble of water will escape from the radiator . At this point close the key or screw very firmly . You have now bled all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next one . <p> New type radiator bleed valve <p> Top up Your Heating System <p> If your heating system features a combi boiler ( or boiler that needs to be manually topped up ) you may now need to top it up depending on how much water escaped during the bleeding process and/or how much air there was in the system . <p> If there was a long period of hissing before any water made an appearance then this could mean that your system is lacking water and needs re-filling . <p> Different manufacturers may have differing methods of refilling their boiler systems so please refer to any documentation that came with your boiler on how to do this . <p> What if Bleeding Radiators Did n't Solve the Problem ? <p> If bleeding the radiators does not solve the problem you are having with your central heating it may be that you need to remove and flush out and drain the radiators . <p> Radiator sludge produced from rust and debris in the water supply can grind central heating systems to a standstill . Use the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure this kit is to hand . <h> Draining a Radiator <p> The first task is to remove the radiator from the wall . Firstly identify the feed and return valves on your radiator and close them down fully . Slacken the bleed valve ( described above ) to remove any pressure , then re-tighten once the radiator is of normal pressure . <p> Protect Your Flooring <p> As in the example for bleeding radiators above , this can get a bit messy if you are not careful so make sure that the area you are working in is covered with old towels/sheets etc .... to ensure that you do not damage any carpeted surfaces . <p> You will also need a tray of some kind that will sit on the floor below the pipe word and the union valve and catch any escaping water <p> Radiator Feed and Union Valves with catchment tray <p> Loosen the Union Nut <p> Once you have protected the surrounding area and positioned your tray , hold the valve tightly with one spanner while you undo the union nut to the radiator with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do this see our removing a radiator project . <p> Drain the Water From the Radiator <p> Water will begin to flow from the radiator . Should the water slow down do not undo the union nut any more . Open the bleed valve a little to let some air in , this will allow the water to flow out more easily . Do not undo the union nut or remove the bleed screw totally until the radiator is completely empty . <p> The union may be re-tightened at any time during this process . If you have a large radiator and it begins to fill the catchment tray , close the union , empty the tray and repeat the above process . <p> Remove the Radiator <p> When you are sure that the radiator is completely drained you can remove it safely and then take it out side and stand it upright to completely drain . There may also be the chance that your entire heating system will need power flushing . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Advice on identifying the type of hot water system you have and the types of maintenance needed , faults with the heating system and how to carry out any maintenance needed . Advice on identifying the type of hot water system you have and the types of maintenance needed . <p> In the majority of houses in this country , there are two different types of hot water system .

It will also be necessary to asses any type of shower you may wish to install . <p> The types of domestic water heating can be broken down into two categories : <p> Hot water is stored in a cylinder <p> Cold water is heated on demand <h> Stored Hot Water <p> This category , although the hot water is always stored in a cylinder or tank , can be further divided into three categories . <p> Immersion : An immersion heater is an electric element which screws into the hot water tank . This element is wired to the mains electrical supply via an isolating switch , a thermostat to control the temperature , and sometimes a timer which enables you set the times you wish to have the water heated . Using a timer , together with a well insulated tank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at their cheapest ( Economy , 7 between 12 midnight and 7 am ) , and use it during the day . It is worth remembering that the hot water from an immersion heater is always drawn from the top of the cylinder , where it has risen over the cold water underneath ( convection current ) . The cold water , fed to the tank from underneath , gives the hot water the pressure it needs to leave the cylinder , from the top , when required by the taps . Some tanks can contain two elements , giving you a choice as to how much water you want to heat up at any one time . It is quite rare nowadays for the immersion heater to be the only method of domestic water heating in a home and the immersion is generally used as a back up to one , or both , of the following two methods . <h> Direct Boiler System <p> In older houses , with a direct system , the hot water may be stored in a square galvanised tank . The principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference , another cold water pipe runs from the base of the cylinder to the boiler . The boiler heats the water and returns it to the tank higher up . When hot water is drawn from the tank , it is replaced by cold from the cold tank , which in turn is fed to the boiler . This is direct heating of the water by either a ) the immersion or b ) the boiler . The hot water is simply stored in the tank . <p> To identify a direct water system you will find the end of the vent pipe fixed above your cold water tank . This allows for any stem expansion in the cylinder to flow directly into the cold tank and not damage the cylinder or cause air locks in the system . <h> Indirect Boiler System <p> With an indirect water system , the copper hot water cylinder contains a coil of pipe . This coil forms part of a run of pipework attached to the boiler . It is heated directly by the boiler . Indirectly , it heats the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanger " forms part of the central heating circuit , and its water heating abilities are purely a by-product of its main function , which is to heat the radiators . This heating is called the " primary " circuit , the pipes running to and from the boiler are called the primary flow and return . The hot water tank operates in exactly the same way as the direct system . <p> To identify an indirect system , you will see two water tanks in your loft . The second , smaller one , is the feed for the primary circuit . It will top up the system when necessary and will also have a vent pipe over the top . The level of water in this tank will be considerably lower to allow the water to rise as it expands when it gets hot without overflowing . <p> Both of the boiler systems above are called " vented " systems . Because of this vent pie , they are open to atmospheric pressure and operate as " low pressure " systems . They both call for cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof space . Because they are low pressure , sometimes the flow from the taps etc is not as great as one might like and pumps can be introduced , both for the domestic hot water and the heating , to give greater flow . <h> Unvented system <p> In 1989 unvented systems were allowed into general use . <p> Unvented heating system <p> Pressure vessel <p> Expansion relief valve <p> Cold water inlet <p> Temperature relief valve <p> Hot water outlet <p> Immersion heater <p> Tundish or visual overflow <p> Non-return valve <p> Cold to taps <p> Pressure limiter <p> Strainer <p> Stopcock <p> Mains <p> Discharge pipe <p> The unvented system operates purely from mains water . The principles of heating are the same , but because everything is under the pressure of the mains water , flow rates are much better ... Many safety devices are built into this system to accommodate for the greater pressure and expansion of the water . Although a small tank may be found in the loft for venting and feeding your central heating , No cold water storage tank is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 gallons for normal domestic supply , with the larger being enough to supply an average family for a day . Most cylinders are made from stainless steel but thin copper may have been used in some of the older tanks . You should make sure your cylinder is well lagged to prevent heat loss . Pre-lagged cylinders are available , which are coated with foamed polyurethane . <h> Thermal store system <p> A revolutionary new concept ( British development ) which reverses the indirect principle detailed above . The boiler heats the water and sends it to a cylinder , and then on to the central heating . On its way it heats , in the cylinder , via a very efficient heat exchanger , the mains fed water for the taps . An integral feed and expansion tank can be incorporated on top of the main tank . This system is so efficient , a thermostatic ( cold/hot ) mixer valve is built into the pipework before the hot reaches the taps or shower . For the two part tank to be viable , the system must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however it can be installed with the feed tank separately installed in the loft . This system is now available with its own dedicated boiler allowing the central heating to be switched off in summer . The ultimate in combination systems . <h> Single Point Water Heater <p> Single point water heaters come in both gas and electricity " flavour " and are sited , generally , next to the point they serve . In the case of an electric heater ( an electric shower is an example ) They must be wired to the mains via an isolating switch . A heater up to 3kw can be plugged into an ordinary 13 amp socket , but that socket must not be in reach of the water outlet . Above 3kw , the heater must be wired directly to the fusebox with a double pole isolating switch in the circuit . In the kitchen , this switch may be wall mounted , again , out of reach from the sink , but in the bathroom it must either be a cord operated switch on the ceiling , or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for differently rated heater and checks should be made for the particular heater you wish to install . <p> Single point gas heaters of the old " Ascot " type are based on a thermostat sensing the arrival of cold water into its reservoir when water is asked for from a tap . As soon as the tap is open , fresh cold water comes in to replace that being drawn from the tap . This triggers the ignition of the burners which heat the water . The hot water rises to the top and is available immediately . <p> A combination boiler combines the functions of a central heating boiler and an instantaneous multi point water heater , giving priority to the supply of domestic hot water . Combination boilers can be direct or indirect in much the same way as the cylinders above , using calorifiers ( heat producers ) to heat water passing through them . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624646 @1624646/ <h> Problems That Wet Walls , Damp Walls and Cold Walls can Cause <p> Wet walls can cause a whole host of problems in your house , and can equally be caused by a number of different things , from penetrating or rising damp in your walls through to issues with your external wall or cavity walls structure and a possible leak somewhere in your house . <p> It may be that you have entire wet walls , damp walls or cold walls or that you just have wet patches or cold spots on your walls , maybe with some black mould patches how your issues manifest is a good indication of what 's causing it and how to fix it . We discuss these indicators in more depth as well as the remedies that will dry out your wet walls and cold and damp patches . <p> Wet patches on walls can encourage black mould growth <p> The first thing you need to do is establish what 's causing your wet or damp walls . You can have a pretty good idea of this depending on how damp your walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wet Wall , Possibly With Patches of Black Mould <p> If the wet walls are in a room in your house that 's below ground , this might be caused by a leak in your water main , or the water main attached to your neighbours properties . You can get your water supplier to test the water free of charge theyll be able to determine whether the water is sewage , from the mains supply or groundwater . A list of water suppliers is available on Water UKs website . <p> If the water looks like its coming from the ceiling and then onto your wall , it may well be the central heating system that 's leaking a lot of the pipework will be going through your floors . You can check your pipes manually or get a plumber to do a pressure check to check that your pipes are free from leaks . <h> Damp Patches Only in Your Lower Wall Area , Possibly With Black Mould <p> This indicates that you may have what is known as rising damp . This is where water from the ground underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capillary action , creating damp in your walls which manifests as damp or wet patches or a whole damp section of wall just above your skirting board . These damp areas can also be marked out by yellowish or brownish stains ( known as a tide line ) and can encourage the growth of mould which turns your damp patches into black mould patches . <p> Rising Damp can cause wet patches on your lower wall area characterised by a tide line of brown or yellow staining <p> Houses usually have what 's called a Damp Proof Course ( DPC ) installed at the time of building to stop this moisture from the ground rising through your walls its a waterproof layer across your brickwork at around 6 inches above outside ground level . Rising damp can occur when this DPC is missing , broken or bridged . <p> Bridging occurs when debris inside your cavity wall ( usually left by builders at the time of construction of your property or it can build up over time ) is taller than the level of your DPC , allowing the damp to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-enter the wall above the DPC and carry on rising . <p> Damp proof course bridging can also occur externally if an outside object such as the ground in your garden or an outside series of steps has contact with your houses external wall both above and below the Damp Proof Course . <p> Again , this allows moisture to travel up and around the DPC to re-enter the wall above the DPC and carry on rising , creating damp in your walls . <p> Damp Proof Courses are built into houses to stop damp rising up your walls <p> How to Fix Rising Damp : <p> First , you should check to see if your house has a DPC . If not , one will have to be inserted . If your house does have a DPC , you need to check that it has n't  been bridged either internally or externally . To check for debris inside the cavity you will have to remove one or two bricks from your outside wall at around 6 inches height . Do not remove more than two bricks if you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . More information on removing bricks is available in our Replacing a Brick Project . <p> Once you 've removed your bricks , have a look for any debris with a torch . Remove any debris that you find by hand wearing thick gloves to protect your hands from sharp objects , dragging anything out that 's out of reach with a crowbar or similar tool . You can remove finer bits of debris with a vacuum cleaner . <p> Its much easier to check your DPC for external bridging make sure that your gardens ground is n't above the level of your DPC , and look out for external structures such as steps that also reach above the DPC . Remove these if possible . <p> If you have n't got a DPC , OR you cant remove an external bridging structure that 's present or you have n't found any debris or bridging , but you have rising damp issues ( indicating that you have a broken DPC ) you will need to insert a new DPC , above the old one if you already have a DPC in place . <p> Inserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most popular retrofit method involves drilling holes in your external and internal masonry and injecting a chemical cream DPC into those holes . The chemical mixture is absorbed by the brick and joins with itself to form a waterproof layer across your brickwork . You then fill up the holes with mortar which has a waterproofer added to it . <h> Damp or Cold Patches all Over Your Wall , Possibly With Black Mould <p> It may be that this is Penetrating Dampness caused by faulty pointing or flashing on your houses external structure , rusty wall ties in your wall cavities , a poor cavity wall insulation job or the fact that your external walls are exposed to extreme levels of rainfall . If your damp wall is on or around your chimney breast , visit our Chimney Breast Damp Project page . <p> Damp patches all over your wall are typically caused by penetrating dampness <p> Get out and have a look at your external wall that corresponds to the damp or cold internal wall . Have a look for any cracked pointing or bricks if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anything from subsidence or general movement of the house through to rusted wall ties in your cavities . <p> Cavity walls usually have ties which tie the two walls together and support them . Over time , these can get rusty , which causes them to expand and cracks the adjoining mortar . Cracks in your mortar allow rainwater to enter your walls and remain there as damp which can travel to internal walls and present as damp or wet patches . Even if not much water is allowed to enter in the crack , this ingress of outside air can cause the corresponding patch on your internal wall to be colder than the surrounding internal wall area , creating a cold patch which attracts condensation and encourages black mould growth . <p> A cold patch can also be created on your internal wall near your wall tie if the tie has been loaded up with debris like mortar . This usually happens during the building process , but debris can also accumulate over time . This debris provides a bridge for any moisture on the inside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating damp and cold patches on your wall which encourage mould growth . <p> Similarly , if there are any gaps in your cavity wall insulation as a result of your insulation being installed incorrectly , this can create cold patches on your walls which attract condensation and mould . <p> If there are any faults in your pointing , get this checked out by a reputable builder and repointed . Your builder can check the wall ties behind the cracks at the same time and replace any that are rusty . If your pointing is fine you can check if any wall ties are causing your damp problems by using a metal detector to see if there are any ties near your damp areas . If there are , you can take a look at the tie by removing one or two bricks near the tie ( information on how to remove bricks is mentioned above ) . <p> You can also remove bricks to check for any gaps in your cavity wall insulation if there are gaps , you can get your cavity wall insulation reinstalled but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consult with a couple of reputable insulation installers to get their opinion on what is best to do in your particular situation . <h> Faulty Flashing , Guttering or Roof Tiles <p> It may be that your damp walls are being caused by faults in your roof or guttering . You can use a pair of good binoculars to check your guttering , the flashing on your roof and chimney stack and your roof tiles for any breaks or damage . If there are any breaks , these may well be allowing water into your roof , where it can run down your rafters and enter your walls . <p> Broken roof tiles could be letting water into your house , creating wet patches on your walls <p> How to Fix Faulty Flashing , Guttering and Roof Tiles <p> If you do have faults in your flashings you can either get these replaced ( the better long term option but quite expensive ) or you can use flashing tape to seal the cracks yourself weve used SylGlas in the past and have found it to produce a good level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will need to replace it . There 's more information on replacing plastic guttering available in our Replacing Plastic Guttering Project page . <p> If one or more of your roof tiles is cracked you will have to replace these . How you replace the tiles will depend on what kind of tile you are using some tiles are nailed to the roof timbers and attached with mortar , whereas slate tiles are attached to to roof with a metal strip . More information on replacing roof tiles is available in this Replacing Roof Tiles video . <p> Repair your flashing either using lead sheeting or cheaper flashing tape to stop water getting into your roof and walls <h> Extreme Rainfall Exposure <p> In some circumstances the sheer level of rainfall your walls are exposed to means that even though your walls are sound , they soak up water and become damp , possibly transferring this dampness to your internal walls . <p> If you think that this is the case , you can waterproof your external walls using a liquid waterproofer . More information on how you can waterproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project page . <h> Repairing the Damage Caused by the Damp in Your Walls and Preventing Further Wet Wall Issues <p> Water getting into your walls and causing damp patches to form can cause a range of visual and structural issues in your walls . After you have solved the cause of your damp you will need to resolve the issues that the damp has caused before you redecorate . Again , the solution very much depends on the problem . <p> After the cause of your wet walls has been sorted you need to find out whether the plaster on your internal walls is sound . Tap on your plaster if it sounds hollow then it is blown , and clearly if it is crumbling away then you can again class your plaster as having blown . <p> If there are any crunchy looking salt deposits present in your plaster , its likely that this will have blown the plaster too . If this is the case , read on to the next paragraph . If your plaster is intact , then you may well be able to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to dry out thourghly first ( this can in some cases take several months ) and then assess it . In reality even if it looks ok , it 's always better to remove the affected area of plaster and re-plaster from scratch as this way you can ensure that the issue does not reappear in the future . <p> If you have any mould growth on the wall surface or there are any salt deposits ( either presenting as white staining or larger crystals ) then you should treat these before you redecorate as if you do n't then there is the good chance that these issues will reappear at some point in the not too distant future . <p> If you find that you also have black mould present on your walls then this will need to be removed before you attempt any redecoration . We advise that you use a mould killer and cleaner to ensure that all traces of the mould are removed . There are quite a few products of this nature on the market but we usually use the ACS mould killer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , as mentioned , you will need to strip this back to the bare wall and replaster ( ensuring you allow the wall to dry out first ) . If you have any mould or salt deposits on your bare wall , again treat these with an Anti-Mould Cleaner and Salt Neutraliser as mentioned above . You can alternatively add a salt neutraliser to your plaster some plasters actually come with a neutraliser already added . <p> If you have a serious problem with salt deposits in your old plaster , it may well be worth fitting a mesh membrane against the bare wall before your replaster over the top of it as this will ensure that no further salt deposits are allowed to penetrate your newly decorated surface . You can find out how to fit a mesh membrane to your wall on our Mesh Membrane Project page . <p> Fit a mesh membrane to your wall to prevent damp from washing salts into your plaster <p> If you need any further help with finding what 's causing your wet walls , please contact Property Repair Systems on 01626 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past and they are experts in this subject . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

The information you need may be in the project below . If not , call them . <p> Property Repair Systems offers you information regarding all types of roof truss component repair and treatment . This includes a helpline manned by experts . Click on the banner above to find out more . <h> What is a Roof Truss ? <p> Roof trusses are frames made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to form structurally interdependent shapes of great strength . Never remove , modify or cut into a roof truss without consulting a Structural Engineer : your roof could fall down ! <p> Roof trusses come in all shapes and sizes to suit almost every single design of roof . If you can not find the truss you need below you may need to find a good carpenter to build a traditional cut roof . This means that your roof is made up from timbers on site . If your existing roof trusses are damaged in any way it is possible to repair them without taking your roof to pieces . <h> Types of Roof Trusses Available <p> Below you will find a selection of the most common types of roof truss design and what they are called : <p> Different types of roof truss <p> Types of Roof Truss <h> What Makes a Roof Truss Stand up ? <p> The truss depends on three main characteristics , which can be given numbers so that a Structural Engineer can calculate a safe load ; <p> The strength of the timbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried timber is used and it is usually pre-treated , to prevent insect and rot attack . You can specify the TRADA Strength Grade when you buy timber for example , C16 or C24 if an Engineer supplies the Design information <p> The distribution of the load through the parts the design is critical if you take one component out , or weaken it ( say by cutting notches for pipes ) it will be seriously weakened <p> The connection of the parts the bolts , plates , screws , glue or pegs that hold it all together . These must not be cut or changed without professional advice <h> What Causes Roof Truss Failure ? <p> The biggest enemy of roof structures ( apart from the notch cutting or hole drilling electrician or plumber ) is Water . <p> Penetrating damp water leaks these lead to rot and insect attack , even in treated timber , which is not always treated all the way through its thickness . Older buildings are most susceptible , especially where the rafters or tie beams sit on , or in the walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected the wood <p> Rot and Insect Attack usually associated with dampness , but mainly in older , pre-Second World war properties , where solid , non-cavity walls or thick random stone walls support the bearing ends of the rafters and/or tie beams . Treatment with boron based preservatives is essential to stop the rot and insects from destroying the roofs structural bearings . These potentially damp areas require careful inspection with a torch and prodding with a screwdriver . Drilling with a small diameter Auger is advised , if you have any doubt about the strength of a component . <p> Joint Failure modern roof structures mostly use nail plates or plywood plates fixed with nails , screws and glue . Older roof timbers were connected with Mortise and Tenon joints , plus wooden pegs . These tend to be eaten away by woodworm and the roof beams then move , opening up the joints . Resin Repair , with Tie Bars and injected resin , can solve this problem <p> Before any repairs are made it is essential that , firstly , the cause of damage is identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hassle and cost of repairing the damage just for it to come back in the future because the root cause was not sorted . <p> Check all areas around the damaged area e.g. roof tiles , brickwork , mortar joints and pointing , chimney stack , water storage tanks , timber and woodwork ( woodworm or infestation ) , plumbing/heating system and pipework and anything else that may be unique to your property until you establish the cause . <p> Once this has been cured you can then look at getting the damaged timber(s) sorted . In most cases you have three options : <p> Removal and replacement of entire truss if it is beyond repair <p> Repair using timber resin splice <p> Repair using joist end repair plates <h> Replacing an Entire Roof Truss <p> This is obviously in the worst case scenario if the timbers are so badly damaged that there is no chance of repairing them and the only choice left is to remove all damaged trusses and replace with new ones . <p> The costs and in turn the hassle involved can be massive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come off so that suitable access can be gained for removal and replacement to take place . In most cases a crane or suitable lifting equipment will be needed to hoist the new truss in . <p> In some instances it is possible to remove the truss internally from within the loft space and then rebuilt but this depends on the type of truss and also the type of roof construction . <p> Badly rotten timbers <h> Timber Resin Repairs for Roof Trusses <p> There is always the possibility in older properties that your rafters , joists or trusses may have dropped at one end because over time the timber has become rotten and compressed due to long term exposure to damp . <p> Thanks to some incredible , yet simple technology ( the patented Timber-Resin Splice Kit ) it is now possible to replace sections of joists and rafters , in-situ . Take a look at the images below to see how this works . <p> Repairing joists in-situ with timber resin splice kit <p> As mentioned , traditionally in this situation it would be necessary to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replace it with a new one . As you can imagine this is certainly not a small job and can involve considerable cost and hassle especially if you have several damaged joists . In extreme situations , previously it may have been necessary and easier to remove the entire roof to replace these timbers . <p> With the introduction and development of systems such as the timber resin splice kit much of this hassle and stress can be removed and a repair can be implemented much more easily . The basis of the repair process is as follows : <p> Damaged timbers are identified and assessed and a decision is made as to whether they are repairable <p> Joist , rafter or truss is examined in more detail to determine the extent of the damage and the point along the length of the timber is identified where it is stable enough for the splice to be applied <p> Suitable props are put in place along the timber to support it during the repair and to take the load of the floor above and/or weight of the roof <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accessed so loft boarding or floor boards will need to be removed <p> Damaged section of timber is cut and removed leaving only healthy timber <p> New timber section is prepared by first accurately measuring what 's needed and then cutting a suitable length . Next drill the required number of holes into the front face end of the timber along it 's length and high tensile threaded steel bars are inserted and bonded in <p> New joist or truss section with threaded steel bars inserted and bonded <p> The existing timber section will now need to be prepped to take the new section . To do this you will need to cut a slot into the existing truss , rafter or joist in a " U " shape to the required length of the threaded steel bars in the new section of timber <p> Slot cut out in existing timber <p> The new section of timber is now put in place with the threaded steel bars sitting in the slot . If all faces meet flat then they are bonded together <p> Now mix the resin as directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pour the resin into the slot in the existing timber until you have filled the space to the very top . In most cases the resin will self level itself <p> Pouring resin into slot in timber <p> Leave the resin to harden as directed by the manufacturer <p> Hardened resin in slots in timber <p> Once set you can then remove the supporting props and replace any floor boards or loft boards etc .... <p> If you have several timbers that need repairing , each repair should be carried out one at a time . <h> Joist End Repair Plates for Roof Trusses <p> This method is not too dissimilar to using the method above . It involves cutting away the damaged end and replacing with a new piece but this time the two sections are joined using galvanised steel plates . <p> The basics of the process are as follows : <p> Inspect and assess the damaged section of timber and determine where it needs to be cut to <p> Prop the timber along it 's length using suitably sturdy props such as acro props <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-damaged timber <p> Now , measure and cut a replacement piece of timber . This has to be the same size in width and depth as the old e.g. if the old timber is 8 x 4 inches then that is what you will need to use <p> Next , sit the new timber into the repair plate(s) . Depending on the manufacturer will depend on the types of plates you have . Some will be a " U " shape and some will be two " L " shape sections . Ensure that the timber is pushed flat against the base of the plate unit or plate sections and then screw into place using coach screws <p> Position the new timber with fixed repair plates into place with the non-plate end sitting in or on top of the wall depending on how the original was and ensure that the plate end sits over the original timber and that they are butted together firmly <p> Before screwing the plate to the existing timber it might be a good idea to get another prop and position it under the plate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With both timbers joined securly in position you can now slowly release and remove the props <p> NOTE : Make sure that you check you have the correct end plates by following the manufacturers guidelines . It is essential the plates themselves are capable of supporting the weight they will be carrying ! <p> As with any repairs to structural supports or structurally integral items in your home we certainly advise that you seek advice from a qualified builder/expert in this area or structural engineer before you attempt any fixes or repairs yourself . <p> If you need help with timber repairs , rot or insect attack , or with timber treatment products , Property Repair Systems staff will be pleased to give you completely free , no obligation advice on 01626 336180. 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

@@41624651 @1624651/ <p> One of the best ways of preventing damp travelling through the walls of a property and affecting the internal surface of the facing walls within your house is to build with a cavity however in some cases this itself can actually cause cavity wall damp issues . <p> Below is a list of ways a cavity can be compromised and allow damp through to the inside as well as a suggested fix for each issue . <p> If you would like some additional expert advice please call Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 , free of charge and no obligations involved . <h> Testing for Potential Damp Issues <p> Initially it is a good idea to firstly establish if you do indeed have cavity wall damp . There are two different ways of checking this : <p> Back of Hand - You can use the back of your hand and feel for damp , obviously not the most accurate of measurements but can in serious damp cases indicate issues with little , if any , initial expense . <p> Damp Meter - For a more accurate measurement you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two different types of damp meter , a Relative Humidity Meter or Hygrometer ( these measure the amount of moisture in the air within a room space ) and a Damp Testing Meter ( these can be used to test the damp within actual materials such as plaster , timber or brick ) .

This means in essence that on the outside of your property there maybe a section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a newly built structure that is now butting up to your property e.g. a set of steps or a conservatory/outbuilding , that is now bridging the gap above and below the original damp proof course and providing any damp or moisture a direct route around the damp proof course and up into the external wall . <p> In the majority of cases a decent , clear cavity should stop any cavity wall damp or moisture penetrating into the inside wall but in the odd instance , the moisture can travel up the wall and meet a connecting medium such as a wall tie and gain access to the inside wall . <p> Good Example of Clear Damp Proof Course <p> Fix - To cure this issue you essentially have several options . The ideal fix is to clear the bridging structure e.g. dig back the garden and leave a gap between it and the external wall exposing the damp proof course , remove the sloping ground or remove the conservatory or adjoining structure . In the case of the latter two items ( conservatory or joining structure ) this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent 20,000 on building the conservatory . If this is the case then this is quite a sizeable mistake on the builders part . <p> In the case that you are unable to clear the obstruction the best and easiest fix is to add a new damp proof course . There are quite a few products on the market today that enable you to DIY it quite quickly and easily such as Permagard or Twistfix . One that we have used on several occasions and found to give great results is UltraCure DPC Cream find out more about it here . Find out more about Damp Proof Injection and Damp Proof Courses in our DIY project . <h> Bridged Cavity or Filled with Rubbish <p> Issue : Bridged Cavity or Filled with Rubbish - The cavity void itself has been filled with rubbish and debris such as broken pieces of brick , mortar spillage or sand that has been dropped during the construction stage . As we know , the main point of the cavity is to keep water and moisture away from the inner walls of a property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs down the inside of the outer wall , hits the Damp Proof Course and then runs back out . The introduction of debris to the void then blocks the channels used by the moisture to leave and also gives it a direct route to the inner wall , creating cavity wall damp . <p> Worst Case Scenario - Poor Cavity void <p> Fix - As you may have already guessed , the only way to fix this is to clean the cavity out . To do this you will need to remove 1 or possibly 2 bricks at floor level or as close to floor level as possible . ( NOTE : do not remove anymore than 2 bricks at a time . If you need to remove more than 2 bricks please consult with a surveyor or reliable builder ) . This may sound like a bit of a daunting task but it 's quite easy ( see our Replacing a Damaged Brick project for more information ) . Once you have removed your brick(s) you can then use a camera or mobile phone with a light to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this you should be able to see its condition and any rubbish that may be there . You can remove the rubbish by hand ( wear some sturdy gloves as there may be sharp objects in there ) and where debris is out of reach , use a bar or scraping device to drag it back . For a fine clean , use an old vacuum cleaner to suck up any smaller objects . Once done you can now replace your bricks . <h> Wall Ties Dirty or Corroded <p> Issue : Dirty or Rusty Wall Ties - Another way that damp and marks can appear on inner walls and affect the surface is due to the wall ties that are used to tie walls together . In some situations wall ties can become dirty , normally mortar sitting on them created at the time of construction , or possibly condensation allowed to collect on them due to gaps in mortar , leaking roof , gaps around window sills etc .... that allows moisture and cold air to enter the cavity ( which is technically known as Interstitial Condensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold bridge " . This causes a difference in temperature around the affected area on the inner wall and create a cold spot . The cold spot then allows moisture to condense much more easily than in the surrounding areas . This usually appears in the form of damp or mould . <p> In some cases wall ties can become rusty and corroded ( again normally due to long term exposure to moisture from gaps or leaks ) . The act of rusting then in most cases creates its own gap that in turn allows moisture and cold air to penetrate the cavity and produce a cold spot on the inner wall . This type of issue can usually be easily spotted as cracks can be seen in the external mortar between the bricks or stones . <p> Wall Tie Positioned Between Mortar Joints in Internal Cavity Wall <p> Fix - Again as with the fix for a Bridged Cavity , you may have already guessed that the only way to properly diagnose and fix this issue is to remove a brick and possibly replace the wall tie itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your local hire shop ) locate the suspect wall tie on the outer wall , using the damp on the inner wall as a reference to the rough area . Once the tie 's been located remove the brick that connects to the tie and inspect the condition of the wall tie . If the tie is dirty , clean it properly . If it needs replacing then see our Checking Wall Ties DIY Project . <h> Fixings , Wires and Pipes <p> Issue : Fixings , Wires and Pipes inside the Cavity Void - In some properties there can be a great deal of service fixings , bolts , screws , wires and pipes that penetrate the inner cavity wall and sit inside the cavity void itself . This can cause cavity wall damp issues as if there is an item poking into the void from the inner cavity wall then any damp , leakage or moisture then has a direct route into the property and on to the inside wall surface . <p> As in some of the issues above this can create cold spots on inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ( or the gap opposite if the item in question spans both walls and exits the property through the external wall ) can seep through any gaps around the fixing creating a cold spot and allowing condensation and mould to develop or in the case of air moisture or a leak dripping on to the fixing , pipe , wire etc .... itself , allow the moisture to run onto the inner cavity wall and possibly through any gaps around the fixing itself and directly onto the inside of the property . <p> Occasionally moisture can run down a fixing and then on down the inside wall and appear as a damp problem elsewhere on the wall so be aware of this ! It 's also worth giving your property a good going over if you are experiencing moisture or damp issues as it may be the case that it is not getting into your property exactly where you think it is and your cavity wall damp may be the sign of something much more serious such as a leaking roof ! <p> Obvious Gap Around Pipe in Internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the object ( if possible ) and properly seal up the remaining hole using the correct material , either mortar or an air tight sealing compound . Make sure that any holes are sealed on both the inner and outer wall as you do n't want further cold air , moisture or damp to continue to access the cavity area and cause the cavity wall damp . <p> If it is not possible to remove the object then make sure that any gaps around it are sealed tightly . In this instance it 's probably best to use a flexible filler as with heating pipes especially , they contract and expand depending on temperature and so a rigid filler can quickly crack and fall out creating the problem once more . <p> It may be also be worth moving a brick from the external wall near to where the damp or mould etc .... is manifesting itself and then inspecting with a camera , mobile phone or borescope to see if you can physically see the source or the issue . <h> Poor Cavity Insulation <p> Issue : Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name - some cavity insulation companies perform sub standard work . They will only part-fill the cavity ( in some cases we have known cavities to have only been filled 400mm up from floor level as let 's face it , their work is going to be hard to check , so how would you know ! ) , filling holes are drilled too far apart creating gaps in the insulation and cold spots on inner walls around these gaps ( usually if the cavity gap is narrow and does not allow much insulation to be pumped in ) , the cavity void was not inspected before insulating and is full of debris etc .... <p> As you can see from the above there is a potential minefield of issues that can arise from a poor cavity insulation job so please , please do your research before hand and select the right type of insulation ( there are quite a few on the market at present - foam , polystyrene balls , rockwool etc .... ) and the right installer ( check their credentials , previous jobs etc .... ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation can be very effective and provide considerable savings on your heating bills . <p> Fix - Unfortunately there is no real magic cure for a poor insulation job . The only real thing that can be done is to firstly check the job and establish what the issue is ( gaps , not filled correctly etc .... ) by removing bricks and then potentially try a re-injection of the insulation , though removal of the old insulation first may be necessary , if it is even possible . Before you go ahead and try this always consult with a reputable and professional insulation company , again do your research first ! <h> Fixing Cavity Wall Damp Damage on Internal Walls <p> In the event that your property is suffering from cavity wall damp problems these can manifest themselves as several different issues on the ground floor walls of your property giving a good indication of the potential issues that you are experiencing . Some of these issues and their potential fixes are outlined below : <h> Blowing Plaster and White Salts <p> Issue : Plaster Blowing off Walls - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before you attempt to fix the blown plaster you have to get the source leak sorted Iif you do n't it wo n't be too long before the plaster starts to blow again . Visually blown plaster is quite easy to spot as you can see any damp spots on wallpaper as it starts to flake off of the wall it 's the same with paint . With bare plaster this is also similar as you can see the plaster bulging , flaking and falling off the wall . A common indicator is also a white salt-like substance around the affected area ( efflorescence , hygroscopic salts ) . <p> Plaster Blowing off of Wall <p> Fix - Once you have fixed the leak at source and are sure that you are not going to experience any further cavity wall damp issues , leave the area to dry correctly ( how long this takes will depend on the materials used , bricks , blocks , type of plaster , humidity , temperature , whether there is cavity insulation present etc .... ) . A dehumidifier may help here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you should be fine and it will not need replacing . You can then go ahead and redecorate the area . If mould is present then you will also need to treat with an anti-fungal or mould inhibitor to ensure no mould is allowed to grow again . <p> In the case that you have found a white salt-like substance you will need to remove everything from the damaged area ( paint , wallpaper and plaster ) down to the bare wall and replaster and redecorate from scratch . Before you do so you will need to apply a Salt Neutraliser/Inhibitor ( a clear liquid used to neutralise ' salts ' in render , plaster or masonry . We use Property Repair Systems Salt Neutraliser . With the salt neutraliser now added ( in accordance with manufacturers guidelines , allowing to dry as required ) you can replaster and redecorate . <p> Salt Neutraliser <h> Damp Patches ( Walls and Chimney Breast ) <p> Issue : Damp Patches - If you have damp patches appearing at a low level around the skirting area that appear to disappear and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hygroscopic Salts . When these salts are present they can attract moisture from out of the air and cause damp patches to appear and , as in the above Blowing Plaster issue , can cause the plaster to blow off of the wall resulting in a fair amount of cost and hassle to put it right . <p> If the damp is present constantly and appears higher up the wall then the most likely cause is moisture/water entering the cavity wall of the property at some other location . <p> Have you ever noticed a yellowy , brownish stain in the wallpaper around a chimney breast ? If so then this is evidence of damp or hygroscopic chimney salt , which as in the case of salt above , is attracting moisture from the air and causing damp to appear . As it 's around the chimney area , the act of burning coal or wood and some of the minerals found in some materials helps with the creation of the yellow and brown staining and if the damp is coming from the chimney itself then this can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fix - If you have checked all the external walls of your property , the roof , any fixings , pipes or wires , cavity insulation issues and all are okay then the issue may be the result of Rising Damp caused by bridging of the damp proof course or it 's failure . Establish if the DPC has been bridged and fix if you can . If you are unable to or there is no bridging present then the introduction of a damp proof course may be required . As commented above there are quite a few chemical DPC companies on the market offering products that can be applied quickly by the DIYer . We tend to use Quick Cream Ultracure DPC from Property Repair Systems as it 's quick and easy to install , produces no chemical smell , is British Board of AgrFment approved and gives great results . <p> If the issue is not due to rising damp and the damp patches are appearing further up wall areas then you have another cavity wall damp issue . Again , using all the information narrow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allow the area to dry out completely and then you can redecorate <p> In the event that white Hygroscopic Salts are present you will need to add a salt inhibitor to the surface before you redecorate . If the plaster dries out okay and can be saved , add the inhibitor on top of the plaster ( following manufacturers guidelines , as to whether you can add the inhibitor on top of the plaster ) to prevent any further salt damage . If the plaster can not be saved then it will all need to be removed . Add the salt inhibitor directly on to the wall and then replaster over the top and then redecorate <p> In the case of chimneys , this can be a little trickier to diagnose , as the leak may be coming from the roof ( where the roof seals around the stack , cracks and damage to lead flashing ) , from the cavity area , from moisture or humidity inside the chimney due to a poorly capped chimney , broken stack , mortar damage to stack , broken chimney pot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need all checking out first and fixing if required . Again , following the guidelines above , add salt inhibitor if required , replace any damaged plaster and then redecorate <p> In very extreme situations the salt neutraliser itself may just not be enough to cope with the amount of salts present . In this situation , you may need to apply a membrane over the top wall surface ( with salt neutraliser applied ) before you then replaster ( similar to dry lining and looks like a dimpled plastic ' air gap ' , find out more about Mesh Membrane on the PRS website . In the past we have used the Mesh Membrane from PRS and found it to remove any future salts once plastered over . <p> Mesh Membrane to Hold Back Salt <p> DIY Doctor have worked closely with Property Repair Systems for a number of years and we have found their products to be reliable and of a high standard .

We explain how high to hang wall units and how to get them level . We also advise how to fit kitchen units without brackets , using an example of horizontal units which screw directly to the wall . To help you with your project we include pictures and instructional video . <p> You will need to work out how high to hang wall units and how to get your wall units level , even on walls where the floor or ceiling are not level , and we give you the information you need in this DIY project . <p> Actually putting the kitchen units together requires that you know the basics of how and why you are doing what you are told to do by the instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way or at least using the same principles . So as long as you are aware of this , you can cope quite easily with any of the slight variances that exist between all the different kitchen suppliers . <p> Make sure you read the instructions through completely before you start to put the kitchen cupboard together . Also you should check that all the component parts of the unit have been supplied . <h> Wall Unit Styles and Sizes <p> Standard wall units are usually supplied in 300mm , 400mm , 500mm , 600mm , 800mm , 1000mm and 1200mm wide , depending on the manufacturer . <p> It is worth noting that base units come in similar sizes , and it makes good design sense to match the sizes of the wall units with the base units below them if you can . The size of the carcass might differ between top and bottom , but try to match up the sizes of the doors between wall and base units . <p> There are also corner cupboards and these come in different styles , one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one concertina door ( see middle image below ) , or a normal wall unit but with just one door ( see left hand image below ) , the other is a quadrant style that creates a diagonal in the corner , and may have one or two doors , but they also come as open shelving units . <p> Different Styles of Corner Wall Units <h> Hanging Kitchen Wall Units <p> Some kitchen wall units are hung onto brackets and others are screwed through the back or sides . <p> The ones that are supposed to be screwed through the back or sides will always have special strengthening timbers fitted or they will be made up of 15mm boards . You should never attempt to hold up a unit by screwing through a flimsy hardboard back , because if the weight of the cupboard itself does n't pull it off the wall , then putting anything in it certainly will do . It is likely that the screws will simply pull through the hardboard , if not immediately then at some point in the future ! <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers <p> In this project we are going to show you how to install both types of kitchen wall units " with brackets and without " so you can see the different methods of hanging each type of wall unit . <p> For the purposes of this project we are fitting two units with hanging brackets at each side and two ( horizontal ) units which screw directly to the wall . These horizontal units are also fixed to the units which are hung on brackets to form a group of units . See the picture above . <p> The featured kitchen units have a high gloss finish and they come with a protective film to prevent scratching while in transit , we left this on while fitting to make sure they remained protected during the construction and hanging process . The blue colour is the protective wrapping these units come with . <h> How High to Hang Wall Units ? <p> The first job is to set out your units properly . Wall units are usually fitted or hung with the bottom of the unit 600mm above the worktop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600mm is not " a golden rule " and some wall units are placed at around 450mm to 500mm above the top of the worktop . The important thing is to work out how close to the ceiling you want the top of the wall unit . If there is a cornice on the top you will need at least 200mm to allow you to fit the cornice easily <p> Allow about 600 mm between Kitchen Worktops and the bottom of the Kitchen Wall Units to give yourself enough room to work <p> The standard height for kitchen base units is 870mm from the floor to the top of your base cabinets . This measurement includes 150mm to allow for plinths and legs . The important thing here is of course , the height of the appliances going under the worktop . There is always adjustment on the legs of the base units and there are no actual rules to follow although we would not suggest that the kitchen worktop itself was much more than 900mm off the floor . <p> The worktop will sit on top of the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen worktops , before measuring up the distance you are going to allow between worktop and wall unit . <p> Usually wall units are fitted at between 450 to 485mm above the worktop . This is so that the wall units are the same finished height of a tall appliance housing which is usually around 2117mm high . <h> Altering the Height of Kitchen Units <p> If you have very high ceilings or the person who spends most time in the kitchen is tall you may want to adjust the height that you hang your wall units , to suit your own preference . All you need to be sure of is that the units are at the same height and are level all around the room . <p> You can also adjust the height of the base units slightly to suit your needs . Kitchen base units have adjustable legs to alter the height . These will only give you a few centimetres difference . If you want major changes in height you will need to prop up the legs or cut down the units . However if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can buy smaller doors to fit the units , otherwise you may need to make bespoke doors . <h> Fixing Kitchen Wall Units on Brackets <p> The first job with wall units that are hung onto brackets is to work out where the wall brackets will go . The manufacturer 's instructions will show you the distance from the bottom of the unit to the hanging bracket on the unit and this can be marked on the wall , along with the distance between each of the brackets . <p> Once the wall brackets are fixed you can fix the cupboard hanging brackets inside the cupboard . The back board of the wall unit will have two cut " outs for the hanging arm of the bracket to fit through . There are two screws at the back of the internal wall unit bracket . One adjusts the height of the bracket for fine tuning on the wall and the other pulls the unit in towards the wall to keep it tight against it . This reduces the strain on the fixings once the cupboards are filled . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a group of units they sit in-between the two wall units that we hung on brackets ( see above ) . So for additional strength we fixed screws into the horizontal units through the inside of the vertical units , but to make sure this did not look unsightly we put the screws in behind the hinges where they wo n't be seen ( see below ) . <p> Hinge holes for wall unit door <p> This Image ( above ) shows the two holes which are put in place by the manufacturers ready for the cupboard door hinge to be fixed to . You can see we have placed a screw in between these to fix through to the vertical unit . <p> Using simple tricks like this keeps every job neat and tidy , to give a professional finish , as well as doubling up on safety and strength . <p> Door Hinge fixed to Wall Unit " This completely covers the securing screws we put in 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624656 @1624656/ <p> Summary : How to tank walls that are wet or below ground . Advice on installing air gap membranes . In this project guide learn all about tanking wet or damp walls to solve damp and mould problems and also unwanted moisture and water presence . Also learn about using air gap membranes to provide a barrier between damp surfaces and inner wall decorative surfaces . <p> Damp walls are cold walls , fact ! Water and moisture that is allowed to pass through a wall onto it 's inner surface will inherently maintain that area at a cooler temperature than it 's surroundings . When this this allowed to happen it can cause condensation build up and black mould growth . <p> Additional when moisture passes through a wall it can also carry salts and minerals with it . When these salts reach the inner decorated surface that 's normally covered with plaster or paint it will completely ruin painted and wallpapered surfaces and also eventually blow the plaster off the wall . <p> When a walls surface is below the damp proof course , partially below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be damp due to the fact that it 's surroundings naturally contain water and moisture . <p> If after reading through this guide you would still like some more help and advice you can call Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 . Any advice in on a no obligation basis and is free ! <h> What is Tanking ? <p> The traditional method of dealing with this was to batten the inner wall surface out and panel over the top of it . This would be ok for a while but due to the moisture presence , eventually the wooden paneling would itself become damp and then rot . <p> As technology has evolved , this eventually gave birth to tanking . Tanking is effectively a liquid coating that bonds to damp masonry and then cures to form a waterproof barrier . <p> This project deals with tanking wet or damp walls and keeping water and moisture at bay to prevent it from damaging inner surfaces . If after reading this project you still need advice on any aspect of tanking or damp walls then contact Property Repair Systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist you . <h> Tanking Walls for Damp Proofing Choice of Methods <p> The is essentially three main methods for tanking wet walls and they are : <p> Cement based slurry applied by soft brush onto damped , cleaned brickwork , stone , block or render easier to apply because the cement base wants to amalgamate with the masonry and mortar . Not a true vapour barrier , so needs to be finished with breathing materials . Ideal for partial below ground situations or exterior coating on foundation walls . <p> Air gap membranes not strictly tanking in the same way as liquids it is a dimpled plastic sheet fixed onto brick , stone , block or render with plastic plugs to form an air gap cavity . These Membranes can have a plain surface , for battening or a Mesh surface for direct plastering or plaster boarding . Ideal for cold , single leaf walls and for lining rooms with cold solid 9 inch walls . <h> Tanking Slurry and Cementitious Slurry How to Apply <p> Remove any old plaster from the walls surface . This also includes any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other items that should n't be there . Once the walls surface is free and clear of dust and any other rubbish wash it down thoroughly with fresh water . <p> Now , ensure that there is no active water seeping from the wall . If there is then you will need to create some relief holes and also a drainage solution . This can be a tricky job and will probably require expert advice so you will need to consult with specialist - Property Repair Solutions are on hand to supply any required advice , call them on 01626 336 180 <p> Now apply a Salt Neutraliser to the surface to prevent any salts from compromising your new tanking layer . Salt neutraliser is typically a clear liquid that neutralises the salts that are found in masonry , plaster and render .

Mix in a 4:1 ratio to ensure the correct consistency . It is also a good idea to add a waterproofer or plasticiser product such as Renderproof to the cement mix as this will aid in the cement bonding with the sand and prevent moisture passing through <p> Next dampen the wall again and apply a coat of tanking slurry or solution to the walls surface . Tanking slurry 's will either come premixed or in a powder form . If in a powder form such as the one available from Property Repair Systems you will need to mix it with water ( refer to manufacturers specifications for specific amount of water ) until it resembles a soup like consistency .

Once totally dry the surface can then be replastered with a renovating plaster , painted over with a microporous paint or traditionally rendered with sand and cement <p> Aside from tanking there are other methods of water proofing and damp proofing walls such as using a plastic lining membrane ( also known as air gap membranes or damp proof membranes ) to line a wall and provide a barrier between it and a walls surface . Depending on how much water or moisture you have coming through your wall , using a lining membrane may be a better solution than simply tanking . Here follows a brief explanation on how to install linings - for a full run down on the process see our lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be left on the walls surface ( cement and sand render is ok to stay ) . Also remove any other items that should n't be there such as wall plugs , wooden plugs and timbers <p> As in the tanking method above , check if you have any water seepage coming through the wall . Additionally also check if there has been a history of any flood damage . If you do have water penetrating the walls surface you will need to install a drainage solution such as a traditional drain or a sump and pump to remove the excess water <p> The next task is then to apply fix your chosen lining membrane to the walls surface . There are many available on the market but we tend to use the Kontact Membrane available from Property Repair Systems as we have found this to be one of the best .

Once it has been lined you can then cover and finish using floating tongue and groove chipboard or you can also apply a concrete screed . When there is physical water seeming up you will need to bond the wall and floor membranes together to create a ? sealed system ? .

@@41624662 @1624662/ <p> Summary : Find out how to diagnose faults with TRV 's and also how to fix , fit or change thermostatic radiator valves yourself . Work through our simple trouble-shooting guide to ensure that all the TRV 's are working well and you keep them well maintained and working . Understand which side of the radiator the TRV should go , how to fit it and make sure that they are working well . Learn about common TRV problems and how you can get over them . <h> What Is a TRV or Thermostatic Radiator Valve ? <p> A Thermostatic Radiator Valve ( or TRV ) is a valve which is fitted to a radiator in a hot water heating system that is self-regulating ( sets the temperature of the radiator automatically ) based on the temperature of the room . It controls the room temperature by altering the flow of hot water to the radiator . <p> In simple terms , it is a valve that can be set by the homeowner to turn on and off the radiator ( when the heating system is active ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level of temperature control in every room of the house , which one would not normally be able to achieve , even with a thermostat controlling the main heating system . <p> They were invented in Denmark and started to be use initially in the 1970s . In Europe they are widely used , particularly where it is common to have a shared boiler supplying heat to all the flats in a block . There is a need to control the heat into each separate apartment and this is done very effectively with the use of these thermostatically controlled valves fitted to each radiator . <h> The Benefits and the Disadvantages of Having TRVs Fitted <p> The main benefit of having TVRs fitted is one of economic and energy saving grounds . They are thermostatic so they can control the temperature in individual rooms regardless of the temperature of the most commonly used habitable rooms , where typically the room thermostat will be located and which controls whether the heating systems as a whole comes on or goes off . This prevents over heating it two key circumstances : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same temperature as the main living rooms , such as bedrooms perhaps , the TRV can be set lower and the room will only be heated to the lower temperature before the thermostatically controlled valve will activate and stop the flow of hot water to the radiator <p> In the main living rooms where there might be a secondary source of heating ; this could be another heating appliance or it could be the sun ( solar gains ) or from having a lot of people in the room . The TRVs will switch the radiator off when the rooms reaches the desired temperature , therefore preventing overheating <p> By preventing overheating you are preventing excess heat being generated , saving money and carbon being wasted on the fuel burn for unwanted heat . This is the reason that the government see TRVs as a good solution and are encouraging their use by inclusion of rules in the building regulations . <p> Other benefits include the extra flexibility that they provide the home owner by allowing them to have some control on the temperature in individual rooms . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference . If a room is not being used , they can be set to their lowest temperature setting maintaining the room temperature at a chilled level , without wasting energy or risking frost damage . <p> TRVs are very easy to change so they can be altered in seconds should a room be occupied again after a period of low usage . <p> Essentially , the disadvantages of TRVs stem from the fact that they are fairly crude devices that can be fooled about the actual temperature in the room , such as by draughts making then believe the room is too cold , or a lack of ventilation around them making then think the room is too warm when it is not . <p> Despite being relatively simple devices , they can indeed breakdown and fail . If they are off when they break , then the radiator will fail to come on when required and could lead to condensation and other problems . If they break when on , then they will lead to overheating which is the problem that they are designed to cure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years without major problems . However , if you are reading this project it is highly likely that you will be experiencing an issue with your radiator valves , so this is what we will cover next . <h> Parts of a Thermostatic Radiator Valve <p> There are several core parts that make up a TRV and ensure that it operates in the manner that it should . See the image below for a full breakdown on the individual parts of a TRV : <p> The parts of a Thermostatic Radiator Valve <h> One Radiator Not Getting Hot <p> It can be hard to identify if there is an issue with a TRV because you are actually trying the address symptom rather than the cause , which could be many other things other than a faulty TRV . The most common issue for which TRVs can be the cause is that there is one radiator that is not getting hot , while all the others in the house are . <p> It is important to work systematically and rule out potential issues , starting with the easiest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Most TRV 's are now universal and can be fitted on the flow or the return however older ones were not . Generally this leads to noisy bangs so you would probably know this , however it will take seconds to check that the arrows on the valve are pointing in the right direction ( or both directions for a universal valve ) . Note that they might be on the wall side of the valve , so you may have to feel for them <p> Arrow showing the direction of flow through an old TRV <p> Check that the TRV has not seized or got stuck : You will need to remove the top of the TRV which contains the thermostat and then check to see that the plunger that operates the valve can be depressed . ( See below or the video for full details about how to do this ) . It might be necessary to oil the plunger with a little WD40 or similar lubricant . If it stays stuck a careful knock with a hammer might just free it . If this does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do it replace the valve <p> Check the thermostat : If the valve is freely moving , and the radiator is working when the thermostat cap has been taken off , but stops again when you replace it , the thermostat is likely to be the problem . They work with an expanding wax capsule which can sometime solidify and stops the TRV working . Change this and it should start to work again <p> Check the lock shield valve : By now you will be pretty sure that the issue is not with your TRV , so you need to check the valve at the other end of the radiator . This is the lock shield valve and should be left open all the time while the heating system is operating normally . Check that this is open by opening it a little further or by closing and opening it again <p> Lock shield valve with drain value open and close the valve on the top with a wrench <p> Airlock or blockage : It is likely that if both valves are function properly then the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to force the water through by closing of all the other radiators and then turning the heating on , using the room thermostat . This just might produce enough pressure to force through the blockage , if you are lucky <p> Drain the Radiator : At this point you will have to drain the radiator , which could resolve the issue , however once you have gone to the trouble of doing this it is probably worth removing and trying to flush the radiator out before refitting it or even replacing it with a new one ( depending on the state of the old one ) . For more information about draining a radiator see our project to help you <p> If one of your radiators is not getting hot , then this process should help you get to the bottom of the issue , and certainly fin or rule out the TRV at the cause . However prevention is the best cure , and there is a little simple maintenance that can be done which will make sure that you <p> There are several things that can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices it is not too difficult to diagnose the problem . It is recommended to maintain them to ensure that they last and perform well . <p> The most common problem with a TRV is that the valve sticks or catches . This means that they are either stuck open or closed . This will happen when the setting has not been moved for some time , such as after the summer . <p> Solution and Maintenance : Set the TRV to the highest heat setting ( generally number 5 ) which will open the valve fully . Then undo the thermostat removal nut , which you should be able to do by hand . When the thermostat unit comes off , you should see the little plunger or piston , which should be able to be depressed and then should spring back up when released . If this is very stiff or catching , give it a little squirt of WD40 and work it a little until it slides freely . An annual check and squirt of WD40 is advisable to keep the TRV working efficiently . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valve has failed and will need to be replaced completely . See below section on how to change a TRV for help with this . <p> Check that the metal piston or plunger can move freely it is quite stiff ! ( Note you do n't  need to remove your TRV to do this ) <p> The second problem that can occur is that the thermostat can fail . If the valve is working , and the plunger is moving freely , it is likely that the thermostat is not depressing and releasing the plunger , therefore opening and closing valve as it should . The thermostats is relatively simple which uses a trapped bubble of gas , liquid or wax to expand and contract with the change in temperature of the room to move the plunger . <p> Solution and Maintenance : If the thermostat has stopped working there is nothing you can do except replace it . Before you do buy a new one it is worth making sure that this is the problem , but swapping the thermostat with a working TRV and confirming that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRV it is worth opening and closing the TRV fully several times to get the mechanism working . Do this several times per year to stop the plunger or piston seizing up . <h> Changing an Old for a New TRV or Changing a Lockshield Valve for a Thermostatic Radiator Valve <p> If you have an old or broken Thermostatic Radiator Valve ( TRV ) which you would like to change , or you have a radiator with two lockshield valves and you would like to change it for a new TRV , these are the steps that you should follow : <p> Shut off the water to the heating system and then electrically turn everything off : all the programmers should be turned off and all the room thermostats are turned right down so that they are not calling for more heat . If the system is dry and the pump comes on this is likely to damage the pump and you can overheat the boiler <p> Drain off the radiator : Find the drain off nearest the radiator that you are working on . Make sure that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain off and run it outside or to a suitable drain . Put a towel or absorbent cloth under the drain off to catch any drips and leaks . Undo the drain off using an adjustable spanner , grips or a star key : <p> Undo all the bleed keys on all the radiators in the whole house : Use a radiator bleed key to do this and let air into the system ; you will hear this happening when you open each of the keys . This prevents water being trapped by a vacuum in the system which could be released later while you are working , causing a real mess ! Give the system quarter of an hour to drain down completely . An ideal time to go and have a cup of tea ! <p> Removing the old TRV : Now that the system is completely drained down , at least above where you are working , you can remove the radiator valve which could either be one of the lockshield valves if there are two , or the old TRV . Put a towel under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water which will drip as you undo the valve . Grip the body of the TRV with a pair of grips and while holding this steady push down on the radiator securing nut on the radiator side of the TRV , as shown below . Slacken this off , but do not undo it completely quite yet <p> Loosen the radiator securing valve on the TRV <p> Once the radiator securing nut is loose : Slacken off the nut at the bottom of the TRV , while still holding the body of the TRV with your grips . ( See the picture below ) . Undo this nut completely , and then you should be able to return to the radiator securing nut and undo this one completely with your fingers too <p> Undo the nut at the base of the TRV completely <p> Remove the TRV : You might need to work it loose but it will come off . There might be a little water that spills out from the pipe or radiator , but your towel should catch this <p> Clean pipes and joints to remove paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pipes and joints with a cloth before apply jointing compound in order to get a tight seal when the new valve is fitted . Modern TRV are universal valves meaning that the water can flow either way through them without adjustment , but check this before you fit the new valve . There will be small arrows on the valve body which point both ways indicating that water can travel through the valve in both directions . If you are unsure , please read the manufacturers information which comes with the valve <p> Fitting the new TRV body to the pipe form after applying jointing compound <p> Once you have fitted the TRV body into place , you can tighten up on both the nuts that you undid to remove the old TRV <p> Tighten up both nuts to secure the TRV body in place <p> For the more advanced : It is possible to remove the olive from the inlet pipe and then replace the connecting nut at the base of the TRV body . You can also replace the inlet and the radiator connecting nut so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use PTFE tape to get a watertight connection on the inlet <p> Place the thermostat unit head on to the top of the TRV body : This should simply be screwed on by hand to fix it in place . Then set this to a relatively high heat . The new valve has now been fitted ! <p> Close bleed valves : Close all the radiator bleed keys that you undid to drain the system . Double check these , because if you forget one , it will cause a nasty puddle when you refill the system ! <p> Shut your drain off and remove the hose <p> Fill the system <p> For a gravity fed system : Go to the valve that you shut off earlier to stop the supply . This will probably be in the airing cupboard . Water will start to flow back into the system . Then go to each radiator in turn and bleed it so that all the air is released . Once you have gone around all the radiators in the house you know that they system will have been filled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaks <p> For pressurised systems : Open the valve of the filling loop which is typically on your boiler or in your airing cupboard . Use this to pressurise the system to 1 bar , then bleed the radiators . This will cause the pressure to drop so when no more air is coming out , you will have to return to the valve on the filling loop and re-pressurise the system . Remember to close the bleed key before re-pressurising or you will have a nasty puddle ! Keep doing this until all the air has been expelled from the system and it has been totally refilled . Check your new TRV for leaks <h> Which End of the Radiator To Fit the TRV <p> This is a common dilemma that people have and an oft asked question at DIY Doctor . At one end of the radiator the TRV will be fitted and at the other there will be a lockshield valve , however many are concerned if the TRV should go at the flow or the return side of the radiator . <p> A typical Lockshield valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a justified concern given that in the past both the TRV and the lockshield valve that were available were only able to work with the flow in one direction . However this in not the case now and most , if not all , TRVs are universal , meaning that the flow can be either way through them without making and alterations to them . This means that there is no restriction to which side of the radiator they can go . <p> The things that you should consider when choosing which end of the radiator the TRV should go are : <p> Easy of Access : There is no point have a TRV which you can not get to and change the setting when needed . Do n't  locate them where they are likely to be blocked by furniture or are hard to reach <p> Air Flow : The TRV functions by controlling the flow to the radiator based on the temperature of the room ( not the radiator , which is a common misconception ) . In order for it you work efficiently it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is working on the actual room temperature . This will help the radiator as they work predominantly by convection air circulating around the room and not radiation ( another common misconception ) , as a good airflow to the radiator , and TRV also , will make the radiator more effective . Do n't  site the TRV behind curtains , furniture or doors which will be open most of the time <p> Aesthetics : Site them where they will look most attractive . If there are a number of radiators in a room , site them on the same side to create the effect of uniformity . Ultimately this is down to your personal choice <p> Always check the manufacturers instructions for any specific instructions and tips . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

@@41624666 @1624666/ <p> Summary : In this easy to follow DIY how to guide we look at a cold water system and cold water tanks , cistern valves and toilet cisterns to see how each of these components works in your home in order to supply cold water to your taps , toilet cistern and other cold water feeds . <p> In the majority of homes , cold water enters the building via a rising main . This water is then directed to one or two of the downstairs taps where it is at full mains pressure . This direction is done using a T fitting with the other outlet of the T taking the water to a cold water tank in the loft . From there it is distributed around the house . ( click here for diagram of water systems ) <p> Regulations state that the cold water tank and indeed the cistern must have a close fitting lid to ensure that the water in these tanks or cisterns can not be contaminated accidentally . The lid must not however , make the cold water tank or cistern airtight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in roof space <p> The water going into the storage tank is controlled by a float valve . The valve operates using a plastic ( sometimes metal ) ball which floats on the surface of the water , this is attached to an arm which is in turn attached to the valve mechanism . When the float rises , it lifts the arm which closes the valve and stops water entering . <p> These valves are dealt with in greater detail further on in the project . If anything should go wrong with this valve , overflow pipes are fitted to water tanks and cisterns to allow water to flow out before reaching a level where they could overflow the tank . These overflow pipes are also called warning pipes and the end must be placed where any discharge can be seen clearly . The overflow pipe can be seen clearly in the top left of the picture below . <p> If an overflow pipe , either from your toilet cistern or from the cold water tank in the loft area is dripping , an adjustment of the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy will be to exchange one of the black rubber diaphragms , according to the valve you have , in the pictures and diagrams below . The water must be turned off and the operation is simple . The rubber diaphragms are available at most diy stores and plumbers merchants . <p> Ball valve in roof <p> The distribution of cold water to the taps is a direct one interrupted , we suggest , with the insertion of isolation valves at the appropriate points . These valves allow you to turn off the supply to that particular item ( basin , sink , cistern etc ) without turning off the mains . An isolation valve is shown below <p> Isolation valve on water pipe <p> With the more common indirect water supply , the mains pressure going to at least one downstairs tap , can also be tapped into for a washing machine , water softener or dishwasher . All of which need mains pressure to work . An electric shower can also be connected to the mains supply but all of these connections , if needed , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A cold water pipe will also feed an immersion tank if you have one . This feed will enter the immersion at the bottom , the water will then be heated and as it gets hotter , will rise to the top . The pressure from the cold feed in , will then force the hot water out of the top of the immersion when the hot taps are opened . Water bylaws insist that every pipe and fitting is given maximum protection from freezing by whichever means are appropriate . This generally means that the pipe or fitting should be covered with an insulation material . Smaller pipes are more vulnerable than larger pipes and the insulation should be of a material that does not allow moisture absorption . The minimum thicknesses of insulation required are : <p> 15mm pipe : 25mm <p> 22-28 mm pipe : 19mm <p> 35mm and over pipe : 9mm <p> The tops and sides of tanks and cisterns in the loft should also be insulated , but no insulation should be placed under the tank to avoid condensation . <h> Cistern Valves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme as far as cistern valves are concerned . The valves connected to the mains must be high pressure valves , and the lower pressure fittings need low pressure valves . There are also valves to reduce the noise made when filling a cistern . <p> Most loft tanks will have a brass , high pressure valve as in the picture above . The picture below shows exactly how this valve works . The ball is screwed to the adjustable thread on the end of the arm . The arm can be detached from the body of the valve by the ribbed nut which can be seen at the end of the arm in the left hand picture . In the right hand picture you can see the black rubber diaphragm which is pushed against the water inlet by the action of the float rising with the water . This closes the valve . <p> Ball valve arm <p> Isolation valve <p> For a quiet operation , the Torbeck valve has been introduced . This one is both high and low pressure , with threaded inserts which can be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the float and the smooth operation of the arm , ensure that water hammer does not occur . Torbeck valves have side and bottom entry designs for use in most applications . These valves are used in toilet cisterns . The same principle is used here and we have unscrewed the blue , ribbed nut from the body of the valve . This again shows a black rubber diaphragm which , by the action of the rising arm , is pushed closed against the inlet . <p> The Torbeck valve is a combination of an equilibrium valve and a diaphragm valve . Once open , the valve is balanced and stabilised by equal water pressure on both sides . This stops it " jumping " which is the cause of water hammer in other systems . <p> The last and most common valve , is the straight forward diaphragm valve to be found in most toilet cisterns . The principle is the same . <p> Bottom entry valve assembled <p> Bottom entry valve components <p> The ball screws onto the end of the arm , in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top , the ball and arm rise , forcing the plunger against the black rubber diaphragm . The height of the arm can be adjusted with a screw near the plunger and the unit can be held steady by using the adjustable " leg " in the top left of the left hand photograph , to sit against the side of the cistern . These valves are also available as side entry valves . <h> Flushing the Loo <p> A very frequent question is , " My loo will not flush , the handle pulls down but nothing happens ... what is wrong ? " <p> There are only two answers ... <p> Your handle is not connected to the flushing mechanism in the cistern . <p> The flush diaphragm is split . <p> A cistern allows water in through one of the above valves . When it is time to " pull the chain " the handle pulls up a plunger inside of the flush chamber . You can see the handle connection in red on the photograph below with the flush chamber to its left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the flush chamber is full of water , this action draws up the water , retaining it in the chamber using a diaphragm . The water rises and is forced into the tube at the top of the chamber ( where the blue top is ) . It then falls down the other tube into the flush pipe which leads to the toilet . The action of the water falling causes a vacuum behind it , which in turn sucks up the rest of the water from the cistern . If the diaphragm ( blue in the picture below ) is split , which happens after continually rising and falling for a number of years , It can not create the pressure required to force the chamber full of water up the pipe . <p> Blue cistern diaphragm and black mounting frame <p> The blue diaphragm in the picture above sits on the black frame . The water is allowed in the chamber because the diaphragm is flexible and the water can rise up through it . When the handle is pulled , the water in the chamber pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water is drawn upward and into the outlet tubes . A split diaphragm can be replaced by turning off the water to the cistern , flushing the toilet and soaking up any remaining water with a sponge . Once the cistern is empty , unclip the connection between the handle arm and the flush unit . Release the back nut under the cistern and pull the flush unit clear . Unclip the bottom half of the connection clip and pull out the frame which holds the diaphragm . ( There may be a spring over the central dowel , do n't forget to return this when re-assembling ) Unclip and slide off the diaphragm , replace and re-assemble . <p> As you can tell from the above " the cold water tank and associated valves and cistern valves play an integral part in the cold water system within your home and need to be monitored and maintained to ensure correct opperation at all times . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Think of Roman Villas with their terracotta pantiles and Welsh Cottages with their slate roofs . Slates are expected to have a useful life of between 50 " 150 years depending on the type and the exposure to the elements that they receive . <p> Having said that terracotta and concrete tiles do have a natural effective life and even slate and stone tiles can be blown off or dislodged , which can crack or chip them . Tiles can also be damaged by falling trees or branches in storms . It is important to have a quick check of your roof after a bad storm . <h> Storm Damage to Roof Tiles <p> Storm damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the ridge tiles . Any art of the roof that is old and weathered will be vulnerable to storm damage . Where there is damage to the pointing on the ridge tiles they may simply need repointing . This is acceptable repair work if the mortar is just weathered , however where the ridge tiles have become loose they need to be removed and rebedded on fresh mortar which will form a more permanent repair . <h> Damage to Lead Flashing on Chimney Stacks <p> As a roof ages the roof timbers and trusses may shrink or warp . This movement can put pressure on the walls and chimney stack and can dislodge the mortar in the joints . <p> Check lead flashing regularly with binoculars to look for damage or signs of a potential leak <p> The lead flashing protecting the base of the chimney stack is especially vulnerable to water ingress if there is movement in the roof .

Debris building up in the valley can then cause rainwater to be forced up under the tiles and into the loft where it will soak roof timbers and even start to leak through onto your ceiling below . You will notice this inside the house as damp or discoloured patches on the bedroom ceilings below . <h> Verge Tiles and Mortar Bedding <p> Verge tiles are the tiles at the end of the roof , and these are also bedded onto a layer of sand and cement . You will find them at the end of a pitched roof , on gable ends and dormer windows .

Get some great tips to making removing the old sealant easier and then replace it with new sealant . <p> This project deals with how to remove sealant from baths and basins and even windows . When applying silicone sealant to any area it is almost impossible to avoid getting it some where you do n't want it to be so in some cases , after applying sealant , you may then need to remove sealant residue from the surface you have just applied it to . Likewise , when you are attempting to remove sealant that 's old or been on a surface for quite a while , this can be a bit tricky and time consuming . <h> Applying New Silicone Sealant Over Old Sealant <p> If you then need to apply new silicone sealant to area once you have removed the old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the new . Applying new sealant over the top of old , leaking sealant never works as the adhesion of the existing sealant to the bath or shower , and tiles , is what counts . It does not matter how much sealant you apply over the top , if the existing sealant is leaking then the odds are that it still will . See our project on leaking showers and baths also as the fact that the sealant has split means that your bath or shower may need some adjustment to stop it moving . <h> How To Remove Silicone Sealant <p> There is only really one way to remove sealant and this is to get a sharp knife , chisel , stanley knife etc .... ( wear the appropriate safety gear for this thick gloves etc .... ) and gently slice the old sealant away until you have removed as much as you possibly can .

This may take some work and may not be that effective on more substantial left overs <p> You can also purchase products known as " Silicone Eaters " that will remove any remaining silicone . Many people have reported mixed results using products of this type , some have found it to be very good while others have reported them to be of no use what so ever .

The mastic gun , or sealant applicator , can be seen below . Some sealant removers do not need an applicator gun and can be simply squeezed out of the tube on to the surface to be sealed . <p> Position the tube length ways along the surface/joint to be sealed and squeeze the trigger as you move the sealant tube along the join leaving a nice even trail of sealant .

A very frequent question to DIY doctor is how long must I wait before I can paint it . <p> There is no definitive answer to this question as all walls and ceilings will dry out at different speeds . With a normal centrally heated house you can be pretty sure of safely painting after 4 weeks but it can take as long as 6 and with extra heat in the room it may be ready in 3 . <p> The reason for not painting before the wall is completely dry is that most paints will simply form an air tight skin over the wall . The moisture from the new plaster is then trapped behind this skin and can not evaporate off . The damp then either retreats back into the wall where it develops mould growth or reacts with the salts in the wall to become Efflorescence . Either way you have a problem on your hands that is incredibly difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or even three coats of plaster , can take months to dry . <h> What if I am in a Hurry to Paint my new Plaster ? <p> If you are in a real hurry to paint your wall because Grandma is coming to stay , there are paints on the market called Microporous Paints . These paints allow the surface of the plaster or artex to carry on breathing and evaporating while they are drying out . They can be found in a lot of DIY stores and decorators merchants . <p> Microporous paints are generally a lot thinner than ordinary water or solvent based paints and in a lot of cases , once the wall is dry , it is recommended that you over-paint them with emulsion . <p> Please read the instructions on the container for information regarding thinning down and applying the first coat onto new plaster ( applying a mist coat ) . <h> Priming new Plaster With a Mist Coat <p> When the wall is first plastered it is closer to colour 1 than colour 2 ( images above ) . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 than colour 1 and be totally uniform in that colour . Artex simply goes from an off-white to white . <p> New and freshly laid plaster and new artex are very porous indeed . If you apply any kind of ordinary paint directly onto either of these surfaces , moisture will immediately be sucked out of that paint . <p> In simple terms this leaves the paint going dry on the surface only and because the moisture has been sucked out so quickly , it has no " roots " or " key " . The surface paint may soon start to blister and flake off . <p> Polythene dust sheet <p> cotton dust sheet <p> Paint brush set <p> Roller and tray <p> It is therefore necessary to " prime " or " seal " the surface first .

When the surface is sealed and dry , you can continue to paint as normal . <p> If you intend to put an oil based paint on the surface , such as eggshell or gloss , then the surface can be sealed using a solution of PVA adhesive .

The next coat will look almost like glass . Do this again for a third coat that will look like glass . ( Tip supplied by InkspOt ) <h> Sticky Door <p> If you have just painted a door and are worried about it sticking as they all do ..

They absorb heat very easily and are much more prone to blistering as a result . Also try and paint the walls in this order . West facing in the morning , East in the afternoon and South &amp; North when they are shaded the most . Painting in direct sunlight ( unless you have managed to get every brush stroke exactly the same thickness ! ) allows the paint to dry in a patchy way and can give a poor finish . <h> Old Paint <p> If you have -+ a tin of paint that you need to keep , turn it upside down before storing it ( make sure the lid is fixed frirmly ! ) .

Twice as quick , -+ as messy . <h> Masking Alternative <p> Masking paper can be a pain to get off and can easily leave marks , which are worse than the paint would have been . Spend some time cutting newspaper into strips and damp each strip before using it as masking tape . The dampness will allow you to manoeuvre it into position and keep it stuck to the glass long enough for you to paint your frame . It falls off easily afterwards ! <h> Faults in Painted Surfaces <p> Faults in painted surfaces are a nuisance and can sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grey/white surface haze . Sometimes called " blooming " This is a result of the paint being affected by moisture during drying . The moisture can be from condensation in an unventilated room or water from another source such as rainfall . <p> Blistering : Almost always caused by moisture in the timber which has been painted over without being allowed to dry properly . The moisture tries to evaporate but can not get through the paint . The paint will eventually crack and peel allowing more moisture in etc. etc . Window cills are very prone to these blisters sometimes because the end of the cills has not been prepared properly allowing the moisture in . This fault often occurs on metal surfaces as well . This is due to the surface not being properly prepared before painting , including rust removal and the use of a primer . The interaction between two different metal surfaces can cause " electrolytic corrosion " which may also lead to blistering . <p> Cracking : Sometimes called " checking " or " Aligatoring " This usually happens in regular cracking patterns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paint before the one beneath it is completely dry will cause this as both coats drying at a different rate will cause shrinkage . <p> Peeling : If areas of paint can be easily peeled off it is mostly due to a contaminated surface or the use of the wrong ( or no ) primer . <p> No shine to gloss:This will happen if the primer used is too thin or insufficient primer or undercoat has been used . The absorbent timber will soak the paint in too quickly and leave a poor finish . <p> Wrinkles : Too much paint applied in one go .... Vertically , it just runs ! ! <h> Roll It Up <p> If you have finished with your emulsion roller and brush for the day , but intend to carry on tomorrow or in a few days , wrap them tightly in a carrier bag . They will stay soft and usable for up to a month if wrapped properly . <h> Gloss Over It <p> Like-wise with your gloss brush , but this time keep it in a jar full of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Shake it out the next day and carry on . <h> Sticky Tin <p> When you have opened and stirred a new tin of paint , tie a piece of string tightly between the two rivets where the handle connects . This will enable you to wipe your brush and rest it without getting paint all over the tin and you . <h> Paint Thinners <p> Do n't waste your thinners , cut the top from a plastic drinks bottle and use that for cleaning your brushes . The thinner the bottle the better . <h> Old Brushes <p> Hard brushes can be rejuvenated after a spell in hot vinegar , comb the bristles with a fork afterwards and keep in shape with an elastic band until dry . <h> Old Tins In The Shed <p> Keep track of the paint you have saved by sticking a piece of masking tape down one side of the tin . When you have finished painting mark a line on the tape to the top of the paint and it might be handy to write the date as well . No more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . <h> Messy Roller Tray <p> Before you start , wrap your roller tray in cling-film and just roll it up and throw it away afterwards . <h> Painting Chairs <p> Stand your chair legs in saucers or something similar to avoid ground contact or balancing acts ! <h> Messy Handles <p> Keep paint off the handles , hinges and locks by applying some vasaline on a piece of tissue to them before you start painting . The paint wont stick to that . <h> Putty Mess <p> If the putty you want to use is very oily and too soft , roll it around on a piece of news-paper first . this will soak up the excess oil and make it ready for use . Keep it soft by wrapping it in cling-film or silver foil . <h> Rejuvenating Masking Tape <p> Put the tape in the microwave oven with a glass of water . ( The water safely loads the magnetron in the oven ) <p> Set the oven on full for about 1 minute <p> Switch off and check the tape has become quite warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peel off just as it did when new <p> When the tape gets cold , just reactivate it <p> Many thanks to Arnie for this information <h> Keeping Ceramic Tiles Clean <p> ( Thanks to Frazer for this tip ) <p> Here 's my tip : When you have finished tiling and grouting , give the tiles a coat of car wax : water and soap residue does not stick .

However there is an easier way and this is where the word screed comes from . <p> The word screed actually means " An accurately levelled strip " of material laid on a wall or floor as a guide for the even application of a covering . So our screed is not a floor screed but a floor covering and to get the covering level we must introduce some screeds ! <p> Screeding layout diagram <p> Its fairly simple to lay a few screeds across a floor and level them as you go and its even easier if you have help laying the screeds . We will work with a 50mm covering and to lay our screeds we will use some 100 x 50mm timbers . This is a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room sizes a timber of a standard 4.8m long is plenty and this can be cut down as required . Make sure you examine the timber before you buy it as you need a straight piece , not a piece that bows everywhere , this will make life , and your floor , very bumpy ! <p> Mix your floor screed at 4 sand to 1 cement . The mix should be fairly dry . The way to tell if you have it right is to grab a handful of mixed screed ( put your marigolds on first ) and squeeze . The mix should stay in one firm lump in your hand but very little liquid , if any , should come out . <p> Lay the timber onto the floor , following the plan shown and place a spirit level onto the timber . If it is out of level it can be packed up using some of the mix you have in the appropriate places . <p> When the timber is in position , place a shovel full of the mix every 300 mm along the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed screed should be about 75mm wide . <p> You will see that the screed you are placing naturally falls away at an angle at the side . When you have finished each mixed screed , cut this back square to the timber screed as shown by the white cut line in the diagram below . <p> Side profile of screeding <p> Remove the timber when you have finished a screed and place it in the next position . This needs to be done carefully to avoid damaging the edge of the screed and always wet the timber before laying the screed to avoid sucking moisture from the mix unnecessarily . This can be done quite simply with a paint brush and a container of water . <p> Leave the newly cast screeds for a day and then fill in the gaps with the same mix . Level across the screeds using your spirit level or a straight edged piece of timber , moving the mix around until it is absolutely level between your two screeds . Fill in any voids . Rub the covering to a void free finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than just dried out quickly . Curing in this instance means dried out slowly and a floor screed needs to retain its moisture for as long as possible . This is necessary because of the high cement content and rapid drying could lead to cracks . To cure place a polythene sheet over the screed and several days should be allowed before the surface is walked on . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

It explains how to apply Intumescent Paint or Fire Retardant Paint and other coatings . Fire Paints provide an essential delay between a fire starting , and taking hold , to allow time for people to escape and Fire Services to put out the fire . Find out how to apply fire retardant coatings to timber surfaces , what types of finish are available , the different test standards paints and coatings have to comply with , the different types of fire door available and how to upgrade existing doors and also how to obtain a supply certificate for presenting to insurance companies plus fire and building control authorities . <p> Types of Paints there are really two main types of fire paint , Fire Retardant Paints and Fire Resistant Paint also known as Intumescent Paint .

Once their effectiveness has been proven they can be applied to walls , floors and ceilings in any space . <p> In certain areas e.g. public areas such as hotels etc .... it is imperative that the correct level of fire resistance is achieved to ensure that all relevant laws and legislation are adhered to . If you would like additional help and advice in this area call Property Repair Systems on 01626 336 180 . <h> What are Intumescent Paints ? <p> Intumescent Paints work differently to fire retardant paint ; instead of releasing the afore mentioned gas they char and swell up when exposed to fire . This has the effect of creating an insulating coating which in turn then protects any materials from the heat generated by the fire . These types of paints can also be know as Fire resistant Paints . <p> Where can They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suitable for use on most structural building materials such as : <p> Softwoods , like pine , larch and cedar <p> Hardwoods , such as oak , ash , beech and birch <p> MDF ( Medium Density Fibreboard ) <p> Chipboard <p> Melamine faced sheet <p> Brick and Stone <p> Plaster and Plasterboard <p> Metal <p> Concrete <p> Fire retardant coatings and Intumescent Fire Resistant paints are suitable for interior and exterior use including : <p> Doors <p> Decking <p> Bartops <p> Paneling and Matchboard <p> Cladding <p> Floors <p> Industrial buildings <p> Intumescent and Fire Retardant paints and other coatings can be applied to most surfaces including ones that are : <p> Painted <p> Varnished <p> Stained <p> Unpainted <p> Coated with multiple layers of non-retardant paints <h> What Finishes are Available ? <p> There are a variety of finishes available for Fire Resistant Intumescent and fire retardant paints and coatings including : <p> Clear finishes <p> White finishes <p> Coloured finishes <p> Gloss <p> Silk <p> Eggshell <p> Matt <p> Metallic <h> Fire Retardant and Resistant Paints Safety Information <p> The following points cover what you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standards <p> Paints are tested under three ' test standards ' and these are separated in different ' classes ' set by the British Standard Institute ( BSI ) . Each of the standards is given a code name and part number which are detailed below . <p> Class 1 requires that the paint coating ensures absolutely no spread of fire . This is the lowest fire standard , and is a performance standard for varnish and paint that can be applied to ceilings and walls . <p> Class 0 is applied to highrisk areas ( fire escape routes and corridors etc .... ) when any surface coatings have to have a very limited ability to also catch fire and combust . In order for areas of this type to qualify all materials used including any coverings and coatings have to comply to Class 1 Surface Spread of Flame and also a very low ' fire propagation index ' . These regulations are stated in BSI BS 476 Part 6 . The basis of this test is to ensure that any coverings do not increase a fires temperature levels or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistance The fire resistant capabilities of a given material can be rated from 30 minutes to 60 minutes . To make sure any surfaces comply with this regulation , intumescent varnishes , paints or other coatings are applied to a surface to effectively stop a fire from breaching for the amount of time specified to that product e.g. a 30 minute fire retardant paint will hold a fire back for 30 minutes before it starts to burn through the protective surface coating . This level of resistance has to comply with BS 476 Parts 20 23 1987 ( see below for more information ) . As you might imagine the variation of materials that can be used in the construction of a building can be great and to these ends fire retardant paints can be purchased to cover all the major material types such as steel , plaster ( this also includes lath and plaster walls and ceilings ) and timber . <h> Certification Why do I Need a Certificate ? <p> In pretty much all cases you can obtain a supply certificate for any projects you undertake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present it to your insurance company , Fire and Building Control Authority and submission to client records so that they can then confirm that you have complied with all relevant regulations and used the correct protective surface coating . <p> If you do not obtain the correct certificate(s) then , in the event of a fire , you may be held liable and prosecuted . Obviously this is aimed more at tradesmen or for DIY use in Industrial buildings , but you may need one to satisfy building regulations or indeed for your own peace of mind , even if you are doing it yourself in a domestic setting . <h> How to Coat Your Timber With Fire Resistant Paint <p> BSI Compliance With Class 0 and Class 1 <p> For all types of timber be it bare timbers in a building or products made from timber , whether they are painted or unpainted ( or treated with other coatings such as stain or varnish ) , you can use a single coating product like Timbercoat which will comply with class 0 and Class 1 as detailed above in Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wallcoat are products which are available online from Property Repair Systems and for the purposes of this project we are going to talk you through using them . If you are using another fire resistant paint or coating then follow the manufacturer 's instructions . <p> Applying Colour Coating to Timber <p> First apply two coats of Timbercoat . This can be done by using a brush or a roller or you can even spray it onto the surface if you have the correct equipment . The Coverage provided by the products mentioned above is usually 7 square metres per litre of paint per coat and this should then ensure an adequate coverage . This is especially important if you are spraying the paint as you need to ensure you have a thick enough coating of the paint to provide the required protection . <p> Plus Once you have applied your covering of Timbercoat ( or similar product ) you will then need to apply two coats of Flame Retardant paint . Again this can be brushed on , sprayed on or even rollered on at a rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . The finish is personal choice and can be matt , vinyl , silk , gloss , eggshell or metallic , it is up to you how you want the final finish to look . <p> Applying Clear Coatings to Timber <p> First apply two thin coats of ( Intumescent ) Fireproof Varnish . As above , this can be rollered on , brushed on or sprayed on to the surface at a rate of 6.5 square metres per litre of covering per coat , to ensure adequate coverage of the coating and to give the surface it 's required level of protection . <p> Plus Then apply one or two coats of Fire Varnish . Again this can be applied using by brush , spray or roller at a rate of 10 square metres per litre of fire varnish per coat . You can choose whether you want to use Gloss , Matt or Stain , depending on the final finish you are after . <p> Fire Retardant Varnish and Stain <p> Applying Clear Coating Over Layers of Old Paint <p> This method is suitable for covering surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have previously been painted even if they have a thick layer of old , nonretardant paints . <p> First , using a product such as Wallcoat ( or other similar product ) , apply one coat , using a brush etc .... at a coverage rate of 7 square metres per litre per coat to the desired surface , to ensure that you have an adequate thickness of the coating to provide the required fire retardant protection . <p> Plus After applying Wallcoat or similar product apply a Flame Retardant covering . Use two coats of flame retardant covering at a rate of 10 square metres per litre per coat . Apply by spraying , brushing on or rollering on . For the second coat you can choose from matt , vinyl , silk , gloss , eggshell or metallic finish to suit your own preference . This final coating can also be a hygiene paint e.g. for a bathroom , kitchen area etc .... but you will also have to ensure that what ever second coat you apply , this is also a flame retardant paint . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The details outlined below can be applied to any and all cast iron or steel products whether they have been previously painted or whether they are unpainted but can not be applied to any doors . <p> Firstly you need to start by applying one coat of High Build Primer using , again , either roller , brush or sprayer . This needs to be applied at a rate of 12 square metres per litre . <p> Plus To ensure that the surface complies with a rating of 30 minutes , now apply one coat of Thermocoat ( or similar product ) at a rate of 2 square metres per litre ( that is a thickness of 500 microns wet ) . <h> Fire Protection for Doors <p> Door Protection against fire is fairly simple as long as you follow these basic rules and guidelines . <p> Minimum Door Thickness is 35 mm <p> Doors must be solid not hollow <p> If your door is not flat , but has sunken panels , then you need a minimum panel thickness of 12mm for Hardwood Doors ( such as Oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If the panels are thinner than this then you can purchase a Veneer Kit to increase the thickness . However the original door panels must be at least 9mm to qualify for veneering . <p> If you need to increase the thickness of your door see the notes on Veneer Kits above to make sure you can do so safely and within the regulations . <p> If your door complies with the regulations regarding required thickness , to upgrade to 30 minutes protection you will need to prepare your door to take all of the following : <p> Intumescent fire and smoke seals <p> Intumescent fire and smoke lock , hinge , and door closer <p> Intumescent protection card <p> Once you have prepared your door for the above items now clean the surface and then rub down any previous coating to give a good , grease and oil free ' key ' to accept the new coating more readily . <p> Once rubbed down and prepared , now apply 3 coats of Timbercoat Intumescent Paint or 3 coats of clear Intumescent Varnish ( or similar products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per coat to ensure you get sufficient covering of the coating and the required protection . <p> Plus Once you have applied the 3 coats stated above now apply 2 coats of Flame Paint or Flame Varnish finish at a rate of 10 square metres per litre per coat , using either brush , sprayer or roller . <h> Getting the Right Expert Advice <p> We trust Property Repair Systems to provide you with the right advice because we have been dealing with them for many years .

@@41624682 @1624682/ <p> Summary : In this DIY guide find out all about earth bonding and electricity in the bathroom , bonding earth wires to copper pipes in order to comply with the 17th edition and iee wiring regulations , adding sockets in a bathroom and what sockets can be added and where , how to add earth straps to items in a bathroom and what items have to be strapped together , what the different zones are in a bathroom and how earth bonding works . <p> This project has been updated to cover any changes made by the 17th edition of the wiring regulations ( including earth bonding regulations ) . Please see notes below . <h> How Does Earth Bonding Work ? <p> The earth , or ground in America , in electrical terms , carries no current , and it is this that electricity will make a dash for when it is allowed to escape from its secure home in an electric cable or flex . This is because one side of the electrical supply , the neutral , is intentionally connected to earth . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the person , their shoes , the floor , the wall , via earth and back to the supply transformer via one or more earth connections of the transformer neutral . The person has completed the electrical circuit . <p> Should any fault develop in an electrical system the electricity will always head for earth , taking the easiest route there . The electrical appliances and supplies in the home are of a much higher potential and if any of these become available to touch and are electrically charged at a different voltage to the earth , the possibility of an electric shock exists when the current passes through the connection between the charged parts and earth . <p> If , for instance , a person comes into contact with a conductive part that is at a potential difference to earthed metalwork and that metalwork , then a very serious shock can result . In order to eliminate this possibility all electrical earths of circuits supplying equipment in the bathroom and all extraneous conductive parts are bonded together . <p> In this way , even if a potential does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the electrical circuits , all the conductive parts that someone could touch will be at substantially the same voltage . No dangerous shock current can then flow . <p> On its way to earth , leaking current may pass through walls , floors or anything capable of carrying it . This is made much easier when the connecting substance is wet . Water is an excellent conductor of electricity which is why special care must be taken in the bathroom . <h> Regulations for Earth Bonding in your Bathroom <p> Bathrooms carry special rules as far as electricity is concerned . Water and electricity do not mix , so the utmost care has to be taken when electrical supplies run in or near the bathroom . To this end , in the 16th Edition of the IEE ( Institution of Electrical Engineers ) bathrooms carry their own very specific rules . We will deal with the use of earth bonding first and the rest later . <p> Should any electrical " leakages occur " in the bathroom the leaking current will try and find a passage to earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any metal or other conductors available . It is therefore important that precautions are taken to ensure these parts are not allowed to retain this current and diffuse it . <p> Available from Amazon <p> Available from Amazon <h> Connecting Earthing Straps <p> Earth bonding in the bathroom is done by connecting all of the metal parts together with an earth cable . This will collect the current or voltage from the leak and equalise it around the pipes and metal parts . Each metal part in the bath or shower room must be connected . We suggest the use of a specific 4mm earth cable for these connections . This is a minimum requirement without conduit and larger earth cable can be used . Please see new regulation notes below : <p> Earth bonding bracket <p> The earth tags ( above ) should be connected to all pipes and can be bought from most diy stores and electrical merchants . They are proprietary connections reading " ELECTRICAL CONNECTION DO NOT REMOVE " . <p> The earth wire , after all bonding is complete should be connected to a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection unit for a heater or shower . This is in accordance with BS7671 which reads : <p> All electrical earths of circuits that supply equipment in the bathroom should be connected to the equipotential bonding , not just one local earth . <p> The cable should not be taken back to the main fuseboard or consumer unit as this can be dangerous . Please see new regulation notes below . <p> Cross section of earth bonding in the bathroom <p> The above layout shows a typical bathroom and its cross bonding layout . <p> Red = hot water supply <p> Blue = cold water supply <p> Green = earth bonding cable <p> Plastic pipes and casings do not need to be bonded . The earth bond required to metal parts of a bathroom heater and shower can be very unsightly if taken to their next connection in the line , and it is permissible to connect the earth wires from these directly to the earthed electrical connection from which they are wired . Please note that if a bath is used for medical treatment or disabled people special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Under IEE regulations the bathroom is now divided into zones for electrical purposes . The zone qualifications are quite complicated and professional guidance should be sought for any proposed electrical work in the bathroom . The basic rule is that no source of electrical supply should be accessible from a position where one can be in contact with water at the same time . Insulated operating cords of pull switches are permissible but they must be in accordance with BS 3676 , which in most cases will be stamped or labeled on them . <h> Earth Bonding in Bathrooms and Shower Rooms <p> Until 2nd July 2008 The 16th edition of the wiring regulations applied as well as the 17th edition . From that date all installations must comply with the 17th edition only . The new requirement is for all electrical equipment in bath and shower rooms to be bonded together along with all metal pipework . Supplementary bonding connects to the earth wiring of the electrical equipment inside the bath or shower room . It must not be taken back to the main earth terminal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with rooms that have a bath or a shower installed . <p> Supplementary equipotential bonding ( between waste pipes , metallic service pipes and earth connections of bathroom equipment ) is no longer required if , and only if , the main bonding between metal service pipes can be proved to be continuous . If so , the need for bonding ( yellow and green ) cable is unlikely to be necessary . <p> Zone 3 has also been removed from the 17th edition . <p> You are now allowed sockets in a bathroom if they can be placed at least 3 metres from the boundary of zone 1 . Any such socket however , would need to be a spur socket or the end of a radial circuit as any circuit entering a bath or shower room must terminate there . Also please note : <p> All circuits now need 30mA RCD protection . <p> Cables in walls of bath or shower rooms have to be protected by a 30mA RCD . <p> Shaver socket outlets are permitted as long as they are 3m from zone 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legality of your project , please contact a qualified electrician . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Perforated plastic drainage pipe ( 80mm ) can now be bought from many garden centres and all builders merchants in 25 rolls . This type of pipe is easily laid in small trenches and surrounded by shingle ( small stones ) to allow water through but filter out silt . The pipe can be joined using a waterproof repair tape also available from builder 's merchants . <p> Perforated drainage pipe <p> Land Drain Pipe can also be bought in clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the domestic application , virtually obsolete . Pipe can also be bought which only has holes half way round . This , for drainage purposes , is laid with the holes uppermost to allow water in from the surface and then to allow it to get carried away completely . We do not advocate the use of this in an English Garden as ( See the drought warning below ) a fully perforated pipe will allow a more even distribution of the water from wetter , to drier parts , on its journey to the outlet . <p> With the introduction of what is commonly called Weed Fabric into the market place , it is now possible to wrap the pipe in weed fabric which should stop any silt getting into the pipe . Many builders , ourselves included , actually line the trench with Weed Fabric or Geo Textile Fabric to give it its proper name , to stop any silt getting into the trench . This gives the land drain a much longer life as silt can build up in a matter of weeks and clog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Geo Textile Fabric will also stop , or at least dissuade , any local roots seeking out a greater water source . A root system can clog or even break a land drain system quite easily . Geo Textile fabric is a polypropylene mat used to suppress weeds and control soil erosion while allowing the controlled passage of water and air . <p> Land Drains and French drains can also be used to direct water to a part of your garden which needs more water than others . This is particularly useful for gardeners . A French Drain is simply a land drain but without the pipe although this terminology is getting somewhat mixed these days with many people referring to Land Drains as French Drains . <h> Building a Soakaway in your garden <p> Land drains in gardens are usually drained to a central point and this is usually a soakaway . A soakaway is simply a hole in the ground filled with rubble and coarse stone with a drainage pipe laid to it removing surface ( rain ) water from other areas . The soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good drainage properties . It is pointless sinking a soakaway in clay unless there is a more porous layer underneath . The diagram below is not to scale . <p> Soakaway cross section <p> A Soakaway must be at least 5 metres from any habitable building , by local authority regulations . The pipe flowing to them should be of at least 75mm diameter which is the minimum pipe size for any surface water drainage . 80mm is the recommended size . <p> This pipe should be laid to a fall of 1 in 100 which means for every 1 m of pipe length the slope should be about 10mm or 1cm . However gradual the slope , water will find its way down it . <p> The size of the soakaway should be a minimum of 1m x 1m square x 1m deep below the bottom of the incoming pipe . The stone infill should surround the pipe and finish approximately 100mm above it . An impervious layer should then be placed on the stone such as thick polythene , tarpaulin , or even a bed of concrete ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed on top of this layer to restore the garden level ( A ) . If you can afford it we also suggest lining the soakaway with weed fabric . As the soakaway needs to be 1m deep below the bottom of the incoming land drain it makes sense to measure the distance of the land drain you intend to lay and work out , using the fall of 1:100 , how deep the bottom of the pipe will be when it gets to the soakaway . <p> For example , if your soakaway is to be placed at the bottom of the garden and your garden is 30m long , the pipe will be 300mm deeper when it gets to the soakaway . If the pipe starts in a trench 300mm deep the bottom of the pipe will be 600mm below the ground when it gets to the soakaway . This means , in total , your soakaway is 1600mm or 1.6m deep . <p> The turf , if any , should be removed carefully and stored for replacement . Good soil should be saved to be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste soil can be used to make a built flower bed somewhere else in the garden . <p> Scaffold planks can be hired from your local tool hire shop and used as a run to get the waste soil into position either in the garden or to a skip . Repeated running through lawn and garden with a wheelbarrow can leave a mess especially in ground which we already know is damp ! <p> Care should be taken when digging a hole this deep and we suggest digging the sides back at a fairly shallow angle to avoid any of the sides caving in . Wet soil weighs over 1 tonne per cubic meter and it is extremely dangerous to carry out any excavation over 600mm deep without either shoring up the sides of the trench or raking ( digging at an angle ) them back . There are no rules to say that a soakaway has to be a perfect cube and your safety is more important than the few extra barrow loads of rubble required to fill a bigger hole . <h> Laying the Land Drains <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most effective method of laying land drainsis to lay them in a herring bone pattern ( see diagram ) . The pipes should be laid so that no point in the garden is any more than 2m away from a pipe . The maximum distance between pipes is therefore , 4m . The centre line , or spine , of the drain takes the water to the soakaway and all of the other lines , or ribs , feed into the spine . To set this formation out it is as well to buy a bag of sand and , after measuring the distances involved , sprinkle sand down each line of pipe you want to insert . <p> Land drain showing levels of filling <p> Excavation of the trenches should ensure that any turf is cut carefully and stored to be re-laid later . Dig the trenches three times the width of the pipe to the required gentle fall to get the water to the soakaway or outlet . <p> Herring bone drainage layout <p> After lining the trench with weed fabric , lay the pipe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available from the builder 's merchants and garden centres . Clean stone with an average diameter of 20mm is fine . <p> When the pipe is surrounded by an equal thickness of stone , i.e. there should be a top covering of stone equal to , or greater than the side covering , the weed fabric should be folded over the top . At least 150mm of topsoil is then replaced to lay your turf on . This area can then be rolled to assist with regrowth . <h> French Drains <p> A cheaper method of achieving land drainage which is , historically , used to remove surface water from the perimeter of a house or patio , is a French Drain . <p> French drain cross section <p> A French Drain is a Land Drain without the pipe . It is excavated in the same way , filled with stone in the same way and backfilled in the same way . The construction only differs in so much as it is much more important , with a French Drain , to excavate the bottom of the trench to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With a land drain there is a certain amount of flexibility in so much as the pipe level can be adjusted by some of the bedding . <p> One further word of warning is required here . The land drains or French Drains you have put in , are there to remove water from areas of your garden . When laid properly they will still be doing this in drier spells and can cause parts of the garden , especially in prolonged dry spells , to scorch . You may notice the lines of the land drains as staying greener and more lush much longer as this is where the water is ! 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

We tell you why you need air bricks , how to maintain them and how to use air brick covers properly , as well as looking at installing air bricks to prevent condensation and avoid timber rot . <p> Air Bricks are special bricks that are manufactured with holes in them to allow the circulation of air under the floor of buildings with a suspended timber floor . The act of circulating air ensures that cold or damp air is not allowed to sit in any voids or empty space as if it is then this is a sure way that timbers and other materials will be damaged and in most cases by the time you realise it 's too late and substantial cost and hassle is the only way to then get it sorted . <p> Cast iron style air vent <p> If you are experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lack or it and would like some additional help and advice you can call Property Repair Systems free of charge on 01626 336180 . <h> What is an Air Brick <p> Traditionally air bricks were made of clay , but latest models are made of plastic , which are less easily broken , and can also allow a greater airflow than the old clay versions . <p> Air bricks are sometimes known as vent bricks , and some properties have cast Iron grilles rather than air bricks ( as seen in the image above ) . <p> Clay air brick <p> Plastic air brick <h> What are Air Bricks For ? <p> If your house has timber floors or a beam and block floor you should have airbricks to allow air to circulate underneath the ground floor , this is also known as ventilation . These types of floor are called hollow floors as they do not sit directly on the ground . <p> Most properties with wooden floors on the ground floor will have a void , or gap , underneath . The air in this void can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulate freely . Humid air carries a great deal of moisture , in fact the warmer the air the more moisture it can hold . This is a problem when the central heating goes off at night and the room cools , causing the floor boards and joists to be colder than the humid air around them , in consequence allowing condensation to form on the wood . This condensation is simply water from the air settling on the wood , and wet wood can cause the boards and joists to rot from the underside . <p> As with all condensation-related problems the only treatment is ventilation . By allowing the movement of air under the floorboards the air temperature should regulate , so that there are no cold spots to encourage condensation to form . <p> All properties with hollow floors should have air bricks built into the wall to allow a free flowing passage of air . However airbricks can become blocked or damaged over time , so if you have this type of floor , it is important to check that you have enough of them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a timber floor void courtesy of Property Repair Systems . The image is taken from a manor house in Warwick where dry rot had caused the floor to collapse <p> This rot can eventually cause the joists to become soft at the bearing ends , usually in or on the support walls , as these tend to be the coolest areas with the least air circulation . <p> You should check with a screwdriver to see if your joists are rotting , if the surface feels soft or flaky then early treatment with Boron based preservatives can save the timber . These come in the form of Gels and Pastes that you can apply to the wood . If you do n't  know what Boron treatment for timber is and what it does you can find out more from Property Repair Systems . <p> However if the joist is soft and spongy , or so flaky that your screwdriver pushes into the timber easily , then the joist is rotten below the surface . Once this level of decay has set in , new timbers need to be fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to fit Joist Repair Plates to the missing bearing ends or even splice on new parts using the Timber-Resin Splice system , which can both be found on this page about joist repairs . <p> Joist end repair plates from Property Repair Systems , replace rotten joist ends by fitting joist end repair plates and splicing in new timber <p> In a job in Forest Hill , London , where the client wanted a new timber floor to replace the old , damaged , Victorian floorboards , we lifted the existing floorboards to find the timber joists had rotted in the far corners of the room . While there were air bricks fitted in the house , they had become partially covered by soil and leaf debris from the garden , which was affecting the air circulation . If you want to see what we did to replace these damaged timbers you can read more in our project on repairing structural timber . <p> Creaking Timber Ground Floor <p> If your floor is creaking then it may be a sign that there is a problem with the joists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting your timber floor have to be supported themselves This is normally done with sleeper walls constructed before the floor is laid . To allow the air to flow around and through these walls , the brickwork is very often laid in honeycomb bond . The image below shows the honeycomb bond walls and how they allow the free flow or air through the structure . <p> Honeycomb supporting wall under the floor allows the free flow of air while supporting the joists <p> Timber wall plate laid on top of sleeper wall to allow joists to be fixed <p> As you can see from the image above a timber wall plate is laid on top of the sleeper wall to allow a fixing from the joist to the wall to be fitted . Unfortunately with the passing of time and the possible closure of some air bricks , often this wall plate will deteriorates . Either that or the mortar underneath it becomes crumbly and the plate , with the weight of the joists on it , sinks . This allows the joists to " spring " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is happening in your house then there is no alternative but to replace the wall plate . See our Repairing Joists project for help with this . <h> Arguments Against Air Bricks <p> So if air bricks are the answer to rotting timber why do n't  we build our whole house out of them ? <p> The down side of these air bricks is that the air under the floor can produce a bit of a draught up through the gaps in the floor boards . Many properties ( because the owners know no better ) have had the air bricks blocked up , or even removed . Some houses have had some air bricks blocked up on one side of the house , while the other side has been left open , and lastly the floor slab of a new conservatory has blocked up the air bricks . This is becoming the most common cause of blocked airbricks , because these days a conservatory is a relatively cheap and easy way of getting an extension . <p> It is important that these air bricks are opened up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air to flow back and forth . You will have noticed that if you open a window in a room with the door shut , it is far less effective than opening both the window and the door . <p> If your floor is draughty then you should repair the floor - see our project on filling gaps in floorboards project , but never block the air bricks . If you find you get a major draught then you could fit an air brick cowl , which shelters the face of the vent but still allows air circulation . <p> Gaps between wooden floorboards <p> Manufacturers also sell mesh vents to fit over air bricks which deter mice and other unwanted visitors , but you should take case to make sure these are kept clear as the fine mesh is easily blocked . <p> If your home is in an area that suffers regular flooding then obviously water can come in through the airbricks . You can get air brick covers that fit over the air bricks to help prevent flood water getting in under your floorboards , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , and should be removed as soon as possible . As you can imagine it is even more important to keep air circulating in damp conditions . <p> It is often easier to use a proprietary telescopic air vent to lift the air intake level . <h> Air Brick Installation <p> You will want to know what size of air bricks to to fit and what models are available when you choose your air brick . The standard sizes are : <p> 2.15mm x 65mm x 50mm <p> 215mm x 140mm x 50mm <p> 215mm x 215mm x 50 mm <p> In most situations for hollow floors a 2.15mm x 65mm x 50mm , ( otherwise known as a 9 inch x 3 inch ) air brick will be adequate , providing there are enough of them at a suitable spacing see below for correct spacing to get optimum ventilation . <p> The holes in the bricks come in different styles too - they can be rectangle , square and louvre . Older houses may have air vents that are made of cast iron , and these can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Bricks <p> The recommended spacing for air bricks is 1800mm . In other words there should be an air brick every 1.8 meters or 6 foot on both sides of the house , depending on whether you live in a detached house or a terraced one . <p> New air bricks can be inserted easily enough . The first stage is to remove a section of wall large enough to insert one . Because the hole you are making is very small in relation to the volume of total bricks in the wall you do not need to worry about compromising the stability of your wall while you are fitting this new air vent . No lintel is necessary over an air brick , air brick construction is such that they are as strong as normal bricks . <p> Having cut a hole through the wall you need to provide a duct to stop debris blocking the hole in the future . This is done by the use of a special venting duct called a sleeve . Click on the image of the air brick sleeve to buy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for older single skin houses , but what if you need to install an airbrick in a cavity wall ? Well of course a cavity wall is thicker and you will need to get through both skins to fit the air vent . <p> You will also need to use an air duct to ensure the airflow goes right through from outside to under the floor without dissipating into the wall cavity . The best way to do this is to fit a plastic telescopic duct , before you lay the air brick . Clay and terracotta ducts are also available if you prefer them . Modern plastic air bricks can be bought with a duct pre fitted . <p> Air brick with a duct to fit into a cavity wall <p> If you are concerned about air bricks and cavity wall insulation , then it is not a problem , the same type of ducting should be fitted straight through the insulating material . <p> We recommend that to fit air bricks if you have a cavity wall , you may need to hire some extra long masonry drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bought in varying diameters and lengths , but you are unlikely to need to own very long drill bits , you may also want to hire a drill that is suitable for this heavy work ( depending on the power of your own drill ) . We suggest you hire a 300mm long , 10mm bit for this project , and you can talk to the hire shop about the most suitable drill for the job . <p> When fitting high placed airbricks above the DPC , for any room venting such as for wood burners , etc. a cavity tray has to be fitted above the airbrick to prevent moisture ingress . The cavity tray should be inserted over an air vent where the cavity is bridged as show in the image below , but we cover this in more detail in our project about wall cavities , so please look there if you are in any doubt . <p> Using a cavity tray above an air brick <p> Air Bricks too Low ? Your air bricks should be placed above the external ground level but they obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage of air . In some situations , for example where the external ground level has been raised over the years , the required height for an air brick is below this new ground level . <p> A special sleeve can be used in these cases . It is shaped like a Z and works like a periscope funneling air down below the floorboards , from a hole above the internal floor level , see the images below . <p> Shaped sleeve to use when you need to raise the level of air bricks above ground level <p> Fitting this special vent sleeve involves digging a hole in the ground against the wall , to the correct level and then cutting through the wall at that level . This should be at least 50mm ( 2 inches ) below the underside of the floor , and ideally 25mm ( an inch ) , or so below the level of the underside of the floor joists . <p> The hole this time must be much larger , because you need to get the staggered sleeve into the inside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flush with the external face .

This can be done very simply with 4 inch ( 100mm ) drain pipes laid side by side as extension tubes for your vents . Make sure when you lay them that the drain pipe slopes a very tiny bit towards the outside of the property , to prevent water ingress .

@@41624690 @1624690/ <p> The diagram below shows a cavity in all of its glory . Not all of this goes into each cavity , but we have put everything into one to make it easier to understand . <p> Total Cavity <p> Brickwork Book from Amazon <p> The cavity wall was introduced into buildings because it is the greatest of all damp precautions , water can not travel across a void . Most masonry is porous to some degree , and sooner or later , especially with weak , or incorrectly constructed joints , that masonry will let in water . Without a barrier of some kind , there is a chance that water will work its way indoors , however thick the wall . By inserting a cavity , that scenario is impossible . For a number of reasons that we will explain below , the cavity has to be bridged . That is the two leaves , or skins , of the wall have to be connected . We will start at the bottom of the diagram and explain . At the bottom of every cavity is a foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another project which will include a ground floor slab construction . <h> Wall Ties <p> The first thing we see as we go up the cavity is a wall tie , this is necessary to " tie " the two halves of the wall together and stop one moving independently of the other . An important function , but from a damp point of view , sometimes a dangerous one . If the wall tie , which is built into the joints of the masonry , is placed so that it slopes down toward the inner skin of the building , water can run down it and soak into the inside wall . To counteract this , firstly it is important they are installed " on the level " or even sloping toward the outside of the building . Secondly , the wall ties themselves have a kink , twist or tail , which allows water to form on this part of the tie and , given that water can not run uphill , drip off the lowest point . <p> Wall tie example 1 <p> Wall tie example 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All wall ties should comply with BS. 5628 1978 the specification for metal ties for cavity walls excepting conditions where severe exposure may occur . In that case , stainless steel or non ferrous ties should be used . Severe exposure is defined in the BS , but to be on the safe side , almost all ties these days are made from stainless steel or are galvanised . These ties should be placed at 900mm centres horizontally , and 450mm vertically . At any openings , the ties should be placed with at least one tie , for every 300mm of height and within 225mm of the opening . This does not apply if the cavity skins are bonded together . A cavity must be between 50mm and 75mm wide , with these figures as a minimum and maximum width . The exception to this , is when vertical twist ties ( second from the left ) are used and spaced at 750mm horizontally . The cavity can then be enlarged to 100mm . Both skins of the wall must be at least 90mm thick for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available on Amazon . <h> Cavity Insulation <p> Clipped onto the wall tie in the diagram , is an insulation retaining clip . Insulation can be placed in cavities in two ways . Either it can fill the cavity completely , or it can be a partial fill , as in the diagram , allowing a free air flow of 50mm for the remainder of the cavity for the reasons of moisture penetration . The clips will stop the insulation " leaning " over and bridging the cavity . If a complete cavity fill is required , the fill must be of a composition which will totally deny the penetration of water and give it access to the inner skin . Please check with your architect , or the building control department of your local council for the correct cavity insulation for your project . Two types are shown here , the wool , or dry on the left , and polystyrene on the right . <p> Cavity Insulation <p> Poly Insulation <p> 225mm Wall or Housing Tie <p> Wall Tie Clips <p> Next up the cavity is an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , where a hollow floor ( normally of a timber construction ) needs to be ventilated . However , they are placed above damp proof courses where additional ventilation is required in a room . These bridge the cavity as a continuous duct must join the inlet and outlet of the openings . Plastic proprietary ducts can be purchased , which will , in a telescopic way , expand or retract to suit the width of the wall . The construction of this air passage can be made in individual components and some of these are shown below . <p> Air Bricks <p> Clay Air Duct <p> Insect Grill <p> These ducts must be inserted with a fall toward the outer skin of the wall . <p> Brickwork 3 book available on Amazon <p> Cavity Trays <p> Above the air vent in the diagram , is an in situ , cavity tray damp proof course . This can be built into walls as work progresses . The object is simple , any water in the cavity will be directed , due to the slope on the dpc , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via a weep hole . This weep hole is , in its simplest form , a vertical joint ( perp ) void of mortar or any other jointing compound . The membrane used to form this " tray " is very often a plastic dpc , but you should check with your building inspector as to the composition of the dpc you should be using . A 4 inch wide roll of plastic dpc is shown below , and these can be purchased in a number of widths to suit your project . Also shown are purpose made plastic weep vents , which are built into the void joint to allow easier passage ( on a smooth surface ) out of the wall . <p> DPC membrane <p> Weep Holes <p> An in situ cavity tray should always be inserted where it is not possible for the cavity to extend at least 150mm below the lowest level of the damp proof course . This will occur if the walls are built from a slab on or just below the surface of the ground , or , if the walls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all other cases the cavity must extend to a minimum of 150mm below dpc . Weep holes must be provided at regular intervals to allow any moisture collected by the cavity tray to escape . 450mm is the recommended distance between weep holes . <p> You will see a lean to roof on the diagram . When a roof abutment is added to a cavity wall ( extension etc ) , unless the sides below the roof are open , the wall below the roof has changed from being an outside wall , to an internal one . There are very specific rules which apply to the protection of this wall from damp . <p> At a minimum distance of 75mm , and preferably 150mm , above the roof line of an abutting roof ( flat or pitched ) a cavity tray must be installed . Sometimes this is done in lead and this is acceptable , but these days , proprietary products are available which make this job so much easier . The whole length of the abutting roof , plus at least 150mm either side must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run down the wall which is now within the building below it . Different types of cavity trays are available for all manner of roofs and abutments . The diagram below shows how cavity trays must be stepped down a pitched roof . Weep holes must be provided and a lead flashing , as indicated on the first diagram , must also be provided . Once again , proprietary products cater for this , with cavity trays and flashing combined . <p> When installing cavity trays above a roof line , the bricks must of course be removed . This is done in sections with a section built up before another is exposed . The cavity trays are inserted through the hole . It is better if the back of the cavity tray touches the inside skin of the wall , but its not required . As long as the tray is at least 50% of the way across the cavity , it will function correctly . Most moisture in a cavity accumulates on the inside face of the outside skin , and will run down onto the cavity tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the twist in the wall ties . <p> Plastic Cavity Tray <p> Cavity Tray <p> Weep Holes <p> Roof and cavity trays <p> Home extensions book available on Amazon <h> Lintels <p> The next thing up is a lintel . Lintels need to be inserted over every opening in a wall where the wall would be weakened by that opening . The principle is that by inserting a lintel , the weight above it is transferred to either side of it . This is why a minimum of 150mm bearing must be allowed for the lintel to sit on the masonry either side of the opening . The lintel in the picture is a cavity lintel , there are many kinds , and they are all different shapes and sizes . To insert a lintel in a load bearing wall you are making a structural alteration and permission for this must be sought from the building control department of your local council . Yes , we know it is your house , but it needs to be safe . If you do not get permission for structural alterations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover you and any future buyer may reject the property on a surveyors advice . <p> Insulation is provided within a cavity lintel to stop what is called " cold bridging " . This is the transference of outside temperatures to inside walls leading to cold spots and subsequently increased condensation on those spots ( See our condensation project for further information ) . <p> Cavity lintels , for the most part , are designed to carry any water in the cavity to the outside skin , again through weep holes , but where a cavity tray dpc is used in conjunction with lintels , as must be the case with reinforced concrete , or box lintels , the dpc must extend 150mm either side of the end of the lintel . <p> Cavity Lintels <p> Reinforced Concrete Lintels <p> Box Cavity Lintels <p> Lintels can be bought to suit all standard size openings , they can be made to suit non-standard openings or larger ones can be cut down . <p> Double Skin 9 " Lintel <p> Internal 4inch wall lintel <p> Box lintel <h> Closing Cavities <p> Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of slate that closes the cavity . Cavities must be closed at all points where there is a risk of fire spreading to another part of the building . In the most part , this must be done with a non combustible material or at least one ( where specified by an architect ) that has a 30 minute fire protection rating . Cavities are closed at the termination of the wall at roof height , at the sides and head of any opening , doors , windows , meter boxes , ( the head is generally protected by the lintel , but where two concrete lintels are used , the gap between them must contain a fire barrier ) . Purpose made cavity barriers are available for this work . <p> Where a cavity is closed vertically , it is most often done by using the bricks or blocks that the wall is built from . This would of course bridge the cavity and a vertical damp proof coarse must be installed .

This guide shows you how to identify the different types of cracks in buildings including vertical cracks and horizontal cracks , what causes these cracks such as drainage problems , leaks , incorrectly compacted soil and how to spot if they are still active . Additionally you will also learn how to repair settlement and subsidence problems using techniques such as slabjacking , piling and other underpinning methods . <p> There can be a huge number of different reasons for cracks in the home . In the majority of cases small , hairline cracks in walls , ceilings and plaster can be a sign of simple expansion and contraction movement within your home due to humidity , temperature and the way that 100+ different materials in your home react to this , all expanding and contracting at different times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale there could be bigger problems with foundations where they need underpinning in some way . <p> For example timber will expand and contract due to moisture levels and temperature . Put this in the context of an exposed wooden window frame in a bathroom that has been plastered right up to it , you can imagine in this environment , due to huge humidity and temperature fluctuations that the window frame will be exposed to , it will expand and contract significantly on a daily basis causing the plaster touches it to crack . <p> In most cases you would n't have the above scenario , as the bathroom may well be tiled and you may have a UPVC window , but its just an example to demonstrate that your house is constantly on the move . <p> If your house is close to a busy road , the rumble of the passing traffic and vibration of the ground can also be the cause of cracks appearing in your home . <p> Additionally in newer properties there can be a certain period of " settlement " that the house has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can in turn cause small cracks to appear . In terms of the size of these cracks , a settlement or shrinkage crack is really anything less than 0.5mm in width . <p> In light of the above points , these sorts of very small , hairline shrinkage-type cracks in wall , ceilings and plaster are fairly minor and more of an aesthetic issue , but at the same time should not be ignored as they may be a sign of the beginnings of something more serious . They should be kept an eye on and if necessary , investigated . <p> In this project we are more interested in examining the causes of larger cracks and splits in brickwork and blockwork , normally visible on the outer cavity walls . These can be the sign of something significantly more serious . <p> If you need help with any type of wall cracking repair problem Property Repair Systems will be pleased to give you completely free , no obligation advice on 01626 336180 . The information you need may be in the Project below , but if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Types of Cracks <p> In general , there are two types of larger crack that can appear in the walls of your home that should cause concern . The direction of the crack should also be noted as this is significant : <p> Horizontal cracks ( including diagonal or stepped ) Usually appear along the mortar joints between brickwork or blockwork . They can follow the mortar joints in a line or diagonally upwards in a staircase pattern . If the crack follows a straight line it is normally caused through applied , sideways pressures e.g. a retaining wall where this may be holding back a bank of soil in the garden , or in a basement where the retaining walls provide the support for the upper floors and also hold back the soil in-fill around the sides . Additionally , poor drainage issues can also contribute heavily to these issues . If the crack is running in a staircase pattern across and up a wall then this is normally caused through subsidence or settlement issues causing the foundations to shift . Another possible cause for this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing mortar joints apart and creating cracks . More about this can be read here . In some cases these cracks may also appear in the foundation itself . Obviously this may be hard to see due to the fact they may be below ground so other , visual effects may need to be adhered to <p> Horizontal settlement crack in wall <p> Vertical cracks Minor cracks of this type usually tend to appear on internal walls and are the result movement in materials such as plasterboard or brickwork causing the plaster to crack . In the case of major vertical cracks running on exterior walls of your property ( minimum of 3mm in width ) this can indicate serious settlement issues or foundation problems . These are normally caused by a drop in a section of the foundation that then causes a property or building to effectively pull away from the rest of the structure creating the crack <p> Vertical stepped settlement crack in wall <p> When any crack suddenly appears in a property , regardless of its size , it should be investigated immediately if just to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some cases wall coverings , paint or render may obscure the extent of the cracking and damage making any cracks appear to be less serious than they actually are . <p> In the case that large cracks suddenly appear you should contact a structural engineer or professional contractor right away as your property may not only be unsafe for you but also other properties and people around you . <h> How Settlement Damage to Foundations Can Happen and Cause Cracks <p> Poor Drainage , Flooding and Rain Occasionally , if the soil surrounding a property is not properly graded to ensure that any water flows away from the property . Guttering may not have been correctly installed or is in poor condition then water can be allowed to sit and overflow . Once this happens it soaks down into the soil causing separation or voids in the ground and if it is particularly clay-heavy then it can become soft and cause foundations to sink . <p> Leaks In many cases plumbing , wastes and pipework can run under the floor of a property . If any of these develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil can become saturated around foundations and severely weaken its load bearing abilities . <p> Trees If you have any large , aged trees in close proximity to your property then they can cause serious issues . An aged trees root system can be twice as large as anything visible above ground and due to this root mass can absorb a considerable amount of moisture causing soil shrinkage . Additionally as roots grow and move they can also cause loosening and movement in soil . <p> Prolonged Drought When soil is subjected to lack of water and moisture over prolonged periods it can shrink and drop causing foundations to shift due to the lack of solid support . <p> Incorrectly Compacted Soil Fill During the construction of a property and to ensure that the base of any footings are flat and level , the builder or ground-work team will bring in material to replace the excavated soil and line the base of trenches . If this material is not correctly and suitably compacted then the weight of property above it will cause collapse and the foundations will fail . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above types of visual cracking there are a few other , slightly more subtle signs that you could have problems : <p> Internal Doors When serious subsidence or foundation issues occur they can cause your property to effectively twist and bend . When this happens , items such as door frames that need to be square so that the actual door fits within it , are pulled out of shape making the door tight and stiff to open and close . Additionally you may also notice gaps around the door and frame <p> Window Frames Similar to the above , when a building shifts , things are bent and twisted and the same can be said for window frames . If this happens , windows become stiff to open and close and the glass has been known to crack <p> Nail and Screw Heads This particular occurrence is sometimes known as nail popping or nail pops . If you have visible cracks , no matter how big , check the area around the crack for any raised nail or screw heads . If you find any , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a property begins to sag or drop due to subsidence or damaged foundations all its internals are pulled and stretched . Internal stud walls and the plasterboard coverings are pulled apart causing nail and screw heads to pop out . Do not be alarmed if you have a few popped nails round the home , in plasterboard ceilings or walls as this can happen with ordinary , minor movement caused by settlement . But where these popping nails are together with cracks appearing in the wall , it may be time to get the place checked over <p> Settlement crack above door frame <h> Cracks in Walls are They Still Active ? <p> In respect to the above , it has also been known for houses to move suddenly and a few cracks to appear , then stay in that condition for donkeys years . This may be due to a sudden shift in the ground below , or a void in the earth may have suddenly collapsed and filled with soil from above ... Any number of geological events could trigger earth movement , but it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unbelievably the UK has several hundreds of minor earthquakes every year according to earthquake measurements taken by the British Geological Society and while most of these go unoticed by us ordinary human beings , they will obviously cause movements in the ground . These movements can translate into crack round the home . <p> Below you will see 3 ways of measuring the movement in a property against an existing crack . These are simple DIY methods of measurement . <p> However , you can also buy the Professional kit for this job the Avongard Telltale. ( http : //www.avongard.co.uk ) This clever piece of plastic is called a crack monitoring gauge . It monitors horizontal and vertical movement across a crack on a flat surface to an accuracy of +/-1.0mm and by interpolation to +/-0.5mm . The opening or closing of the crack is then recorded on the monitoring card supplied with each Tell-Tale . <p> Crack monitoring gauge <h> DIY Methods of Crack Monitoring <p> Example of a crack in a wall with DIY monitoring methods installed <p> The above image demonstrates a crack in a wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 In the above image , 1 represents a piece of glass roughly 9 x 4 inches with a small hole drilled in each corner . This piece of glass is then attached over the crack using screws inserted into each hole ( or you can use Araldite or a similar strong adhesive ) . Be careful not to tighten the screws too much and use some rubber bungs or washers if you can as this will avoid cracking the glass . If there is any further movement in the structure , the crack will widen and break the glass . You will need to monitor on a regular basis . If movement is evident you will need to contact a qualified structural engineer or building surveyor right away . <p> Point 2 This represents a piece of strong tape such as Duct Tape or similar that will to a degree be resistant to elements such as rain etc. and allow it to stick and hold to the walls surface . Once the tape is stuck you will then need to mark each end at the vertical with a pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger the tape will move . Again , this will need to be monitored regularly and the relevant professional contacted if movement is evident . <p> Point 3 This represents a timber wedge that is knocked into the crack fairly tightly . Obviously do not hit it in too much if the crack is only small as this may cause more damage . You will also need to ensure that the wood is completely dry when you knock it in to the crack . If movement in the structure continues then the wedge will simply fall out . <p> The DIY methods above are ok to use as an initial indication but ultimately it is much better and in actuality better to monitor any movement as accurately as possible so a purpose made kit manufactured specifically for the job is the best thing to use . <h> Repairing Subsidence and Settlement Issues with Foundations <p> In the case of any settlement or subsidence issues this will need to be sorted as soon as possible to prevent any further damage to the property . If these problems are not remedied then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and cause very severe damage ! <p> There are several methods of repairing foundations . Depending on the severity of damage or recommendation of repair from a structural engineer , a fix will more often than not be through one of the two following methods : <p> Slabjacking as an Underpinning Method <p> Sometimes this is referred to as mudjacking or grout pumping . This process involves pumping concrete into any voids below sunken driveways , foundations or ground slabs etc . When the pumped substance fills and expands into any void areas and it then effectively lifts the sunken area back to its correct level . <p> This method is normally used where the area surrounding foundations is so unstable that piling can not be used for fear of further disrupting any supporting base and causing more damage . <p> It is also important to note that slabjacking should not be used in any area where there is a possibility that the surrounding soil could expand as this could then end up pushing everything upwards and causing more issues . <p> Mass concrete Underpinning <p> Occasionally , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the existing foundation . Sections of ground are dug away from under the concrete foundations and a mass fill of concrete is poured under the existing foundation . The new concrete is given a day to dry , then the next section is underpinned . <p> Piling used as Underpinning <p> This can be done using either concrete or steel piles . In either case a hole will need to be drilled down into the ground to a depth or usually between ten and twenty feet ( depending on how far down a stable rock base can be found ) and around twelve inches in diameter . <p> With concrete , normally a set of reinforced steel bars are then lowered into the hole for additional support and bonding of the concrete and the concrete is then poured in and allowed to set . <p> Once cured a set or hydraulic lifts are then used to raise the level of property back to its correct height and then concrete or steel spacers are inserted on top the piers to support the foundation . Normally in this case and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the property . <p> Pile and Beam Underpinning <p> Sometimes a pile and beam method is used where piles are drilled down into the ground either side of the foundation ( very messy inside the home ) and a concrete or steel beam is pushed under the foundation , or sometimes the brickwork on the foundation , each end of which sites on a pile . The more beams inserted , the greater the load they will carry . <p> Screw ( Auger ) Pile and Bracket Underpinning . <p> With steel piers these are slightly different . In some cases a steel pier will feature a screw ( often called auger piles ) at their base much the same as a corkscrew ( Helical screw piers ) . They are then screwed down into the soil and once in position special brackets are attached to support the base of the foundation . <p> The second type of steel pier is called a " push pier " . These are normally galvanised steel sections that are driven down into the soil using a hydraulic ram to provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this project , before you go about applying any repairs you should get an expert opinion and survey carried out by a structural engineer or specialist . In most cases they will then carryout a full survey and then recommend the exact repair method that should be used . <p> Piled Raft Underpinning <p> If the entire building needs underpinning and the foundations are very deep , piles can be sunk in a grid , in and around the property . Then " tunnels " are created between the piles and a concrete or steel " ring beam " system is connected to the piles . The weight of the entire property is then carried by the ring beam and the load spread evenly amongst the piles . <p> Mini Piles Through Floor Slab <p> Sometimes the foundations themselves may stay relatively stable but ( especially in clay soils ) the compacted ground under the floor slab may drop when it is too dry or the slab has been laid on a sub-base which has not been properly compacted or contains organic material which has decomposed . <p> Remedial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling down through the floor slab at intervals of between ( usually ) 600mm and 1,5m , in a grid shape , the depth of which is determined by a structural engineer but rarely less that 3m . Grout is pumped into these holes and left to go hard . As the grout dries in the holes in the slab as well as in the ground , the slab and the piles become as one . A new floor screed is then laid on top of the slab up to the correct level . <h> Large and Small Cracks in Walls and Foundations and How to Repair Them <p> Once you have repaired the cause of any settlement or subsidence issues using the above information and repair methods , the next job is to repair the visual damage such as cracks and splits in brickwork and blockwork . <p> If the repair of the cause was successful then this may have re-aligned any subsidence issues and actually closed up any splits or cracks but any remaining gaps will need to be strengthened and filled to prevent water ingress or instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vertical cracks in masonry is to effectively stitch the cracks back together using crack stitching bars . These are usually either Helical-type bars that feature a course looking thread or an epoxy-glass type rod . <p> The normal method for fixing is to first cut out a bedding joint in the masonry spanning the vertical crack . Specialist dust extraction equipment should be used to ensure that all dust and debris is removed from the joint eliminating the possibility or future failure . <p> Once the joints have been cut , the rods are inserted and a polyester or epoxy based resin is injected in to bond the rods to surrounding masonry . <p> Once the resin has set and the length of the gap has been stitched it can then be filled using a soft mortar mix . When mixing the mortar you should also add a shrink proofing agent as this will then help to compensate for any further , small amounts of movement . <p> Applied Pressures As mentioned above , these cracks are normally caused through horizontal pressures pushing in on the outsides of walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fix for this issue involves bracing with steel columns or reinforced steel rods that can then be in-filled with concrete blocks that are inserted into the ground to apply a counter-force and stabilise the movement . Other fixes involve carbon fibre straps that are bonded into the walls that then increase the load strength of the wall and reinforce it . These will not repair the cause of the damage but will stabilise the walls . The final repair method and ultimately the best is to excavate around the outside of the property , removing the cause of the horizontal pressure . Once excavated , a new exterior wall is constructed against the existing foundation but this new wall will need to be an actual retaining wall with the ability to hold back any soil back-fill and prevent future the same issues happening in the future . In any case involving applied pressure this is unfortunately one for the professionals so you will need to consult with a structural engineer and then he/she will select the best and most cost effective fix . <p> Poor internal Drainage You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for leaks and them repaired as soon as possible . This may be a little trickier where pipework that is set in concrete etc. so in these cases it may be best to consult with a qualified plumber . <p> Faulty external drainage In terms of external drainage , check that anything that abuts the property ( soil , pathways etc ) is correctly graded and directs water and moisture away from the walls and prevents it from sitting or resting in one place . It may be necessary to install a French Drain ( see our project on French Drains ) or other drainage method . Again , consult with reputable and qualified builder or building inspector . Finally , check all of your guttering for splits , leaks and cracks and get these repaired as this will also ensure that any water is dealt with correctly <p> Settlement and Subsidence In this case where settlement and subsidence occur , it may be the case the foundation has dropped down and split away from any brick courses above it . Repair would normally involve one of the above underpinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the correct level <p> Once the above cause has been sorted and a fix put in place you will now need to repair the crack itself . This is usually done by working in 600mm sections and removing one course of bricks above and below the crack . Any old mortar is removed and cleaned and the brickwork is then replaced with new mortar NOTE : This can only be done 600mm at a time as any more may cause instability in the brick or blockwork above . <p> In the majority of cases these are pretty easy to sort . Firstly clear the crack and its surrounding area of any dust or debris using a small brush and then a vacuum cleaner if you have one . <p> Next , using Polyfilla or a similar crack repair filler , spread over the crack using a spatula , ensuring that you apply a little pressure to work it into the crack . Ensure that you smooth it out and get it as flat as possible . <p> Once complete , leave for a few days to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand any bumps or raised edges until they are flat . <p> If there are any pits or dips remaining you may then need to fill these by repeating the above steps . <h> Cracks in Sills and Copings <p> As with the above , this will depend on the size of the crack and whether the sill or coping is load-bearing ( a Structural Engineer will be able to tell you this ) . In most cases you will need to widen the crack slightly to enable you to insert some mortar compound . Once widened , mix up some mortar and insert into the crack , pushing the mortar in as far as you can . Once the gap is filled up to the face level it off as flush as you can with the face of the sill or coping stone as this will ensure a natural looking finish . <p> If the crack is quite wide or it is indeed load bearing , a Structural Engineer will be able to recommend the correct repair method . In most cases this will involve stitching as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cut at 90 degrees to the crack and around an inch deep . An Angle Grinder with stone cutting disc will help you . Once channels are cut insert suitable threaded bar or Helical bar and fill with grout or resin . <p> Again , try and fill as close to the face of the sill or coping stone as possible to ensure a flush finish . <p> If after reading through this project you would like some additional expert assistance and advice , feel free to contact Property Repair Systems as their expert staff will be pleased to give you completely free , no obligation help : 01626 336180. 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624694 @1624694/ <h> How to Stop Creaking Floors and Creaking Stairs - Why Floorboards and Stairs can Creak and What you can do Stop the Noise <p> Summary : How to fix creaking floorboards . Why floor boards creak and how to stop them for good . In this project we provide some common reasons for wooden stairs and wooden floorboards creaking and making noise such as the incorrect nails being used to hold the floorboards to the joist and even not enough nails or screws being used ! We show you how you can fix these issues and have a nice solid , non-creaking floor . <p> This is a major problem in many houses and yet many people think there is an " easy " quick fix . To do this job properly will take some time and may involve the removal and reinstatement , even renewal , of some of the floor . Set aside plenty of time . <h> Common Reasons for Creaking Floorbaords and Stairs <p> The most common reason for floors creaking are : <p> The use of incorrect nails holding the floor down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails should be annular ring shank nails . These nails ( usually 2 inches long ) have serrations all round the shaft and are slightly screw like in appearance . There may also have been an insufficient quantity of nails used <p> The floor joists need to be absolutely solid and of the correct size to prevent movement across the span they are bridging . There is a table of joist sizes required for any given span in our load bearing walls project . It is also vital that the joists are fixed very solidly at either end , are spaced at the correct centres ( usually 400mm ) and can not move in their wall sockets or joist hangers . The tail of the hanger should be firmly built into the wall and the joist firmly fixed into the hanger . If the joists are built into the wall this should be done in a way which prevents both rotting and movement . <p> Cross section of joists built into a wall <p> Timbers from merchants are very rarely straight . To ensure no twist in the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when downward pressure is applied , there needs to be timber spacers or ? noggins ? at regular intervals across the floor . This is sometimes done in a ? Herringbone ? fashion using battens but more often these days is done using solid timber the same size as the joists themselves ( see image above ) <p> It is also a very good idea ( and required on all other floor levels ) to strap the first three joists on either side with a restraining bar ( called a joist strap ) which is fixed to the wall by means of plugs and screws or resin fixings when doing a loft conversion . This is not often done in a loft conversion in all fairness but is never a ? bad ? idea ( see image below ) <p> Joist strap or joist restraining bar <p> Sometimes too many , or too large holes are drilled through the joists to accommodate pipes and cables . This also applies to notches which are taken out of the top of the joists and pipes/cables are set into these notches . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for notching joists can be found on this page <p> Having made sure the joists themselves can not move the floor needs to be securely fixed to them using screws which penetrate the joist by at least the same depth of the floor itself . These should be fixed at 400mm centres in both directions . 18mm is the usual depth of a floor but if particularly weighty objects are to be placed in the roof 25mm is the next option <p> A little known ? Trick of the trade ? is the fact that sometimes the floor is absolutely solid and what is making the squeaking noises is the nails and/or screws used to hold the ? sole-plate ? of the new stud walls to the floor . If the floor moves at all , even a tiny bit ( which of course it should n't , but sometimes does ) the friction between the wall and the floor it stands on can sometimes cause a squeak which is impossible to locate unless you know this . The only retrospective remedy here is to drive timber wedges between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this wedge needs to be more than 12mm at its widest end then the floor has not been put down properly . <p> Other reasons for floors creaking are because a joint in the floor is not supported properly on a joist . A timber and plasterboard wall placed on top of the floor is not securely fixed to the floor , and any floor movement is causing the fixings to squeak . The floor joists themselves are not properly secured and are bowing or twisting under the floor . <h> How to Fix Creaking Floorboards <p> Add Additional Screws <p> The first step is to add chipboard screws to the floor to secure it to the joists . These screws must be no longer than the nails used and must be placed next to the existing nails . <p> Drill a pilot hole and countersink it for each screw . The screw heads can be covered with wood filler as in point 6 in the diagram below . Make sure you check for cables and pipes before drilling and screwing . Use additional screws if there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the joists . <p> Check Joints in Floorboards for Support <p> Check each joint for adequate support . Joints should not spring and must be firm . If you feel a joint is not supported , remove one of the boards forming that joint and fix a new joist extension to support it as ? 1 ? in the diagram . <p> To remove a board or boards it will be necessary to cut the tongue from the board using a sharp chisel or a power saw . Once the tongue of the board is cut , careful prising of the board upward , should lift the nails with it , allowing them to be removed . There is always a danger here of damaging the board ( even the pros do ) so be prepared to get a new board or two . <p> Tongue and Groove Chipboard Flooring <p> With a tongue and groove chipboard floor , the joint along the long edge of the board is not normally supported , the tongue and groove give it the strength when supported along this length by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles to the joists . <p> Floorboard Cross Section <p> Timber and Plasterboard Stud Walls <p> Number " 4 " shows a timber and plasterboard wall that has been built on top of the floor , this is standard , but all fixings for the bottom timber ( soleplate ) of this wall should go into a joist or purpose made timber " noggin " . <p> In the diagram , the nail holding the soleplate to the floor is only secured into the floor board . This will work loose and is sometimes the cause of the creaking noise . This can be diagnosed quite easily because it will generally leave a gap between the underside of the skirting and the floor . This can sometimes be cured by tapping in small timber wedges , " 3 " , and filling the remaining gap with gap filling adhesive or even the careful application of spray foam . <p> Undersized Joists and Incorrectly Supported Joists <p> The most devastating reason for a creaking floor is that the joists themselves are either not man enough for the job of supporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported in , or on the walls that should secure the ends . <p> They may also be twisting within the floor void . Number " 5 " shows a joist added and bolted to the existing to strengthen the floor , while 2 shows a noggin fixed in between the floor joists to stop the twist . Check the ends of the joists are fixed to the wall . If they are loose they must be fixed securely . <h> How to Fix Creaking Stairs <p> If you are lucky enough to have access to the underside of your stairs , you may find a typical staircase construction along the lines of the diagram below : <p> 2 = Holding blocks , glued and screwed to the back of the riser and underside of the tread . If these blocks have come loose , or even split , glue , tighten or replace them <p> 3 = Timber wedges that are inserted between the stair " string " and the wedge plates . Again these may have worked loose and need to be tapped into position and glued <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , your only option is to drill pilot holes into the tread , where it is directly over the riser , and screw down into the riser , 1 . These hole should be countersunk with the screw heads covered with filler . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

The Jaeger kit ensures not only a nice shiny finish but also a long lasting one . Additionally , the kit is easy to use for both professionals and DIYer 's alike . <p> Firstly , all surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned to remove any grease or residue and then sanded with sand paper to rough it up and allow a key for the enamel . You must then remove all traces of dust and debris and then you can apply the enamel paint with either a brush or roller . One coat should be enough to give a great finish .

@@41624696 @1624696/ <p> Decorating plasterboard is not so different to decorating new plaster other than the preparation required to get brand new boards ready for painting . For the answer to the eternal question , which side of the plasterboard should I paint , please scroll down . <p> Tapered edged boards <p> If new plasterboard walls were built to be painted or decorated , rather than plastered , boards called Tapered Edge boards will have been used . The edges of the board taper in slightly to allow the joint to be filled in such a way as to stop any lumps or bumps showing through paint or under wallpaper . The joints in the boards are filled by first taping over the joint with a vertical strip of joint tape&lt; which can be bought below in our tool store . This is then covered with a special joint filler available from builders merchants and some DIY Sheds . For the best finish we always recommend applying the joint filler in two layers . The first , with a small filling knife , working the filler into the joint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of the joint . <p> When this is dry , use a jointing knife to fill the taper and leave the filler as flush as possible with the surface of the boards . This is sanded down when dry using a fine grit sandpaper . A 12 inch ruler can be put onto the board , horizontally across the joint , and by moving the ruler up and down the joint you will be able to see if any of the filler has sunk below the level of the board or is sticking out , proud of it . Add , or sand off , filler as required . <p> Jointing knife <p> The plasterboard should then be painted with a mist coat of the emulsion you intend to use . This is a dilution of the paint to 4 parts paint to 1 part water and will allow the board , and joints , to be primed before painting with the undiluted paint . It will not harm the board to do two mist coats before painting with undiluted emulsion . <p> If you plan to wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to seal the board prior to pasting or you can size the boards with a sizing solution just as you would an ordinary plastered wall . <p> Both sides of plasterboard <p> It could be that your wall is in bad condition , so before you decorate you might need to skim plaster the wall first . You can find out how to do this by clicking on our relevant project . <p> Despite a million posts in various forums and different opinions coming from every direction we can clearly state on this website that it does not matter at all which side of the plasterboard you paint on and which side you plaster on . The ivory side of normal plasterboard is a little smoother than the brown side . This makes it a little easier to get a good finish when decorating but the difference is barely noticeable .

In this project learn about the ideal temperatures for different rooms in the home such as living rooms , dinning rooms , bedrooms and kitchens . With this information you can then calculate the total BTU 's for your entire house and what size boiler you will need . <h> What Temperature Do You Want Your Radiators To Heat Your Room To ? <p> Firstly , the temperature that you want it to be able to maintain which is a relatively straightforward task and you can use the table below as a guide . <p> Room <p> Ideal Temperature ( deg C ) <p> Lounge <p> 21 <p> Dining Room <p> 21 <p> Kitchen <p> 16 <p> Bedrooms <p> 15 <p> Bathroom <p> 23 <p> Stairs <p> 18 <h> How Much Heat From The Radiators Is Going To Escape From My Rooms ? <p> The second consideration to take into account is the the heat loss from your room . The calculations for this are quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of doors and , in particular , the construction materials used in the building . <p> Too big and the system will overshoot its temperature and be less economical to run , to small and it wo n't reach its desired temperature . <p> Some of the poorer installers get round this complex step by putting in radiators that are too big , and then fitting thermostatic radiator valves to every radiator to cut the heat down . <p> This calculation produces a heat loss figure in watts , of how much heat you need to warm that room up to the design ( and desired ) temperature from -3 deg C in one hour . <p> This will give you the output of any radiator in BTUs ( British Thermal Units ) . Adding the total for all the rooms in your home will give you the approximate demand in BTUs for the whole house . Add 20% to the total for a hot water circulating tank and 10% for general losses . This will give you the boiler size you need for your house . <p> Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the sizes you will require , it would be best to get this checked by the installer . <p> It is very unlikely that any radiator will match the exact heat required , so select the first size of radiator above the heat requirement . <p> With rooms greater than 6 meters ( 18ft ) in any one direction , it is worth considering distributing a number of radiators to minimise the thermal gradient within the room . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624698 @1624698/ <p> Summary : Acrylic baths are generally regarded as the best choice for your bathroom as they have numerous advantages over their steel and granite counterparts . In this project you will learn all about the advantages and disadvantages of acrylic baths , how acrylic baths are made , how they are fixed into your bathroom in such a way that the bathtub is supported to take the weight of any water and any persons and also how to install acrylic bathtubs . <p> Believe it or not , a bath is not just a bath , there are in fact several different types that include roll top baths , inset baths , shower baths , corner baths and even whirlpool baths and each can be constructed from different materials such as steel , plastic , granite and even wood ! <p> Each type of bath and construction material has its own set of pro 's and con 's and some will be more suited to certain installations than others . For more information on the different types of bath check out our bathroom projects area here . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do They Have ? <p> Acrylic ( sometimes called plastic ) baths are the most versatile of all baths and can be made into pretty much any shape one chooses . <p> Acrylic bathtubs are warm to the touch , keep the water temperature longer than other makes of bath , are lightweight and easily transported , can be fitted easily , have a huge range of colour options , are very hardwearing , have a great resistance to water staining , are easy to clean and have a great range of places to fit taps . <p> On the whole , a great many plus points for the acrylic bath ! But that 's not to say that they do n't have any downsides as they do , these are summarised as follows : <p> Easily marked : Acrylic as a material tends to be quite soft and due to this can mark easily . Using abrasive cleaners and cleaning pads can easily leave scratches and marks . On the plus side , this also means that they can be polished out with a little hard work ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , flexible nature of acrylic makes it not very strong or rigid . However it can be strengthened through the use of frames and base boards <p> Non fireproof : Plastic , as we all know , tends to melt when exposed to flame and high temperatures so in the unfortunate event of a fire an acrylic bath would certainly be one thing that would not survive and could possibly prolong the fire while the acrylic burns <p> Can stain easily : They can also be quite prone to staining from hair and clothes dye . Fortunately again , with a little hard work any stains can be polished out <p> As you can tell from the list of disadvantages above they are reasonably minimal and if you are careful there is no reason why an acrylic bath can not provide many years of great service . <p> One other advantage with these sorts of baths is that , although most come with pre-drilled tap holes you can buy acrylic baths with no tap holes allowing you to drill your own in a place to suit your bathroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going for a more bespoke approach and would like the taps to be in a place other than where they usually are . <h> How are Acrylic Baths Made ? <p> Typically an acrylic bath is moulded from one single sheet of acrylic which is normally 4 , 5 or 8mm thick . <p> As you can imagine , stretched over a wide area an 8mm sheet of plastic is not going to provide much support and strength let alone a 4mm sheet . <p> To solve this issue the sheet is then reinforced with glass reinforced plastic which is sprayed on . Obviously the thicker the acrylic sheet , the less reinforcement is required . <p> To provide even more strength and support the underside of the bath is usually then stuck , or fixed onto a baseboard ( usually chipboard ) to give it the strength required to support your body weight . Sometimes the baseboard is cast in with the bath and is then covered with fibreglass . <h> How is an Acrylic Bath Fixed and Supported ? <p> In most cases , when you purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . This frame will not only provide support for the base of the bath ( coupled with the baseboard mentioned above ) but it also has another job - to provide a fixing point and support for the feet . <p> The main job of the feet is to not only give a stable base between the bath and floor but to also allow the bath to be adjusted so that you can level it up . <p> In most cases each foot will have a screw adjuster that can be screwed out or in depending on whether you want to lower or raise the bath to get it level . It is very important a bath is fitted level <p> Aside from the galvanised frame and feet in most situations the bath is also fitted with a wooden frame to give it additional rigidity and strength . This frame is called a cradle . <p> Not only does the cradle provide support for the bath but it also enables bath panels to be fitted where required , allowing a solid timber base to fix to and also providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . <p> Brackets are sometimes fitted to the cradle which allow the bath to be fitted to the wall . Sometimes the plaster has to be cut back a little to allow the brackets to be set back and the edge of the bath to finish flush with the wall . <p> Please excuse some of the images in this DIY project page . When we last installed an acrylic bath we did n't have a camera handy so some of the images are of an old bathtub we have at the yard that we removed for a customer so its looking a bit shabby , but it does illustrate all the features that we will be talking about . <p> Before you Fit Your new Bathtub <p> Obviously before you fit your new bath you will need to remove the old one . Firstly , remove any bath panels that may be present to access the underside . <p> If the taps have isolation valves switch these off so the taps can be disconnected without the fear of flooding the place . If you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mains . Once tuned off , turn the taps on flat out to drain any remainiing water . <p> If you do n't have isolation valves as mentioned , now is the ideal time to install them as once the bath is out the way you will have plenty of room . <p> Isolation valve or sometimes known as Ballofix valve <p> Once the taps are disconnected , disconnect the waste pipe from the drain in the base of the bath and then look all the way around the underside of the bath to check for any additional bracket fixings that may secure the bath to the wall . Remove them if you find any . <p> Once all the fixings have been disconnected or removed , jiggle the bath slightly to feel if it will now move . If not , check for more fixings . <p> Once there is some movement , again , jiggle it around and slide away from any adjoining walls and remove it from the bathroom so that it is not in the way . Depending on the size of the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly tripping over an old bath is not going to make the job any easier . <p> If the old bath was not sealed correctly then you may find that it has been allowing water and moisture to leak down to the floor for a good few years . If so then you might find that the floor ( if it 's timber ) is badly rotted . If this is the case it will need replacing ! <p> If the floor is in good condition it is a good idea to treat it with a decent wood treatment as this will help to protect it and stave off any furure possibility of rot and insect damage . <p> Once treated , allow it to dry thoroughly before commencing with the rest of the job . <p> Firstly unpack your new bath and move it up into your bathroom area . Do n't remove the protective plastic film that normally covers the bath just yet as this will help protect against potential knocks and scratches while installing . <p> With any major packaging out the way position the bath where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it should be - hot and cold tap supply , waste pipe etc .... <p> One final point to note is the tiles . With your new bath in position you may find that your existing tiles extend down past the edge of the bath . <p> In an ideal world you would want the tiles to stop above the edge of the bath so that you could then seal the bath to the wall , tile down to the top of the bath leaving a 2-3mm gap and then seal the bath to the tiles . <p> This ensures that any water or moisture that seeps down the wall behind the tiles down not carry on down to the floor , it is stopped at the top of the bath and will eventually seep into the bath . <p> In light of this , idealy you would remove the base layer of tiles and then replace them once the bath is in place . This may not be possible for a number of reasons and if not the only choice is to seal the bath to the tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to periodically ( every 6 months or so ) remove and replace the sealant to ensure a continued leak resistant seal . <p> Fix Baseboard if Required <p> If your chosen bath does not feature an in-built base board then you will need to add one . Using a piece of chipboard , cut it to the size of the base area of your bath . You will need to use at least 18mm chipboard , ideall use 2 pieces and stick them together using a decent construction adhesive to give you 36mm in thickness . <p> Once prepared , use a solvent free construction adhesive ( as some solvents melt plastic ) to stick it to the base of the bath . You will propably want to turn the bath upside down for this and you will need to leave it until dry . <p> Acrylic bath with base board glued on <p> Build Timber Frame and Fix Galvanised Supporting Frame <p> The final " building bit " is to construct your timber frame for additional support and for fixing bath panels . <p> You can get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be visible and it is cheaper than planed or prepared timber . <p> You can use either 1/2 inch x 1 inch or 1 x 2 inch timber for this . 1 x 2 inch is propably better as it will be a little stronger and should also protrude down from behind the lip of the bath a little giving you fixing positions if needed . <p> Flip the bath over again so that the underside is accessible . Measure around the inside , behind the lip and then cut your timbers and fix them together . You may have to trim the timber up that sits across the edge with the taps depending on how much room you have . <p> Once you have assembled your frame drop it onto the bathtub to check that it fits ok . <p> When it comes to fixing it , obviously you do n't want to be screwing it to your tub so you can use your construction adhesive to glue it in place . Again , allow it to dry thoroughly before proceeding . <p> Timber support frame for acrylic bathtub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in place you can then fix the galvanised frame . <p> Most frames will feature a fixing point at the top that will have a screw hole . As above , this is easier done when the bath is flipped over so that the underside is facing upwards . Once upsidedown position the frame on to the cradle <p> You may find that you need to wiggle it slightly so that the fixing points are flat on the surface of the cradle . Now align it centrally both along the width and length of the bath so that it provides support across an even area . <p> When fixing it , start at the tap end and then at the opposite end . Once these are fixed you can the deal with the fixings along both the longer sections . <p> Ensure that all are screwed down firmly and when flipped back up , the bath feels sturdy and solid . <p> Galvanised frame leg fixed to wooden cradle <p> Fix the Taps and Waste <p> As the bath is currently moveable it is a good idea to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came with the bath or you bought them seperately , they should include assembly and installation instructions . It 's a good idea to follow these as methods may be slightly different between manufacturers . <p> In most cases you will be using either seperate hot and cold taps or a mixer tap , in either case , installation is prety much the same . Unscrew the remaining nuts ( the large plastic ones ) from each of the taps and then poke the base of one of the taps down through a tap hole . <p> Install each tap in the required position depending on which way around your pipes are in terms of hot and cold . In most cases hot will be on the left and cold will be on the right . <p> Reach underneath the lip of the bath and screw the retaining nut up until it is finger tight . Make sure that the tap is straight on the top . As you may have noticed , getting a spanner on to the nut in order to tighten it up is nigh on impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in very handy as it will allow you to access these tight areas . <p> Once the taps are in position on the bath it is also a good idea to fix the tap connectors onto each tap . The easiest connectors to use are push fit fittings as you can then just push these straight onto the exising water supply pipes . <p> If you have a mixer tap and both inlet hoses are connected to the same ( mono ) block you will need a small box-spanner to tighten the flexible hoses onto the block properly . These can be bought from any plumbers merchants . <p> If the pipes are clean and the seal is good they will be equally as good as a compression fitting . <p> Push fit tap connector <p> When it comes to the waste , normally this will feature a chrome or stainless steel cover that sits inside the bath with a rubber seal behind it and a screw will run down through the centre that screws into the rest of the pipework underneath the bath . <p> The act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover on the inside of the bath up tight and prevents any water from leaking . To aid with this seal it is also a very good idea to apply a bead of silicone on the underside of the drain cover , all the way around it , to provide an additional layer of resistance to any leaks . <p> Depending on the type of bath you have and who made it , the final job should be to bolt on the plug chain fixing . There should be a small hole located near the overflow drain off or near the taps somewhere . <p> Unscrew the bolt on the chain bolt , push the bolt through and then from underneath , screw the bolt back on and tighten it , but not too tight as this may crack the bath . <p> Again , for some added protection , apply a small amount of silicone around the bolt hole when you have inserted the bolt , to totally plug the hole and prevent any potential leakage . <p> Move the Bath into Position and Fix <p> Before you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is add some additional bearers on top of the floor surface that will sit under the feet on the frame . This will help with keeping the bath from moving when its in use and also provide more load-bearing support for the floor . <p> When it comes to the bearers its best to use 1/2 inch x 6 - 8 inch timber as this will give a good area for weight distribution and allow a little movement room for the feet so that you can get the bath in exactly the right place . You should also screw the bearers firmly to the floor so that they stay in place . <p> Timber bearers fixed to floor to support bath feet <p> With the cradle and frame fixed and the taps and waste in place along with further supporting bearers in the floor , move the bath into its final resting position ensuring that it is pushed up tight to any walls or other solid surfaces . <p> Now that the bath is in place , use a spirit level to get the bath level by screwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath fits flush with a wall and you have brackets that hold the bath to the wall , now is the time to fit these . If the base of the feet have screw holes you can screw them to the bearers . <p> Adjustable feet that are fixed to the baths galvanised frame <p> Bath pushed into position and levelled up <p> Connect up Taps and Waste and Check for Leaks <p> Now that the bath is in place you can start connecting up . You should already have your flexible tap connectors fixed to the taps so it should be a case of pushing each onto the relevant hot or cold supply pipe . <p> If your taps were previously connected using compression fitting you may need to cut a section of the exisising pipe off to remove the old olive and also allow some room for the length of the connector pipe . Also ensure that you remove any paintwork and clean pipes with wire wool before pushing on connectors . Push fit connectors must only be fitted to the bare pipe as if not you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's tackle the waste . If your bath is of the same size and shape as the old one then you should be able to use the existing waste pipework . If so , firstly slide the screw up collar back and remove the rubber seal and give it and the end of the pipe a good clean with an old cloth to remove any debris . <p> Its a good idea to fit a new rubber seal at this point to ensure a good joint . Your new waste should include a new one but if not pop down to your local plumbers merchant with the seal and ask them to match it for a new one . <p> Refit the rubber seal and position the piework back to meet the new waste on the base of the bath . Ensure that pipework mates together nicely and that there are no major gaps around the area the two meet as , when screwed up , this could cause the pipework to twist and put unnecessary stress on other joints that could cause leaks . <p> Screw the collar onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Over tightening can cause leaks . You can tighten further if needs be later if you find you have leaks when we test . <p> With everything connected up it 's time to test for leaks . You will need to turn the water back on at the mains ( if it is off ) or open up your isolation valves if they are closed . <p> Once all back on check all your new connections for signs of seepage or leaks . If any are found carefully tighten any compressions joints ( only a little to begin with ) and wipe away any water and then check again . <p> If any of your push fit fittings are leaking ensure that they are pushed all the way onto any pipes . Additionally , there are 2 types of these fittings - push fit and twist &amp; lock . The push fit type are just pushed onto a given pipe whereas twist &amp; lock are not only pushed on to the pipe but you then have to turn the collar until tight to create the seal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none are visible right away they may develop over time . With this in mind it is a good idea to keep the pipes visible for a good few hours to make sure that none develop . <p> To test for leaks in the waste , pop the plug in and fill the bath up to about half way and then remove the plug . The pressure and volume of water rushing down the plug hole should make any leaks evident quite quickly . If you find any , push the fitting together more tightly . If this does not work you may have to replace the push-fit fittings with solvent weld . See our project and video on solvent welding pipes here for more info . <p> Add Supports for Timber Frame <p> To add a little more rigidity its also a good idea to fix vertical uprights at each accessible corner from the base of the cradle down to the floor . <p> Not only will this help by adding strength and support for your galvanised frame but it will also help in preventing movement of the bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Measure down from the base of the timber cradle to the floor and cut lengths of 2 x 1 inch timber . To fix to the frame and floor its best to use some 90 angle brackets . <p> Where the bath butts up to a wall it is also good to fix the upright into the wall . <p> Complete any Tiling <p> The penultimate job is to now finish off any tiling you may need to do . <p> Acrylic baths should always be filled with water before the wall is tiled down to them as they are the most flexible type of bath and , if not fixed 100% securely , it can move when bathing takes place . This can be avoided by filling with water to see how much movement takes place . <p> For a full and detailed run down on how to tile a wall , check out our ceramic tiling project . Remember , before you tile down to the bath , seal the bath to the wall using a suitable silicone sealer , complete your tiling and then seal along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bath filled with water ready for tiling down to <p> Install Bath Panels <p> The final job ! After you have left all the pipework exposed for a good amount of time to confirm there are absolutely no leaks its time to fit bath panels ( if indeed you want to ! ) . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Also find out about more hands-on approaches such as using sand paper , wet and dry paper and wood scrapers . <p> As I 'm sure anyone that has previously tried this will agree , its not one of the nicest jobs to do as it can be messy and time consuming . <p> We get many questions regarding stripping paint from flaky walls , door and window frames etc . As is the case with many jobs the final finished product will be reflected by the prep work carried out on the surface . <p> If the surface is not clean , flat and free of dust , flakes , grease etc then the final finish will either look rough or will crack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this information in mind , preparation is the key to success ! <p> Pretty much all the techniques discussed in this project will work on a variety of surfaces such as wood and metal etc .... but it is always a good idea to check the manufacturers specifications on specific paint stripping products to ensure they will not cause damage . <h> Before We Start Stripping Paint Lead Paint Awareness ! <p> Lead paint is one of the major sources of lead in older houses . It is recorded that about twothirds of the homes built before 1940 , and onehalf of the homes built from 1940 to 1960 have been decorated with leadbased paint . Some homes built in the 60 's and early 70 's may also contain some lead too . <p> DIY Doctor , in the interests of safety does not recommend sanding down or burning off paint from internal or external surfaces of a house unless you can be sure the paint does not contain lead . If this is the case , please see our project on preparing timber for painting where you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following paragraphs below you will see a product called Paint and Varnish Remover and this is the best product DIY Doctor has found in over 30 years of decorating , for stripping paint . It is safe and it is clean . If this project looks like product placement it 's because it is ! This is the only way we strip paint and we know what we are doing . <p> Danger of lead paint warning sign <h> Paint Stripping Options <p> When it comes to stripping paint there are several ways that this can be done and depending on the situation , environment or surface you may be able to pick and choose from the options available or you may only have one choice ! <p> NOTE : Whichever option you choose its always a good idea to test on a small and inconspicuous area first to ensure that no permanent damage will be caused . <p> Paint stripping options : <p> Liquid , gel or paste strippers <p> Mechanical strippers such as sanders <p> Hand stripping with sand paper <p> Heat guns <h> Using A Liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is probably the quickest and easiest way to strip paint and in the majority of situations can be the most useful as it can be applied with a brush or putty knife and due to this can be plied into very tight spaces where you may not be able to get a scraper . <p> Due to this , it can be great for use on decorative moulding and odd shapes where scraping would take a life time . <p> As you may be aware there are quite a few products of this kind on the market . The most common of these come in the following forms : <p> Gel Type Paint Stripper <p> The gel types can be brushed onto the surface to be stripped using a paint brush . Once applied ( read the manufacturers guidelines on the packaging for how much should be applied to the surface , generally a thin layer 1 2mm thick ) . <p> You generally have to wait a few minutes while the gel penetrates and as it either softens or lifts off ( in most cases you should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can then be scraped off using a scraper or wiped off with an old rag or cloth . <p> This process may have to be carried out several times depending on how many layers of paint have been applied to the surface over the years . <p> Once you have scraped off the first coat , inspect the surface for any remaining paint and then repeat the process if necessary . <p> Gel based paint stripper <p> Paste Type Paint Stripper <p> With paste type stripper , this usually comes in 2 forms a powder that you have to mix and a ready to use version . Similar to the gel version above and depending on the consistency , you may be able to apply the paste with a brush but if it is too stiff you may need to use a scraper or a putty knife . <p> Spread the paste over the surface to be stripped following the guidelines on the packaging as to how much should be applied ensuring that you ply it into any corners etc ( again usually a thin layer 1 2mm thick ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified by the manufacturer . <p> Unlike the gel type where in most cases you can see the reaction occurring , you will be unable to if you use paste so ensure you wait for the full amount of time specified by the manufacturer . <p> Once this time is reached test a small area first to ensure that it has worked correctly . The paint should lift away with the paste . <p> If all has worked as it should , use a scraper to lift the paste and paint away from the surface . <p> Paste based paint stripper <p> Which ever of the above methods you have used , once you have removed all of the paint it is always a good idea to clean over the surface with some fine wire wool or very fine sandpaper . <p> Take great care when doing this as if the surface is wood or decorative then there is a good chance that if you are too heavy handed or use a course abrasive then you will damage it ! <p> As easy as they are to apply , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are corrosive and can burn if contact with bare skin is made and they can also give off harmful and toxic fumes so always refer to the packaging and manufacturers instructions for use and always use in a well ventilated space , wear gloves , eye protection and if possible overalls and other protective clothing . <p> In some cases ( depending on what you are applying to ) gels and pastes can also cause surface damage e.g. to some wood fillers . If this is the case then you will have to repair/replace before you can then start painting . <p> One further thing to be aware of is that once you have used chemicals on a surface , before you re-paint , you will have to thoroughly clean the surface first in order to remove any chemical residue as this may affect the paint . Refer to the manufacturers instructions once again for this and what to use in order to neutralise any residue . <p> In most cases this can be achieved by using white spirit , adding some to a rag and then wiping the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One final point to make is always ensure that you do not leave chemical based strippers on a surface for any period where they could then dry into the surface as this can then become a monumental hassle to ensure that you have removed from the surface entirely . <p> Advantages : <p> Quick and easy to apply <p> Can get into awkward areas <p> Thorough and complete paint removal <p> Disadvantages : <p> Corrosive to skin and can burn <p> Produces toxic fumes <p> Can damage some surfaces and fillers <p> Needs cleaning properly before applying paint <p> An Alternative to Traditional Chemical Strippers <p> Here is a product which is taking the market by storm .

These include : <p> The domestic plate/sheet sanders - you may already be familiar with these , usually feature a foam plate that you strap a piece of sandpaper to and the plate vibrates creating the friction between the sandpaper and the surface <p> The belt sander type - an oval belt revolves around a set of rollers rubbing the sandpaper over the surface <p> The drill attachment type - usually circular in appearance and slot into the end of a standard drill chuck and revolve in a circular motion , powered by the drill <p> The orbital type - similar to the plate/sheet sander in that a sanding disc/sheet is attached to a plate at the base of motor that turns the disc in a circular motion creating the friction between the sheet and surface <p> Detail/Corner sanders these come in various shapes and sizes and are similar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plates are not uniform rectangle in shape they are usually odd shapes , featuring points enabling you to get into hard to reach corners etc . <p> Drum sanders these feature a foam drum that features an abrasive coating that revolves and creates the friction between the drum and the surface . <p> All of the above have their advantages and disadvantages ; you can cover large areas in a relatively short space of time , there is a wide and varied selection of grades ( coarse to fine ) that can be attached and adapted to almost any sanding/stripping situation . Attachments can be purchased to enable you to get into hard to reach areas etc . <p> Despite the above advantages there are also quite a few disadvantages ; its easy to use the wrong grade of paper for the wrong surfaces causing damage . <p> Its also very easy to get carried away and go past the surface you are trying to remove and burrow into the surface below as some machines can be quite aggressive . It can also be difficult to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sanding or stripping you will create a huge amount of dust that will get everywhere and will take a lifetime to clean up and in some cases can damage electrical equipment if left unprotected ( always ensure any furniture etc .... is covered and you are wearing goggles and a suitable dust mask ) and also you have to be aware of the surface you are sanding e.g. if it is wood then you have to be careful to run with the grain of the wood as you can damage the surface . <p> Advantages : <p> Sand and strip large areas at a time <p> Varied range of paper grades for different jobs <p> Cost effective when it comes to purchasing sanding paper <p> Disadvantages : <p> Using the wrong paper can damage a surface <p> You can damage the surface beneath the paint <p> Sanding intricate or odd shaped objects can be tricky <p> Massive amount of dust created <p> Have to be aware of the type of surface you are sanding e.g. you can damage timber if you do not run with the grain when sanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As you can guess this involves a fair amount of elbow grease and due to this fact is only a realistic solution for small jobs where there is only a very thin layer of paint that needs to be removed . <p> There are several ways to do this : <p> Using Sandpaper : <p> The first is using sandpaper Firstly start with quite a coarse grade of paper ( 60 or 80 grit ) and as you get through the layer(s) of paint move down to more of a medium paper ( 180 or 240 grit ) . <p> Once pretty much all the paint has been removed it is always a good idea to go over it again with a fine grade of paper ( 800 to 1200 grit ) to give the surface a nice smooth finish , if or course that 's the finish you are after . <p> This final process also removes any final microscopic traces of paint that may remain on the surface . Again , this will create a fair amount of dust so always remember eye protection and a mask ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and course grade papers <p> Using Wet and Dry Sandpaper : <p> You can also use wet and dry sandpaper . This is very similar to the conventional sandpaper type only you can dip it is water before you begin sanding over the surface . <p> This helps to prevent too much dust and depending on the surface you are stripping will create a lovely smooth finish . <p> If the surface you are working on is wooden this may not be the ideal solution as obviously it involves the use of water and thus the water will be absorbed by the wood making it swell so before re-painting can commence you will have to give it plenty of time to dry out . <p> General purpose wet and dry sandpaper set with fine , medium and course grade papers <p> Also if the surface you are working on is shaped or decorative this is not the best solution as no matter how careful you are you will begin to flatten edges and remove detail . <p> Using a Wood Scraper <p> The final method of hand sanding is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good results but if you are not careful you can bite into the surface and take chunks out of it . <p> General purpose wood scraper <p> Advantages : <p> Cheap and cost effective for all types <p> Fairly easy to control the amount of paint removed <p> Ideal when only small amounts of paint need removing <p> Disadvantages : <p> Lots of hard work <p> Easy to damage detailed work <p> Can damage surface <h> Paint Stripping Using Heat <p> There are 2 tools that are commonly used in order to strip paint using heat the blow torch and the heat gun . Each of these tools has a very specific difference . <p> Blow Torches <p> The blow torch uses a naked flame in order to heat a surface and strip paint . Most available today feature an adjustable knob that will allow you to control the temperature and intensity of the flame by using specially supplied nozzles you can control the air flow . <p> Heat Guns <p> Unlike the blow torch , the heat gun does not use a naked flame in order to heat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are all used to this works on the same basis only in a more intense manner , essentially a hair dryer x10 ( Do not try and use a heat gun as a hair dryer ) ! ! <p> Using Heat Guns and Blow Torches <p> When using either tool above ensure that it is held a constant distance from the surface , roughly 6 to 8 inches ( you may have to adjust depending on the intensity of your flame/heat source ) . <p> With the tool held at the correct distance move it back wards and forwards over the surface in a sweeping motion again of about 6 to 8 inches heating the surface as you go . After a period of time you will begin to see lift from the surface ( bubbling or wrinkling ) . <p> Once the paint has started to lift you will then need a scraper in order to scrape it off . An old rag is also a good idea in order to wipe of any residue . <p> Repeat until all the paint has been removed and once all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sandpaper ( more than likely a fine grade 800 to1200 grit ) and rub the surface down to remove any final residue and also give the paint a decent surface to key to . <p> Before using either of the above items its always worth practicing for a while to get used to the intensity of the flame/heat settings and also how fast a surface is heated and how long the heat source can remain in one place before it causes and scorching or damage . <p> Using this method may in some cases cause the resin in the timber to seep out . Also any fillers that may exist in the surface you are heating can become damaged and will need to be replaced before re-painting/covering <p> As mentioned it is a good idea to practice before you get stuck into the actual job get used to your heat gun/blow torch and the way it works and functions . <p> Also , as you work beware of items around you e , g , materials such as curtains , carpet , sofas , plastics etc .... you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove anything that can be removed and if it ca n't move it/tie it out of the way as best as you can . Also beware of glass . If this is heated with too much intensity then it will crack . <p> As with the other paint stripping methods wear eye protection and also a mask . Heating paint can in some cases give off harmful fumes . Also , always , always wear a pair of heavy duty gloves such as riggers gloves . <p> While you are concentrating on the work in hand its very easy to forget about what you have in your hand and as the paint begins to bubble and wrinkle and you move in with your scraper to scrape it off you can occasionally end up torching the back of your scraper hand as you pass it underneath the heat gun/blow torch ! ! <p> Advantages : <p> Can remove paint very quickly <p> Works on multiple layers <p> Relatively cheap to purchase <p> Disadvantages : <p> Can be very dangerous <p> Can damage the surface or item you are trying to strip especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job <p> Hot air or heat gun with multiple heat settings 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Choosing Shower Panels instead of tiles makes installing a waterproof surface easier . We explain how to choose and then fix panel board to your bathroom walls , to provide additional waterproofing around sensitive areas such as the bath and shower . Find out more about them below . <h> Shower Panels Instead of Tiles ? <p> Aquabord Shower Panel kits 1200mm width <p> When DIY'ers install a bathroom and add a shower the first waterproof thought is ceramic tiles . Things are changing quickly in the bathroom world however and shower panels are fast becoming the way to go . <p> There are many types of shower panel on the market . Aquabord , Mermaid , Aquapanel , Wetwall , Minerelle , Aquamura , and so on . These are all Trade names for waterproof panels made specifically for use in the bathroom . <p> Their installation is so much easier than tiles and , if installed correctly , they are maintenance free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildew or mould . <p> Our favorite is Aquabord and when ordered from IPSL it can be bought in kits made up from panels 2400 x 1200mm . These panels are 10mm thick and faced with a hard laminate which is totally waterproof . The panels have Polyfoam backing to make them really light and easy to handle . Click on any of the images to read and see more about Aquabord shower panel kits . <p> The main problem with ceramic tiled bathrooms is the leaks which are mostly caused by poor grouting between the joints of the tiles . The real difficulty is that although a joint may be leaking , in many cases it is impossible to find . No such problem exists with shower panels . <p> There is usually just one joint and if this is put together in accordance with the manufacturers instructions using the recommended sealants etc it will be guaranteed for 15 years . No such guarantee comes with the arduous task of covering the bathroom wall in tiles ! <p> Aquabord Shower Panel kits 1200mm width <h> Benefits of Decorative Shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clad in just two panels , at right angles to each other and joined by one jointing bead . The edges of each board are covered with an edge trim or external corner and matching skirting boards are available for decoration on otherwise plain walls . <p> Bathroom and shower panels can be installed over existing tiles in bathrooms and come in either plain , or in a huge variety of patterns . They are warm to the touch and can be wiped clean and because of their inherent warmth will reduce condensation problems in the bathroom . The panels can be simply stuck to existing walls and most manufacturers will actually sell shower kits . These kits , based on the experience of thousands of showers , are for two or three wall showers and include everything required to finish the job . <p> Good suppliers will offer full installation instructions and most have these in downloadable format from their websites . <h> How to Fit Decorative Shower Panels <p> As a general rule it is advisable to leave shower panels in the bathroom for half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humid places and any material needs to adjust to the area it is to be installed in to minimise movement after installation . <p> Make sure all surfaces are clean and any painted surfaces must be sanded to give the adhesive a good key . Always seal newly plastered walls and see our Painting New Plaster project in our projects area for how to do this . You can click on the link to the right of the page to order a brochure showing all of the available kits and colours etc . <p> Measure for your panels and cut with the face side up . Always double check your measurements before you cut anything . Panel adhesive is applied to the walls just as you would when tiling . Use a notched trowel ( see our ceramic tiling projects ) to form a grooved covering and do not leave any spaces for air to get into and expand . The panel should not be taken right down to the shower tray as some movement must be expected . Leave the panels a couple of mm short and fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling level also . <p> Most manufacturers , and definitely those dealing with PVC , uPVC or plastic panels will not allow the use of Solvent adhesives and sealants . This is because the solvent melts the PVC . <p> Shower panels in place <p> The corners are joined using a corner bead or trim which sits behind the panels as shown in the image left . Each one of the side panels pushes against the two central rubber lugs . Sealant is applied to the sides before the panel sides are pushed in , when both the panels are tight against the corner bead and stuck to the wall . <p> The finishing cap is pushed into the two lugs after sealant is applied to the gap . This gives a completely water-tight seal and even if a drop of water gets behind the finishing bead it can not do any damage as the corner bead itself is stuck to both of the shower panel board sides .

Opening up fireplaces - explaining flues , fire hearths , register plates , how fires work and regulations for installing a log burner or woodburning stove . <p> Fitting a wood burning stove or fire carries no stipulation that the work can not be carried out by a DIY enthusiast . All work however does have to comply with part J of the building regulations . These regulations can be seen in our projects section . Such work should n't be carried out without a building notice having been applied for through a local authority building control office or such work signed off and certificated by a competent person . <p> If this work is not carried out by a competant person ( E.G a HETAS installer ) it must be inspected by someone from your local councils Building Control Department .

The efficiency of the fire will depend on putting the right wood burner into the right opening and using the correct flue . If they do not all match up you could be wasting a great deal of energy . <p> Wood burning stoves and fires are , in themselves , fairly simple . The wood , or solid fuel is fed into the chamber , set light to , and the smoke and exhaust fumes escape up a flue to outside air . It is however , absolutely vital , that during this process no heat escapes through any gaps or cracks . Wood burners and other solid fuel fires , including open coal fires , created an immense amount of heat . If this heat is allowed to escape before it gets to open air it can very easily cause a fire and it is imperative you have any existing flue checked by a qualified engineer before attempting to fit a wood burning stove or fire . <p> Fireplace opening <p> The first job after having the flue checked is to have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not . This project is about connecting a wood burning fire to a flexible flue and the first thing we did after opening up the old fireplace and checking the flue was to chop out and repoint the brickwork in the fireplace with a lime mortar . The proper mortar mix can be found here . <p> You can just see , at the top of the fireplace , the new flexible flue hanging down . Our first job , while the fireplace was empty , was to install a steel frame to hold what is called a register plate . The register plate stops loose objects falling from inside the stack into the fireplace and also keeps the flue insulation in place . It should be made of a non flammable material and it fits round the wood burner flue pipe while also blocking off the opening to the stack completely . Proprietary steel register plates can be bought from the fire supplier and they will measure the fireplace opening and position of the flue for you . You will still need to install a frame or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We use fibre cement for our register plates because it is easy to cut , very light and easy to position . <p> Fitting top flue outlet to wood burner <p> Adapter and liner <p> Adapter and flue liner <p> Next the flue outlet is fitted to the top of the wood burner . To stop heat escaping from any gaps the flue outlet bracket sits in a slight recess at the top of the wood burner and a length of fire rope is placed in between the two . As the flue outlet is tightened down onto the top of the wood burner , the fire rope is squashed into place . Fire rope is also used as the seal between the wood burners door and the frame it butts up to . This is in place when you purchase the woodburner . <p> Having measured the distance from the top of the fire ( inside the flue outlet ) to a point 100 mm above the top of your new register plate frame , you can cut off the surplus flue liner and cut the wood burner flue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate it is as well ( if it will not cause an eyesore ) to keep the joint between flue pipe and flue liner , below the register plate . Our fibre register plates can be lifted easily and the joint inspected . A special collar , or adapter is used to join the top of the flue pipe to the bottom of the flexible flue . Sit the flexible liner into the collar so it is located centrally . Tighten the self tapping screws round the collar to hold the liner in position and to secure the collar to the liner . Another length of fire rope is inserted into the collar and fitted around the circumference of the flue pipe . Fire cement is now rammed into the collar so there are no air voids . The joint is then smoothed off and left for a while . Fire cement goes hard when exposed to heat . Many installers use fire mastic for this joint . <p> Complete unit of wood burner and flue system <p> Flue adapter with pipe <p> Flue pipe in position <p> Register plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shape <p> The register plate can now be fitted into the frame .

This is done for the two parts of the plate surrounding the flue pipe and straight lengths are fitted to fill any gaps . Fibre cement can be bought at builders merchants and it is most often used in strips of 100 or 150mm wide as a tile undercloak to roof verges . <p> Seal the joints and gaps of the register plate with some fire mastic and you are now ready to get up onto the roof ( Please heed the safety warning shown on our flue lining page ) and slide the closing plate off , or to one side , while you fill the void between flue liner and chimney with Vermiculite insulation .

@@41624705 @1624705/ <p> Dry lining or drywall as it is called in the States is the term used to describe covering a structure with a dry product which is attached to the structure . Traditionally surfaces were covered with a wet sand and cement render or plaster . Dry lining now refers mainly to covering internal walls with plasterboard . The plasterboard is either stuck on the walls or fixed to a timber , or steel frame which is attached to the walls . <p> Dry lining has several advantages over the wet finish in that it can be installed much more quickly , especially in the case where it is stuck to the walls using a mix of plaster as adhesive . This method is called dot and dab . The fact that dry lining is lighter than its wet counterparts means that the finished construction is lighter and further more less moisture is introduced into the building structure . Dry lining partitions also means that properties can be changed to suit the changing needs of a family more quickly . Dry lining also allows ( in the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property warm and meet the increasingly demanding specifications of the Insulation Building Regulations . Conservation of fuel and power are most Governments buzzwords these days . Plasterboard also comes in many varieties which , without changing methods of construction too much , allow for the introduction of soundproofing , greater fire protection , moisture protection and the protection offered when warm vapour is not allowed to get into voids and condense on colder surfaces . Condensation is one of the most frequent causes of damage in properties and should be safeguarded against as often as possible . Finally a huge advantage of dry lining is , if it is properly prepared , it is considerably easier to decorate than plaster . <p> The disadvantages of dry lining are that it is more difficult to fix things to , and easier to damage . It is also , without the introduction of the correct products , terrible at sound insulation . There are any number of plasterboard fixings available now and with a little forward planning when building a new plasterboard wall or partition additional timbers can be inserted to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most people involved with DIY will turn to dry lining as a means of warming their properties and preventing the damage caused by moisture . In older houses with solid walls , the appearance of damp in the colder months is common . This is most often caused by condensation . Condensation can be combated in a huge way by reading our project and using simple ventilation methods to change the air in a room frequently . For the longer term , the walls can be well insulated using dry lining . This involves either fixing timbers to the walls , fitting insulation between the battens then fixing and decorating plasterboard , or placing dabs of plaster on the walls and pushing plasterboard onto them . The battening can be done using 25 x 50mm treated sawn battens with a 25mm thick polystyrene " batts " in between . A vapour barrier needs to be introduced and this can be done by either fixing a polythene sheet to the timber battens before fixing the plasterboard or , more simply , by using vapourcheck plasterboard which has a thin silver foil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects section to see our project on the different types of plasterboard available . <p> If you are considering dry lining because your walls are damp please first check to see whether the water is getting in from outside . Our damp projects will help you identify the possible causes of damp in your building and the project on damp or mould will help you search for possible origins of water ingress . <p> Forget Nails Adhesive <p> Take off skirting boards where possible . Keep them safe as they can be reused . . If there is any mould on the walls and you are sure you have dealt with any water ingress , treat the walls with a fungicide solution and follow the instructions carefully to kill all the mould . Fix the timber battens at 400mm centres after fixing battens at ceiling and floor level . These will be required to fix the top and bottom of the board to .

Our project on plasterboard partitions shows you about these boxes . Battens need to be placed round these as shown in the diagram , left as the plasterboard needs to be fixed around the perimeter of all openings For window or alcove cut outs see our project on cutting and fixing plasterboard .

@@41624707 @1624707/ <p> Relax ! ! ! This problem does not mean you have a major wiring fault . This is a never ending problem which has been looked into for donkeys years . A wiring fault in your circuit will be picked up by fuses and MCB 's long before it gets to the bulb . <h> What can Cause a Bulb to Blow ? <p> There are a few reasons bulbs can blow , the major one being cheaper bulbs . The elements in cheap bulbs are much thinner and any surge of power , however slight , simply breaks them . Always go for more expensive , better quality light bulbs , its cheaper in the long run . <p> A loose connection in the lamp holder can also cause bulbs to blow . This is because the circuit is not completed as tightly as it could be and the electricity may have cause to " arc " or jump across the contact , rather than simply flowing through it . When this happens it produces more heat in the fitting than is expected or catered for by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same can happen if the spring loaded connection in the bulb holder is slightly loose . This will cause electricity to arc across the contact , cause too much heat and blow the bulb . This can very often be diagnosed by looking at the contact on the bottom of the bulb to see if it is pitted . <p> Arcing electricity effectively melts the metal it is arcing onto ( This is how arc welding works ) so if the bulb contact is being subjected to arcing , tiny little indentations occur , called pitting . <p> It is sometimes possible , if the live connection in your light switch is a little loose , for this to happen here also . Heat will be generated and it is possible , though very very remote , for the bulb to blow as a result of this . <h> What happens When a Bulb Blows ? <p> When a bulb blows , 99% of the time the fuse for the lighting circuit will blow or trip also . This makes the problem seem rather bigger than it actually is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCB is that the lamp element gets thinner during its life to the point where it breaks at the thinnest point , this point will melt just before failure . The resistance of the overheating element will momentarily be very low and a current surge is caused , this is picked up by MCB 's but generally not fuses . <p> Working Bulb <p> Broken Bulb <h> Blowing Bulb Checklist <p> So , three things to look into if your bulbs keep blowing : <p> Your bulb supplier <p> The wire connections inside your bulb holder <p> If the spring loaded connectors are working properly inside the bulb holder <p> As a last resort you can also check the tightness of the connections in your switch . <p> As mentioned above , make sure you have turned the power off before you do any maintenance whatever . Read our projects on electrical safety and Part P building Regulations . Be careful out there ! <p> This was also sent in by one of our users , N.J. Stainton <p> 99% of the time tungsten fillamented bulbs have their own fuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp fails , usually saving the main fuse . The reason stated , although possible , is not common . What usually occurs is at the point of the filament failing ( usually at switch on ) , an expanding arc occurs , melting back the filament as it goes .

They are sometimes called rockers , throws or dimmers , depending on how they operate , but still they just refer to the number of light switches on the plate . It is possible to get more , but it is very uncommon to have more that three in a domestic setting " this would be called a 3 gang switch . <p> If you have a dimmer switch they are described in the same way ; a 1 gang dimmer switch will have a single dimmer on the plate , and a 2 gang dimmer switch will have 2 dimmers and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 gang dimmer switch <p> 2 gang dimmer switch <p> A 1 gang switch will control a single lighting circuit , and with a 2 gang switch you can control two lighting circuits , and so on . However if you need two switches to control a single lighting circuit , such as in the case of at the head and foot of stairs so you can switch the lights on and off in both places , you need to understand a 2 ' way ' switch . <p> It is also possible to install or fit a variation on the theme by combining dimmer and " throw " switches on the same plate . You are then able to set the light to the required ambiance and turn it on and off . The ambiance setting is remembered by the switch but can be altered just like any other dimmer . <p> Combined dimmer and throw or rocker light switch <h> What does 1 way , 2 way and intermediate light switching mean ? <p> There are 3 basic types of switches that are used for domestic purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' 1 way ' this means it is just an on/off switch . This is the simplest type of switch that you can get . The single switch controls a single light ( or lighting circuit ) . <p> 2 Way Switches : A ' 2 way ' switch means there is another switch controlling the same light . These are often used on a stair case , large room with switches by each door . <p> Intermediate Switches : If you need to control the lights from three places , say you have 3 entrances to a large room and need a light switch next to each one , you will need an intermediate switch . The light(s) can be switched on and off from anyone of 3 places . <p> On the whole 2 or 3 gang switches will always be 2 way switches . If you are buying switches and do n't know exactly what you need then it is often a good idea to get a 2 way switch anyway .

These switches can be flush mounted into a metal box which is sunken into the plaster of the wall . Plastic boxes are placed into plasterboard , or stud , walls . In either case these boxes are called patress boxes .

See the right primer and undercoat for painting MDF and achieving a great finish . Learn how to avoid an uneven or blotchy finish on your MDF and discover how MDF is made . Use our tutorial to understand why MDF is a good fibreboard to use in the home and understand why it is very important to seal the timber before installation . <h> Medium Density Fibreboard <p> Painting MDF or Medium Density Fibreboard is not an easy job . The paint dries so quickly that it can dry in a very uneven and blotchy way . Special primers , such as the one below , are available for MDF and once applied the timber can then be painted with any ordinary paint . The MDF primer seals the timber effectively allowing other paints to dry in a uniform way . We recommend painting the timber with an undercoat , after the primer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density fibreboard <h> Priming MDF <p> The surface of MDF , despite it 's density , is very porous . The moisture from ordinary paints is soaked into the MDF very quickly . This leaves a skin of paint on the surface which , because all moisture has been removed , does not adhere well to the surface . This means that every subsequent layer of paint applied to the MDF is only stuck to the layer ( or coat ) of paint below it , not to the MDF itself . <p> This is the reason that , if MDF is not prepared properly , the paint sometimes blisters up resulting in large bubbles on the surface as air ( or water ) is allowed under the first coat of paint . See the special MDF primers below to avoid this happening to you . <h> Sanding MDF <p> Once the MDF has had one coat of primer it is a good idea to put on your mask and give the surface a very light sanding down . Then brush , or hoover off the dust and wipe down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white spirit . This degreases the whole surface allowing the second coat of primer to be applied uniformly and form a great , sealed base for your undercoats and top coats . Remember , any painting is only as good as the preparation that has gone into it . <p> NOTE : When sanding , whether it 's sanding primer , or the MDF itself and also cutting it , as we state above , always wear a suitable , decent mask ! The dust produced by MDF is very bad for you if breathed in so protect yourself ! <h> Painting Both Sides of an MDF Sheet <p> Because MDF is so porous it is always a good idea to at least prime the underside of the timber before you install it . Water can run from the painted surface , over the edge of the MDF and soak into the unpainted edge . <h> Finishing the Edges of MDF <p> The edges of a sheet of MDF are even more porous than the surface of the sheet and over the years there have been many different techniques tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which matches the surface finish . <p> The best method found by DIY Doctor is to apply an ultra-thin layer of wood filler to the edges , pressed well in with a putty knife or scraper , then sanded down using a sanding block . This prohibits the over-absorption of primer and paint . <h> Using a Sanding Block <p> Many people do not put sandpaper onto a sanding block , tradesmen are the worst offenders and we hold our hands up to this . The fact of the matter is that sanding ( usually ) is to try and get surfaces as flat as they can be so sanding with a a flat surface ( IE a sanding block ) is really a no brainer ..... A human hand , however you contort it , is not flat and the surface you are sanding will never be 100% flat if you use your hand . This applies especially to MDF as the pulp itself is so soft . <h> Which Primer is Best for MDF ? <p> The two primers below are ideal for MDF and both are stocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seal <p> Rustin 's White Undercoat <p> MDF is a man-made product constructed from organic wood products which have been broken down into fibres through being pulped and crushed . <h> Safety Issues With MDF <p> The resins used to bind MDF often contain Formaldehyde and other compounds which are quite hazardous to health . These compounds can escape into the air when the MDF is being sawn and can even escape from the edges of the timber in it 's free standing , sheet state . <p> Priming the MDF properly is very important for , as well as sealing it ready for painting , it prevents the compounds being released . It is always a good idea to wear a mask when working with MDF , even if not actually sawing it . <h> Using all of the Tree for MDF <p> Firstly the trees ( both hardwood and softwoods ) are cut down and de-barked . They are then fed into an industrial chipping machine which is the start of the reduction process . None of the timber is wasted as the bark is used for landscaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood logs . <p> The chips are then fed into a screw feeder machine which heats them for 30 seconds to 2 minutes and then they are fed into a machine called a defibrator which grinds the timber down into a pulp while introducing very hot steam to further soften the timber . This entire process is done at a very high pressure . <p> The pulp is then mixed with wax to allow the very light , very fine fibres to obtain a degree of resistance to moisture . A resin agent is also added to allow the fibres to bond and set together after the timber pulp is fed into giant trays of varying thicknesses and pressed under a very high heat which initiates the resin-bonding process . The resulting sheet is then cut into the required thicknesses and sizes . <p> MDF then becomes a very uniform wood . Uniform in size and quality with no knots or rings . It is difficult to get a good fixing into the edges of MDF sheets but special coarse threaded screws are available for this . <h> Benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it works perfectly as a surface for : <p> Veneers - Because MDF is so completely flat with the ability to absorb adhesives , the MDF surface is good for attaching timber , or plastic veneers to <p> MDF is usually less expensive than the timber it is made from on a comparable area price <p> There is no grain . This makes MDF an isotropic timber which gives it consistency in every direction <p> MDF can be curved easily without splitting or cracking in it 's thinner sheet sizes . This makes it ideal for hobby or intricate work <p> Unless it is subjected to a lot of water , MDF will not expand and contract , as timber does , due to the natural moisture content of a normal room at home <p> Having been primed suitably with one of the primers listed above , MDF is very easy to paint as there is no grain or varying surface texture <h> Drawbacks to Using MDF <p> There are some drawbacks to using MDF , namely it swells with water and will not return to it 's usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting correctly to seal the sheet . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Learn how to erect a close board fence around your garden , including tips and tricks that will make it easier and last longer . Close board fencing is also known as feather edge fencing as the fencing boards are feathered . <p> Fencing is a great DIY task but will be a lot easier if there are two of you as you will have someone to help hold the other end ' . Before you start your fencing project , you will need to plan where the fence will be positioned . This will often require clearing a path through any vegetation ; any plants that you do n't want to trample should be dug up and potted , to be replanted once the fence has been built . ( Find out more about re-potting plants here ) . <p> The best time to work on fences is in the early spring and late autumn , when the ground is not frozen , but the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Close Board or Feather Edge Fencing ? <p> Close board fencing is fencing which is made up of posts and rails , with feather edge boards fixed vertically to the rails . Here is a little more information on the parts of a feather board or close board fence : <p> Posts : The fence posts are typically made of treated timber ( as we will describe in this project ) , however they can also be made of concrete which will be much harder wearing . The posts can either be concreted into the ground ( see here for how to concrete in fence posts ) , or they can be fixed with using metal supports , which are less sturdy , but much easier and quicker . We would prefer using concrete for a close board fence <p> Rails : These are the cross member that are fixed between the fence post that you will fix into the ground . These can be fixed directly on to the post or you can use an arris rail , which fits into a triangular notch in the fence post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you can cut these yourself . The arris rail will be triangular in cross section which means that it will fit into the notch and still leave a flat surface to fix the feather board on to <p> Gravel Boards : The gravel board is fixed at the base of the fence along the ground horizontally from post to post . They help to allow the fence line to follow and traverse a slope on uneven ground , as they fill any gaps and can be dug into teh ground also . They will need to be treated as they are the most at risk area for rotting . If using gravel boards you should try and leave a 150mm gap below the fence boards that the gravel board will cover . This will also mean that the fence boards are less likely to get damp <p> Fence Boards : For close board or feather board fencing , feather boards should be used . These are the boards that are secured vertically to the rails which provide the protection that the fence affords <p> Capping Strip : Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate slope if necessary ( see below for close board fencing on a slope ) , the exposed top or end grain should be treated with a wood preservative to make it last . Over the top of this and running the length of the top of the fence , you should fix a strip of wood called a capping strip to further protect the feather boards from the weather <p> Feathered edge board used for closeboard fencing <h> How to Erect Close Board Fencing <p> The posts should ideally be 4 x 4 inch treated timber , set into the ground in a hole 2 ft ( 600mm ) deep and concreted with a concrete mix as shown in our <p> concreting fence posts project . The picture at teh top of the page shows both the inside of the fence ( left ) and the outside ( right ) to demonstrate how the fence is assembled . <p> Fencing Etiquette <p> It is an accepted rule that the outside ( good side ) of the fence is shown to neighbours . We suggest that you discuss this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing much of the work ( fitting the feather boards ) so you may trample plants etc . <p> First the posts are concreted into the ground , then the gravel boards are fixed to the outside of the posts . Try and get the gravel boards as level as possible and if your garden slopes you may need to " step " the gravel board . <h> Close Board Fencing on a Slope <p> Stepping sometimes involves digging out the ground a little to set the board down into it ; another reason why all timber should be treated as if it is in contact with the ground constantly then it wo n't take long for it to start rotting . <p> Stepping of fence boards and gravel boards on a slope <p> Stepped close board fencing on a slope - Image courtesy of jury.co.nz <p> One of the features of using feather boards is that it is not necessary to step the fence if this is prefered , as you would have to with any panelled fence ( Find out more about fencing with fence panels here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slope of the ground , keeping the post and the feather boards vertical . If this is the approach that you have opted for you should fix the gravel board parallel to the ground also , rather than stepping it . <p> Closeboard fencing following a slope - Image courtesy of pridefencing.co.uk <h> Fixing the Fence Rails <p> Once the posts are secure , the rails need to be positioned . <p> The rails can be flush with the front of the posts , which will allow the feather edged timbers to sit on the gravel board and be fixed easily for the length of the fence . Some people like to set the gravel board and rails back so the feather edged timbers sit a little inside the posts - the choice is yours . <p> Fence supports in place and being fixed <p> The rails can be screwed into the posts through the sides and supporting brackets can be used to give extra strength . Three inch number 8 screws are usually needed for this . <p> Again all timber should be treated to ensure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the rails further . There are a wide range of designs , even ones that will support arris rails . They should be used whenever possible as they will provide considerable extra stability and strength . <p> Fence rail bracket to fix rail to the fence post <p> Close board fencing can also be done using proprietary concrete posts . These posts have slots in them in which the rails can be easily inserted into . <p> Notches in concrete fence posts for inserting rails into <p> Closeboard fencing installed using concrete posts <h> Fixing Feather Board to the Rails <p> The first feather edge board can then be fixed on the outside of your fence . Use a spirit level to make sure this is absolutely upright . They should be approximately 25 mm higher than the fense posts . <p> Nailing positions for feather boards on support rail <p> Each subsequent board can then be fixed to the one below it as shown above and to get the spacing right a small block can be used to ensure an even overlap . The overlap should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails or 50mm ovals . <p> Wooden block used as spacer <p> As you get towards the last post ( between 6 to 10 boards distance ) measure the distance and then adjust the spacing so that you finish at the outside edge of the post . This will mean that you have a nice neat finish . <h> Options for attaching Feather Boards to Fence Rails <p> There is a school of thought that the nails that are used with fencing projects should be galvanised and round and should only go through the one board and not the thin edge of the previous board as we have shown . <p> Using galvanised nails is certainly the right way to go as they are much more resistant to corrosion so will last longer . The main reason for not nailing through the thinner section of the board is that it is likely to split . If using these nails then you should drill pilot holes to prevent this , particularly if they are used to fix the thin edge of the board as we have shown . <p> Closeboard fencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they do not rust but they leave the head of the nail proud of the timber and unless they are all perfectly aligned , this looks horrible , especially in sunshine . In reality , it takes 7 years for a lost head or oval nail to rust and routine maintenance will identify any weak points during and at that time . <p> In light of this , if you are a proactive DIY enthusiast you will save time and get a neater looking job not using galvanised nails . The trade off is that you will have to do more maintenance to the fence over the years , but if you are prepared for this it is no hardship . <p> Also because galvanised roundheads have a larger ( circular in section ) diameter shank than lost heads or ovals they have a tendency to split the timber . <p> Given that lost head or oval nails have a lesser diameter and are generally sharper , they are able to pierce both the thicker section of the feather edge , and the thinner edge of the board behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixing ) to each lap stops the timber " curling " as it dries out . Curled timber creates wind and drag which can very quickly wreck a fence . <p> Damaged or curled feather boarding on a close board fence can result in further wind damage <p> There are no rules really and so long as you understand the trade off between the two approaches you can make the decision about which way you prefer to fix your feather boards to make your ideal close board fence . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

You will also learn about the revolutionary Perfect Fit blinds that require no drilling or screwing and can be installed in minutes . We also tell you how to fit conservatory blinds when you need to fix to a solid surface and also all about fixing conservatory blinds to UPVC shells . <p> Fixing conservatory blinds , or fixing blinds to PVCu or plastic windows is a hugely popular topic on DIY Doctor . We have answered the question so many times on how to fix the brackets for window blinds to double glazed window that it really is time to produce a project containing the answer . <p> Venetian blinds installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add blinds to your conservatory there are really two different routes you can go down : <p> Installed by a specialist : Normally this will start with you contacting a specialist blind fitting company . They will then send out one of their reps to discuss colours , styles and measure up . Once this has been done they will either manufacture the blinds for you or create some to the correct sizes . A member of their installation team is then dispatched on an agreed date to fit them . This may be the ideal choice for some but it costs ! <p> DIY with a kit aka Self Measure and Install : This is the ideal choice for the avid DIY'er . You will measure up the sizes of the blinds you require , purchase the blinds themselves and cut them to size if needed . Once prepared you will then install them yourself . Most DIY kits will come with all the fittings required and if you take your time you can get as good a finish as any professional <p> For the purposes of this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to manufacturer installed conservatory blinds and those installed by a specialist blind fitter they will have their own installation methods . <h> Am I Allowed to Drill into my PVC Window Frames ? <p> This is also quite a common question we get asked . Some window installation and conservatory construction companies will issue you with a guarantee for your windows or conservatory once fitting or construction is completed . <p> The answer to this question will very much depend on who constructed your conservatory , the terms listed in your contract ( if you have one ) , the guarantees that you have and if they are a member of FENSA ( Fenestration Self-Assessment scheme set up by the Glass and Glazing Federation and backed by the government ) . <p> On the whole this is quite a " shady " area and due to the levels of competition in the replacement window market on the whole , some companies have been known to offer guarantees and warranties that , shall we say , are rather unrealistic just to get the sales in . <p> Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years as a warranty ? We certainly ca n't ! When thinking along these lines it all starts to sound a bit unrealistic . <p> If you read through the small print of your contract you will probably find that the item with the longest cover-term are the pvc shells themselves and the terms will probably only cover discolouration or manufacturing defects . <p> In light of this you can imagine that in the event of a claim your pvc units will be examined in fine detail and if it is found that they have been drilled this may be used as an ideal excuse to wiggle out of any payments . <p> Another fact is that due to the competition in this market and the money involved , the chances are that a given window or conservatory company wo n't even be around in 10 years time to honour any warranties ! <p> This is not to say that you are not allowed point-blank to fix to your shell units . Just contact the company that fitted your windows or built your conservatory and even any insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to clarify whether you can . Then get this in writing from all parties involved ! <p> Further help and advice , if you need it , can be obtained by contacting FENSA . Visit their website on the above link . <p> The ideal alternative to drilling your shell units is to use Perfect Fit blinds , more about this is mentioned later in this project . <h> How to Measure Conservatory Windows for Blinds <p> The next potential problem is measuring for your blinds . As we have mentioned , if an engineer or fitter comes out to your home it costs money . <p> Regardless of any " Free Measuring " offers , this engineer has to be paid for and his or her wages are built into the cost of your blinds . <p> If you are going for " made to measure " blinds and you are supplying the measurements then make sure they are accurate . Any errors in dimensions you supply to the manufacture will be down to you . Check with your supplier exactly what you need to measure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each window or dorr pane or indeed wall you want each blind to cover . When viewing the images below , the inside recess area will be taken from the edges of each bead across the width and height ( or drop ) . <p> In most cases the outside recess will cover a " wall " or pvc shell unit containing 3 or maybe 4 panes of glass . <p> If you want the blind to cover just the window pane or glass itself , measure the inside recess in 3 positions - top , middle and bottom for the height ( or drop as it 's known ) and the left , middle and right on the width . This is wall to wall , or bead to bead ( if dealing with single panes ) - write down the dimensions on a piece of paper and take the smallest measurement for both width and drop as the ones to use . <p> Measuring the inside recess for individual PVCU units with a surrounding wall <p> If you want the blind to cover the entire window or door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside recess measurements with around 12 - 14cms added to each dimension as this will give you 6 - 7cms either side of the blind . Again , measure in 3 positions across both width and height ( drop ) - write down the dimensions on a piece of paper . <p> Measuring the outside recess for individual PVCU units with a surrounding wall <p> Depending on how your conservatory has been constructed you may find that each unit is butted up to each other with no wall space in-between , this is pretty much how most conservatories are constructed , by fixing UPVC units together . <p> Some conservatories are constructed from brick and block and in this case you will probably have a traditional recess area . <p> When dealing with just UPVC units the recess area is basically the surrounding shell outside of the glass area and , as mentioned , the inside recess is just the glass area measured from bead to bead . <p> Measuring inside and outside recess where PVCU units are butted together with no surrounding wall space <p> If you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width of the roller mechanism and the brackets which will be 38 - 40mm wider than the actual material of the bind . This is not necessarily too important when mounting outside the recess but certainly comes into play when mounting inside a recess . <h> Types of Conservatory Blinds <p> There are quite a few different types and styles of conservatory blind available and their fixing and installation can vary slightly depending on manufacturer but in essence the principles of installation are pretty similar when it comes to DIY kits . <p> There are also numerous different types of conservatory ranging from the Lean-To type to Elizabethan and Victorian styles and each manufacturer may also have a slightly different take on each style but in essence a conservatory is a conservatory and they are all constructed from similar materials and erected in the same manner . <p> To these ends , most conservatory blinds are based on size and the area of glass they need to cover . Some will span an entire " wall area " whereas the more modern types are made to cover individual panes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which panes are covered and which are n't . In respect to this pretty much all styles and types of blind are universal and can be installed in pretty much any conservatory . <p> It 's also a good point to note that blinds are also available for the roof windows and not just the walls ! <p> The main styles of conservatory blind can be summarised as follows : <p> Venetian Conservatory Blinds <p> There are several types materials used in the construction of these sorts of blind , typical aluminium , wood and pvc . <p> Due to the nature of a conservatory it is subject to vast changes in temperature and pvc and wood are not suitable . Pvc are often prone to melting whereas wooden blinds simply can not cope with the rapid temperature changes . In respect to this , aluminium is the way to go . <p> Overall they are a great choice , they can provide good levels of privacy even when open and still allow a decent view outwards , they are able to create a great light balance , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat retention . They are also very reasonably priced . <p> Venetian conservatory blind <p> Vertical Conservatory Blinds <p> A very common choice when it comes to conservatory blinds ! They offer a great range of lighting options due to the numerous combinations of draw strings and controls that also provide great levels of privacy . <p> One drawback is that because of their material construction , they are quite prone to fading over time due to sun exposure but a plus here is that you can purchase replacement verticals very cheaply ! <p> Vertical conservatory blind <p> Roller Conservatory Blinds <p> These are also quite a popular choice . They can be installed in several different ways , either one blind spanning a wall or several windows or one blind per pane section with the latter option giving you much more control over light . <p> They are also quite light in weight so they wo n't put too much strain on the fixings or on the pvc itself . <p> The one major drawback is , similar to the above , they will be prone to fading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down or even retracted during summer months , they will fade unevenly and look quite unsightly . Additionally they also attract insects and if you have ever rolled up a fly in a roller blind you will be well aware of the mess they make ! <p> Roller conservatory blind <p> Roman Conservatory Blinds <p> These blinds tend to be quite expensive , especially when they are made to your specific measurements . However , it is possible for you to buy the " header " section that includes the controls so that you can make your own . <p> Again as with the other choices there are drawbacks - When retracted they still have quite a presence over a pane of glass so vision is restricted somewhat and due to this they will be prone to fading over large areas . <p> If purchased with a blackout lining they will also be very heavy , putting a lot of strain on fixings and also the areas of the pvc frame they are screwed into . <p> Roman conservatory blind <p> Perfect Fit Conservatory Blinds <p> At DIY Doctor we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that make DIY and home improvement fun and enjoyable and when we came across the Perfect Fit blind we were very impressed . <p> This is possibly the best way we have seen of fitting blinds to plastic frames without the need for the traditional drilling or screwing of the frames themselves avoiding all the hassle of trying to confirm if drilling the frames will invalidate the affore mentioned guarantees etc .... <p> No drilling and no screws <p> Availabel in a great range of styles and colours , there is pretty much a Perfect Fit blind that will suit all situations and styles . <p> Fitting the blind when it arrives is literally done in minutes . Using an ordinary credit card as a measure you simply slide special brackets ( usually 4 ) into the existing window beads . <p> Your new blind clips straight in and its done . No drilling , no screwing , no sticking it really is that easy . <p> With their Perfect Fit system there are no gaps down the side of the blinds .

This product is the answer . <h> How to Fit Conservatory Blinds <p> Fitting methods may vary depending on the manufacturer of your chosen blind , how your conservatory has been constructed , the type of blind you have chosen and what brackets are supplied with your kit but regardless of this the fitting principles are pretty similar across the board . <p> The one major point to ensure when you are fitting conservatory blinds and any type of blind for that matter is to ensure that it is fixed straight so that the drop of the blind is totally level . <p> You will also need to decide whether you are going to face fix ( fixed to window frame ) or top fix ( fixed to lintel ) the brackets . This may be dictated to you by the type of blind you have or who manufactured it . Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best fixing method and also how to assemble your blind . <p> Fixing Conservatory Blinds to a Solid Surface <p> If you are top fixing to an inside recess or indeed fixing to an outside recess close to edge of the opening you may need to drill into a lintel . These are very tough to drill so ensure you have a decent drill and some sharp drill bits . <p> The idea of drilling into your UPVC frames might sound terrifying but if you take care in doing so there 's nothing to worry about . <p> The main thing to avoid is the glass itself as if you can imagine . Drilling into this would be a nightmare as it most cases it will crack requiring the entire pane to be replaced , an expensive mistake ! <p> Generally , the glass itself only extends into the frame just past the outside edge of the bead ( the black plastic strip running round the outside of the glass ) . The beading effectively holds the glass in the frame and allows for ease of removing panes if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross section of a upvc unit . Although this is an opening unit ( you will be fixing to a fixed unit ) their makeup will be similar . <p> You can see in the image above that we have indicated the location to drill and fix into . By fixing here you will not only be securing your blind through three sections of the unit but also into the metal reinforcing section in the centre of the unit . <p> With the correct position established for your first bracket , position it on the frame and mark the top fixing hole on the frame with a pen or pencil . <p> Using a 3mm drill bit , drill directly into the mark you have created on the frame . Do n't push the drill , let the drill itself do the work . Forcing the bit through may cause the frame to crack . <p> Drilling into a UPVC window unit <p> Now , work through each of the following steps : <p> Position the bracket back over the hole and insert a screw and screw it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to level up the bracket and ensure that it is dead straight and mark the bottom fixing hole <p> Remove the bracket , drill the second hole and then put the bracket back , inserting and screwing up both screws <p> A few things to remember - when top fixing : <p> Ensure that the blind will drop far enough away from the window to avoid catching on any handles or catches <p> Ensure that you use the correct sized screws for the hole you have drilled . Trying to force screws that are too big into a drilled hole could cause the frame to crack or split <p> Now for the bracket on the opposing side : <p> Using a spirit level , place this on top of the bracket you have just fixed and using the second bracket , position this under the level on the other side , wiggling it around until it 's level and in the correct position for drilling and screwing . Mark the top hole on the frame with a pencil or pen . <p> Remove the level and bracket and as above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and screw in a screw . Mark the below hole , move the bracket out the way , drill the second hole and position the bracket back , inserting and screwing up both screws . <p> The final task is to clip your blind in place and open and close it , using all the available controls to check that it operates correctly . If you have more blinds to fit , follow the above steps until all are in place at which point your job is done ! 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Cutting and sawing timber takes a little practice especially if you want a straight cut . Straight cuts are essential if you want to make square joints with timber . This project will help you understand the key parts of the saw and which hand saw you should use for which particular task as well as some simply tips to ensure that you can cut your wood straight . <p> Sounds so simple does n't it , but like all building work it takes practice and a little know-how to get a straight line when you are using a handsaw . <h> The Parts of a Handsaw <p> It is not vital to know the parts of a handsaw to use one , but it will help if you do understand the various parts so we can explain more easily how you should use your hand saw . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main part of a Handsaw that we will refer to in this ( and other projects on the DIY Doctor website ) : <p> Toe : This is the end of the saw blade furthest from the handle <p> Heel : This is the part of the saw blade or sawplate that is nearest the handle and is typically the widest part <p> Handle : This is the part that you hold when using the saw . Traditionally it was made from wood , but now it can be made from a wide range of materials . The saw blade slots into it and is generally held with screws known as the saw nuts <p> Blade or Saw Plate : This is part of the saw that does the cutting and will vary in size and shape depending on the type of saw and its role . Most commonly it is made from steel , although some saws will be made from special alloys . They will have the teeth on the cutting edge of the blade <p> Back : This it the top of the saw plate on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reinforcing on the back of the saw to keep the saw blade straight , others where the blade has to pass through the cut the saw makes ( or Kerf ) will not have any strengthening <p> Teeth or Toothline : The toothline is the edge of the saw blade that does the cutting . It has teeth positioned along this edge of the saw and the number of teeth is determined by the TPI or teeth per Inch . The lower the number the rougher the cut ; a TPI between 6-10 would be for a rip saw and a TPI above 14 would be for cutting across the grain of the wood . In between 10-14 TPI would be a universal saw which could be used for both cuts . ( See below for an explanation of rip and cross cuts saws ) <p> Pinch : The teeth of a saw were traditionally offset from each other along the toothline , one being offset to the left and one to the right and this offset is called the pinch . This was so that they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened or tempered steel which means that they will stay sharper for longer but can not be sharpened manually <p> Gullets : The space between the teeth is the known as the Gullet . This is important because the size of the gullet will determine the speed that the saw will cut through the wood . The larger the gullet the larger the piece of wood that will cut away with each saw stroke and therefore the faster the saw will cut through the wood <p> Kerf : The width of the blade is often described as the Kerf . It is also used to describe the width of the cut that is made through the wood , but purists might point out that it is actually the wood that is cut out of the timber as the saw cuts through it . Either way people will know what you mean <h> How to get a Straight Cut with a Handsaw <p> Look at the teeth on a saw . They are " set " at an angle to each other . This allows the saw to cut easily through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get through without sticking . This only works if the saw is going in a straight line . If the cut you are making veers from the straight in any way , by even a few mm , the saw will stick . <p> There are two very basic faults which turn a relatively simple job into a nightmare . People do not secure the timber they are cutting and do not get right over the top of the cut . <p> Secondly , get right over your work . Ideally you should have an eye either side of the saw blade . This should ensure that your cut is at 90 degrees to the timber . If you are over to one side of the work , your saw will be at an angle . <p> Secondly , get right over your work . Ideally you should have an eye either side of the saw blade . This should ensure that your cut is at 90 degrees to the timber .

A slip with a hand saw can cause a little cut in a piece of work which , most of the time , can be sanded out . A slip with a circular saw is a huge cut half way across a door ! If you want to use a circular saw safely see our project on how to use a circular saw . <h> Pull Cut and Push Cut Saws <p> Handsaws are either considered pull or push cuts . This refers to the direction in which the saw is moving when the cutting takes place . The cutting action for a pull cut occurs when the saw in being pulled back towards you , and a push cut saw cuts on the push stroke . There are some saws that cut on both strokes , but these are not very commonly used . <p> The choice is typically determined by the type of saw and how these are traditionally made . Generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pull cut . Saws with thin and often delicate blades such as coping saws tend to have a pull cut action as this keeps the blade under tension while cutting and therefore allowing a straight cut with more control . <p> There is a fair amount of disagreement about which is best and for what job even among the pros . The cut action will have a bearing on the power that can be put into the cut , the accuracy that can be achieved and the thickness of the cut ( or kerf ) . A pull is typically thought to be a finer cut but less powerful . <h> Type of Handsaws <p> There are quite a range of handsaws that are all designed for different jobs . There is some cross over but if you understand what type of handsaw is designed for what project and why , you will be better able to decide if you are using the right saw or you need to go and get the right one . <p> Cross Cut versus Rip Cut Saws <p> One of the main differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut saws . A cross cut saw is designed to cut across the grain of the wood and a rip cut saw is used for cutting with the grain , which is typically a harder cut to make . A rip cut saw will have a lower TPI ( teeth per inch ) , generally less than 10 TPI where as the cross cut saw will have a TPI of over 14 TPI . <p> Universal or Jack Saw : This is the ' jack of all trades ' and can be used for most timber cutting work . This type of saw can be used as a cross cut or rip cut saw and are generally push cut , although we have come across some that have been designed to cut on both strokes . Take care to choose the right TPI ( teeth per inch ) for the work that you are planning as they come in a wide range although most will be able in the range between 10-14 TPI which can be used for both types of cut . Some can be coated ( like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber as the coating prevents the saw blade becoming rusty . <p> Coping and Fret Saws : A coping saw is a fine saw that is used for cutting around curves and unusual shapes . A fret is a similar saw that is used for even finer work and modern workshops if often powered , where is can be referred to as a scroll saw . <p> These saws are also commonly used with a Mitre block for cutting timber on angles . They tend to have very fine teeth and can be bought with either cross cut or rip cut teeth depending on the type of work that you are going to do . <p> The tenon saw is the most commonly known back saw but there are others such as the dovetail saw with is for even finer work . Here is a breakdown of the most common types of back saw from " Hand-Saw Makers of North America " by Eric Schaffer : <p> Type <p> Length <p> Blade Thickness <p> TPI <p> Tenon <p> 16 - 20 <p> 0.032 <p> 10 <p> Sash <p> 14 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 <p> 0.025 <p> 12 <p> Dovetail <p> 6 - 10 <p> 0.022 <p> 14-18 <p> Veneer Saw : This is a small double edged saw which is used for cutting thin wood veneers . It is designed to allow really fine work and has an offset handle so that you can cut flush with the surface of the wood . They will have fine teeth although the blade might not have a thin blade like some of the similar fine saws like a pull saw . They can be referred to as a flush cut saw . <p> Japanese or Pull Saw : When people refer to a Pull Saw they often mean a Japanese Saw , although a Japanese Saw tends to refer to saws with finer teeth , a more flexible blade and a handle that is inline with the blade ( see the picture below ) . A pull saw can mean any saw that cuts on a pull stroke , but often it refers to a fine toothed saw with a fairly flexible blade in the Japanese style as these are best suited to projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fine , detailed work due to the extra control you have over the blade and therefore the cut . <p> Mitre Saws : This is not so much a saw as a system of cutting timber at a precise angle . A range of saws can be used ; a tenon saw is one of the more common . The mitre block is used to guide the saw at the right angle so that the timber will join where it needs to at the right angle after the cut . <p> Compass Saw : A compass saw is a saw with a long thin blade which can be used for cutting curves . A very common use is for cutting holes when installing cabling or pipes . They are great for working in a confined space and cutting awkward shapes . This very versatile little saw is good for cutting a variety of other materials other than just timber . <p> There are a wide range of saws for a wide variety of types of timber cutting jobs . There are even more saws available when you are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! From this project you should have learnt how to cut timber in a straight cut with a handsaw , and you will have a good idea about which type of saw that you need to do the project you are about to tackle . Working with wood is very rewarding and it is much more so if you are using the right saw for the type of cut you 're trying to achieve . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Do n't worry many concrete floors and floor screeds are not 100% level , and there is a solution . <p> Laying a concrete floor slab or floor screed over a fairly large area lends itself to a little inaccuracy simply because of the difficulty in moving and laying an extremely wet and heavy material like concrete . <h> When to Use Self Levelling Compound <p> Using Self levelling compound to get a concrete floor slab level depends on how much it is out of level in the first place . It can only be used if the floor is out of level by 5mm or less . This can be checked in the following way . <p> Drop a marble or golf ball in many places on the floor and see which way it rolls to get a picture of where the floor is at its lowest <p> Use a long spirit level to measure exactly how much out of level it is .

The first is a powder which comes with a latex liquid in a separate container . To prepare it for use the two are mixed together to form the compound . This is the type we sell in our store . <p> The second type of compound is a bag of powder , with the latex compound already included . This just needs to be mixed with water to use . <p> This second type is so much easier for a DIY'er to mix and work with . It can also be used to level floors which are more than 5mm out of level ( up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix . This stiffens the mix up a little and allows it to be used in greater thicknesses . <h> What is Self levelling floor Screed ? <p> A self levelling floor screeding compound usually contains latex because the compound is laid in a very thin layer and the latex gives it the flexibility it needs to move without cracking . <p> Once it is prepared , mixed and poured it will flatten out across the uneven floor and " self-level " due to gravity ( with a little help " see below ) . <p> There are a number of types of compound but they all usually require mixing in a bucket using a mixing paddle . This involves attaching a special paddle to an electric drill and mixing it thoroughly to make sure the components are evenly distributed through the mixture .

At this stage , mix only enough quantity to make the required number of screed lines as shown below . You can work out the volume using the length of the number of lines you need , their width ( 2 inches ) and the depth <p> Next , start forming your screed lines . These will need to be about 1 meter apart ( or proportionately spaced accoring to the size of the room - basically you should have an even number of lines across the space of the room ) , start at one side of the room and work towards the opposite side ( as can be seen in the image below ) . You can mark out where your screed lines are going to go on the floor using a pencil <p> Once the screed mixture is prepared , spread some of the flooring compound out into a strip about 2 inches wide as you can see from the image below .

Again , check along the length of the line to make sure it is level and also against any adjacent lines <p> Getting a dead flat level down the length of a line and across other lines is a tricky task so take your time and get it right . The level of your screed lines will ultimately determine the overall level of the floor <p> Also remember , if you add more mixture to one line then this may make other lines out of level <p> Once all your screed lines are down and level , trim off the sides of each line to get a nice , crisp edge ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry for about an hour until they are firm enough to push down on lightly without causing a depression <p> With your lines set it 's now time to start filling the spaces between the lines .

Again check levels as you go <p> One important fact to note is make sure that you work around your room towards the door .

The above Flexiplus compound will set in 90 minutes but it will need to be left for at least 8 hours before anything can be laid on top .

If you do n't have mains gas , oil is a great alternative fuel . Oil boilers are just as efficient as gas and in some cases even more so . In this project you will find out about the efficiency of oil fired central heating systems , oil fired boilers , what oil is used in these types of system , who can fit and install and oil fired central heating system and what tanks should be used to store your heating oil . <p> The majority of UK households utilise mains gas for heating and hot water purposes but there are ( around 4 million ) numerous homes that run oil fired central heating systems . <p> This can be down to several reasons but the most common is that the mains gas network is not close enough to connect to . <p> This herein defines the main difference between gas and oil fired systems - gas is delivered to a property via mains gas lines on demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored on site at the property in a storage tank . <p> Using oil in a heating system can sometimes be referred to as a " wet " system . <h> How Efficient is Oil Fired Central Heating ? <p> Is Oil Fired Central Heating energy efficient ?

Without correct drainage unwanted water or waste can sit and buildup and cause numerous probelms . In light of this , if at any point during this project guide you require additional help and advice give Property Repair Systems a call on 01626 336180 . They are experts in all matters of drainage , damp and damage repair an will be able to advise you further . <h> What Is A French Drain ? <p> A French drain is simply a small trench , dug to a gradient , and filled with aggregate , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a building , driveway , garden or area that is prone to surface water pooling , or is vulnerable to flash flooding . <p> French Drain detail showing a cross section showing the graded stones <h> How To Drain Surface Water <p> A French drain is ideal for carrying away surface water which builds up around walls , on driveways or in waterlogged areas of a lawn or garden . It is a relatively simple and cost effective way of draining land , and it does not require specialist tools or complicated equipment . <p> The main considerations are : where to dig the trench ; and where to drain the excess water to . <h> How To Make A French Drain <p> After digging the French drain trench to the required width and size it is filled with graded stones from fine shingle on the top to large rubble on the bottom . This aids the flow of water and filters out debris . <p> French Drain detail showing a cross section showing the graded stones and a perforated drainage pipe <p> You can also install a perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perforated pipe allows small amounts of water to soak into the ground , but carries larger quantities of water away more quickly to help with flash flooding . <h> French Drains How They Work <p> The drainage should be installed at a low point in the affected area to allow it to drain surface water away to storm drain , or a Soakaway . <p> Water will always find its way to the lowest point in the landscape , so it is common sense that the area most affected is the place you should build your French drain . <h> When Can I Use A French Drain ? <p> You can use a French Drain in most areas , however before you install a French drainage system you should check that all your other surface water drainage systems are working properly and are not blocked or broken . Make sure your rainwater pipes and gullies are freeflowing and are properly connected to a mains drain or Soakaway . <p> A French drain is not intended to replace existing surface water drains . However French drains are useful where water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the water to seep away into the ground rather than affecting the stone or brick of the building or walls they are protecting . <p> On entering the trench the water will have to run to a suitable drainoff point , and in most cases this is a soakaway or watercourse . If a wall has been continually soaked by water pooling against the building then a French drain will also allow the water to evaporate from the wall and dry it out , during drier periods . <p> The surface of this wall is damaged below the DPC , where standing water has pooled against this Wall <h> Installing A French Drain <p> The usual reason for installing drainage is to relieve a buildup of water against a house wall . Allowing water to pool against an external wall may manifest itself in the form of rising damp , decaying brickwork and crumbling mortar joints .

You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Technoseal ( pictured below ) . But you should apply this while the wall is dry , so after a warm dry spell of weather has dried out the masonry . <h> French Drain Cleaning And Maintenance <p> The life of your French drainage system may be temporary because of a tendency for the shingle and stone to get clogged up with earth . When you are including a perforated land drain pipe in the bottom you can make maintenance easier by using weed fabric from a garden centre , DIY store or builders ' merchants . A layer of this weed fabric may be inserted into and across the trench to ensure longer life by stopping the ' fines ' fine particles which come from the earth and stone , clogging the pipe and drain . <p> If you need any help with any type of French Drain , timber repair , maintenance or other damp problems Property Repair Systems will be pleased to give you completely free , no obligation advice on 01626 336180 . <p> Watch our tutorial video on building French drains 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Advice on all aspects of Load-Bearing Walls with span tables for floor joists and the associated building regulations on end support , materials joist sizing and specification . <p> We get many questions asking " how can I easily tell if a wall I want to knock down is load-bearing or not ? " <p> There is no easy answer . Houses are constructed in many different ways , most conform to building regulations , some do n't . Finding out if a wall is load bearing or not involves investigation , and some of this investigation involves pulling up floorboards throughout the length of the house . <p> Even builders have been caught out , on many occasions , by commonly held beliefs . <p> " It 's a timber stud wall covered in plasterboard , therefore it ca n't be load-bearing " ....... WRONG <p> " The joists are running parallel with the wall so it ca n't be load-bearing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it ca n't be load-bearing " ........ WRONG <p> Floor or Ceiling layout diagram <p> The diagram represents a first floor/ceiling . A and B on the diagram represent two rooms divided by the brown , timber stud and plasterboard ( in this instance ) wall . If , for example Mrs. Street wanted to remove the wall the first question would be " is it load-bearing ? " . <p> After taking measurements to the wall from a fixed point downstairs , she does the same upstairs and realises there is ( ignoring the dotted lines for a moment ) no wall directly above it . Therefore it is not carrying a direct load , which , being plasterboard , one would expect . While upstairs , she checks the direction that the floor boards are running . Floorboards are almost always laid at 90 degrees to the joists . The wall below must be running parallel with the joists meaning they can not be sitting on it . Having made these investigations in above room B , she decides on one last check to make sure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This final investigation prove that the joists run parallel to the wall and it can not be load bearing and work begins on a new opening through wall A. <p> Strongboys added to top of props to support load bearing wall <p> Load bearing wall supported and propped <h> Whoops ! <p> Wall A is constructed in plasterboard and timber . This would not be strong enough , under normal construction methods , to hold the floor above . But in the past it had been necessary to install a staircase to these rooms above . This meant cutting a hole in the joists and installing a " trimmer joist " ( 1 on the diagram ) . This trimmer had to be supported on something stronger than the plasterboard wall , so a support was introduced and hidden within the wall . If wall A were built in brick or blocks ( solid wall ) then joist 1 would have been built into it to support the floor . The wall would still be a supporting wall , albeit in only one place . This one point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . <p> This support is by no means just for this example . It is a common way of transferring a load from its old bearing to a new one . When the load of an area , such as the floor in question , is supported in one place , it is called a " point load " . This has caused more than enough refurbishment accidents ! Point loads are common in new buildings too where stud and plaster walls are being used more and more . <p> The only way to be absolutely sure whether a wall is load bearing or not is to investigate along its entire length . <p> In the diagram , if the brown wall was solid , ie brick or block , and it continued into the dotted line area , the wall would be bearing the weight of the load above . If the joists ran the other way and their ends rested on the wall , it would be a load bearing wall . <p> But what if the joists ran the other way and did not end on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor boards " to the far end of room B. How then could we tell because it may not be entirely obvious that they are sitting on the wall in question . <p> The building regulations are compiled with a series of approved documents . Approved document A covers loading , ground movement and disproportionate collapse . In appendix A there are a series of tables which are used to calculate the size of timbers necessary to give adequate support to floors , ceilings and roofs . Using these tables , It is possible to work out whether your joists are strong enough to support themselves and the load they carry , without the help of any walls underneath . <p> The timber floor of a property obviously weighs something . This weight consists of the timber joists , the plasterboard ceiling underneath it , the floorboards and even the nails or screws used to fix both of the aforementioned coverings . All of these are known as " the dead load " and the joists themselves must be able to support this dead load without sagging . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceilings , this dead load is generally taken by architects and planners to be no more than 0.50 Kilo Newtons per square metre . ( kN/sq.m ) <p> The weight we place upon a floor by way of bathroom suites , beds , wardrobes etc , is known as the " imposed load " . It is again accepted that , for normal household requirements , the imposed load will not exceed 1.5kN/sq.m . <p> The building regulations tables A1 and A2 , list the size of joist necessary to support this weight , over a maximum span . Table A2 uses timbers known as " SC4 " which are high strength timbers containing very few , if any , knots . These timbers if you have them in your property , will be stamped C24 by the timber yard that supplied them . They are not common in modern day construction unless specified and we will deal with the more generally used timbers , dealt with in table A1 . These timbers are known as SC3 and will have C16 stamped on them . <p> This table is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 0.50 and allows for an imposed loading of no more than 1.5 kN/sq.m . <p> This is an abridged representation of Building regulations Table A1 <p> Spacing ( distance apart ) of joists is stated in mm . <p> Size of joist <p> 400mm <p> 450mm <p> 600mm <p> 38 x 97mm <p> 1.72m <p> 1.56m <p> 1.21m <p> 38 x 122mm <p> 2.37m <p> 2.22m <p> 1.76m <p> 38 x 140mm <p> 2.72m <p> 2.59m <p> 2.17m <p> 38 x 147mm <p> 2.85m <p> 2.71m <p> 2.33m <p> 38 x 170mm <p> 3.28m <p> 3.1m <p> 2.69m <p> 38 x 184mm <p> 3.53m <p> 3.33m <p> 2.9m <p> 38 x 195mm <p> 3.72m <p> 3.52m <p> 3.06m <p> 38 x 220mm <p> 4.16m <p> 3.93m <p> 3.42m <p> 38 x 235mm <p> 4.43m <p> 4.18m <p> 3.64m <p> 47 x 97mm <p> 1.92m <p> 1.82m <p> 1.46m <p> 47 x 122mm <p> 2.55m <p> 2.45m <p> 2.09m <p> 47 x 147mm <p> 3.06m <p> 2.95m <p> 2.61m <p> 47 x 170mm <p> 3.53m <p> 3.4m <p> 2.99m <p> 47 x 195mm <p> 4.04m <p> 3.89m <p> 3.39m <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 x 97mm <p> 1.98m <p> 1.87m <p> 1.54m <p> 50 x 122mm <p> 2.6m <p> 2.5m <p> 2.19m <p> 50 x 147mm <p> 3.13m <p> 3.01m <p> 2.69m <p> 50 x 170mm <p> 3.61m <p> 3.47m <p> 3.08m <p> 50 x 195mm <p> 4.13m <p> 3.97m <p> 3.5m <p> 50 x 220mm <p> 4.64m <p> 4.47m <p> 3.91m <p> 63 x 97mm <p> 2.19m <p> 2.08m <p> 1.82m <p> 63 x 122mm <p> 2.81m <p> 2.7m <p> 2.45m <p> 63 x 147mm <p> 3.37m <p> 3.24m <p> 2.95m <p> 63 x 170mm <p> 3.89m <p> 3.74m <p> 3.4m <p> 63 x 195mm <p> 4.44m <p> 4.28m <p> 3.9m <p> 63 x 220mm <p> 4.91m <p> 4.77m <p> 4.37m <p> 75 x 122mm <p> 2.97m <p> 2.86m <p> 2.6m <p> 75 x 147mm <p> 3.56m <p> 3.43m <p> 3.13m <p> 75 x 170mm <p> 4.11m <p> 3.96m <p> 3.61m <p> 75 x 195mm <p> 4.68m <p> 4.52m <p> 4.13m <p> 75 x 220mm <p> 5.11m <p> 4.97m <p> 4.64m <p> It is now possible to measure the complete span of your floor joists , together with the distance between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to the table .

How to use your loft safely for storage and cover it into a secure and sound storage solution which you can access easily and safely . Learn how to convert a loft into storage space and board out a loft whilst improving the loft insulation too . There is also lots of help and advice when choosing loft ladders , staircases , loft lights , and roof windows for your loft conversion . <p> More and more people are looking to move up rather than out , however financial restraints can make it impossible for people to go for a full loft conversion . In these cases , the best way of making good use of your loft is to lay loft boards and use it for storage .

However , with the required thickness of insulation under the current building regulations being 270mm ( as of August 2013 ) , it is not possible to lay loft boarding down on top of the insulation without causing problems to both the integrity of the insulation and the fixing of the boards to the ceiling joists below . <p> Please remember that putting cases etc on top of insulation ( especially when laid at 90 degrees across joists ) is not a great idea . You can lift the floor to your loft with some simple timber studwork to give you a good platform for a few cases . <p> However if you want to fit a more sturdy system we can recommend a new invention called StoreFloor from LoftZone.co.uk which allows you to install a solid loft floor over increased insulation .

How to wire the cooker using a double pole switch and get your cooker connected safely . This project will apply to all kinds of electric cookers , even for connecting range cookers . <h> How Should an Electric Cooker be Installed ? <p> Installing or fitting an electric cooker must be done on its own circuit . An electric cooker can not be spurred of any other circuit and must be controlled by its own fuse at the consumer unit . <p> For this reason , if this is a new installation it counts as installing a new circuit and is forbidden by anyone other than a Part P qualified electrician . Please see our project on part P if you do not understand this . <p> Connecting a cooker cable to the mains is the last part of this project . If connecting a cooker - the appropriate fuse should be withdrawn . <h> What Type of Switch is Needed for a Cooker ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat they need to produce so a larger fuse is required as is thicker cable and a double pole isolating switch . <p> Usually , when a switch is installed , it interrupts the live wire of the circuit - the switch breaks the connection in the live wire . With a double pole switch the connection to the live and the neutral is broken so there is no fear of any residual current causing a shock when the switch is off . <h> Cooker Control Unit <p> The cooker must be connected to a cooker control unit , above . It must be connected via the correct size cable and this may vary but is directly related to the power of the cooker . See our table on cable sizes and check the rating of your cooker . <p> The cooker control unit fits to a patress box , just like a socket outlet or switch and may be flush or surface mounted .

The load cable then runs to the terminal outlet box ( or cooker outlet box ) which is simply a junction box in the wall where the cooker cable is connected to the mains cable you have just installed . <p> The terminal outlet box is covered with a plate which allows easy , but safe access for connection .

@@41624726 @1624726/ <p> The size of your boiler is dictated by the output you require . This is measured in terms of radiators and hot water cylinders . It has been common in the past to oversize boilers to make sure the boiler would heat your house adequately . One result of this is that most boilers installed pre 1989 are as much as 30% oversized . This is an incredible drain on finance as well as energy and these days boiler efficiency calculations are much more advanced . You can get some help by clicking through to our radiators project . <p> There are several types of gas boiler from which you can choose , so it 's important that you understand how they differ if you 're to make the right choice for your individual needs <p> It is also advisable that you find out what type of fuel is available in your local area if you do not already have heating installed or you are thinking of changing . <h> Types of Central Heating Systems <p> The Conventional Heating System : <p> Conventional Home Heating System <p> Requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storage Tank the other an Expansion / Feed tank , also requires a Hot Water Cylinder . The storage cylinder holds a large quantity of hot water that is available immediately ( or as soon as the feed allows ) . However when this store has been used up it has to be reheated , this could take anything up to 1 hour . This type of system is considered the least efficient as there are heat losses from the pipe work to and from the boiler to the cylinder and the cylinder itself . <p> System Boiler Heating Systems : <p> System Boiler Heating System <p> System boilers come in two types , a vented low pressure and an un-vented high pressure system . Both require a Hot Water cylinder . Vented system boilers require a storage tank but most of the other components are held in the unit itself which means that installation is quicker and cheaper . Also , the hot primary water is pumped through the system to the radiators and hot water cylinder resulting in a faster response and more economical running costs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed system including a pressure relief valve and a pressure gauge , removing the need for a feed and expansion tank . <p> Combi Boiler Heating Systems : <p> Combi Boiler Heating System <p> Combi 's are now the most used form of central heating boilers . Most Combi 's run on mains pressure water , thus do not require tanks to be placed in the loft . They also eliminate the need for a hot water cylinder as they instantly heat the water when it is needed . Another benefit with the combi is that , due to it running from the mains water supply , you can create an effective power shower without the need for a pump . <p> Whilst all new central heating boilers have to meet government-set minimum standards of operating efficiency ( SEDBUK Band D or above ) , like cars and household appliances such as washing machines , some boilers operate more economically than others ... <p> Condensing boilers hence low emission levels and are very energy efficient . Old conventional boilers run between 60 - 70% efficiency , a modern standard combi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , condensing boilers recover and recycle most of this wasted heat energy and some can operate at up to 95 - 97% efficiency . <h> Types of fuel <p> Gas ( Gas Boilers and Condensing Boilers ) <p> Gas is the most used fuel for heating the home , it comes in two forms : <p> Natural Gas - This is piped to your home via a supply company . If you require natural gas and it has not been connected to your home yet then it can cost a lot of money to get connected . You can install a gas central heating system yourself but will need a Corgi registered installer to make the connection to the gas supply . Natural gas is very convenient and there are a good variety of heating systems that can be powered by gas , such as Combi 's , back boilers , wall heaters etc . Another benefit is that you will not run out of fuel for your heating . <p> LPG - This is an alternative to natural gas where it is too expensive or impractical to get natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange cylinders that stand about 4 feet tall , you usually require two of these cylinders to be fitted with a valve to switch between the two as there are no gauges on them to tell you how full they are . LPG works in exactly the same way as natural gas but you will need a boiler that can be made compatible via a conversion kit . <p> Oil Boilers <p> Oil fuels some of the most efficient boilers available , the choice of heating systems are fewer than with gas being restricted to just boilers . In most cases to run an oil boiler you will need a tank to be installed outside your house , these are usually large and very hard to disguise , you also have to conform to a variety of regulations in sighting it . Another thing with oil is that if you let it run out then you will need a heating engineer to re-prime the system before you can get it working again . <p> Solid Fuel Boilers <p> Solid fuel heating boilers are mostly limited to back boilers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the same way as other fuelled boilers and use automatically fed pellets from a hopper situated outside the house ( we do not supply these ) . Most solid fuel heating systems are inefficient as they consist of open fires ; they also can be messy and require cleaning out once a day at least . Solid fuel comes in a variety of forms , coal , wood , etc . <p> Electric Boilers <p> Until recently effective Electric central heating was limited to storage heaters or blown air systems . These were both run off cheap rate electricity supplied in the small hours , and in some cases for a short top up period in the afternoon . Though storage heaters ( the most popular ) are reasonably efficient they have a problem of being on all the time , so if you have a hot day after a cold day in the winter , you will have heating even though you do n't need it . They are also susceptible to drafts which can discharge them very quickly indeed . <p> A new form of electric powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boilers .

Whether you 've just removed an old carpet or you 're just refreshing an old paint-job , our guide below has everything you need to know . <p> Old stairs in disrepair <h> What Will I Need To Paint Stairs ? <p> We 'll start by assuming the stairs are plain wood , that any carpet or other covering has been removed . You 'll need to sand the stairs . If there is old paint or the surface is a bit rough , you 'll need an 80-grit sandpaper first of all , followed by a fine sandpaper to smooth it ready for painting . You 'll also need detergent for cleaning the wood down . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . An primer is advised " buy a wood primer and make sure it is suitable for the type of paint you are planning to use . When it comes to paint for stairs , floor paint is the most suitable " it is very hard-wearing , cleanable and resistant to stains . Floor paints are available in a variety of colours , make sure you choose one that is suitable for wood floors . <p> It 's worth investing in a good quality brush to use on your stairs " it will make painting the edges much easier and should n't leave as many brush marks . <h> Preparation For Painting Wooden Stairs <p> If you 've removed the carpet from your stairs , make sure there are no nails or staples left . You 're going to need a few days to complete this job between sanding , cleaning , and various coats of paint , so try to make sure the stairs will be used as little as possible during this time " especially while the paint is drying ! <p> Sand the stairs with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards smooth and level . A mouse sander will make this job easier and enable you to get into all the corners . Make sure you do the risers as well as the treads . Then go over it with the finer sandpaper , making the surface nice and smooth . <p> Sanding and cleaning stairs <p> Once you 've finished sanding , give the stairs a really good clean to remove any dust and grease . Use a cleaning detergent diluted with water , and rinse with clean water afterwards . Let the wood dry out completely after you 've washed it " this might take a day or two . <h> Painting Wooden Stairs <p> Paint the stairs with your primer first . This will give the floor paint something to adhere to and stop the paint from just soaking into the wood . Allow the primer to dry , then give it a quick sand with a fine sandpaper to smooth it down . Wipe off any dust , then start on your top coat . <p> Paint carefully trying to keep it smooth and make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tempted to slap on a really thick coat " the paint will last much longer if you paint multiple thin coats than one thick coat . <p> Check on the paint tin for drying times between coats , and once the last coat is on leave for 24 hours if possible before walking on the stairs " the longer you leave it to dry , the stronger the paint will be . <h> Painting Styles For Woolden Stairs <p> You might choose to paint your stairs plain white , or you might decide to go for a bold statement and choose a strong colour . You could paint the risers and treads different colours , or you could use masking tape to mark out a pattern . Using different colours for the centre and edges , to give the effect of a carpet runner , is a stylish pattern to use .

This is a good starting point before you start your research for your next set of garage doors . <p> There are four main types of materials used in the manufacture of garage doors " steel , aluminium , timber and glass reinforced polyester ( GRP or plastic ) , so there is a wide choice available to householders deciding on a new garage door . The means of opening and closing the doors can be either done manually or by remote control and the three styles of doors are canopy , retractable and roller . <p> Steel doors are light and easy to handle and are supplied ready-primed for the purchaser to apply the finishing coat colour of their choice . See our painting a metal garage door project to find out how to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is living accommodation above the garage for noise reasons . Timber garage doors were once the most popular choice of the door ( see our project on painting wooden garage doors ) but they have been replaced by GRP doors whose strength and resistance to both knocks and rot makes them extremely durable . <p> Canopy doors , or ' up and over ' doors , are overhead doors that only retract part of the way into the garage leaving a horizontal canopy of door projecting beyond the face of the garage entrance . The retractable door enters the garage for its full length without leaving a projecting canopy and it is generally regarded as being stronger and quieter to operate than a canopy door . Roller doors move on a track embedded in the garage floor with overhead guide rails and are opened and closed by electric remote control devices . <p> There is a wide variation of door sizes available and here are some of the more popular ones : <p> Steel doors : <p> width 1981 to 4267mm ( 6 feet 6 inches to 14 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches to 7 feet ) <p> ( available in both canopy and retractable styles ) <p> Aluminium doors : <p> width 1981 to 4267mm ( 6 feet 6 inches to 14 feet ) <p> height 1981 to 2134mm ( 6 feet 6 inches to 7 feet ) <p> ( available as roller doors ) <p> GRP doors : <p> width 2134 to 4267mm ( 7 feet to 14 feet ) <p> height 1981 to 2134mm ( 6 feet 6 inches to 7 feet ) <p> ( available in both canopy and retractable styles ) <p> The variation of standard widths within these ranges means that it is highly unlikely that it would be ever be necessary to require a purpose made door to be made " a good thing considering the extra cost that would be involved ! <p> There are two main types of automatic door openers .

Roller doors do n't require a frame because they move inside the garage on a floor track and overhead guide rails . <p> The cost of the doors listed above range between -400 and -2,000 including VAT and delivery . The standard size single garage doors can be fixed by a competent DIYer but the wider double garage size would probably need to be installed by professionals particularly if the electric opening system is being used . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Find out how to fit a shaving socket . Be sure where they are allowed to be fitted and understand the shaver socket regulations . See a wiring diagram how to wire your shaver socket when installing it . <p> There are two distinct types of shaver socket , one with a transformer to low voltage for use in bathrooms and the other without a transformer which may be placed in any other area of the home , typically a bedroom . Shaver sockets are available as separate units and are also available as part of a multi-functional unit , such as a light and also an illuminated mirror . <p> Shaver sockets without transformers should not be used in a wet area such as a shower room or bathroom . When choosing a shaver socket for a bathroom , look for the British Standard BS3535 . Both types of shaver socket should be connected through an FCU or Fused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amp . <p> Fused Connection Units can be switched , un-switched and another type incorporates the flex which is fed out from the face of the box . Usually FCUs will be mounted onto a junction box and they can also be added to a ring main or to a spur , as part of the ring main . The manufacturer 's installation instructions must be followed carefully , especially if the unit is required to be earthed . In certain situations , it is possible to add a shaver socket to the lighting circuit of the room ; however it is probably best to consult with a qualified electrician before attempting this , especially in a bathroom situation . <p> Using electrical equipment in bath or shower rooms has always needed great care to ensure safety . The IEE Wiring Regulations ( 16th Edition ) identified particular Zones within the bathroom to indicate what type of electrical equipment that can be installed , within each Zone .

Zone 2 also includes any recessed window with a sill next to the bath <p> Providing the Shaver socket is reduced to 110V it should go in zone 2 or preferably , zone 3 , never in zone 1 . There should be no 240V sockets in the bathroom at all . <p> Dual Voltage shaver sockets are also available and have the advantage that they can be used for 240 volt or 115 volt appliances .

So people should be very careful of those . In general , if it fits into a single pattress box it 's an old type ( and they do not provide any mains isolation ) . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Instructions on wiring a consumer unit to UK specifications for dual RCD and RCBO consumer units . Here is a detailed explanation of the consumer unit and how it should be installed in the UK . <p> All cables and connections to the consumer unit must be checked and tested by a qualified electrician . Do not attempt removal or replacement unless you are you are qualified to Part P regulation standards . It is also an offence to interfere with the seals on the electricity meter . <h> The Consumer Unit <p> The modern consumer unit is the centre , or heart , of the wiring system in the home . The unit distributes the electricity , via fuses of one kind or another , to the different circuits in the house . The older fuse wires are being replaced gradually by their modern equivalent , the MCB or miniature circuit breaker . <p> Consumer unit for installation with rcd 's <h> Different Types of Consumer Unit <p> We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home today . <p> Single Load Board <p> The first one is a single load fuse board where the power coming in is taken through a double pole switch to a live bus bar . Each fuse , or MCB , is clipped onto a DIN bar and the " teeth " of the bus bar are inserted into the MCB 's . The cables to the house circuits are connected to the other side of the MCB 's . All of this is explained more thoroughly when we deal with the second type of unit , which is the split load unit . The photographs are of a split load fuse board . The ordinary consumer unit is exactly the same in principle without the RCD . <p> Consumer Unit <p> Under the 17th edition regulations it is required that every socket is protected by an RCD . This can be done in 3 ways . <p> A consumer unit can use an RCD as the main switch . This will protect all circuits but if the RCD trips , so do all circuits . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has one main switch , two RCDs and each circuit has it 's own MCB . This allows the circuit to be divided into two , usually one upstairs , one down . This protects all areas including showers and cookers , but if one trips the other will ensure at least some lights and some sockets still work . <p> An RCBO consumer unit has one main switch but each circuit is protected by an RCBO which is a combination of an MCB and an RCD . This allows protection in full for all individual circuits and if one trips , all others will still work . As this option is expensive it is only usually used where space is tight for the enlargement of a consumer unit as has to happen when updating to a dual RCD unit . <p> Just as a matter of interest , DIN stands for Deutsche Industrie Norm and , originating in Germany , is any of a series of technical standards , used Internationally , to designate electrical connections , film speeds and paper sizes . Shown in the consumer unit casing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the MCB 's clip . They simply push on via a spring loaded lock at their back . <p> Split Load Board <p> A split load board is designed for total safety and incorporates an RCD ( Residual Current Device , shown as E in the picture above ) as well as the double pole switch ( D ) . The split board shown here has one RCD and is a simple version to show the user how the board works . <p> An RCD is a manually operated isolator switch , but it is also an automatic safety device that will trip and cut off as soon as it senses an earth fault . There are a number of different ratings for current and sensitivities to current leakage available , so you will need to understand which are the appropriate ratings for your home . RCD 's also work by detecting an imbalance between the Live and the Neutral conductors and this feature is a requirement for all Class 2 double insulated equipment . <p> As they are very sensitive , it is not practical to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault develops on one circuit , all circuits would be switched off immediately ... This would , most often , leave you in the unnecessary position of having no lights or power . Because of this it actually contravenes the most recent ( 16th Edition ) wiring regulations . This is easily prevented by using an RCD in conjunction with a main , double pole isolating switch so that it protects only some of the more vulnerable circuits . This then becomes a split load consumer unit and is shown above . The key to this photo is .. <p> A : Neutral terminal block for the main isolating switch side of the unit <p> B : Neutral terminal block for RCD side of the unit <p> C : Earth terminal block ( takes both sides of unit ) <p> D : Main double pole isolating switch <p> E : Generally 80 - 100 Amp RCD with 30mA ( milliamp ) sensitivity <p> F : Neutral link cable from Main switch to terminal block <p> G : Live feed from main switch to RCD <p> H : Neutral link cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link cable from RCD to RCD neutral terminal block <h> RCD 's <p> The use of RCDs is necessary , on two occasions , to meet the wiring regulations . The first of these is to protect any socket which may be reasonably expected to supply equipment outside the house ( Strimmers , lawn mowers , hedge trimmers , pond pumps , sheds , lights etc etc ) . This rule pretty much covers every single socket in the house so the ring main should be placed on the RCD protected side of the consumer unit . <p> RCDs have a test button which creates an earth leak with a resistor , and it is usually recommended that they are tested once a month . An information label near the consumer unit explains this The resistor passes more current than that required for tripping , and the duration of the test is not limited , so testing in this way does not provide proof that the unit is working to specification . RCDs can also be switched off manually and can take the place of the isolator switch in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The second condition applies to any circuits where an earth fault current is not sufficient to blow the fuse , or trip the switch , in the designated time allowance made in the regulations . This generally applies to higher Amp rated appliances ( showers , cookers etc ) but it should always be checked with an electrician as to which circuits need to be placed on the RCD side of the consumer unit . <h> MCB 's <p> The Current ratings which MCBs are designated to deal with are now conforming to the international equivalent of our old imperial ratings . This standard is called the Renard current rating and supercedes the imperial ratings as far as MCBs are concerned . A 5 amp fuse can be replaced with a 6 amp MCB . A 15 amp fuse becomes a 16 amp MCB , a 20 amp fuse can be a 20 amp MCB , 30 amp fuse = 32 amp MCB and a 45 amp fuse must now be a 40 amp MCB . <p> Consumer Unit with MCB and main double pole isolation switch <p> Consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the mains double pole isolating switch and an MCB clipped into place on the DIN bar .

@@41624734 @1624734/ <p> Summary : How to measure and calculate floor area for different types of flooring including carpets , vinyl , lino , laminate flooring and floorboards . In this DIY guide you will learn how to measure the area of a floor that may not necessarily be square and may have odd shapes . Measuring the space accurately will also ensure that you can minimise any waste and also the number of cuts you may have to make . <h> Measuring Floor Area for Carpet , Tiles , Vinyl etc .... <p> Measuring for a floor covering can be very tricky in some rooms where awkward shapes and alcoves can cause some confusion . We have shown below the simplest method of measuring in these circumstances . As you can see the floor has been divided into rectangles . <p> String can be laid on the floor to show these rectangles when measuring , masking tape can be stuck to carpets and pencil lines can be drawn on floors to be permanently covered by tiles etc . You can also use a chalk line to mark any floors which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool to have in your tool box . <p> There is a laser line generator which , when turned on , shines a laser ( harmless ! ) light across the surface allowing quick and easy measurement . <p> There is a diagonal wall in this room , which can make it very tricky to measure until you remember that a triangle with a right angle in it is half of a rectangle . Therefore by drawing the line G and multiplying it by the line F , then dividing it by 2 , you have the area of the triangle section of the room . <p> The area of the room above is : <p> A X B <p> H X D <p> E X G <p> -+ of F X G <p> Add all of these together and you will know how much material you need . <h> Measuring Floor Area for Floorboards <p> The area method described above is OK when ordering materials such as tiles , carpet and others that are sold by the square yard or meter . For floorboards there are some additional calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added floorboards , and some dimensions to the plan . This is not drawn to scale and the number of floorboards represented is not the amount needed for a room of this size . We will say for the purpose of this demonstration that the face of the floorboard , which will be seen when the boards are laid , is 150mm . <p> Each board may be wider than this if it is a tongue and grooved board , as the tongue will stick out a little . You must check with your supplier , before measuring and buying , the width of the board that will be left showing . This is called the finished width . <p> Downstairs floor area example showing the space divided into rectangles for measurement and also showing floorboards laid over floor space <p> To work out how many boards we need , and the lengths they need to be , we now must produce what is called a cutting list . We want as few joints as possible so if we can order the correct lengths of board it will make life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want a total of 100m of floorboard as they may well send it to you in very short lengths which have been left over from other orders . You will then have a great deal of extra cutting to do as each join must be placed on a joist . See our replacing a timber floor project . <p> Rectangle 1 - A , B , C <p> We know length B is 4 m and by dividing length C by the width of each board ( 150mm ) we can see how many boards we need in the first of our rectangles <p> Finally measurement F = 0.20m divided by 150mm = 1.33 ( say 2 ) which in theory can be divided by 2 because it is a triangle . BUT .. Because of the cut you will need to make to go up against the angled wall , it is very , very unlikely you will be able to use the remainder of the first board top complete the space left . It 's always advisable to have a little spare anyway , so in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs 2 boards of 4m or longer . <p> We can then take these totals to our supplier and give him our cutting list which for the example above would be : <p> 29 boards of 4m or longer <p> 7 boards of 3.4m or longer <h> Measuring Floor Area for Chipboard <p> For floor coverings such as Chipboard , which , for ordinary flooring can be bought in tongued and grooved panels measuring 2.4m x 1.20m with smaller panels available for lofts , the total area of your floor can be divided by the area of each board to give you the number of boards required . So for our plan above we have : <p> B X C = 10 square m <p> H X D =3.4 square m <p> E X G = 6 square m <p> G X F divided by 2 = 0.40 square m <p> Total area = 19.80 square m . <p> The area of each board is 2.40m x 1.20m = 2.88 square m <p> Total area ( 19.8 ) divided by a board ( 2.88 ) = 6.875 boards ( say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every board being used , however when you come to lay them out on your floor joists you will probably need to cut some off the length and even the width to be able to fit the boards to the joists and edges of the room . Obviously this means more boards so be prepared to add to the number you need depending on the layout of your joists and the shape of the room . These calculations however will give you a very good idea of the amount of timber and the cost involved . <p> When ordering quarry , vinyl and carpet tiles , each box of tiles will say how many square meters its contents will cover . Armed with your total area you can easily work out how many boxes you need . Bags and drums of tile adhesive will have the same information available . For laying carpets you will also need to work out the complete perimeter of the room to order gripper rods for holding the carpet down . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Make sure you site it well away from the existing one ( at least 20m away ) . <p> If building a new soakaway is not possible , then you may need to renovate the existing system . This could involve digging out the old pit and replacing the graded stones , if it is just silted up , or you may need to make the pit bigger to cope with a higher volume of surface water . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624739 @1624739/ <p> Building a garden wall is a little daunting for some people but it is not a difficult job if you take your time and follow a few simple basic instructions . Firstly a garden wall foundation must not be taken lightly . The absolute minimum thickness of a foundation used anywhere on , in or around a property is 150mm ( 6 inches ) . This thickness , providing the wall is not loadbearing , will be enough to ensure your foundation will not crack . <p> The width of the foundation should be 250mm wider than the wall you intend to build and the wall should be built in the centre of the foundations making sure that the distances A and B are the same . Its also important that the foundation trench is dug with a flat smooth bottom and the thickness of the concrete is the same throughout the length of the foundation . See our project on mixing concrete to get the correct mix for your foundation . <p> How to lay the bricks and/or blocks for your garden wall is best seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , place a layer , or bed , of mortar on the concrete foundation . This operation is exactly the same if done with blocks as seen below . <p> The bricks are then pushed in to this bed until they are level and the joints between them are filled . <p> The spirit level is placed on the back of the bricks to make sure the first course is running in a straight line . The same operation is used for the next course but it is as well to build up one end , or corner , first . <p> Keep checking in every direction with the level to make sure your wall is completely flat and upright . Much more instruction is given in the laying bricks project . <p> When the corner is built up , a corner can be built at the other end and a line strung between them . This means you can lay the bricks or blocks in between the corners , to the line , and everything will look neat in rows . <p> The image below shows the line being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks <p> Blockwork corner <p> Using a line <p> You can see from both the brick and the block wall that the joints are staggered . Each brick or block overlaps the brick below it by half . This half bonding keeps the wall strong . <p> There are so many ways a garden wall can be built and so many different bricks , blocks and stone that can be used we have listed a few below and explained what they are called and why they are built the way they are . <p> Brick on edge with a corbel <p> This wall is made from old red bricks which can be bought at most demolition yards or as they are known now , architectural salvage yards . The feature of this wall is the top section . <p> The very top of the wall is built from bricks which have been laid on their edge . Understandably these bricks are called Brick on Edge ! <p> Under this course you will see a single course of bricks jutting out slightly . This jutting out is not just a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Called corbelling , the brick is made to stick out so any rain water running off the top of the wall runs onto the corbelling and then drips down to the ground rather than run down the face of the wall . This avoids unsightly stains made by water constantly running down the face of a wall . <p> Brick on edge on split block walling <p> This wall is constructed out of split block walling . This means the blocks themselves were part of larger blocks which have been split by special blades and hammers . <p> Split block walling is in itself attractive as it is mostly used to represent stonework . The brick on edge in this wall is a completely different colour brick making an even more attractive feature . <p> You can see however , the rain has run down the curve on the top of the wall and has then run over the edge . This will eventually cause a stain and it would have been a good idea to place a corbel on this wall . You can see from this example that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coping stones <p> Tile corbelling <p> Another example of corbelling but this time it is constructed using some old roof tiles . These roof tiles are small 10 inch x 6 inch concrete tiles called Plain Tiles . They can be bought at any builders merchants and make a very attractive corbel which protects the face of the brickwork . <p> The walls on the right are topped , or capped , with purpose made coping stones which give an attractive finish to the wall as well as providing the necessary overhang required to " throw " the rain water away from the face of the walls . <p> The lower of the two walls is an old stone wall which has been extended . The mortar used in this wall is lime mortar which you can find out more about in our project on mortar mixes . <p> Lime mortar is a great deal more flexible than cement mortar and this allows the wall to move a little while the elasticity of the mortar also allows it to breath . <p> This allows water that has soaked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind cement based products is pretty much sealed in . <p> You can see from these few examples that building a garden wall needs a bit of thought but whatever you decide to build the basics will stay the same . <p> It must be built on a solid foundation <p> The concrete and mortar mixes must be strong <p> The joints must be staggered and all joints must be filled to stop the water getting in too easily <p> If you walls becomes saturated it will not be long before the frost freezes inside the walls causing freeze-thaw action which can ruin a wall very quickly . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

In the case of a " barred " unit , which is a sealed unit with inbuilt glazing bars to make it look as if it is lots of small sections , you will need to make sure the glazing bars look absolutely horizontal and vertical . This can also be done using the spacers . <p> The beads , if installed when you take delivery of the frame , can be removed using a sharp scraper or chisel , this will give you a clear view of the rebates that will receive the glass . <h> Window Sill and End Caps <p> The frame will come separately to the sill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on site as normally you get a little extra to play with . The sill in most cases will also come with some end caps which need to be glued on to each end of the sill with a special PVC superglue .

The glue can be purchased from most window and glazing suppliers . <p> The sill sits on the top of the outside skin of the wall , on a mastic , or sand and cement bed . A bead of silicone is applied to the top of the sill and the frame then sits on that . The back edge of the sill will have a little upstand against which the window will butt and this is where you put the silicone .

You can ask to have a variety of spacers sent with the windows you order . <p> Choose a solid area of wall and drill through the frame and wall . Countersink the fixing hole gently , the pvc section here is not very thick and you just want to be able to lose some of the heel of the fixing . <p> Insert the correct length " frame fix " screws , which come complete with plug .

In this DIY guide find out about the different types of thermostat and how they are used in your home to control temperatures and the running of your boiler or heating system . Find out about digital and analogue room thermostats , programmable room thermostats , zone heating systems and how each can effect your heating costs . <h> What is a Room Thermostat ? <p> A thermostat , be it mechanical or digital , simply allows the user to set a temperature which will be maintained whenever the time-clock is timed to be on . <p> By using a room thermostat to control your boiler you can control when you 're heating is switched on and in some cases even what rooms are heated , ensuring that you are not wasting money and heating energy when no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you money on your heating bills and also help to save the environment by reducing your carbon dioxide emissions as heating systems in the home generally tend to consume the most energy compared to any other item . <p> Essentially by using a room thermostat you can set the required temperature that you would like your rooms to be and once this temperature is reached , your boiler is switched off . <p> Most of the major heating manufacturers ( Honeywell , Siemens etc. ) produce room thermostats and typically they are available in several different forms " wired and wireless and digital and analogue . <p> As it suggests , wired units are connected to the heating or wiring source via a wire and wireless systems operate wirelessly . <p> When it comes to digital or analogue there are also some decisions to be made . Typically analogue thermostats are cheaper and easier to operate in that they feature a dial that is turned to set the required temperature . The temperature settings are also easily visible above the dial and in this respect can be ideal if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honeywell analogue room thermostat - Image courtesy of Honeywell <p> Digital thermostats often tend to be more attractive to look at but in most cases are more expensive . Depending on the type of heating system that you have in your home can also depend on what features you can use with a digital thermostat e.g. Zone Heating Systems ( manufacturers requirements apply ) . In some cases the user panel used to set times and temperatures can also be a bit tricky to figure out . <p> Honeywell digital room thermostat - Image courtesy of Honeywell <p> Some of the benefits of room thermostats are as follows : <p> With a wireless room thermostat , the controls and sensor can be positioned anywhere in your home ( needs to be an area with free flowing air , with no obstructions e.g. curtains , chairs ) so that they give the most accurate readings . In most cases the temperature sensor does not need to be wired directly to the boiler <p> They constantly measure the temperature of the air in your home <p> You can set the temperature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Digital Room Thermostat <p> A mechanical thermostat often maintains temperatures higher than required due to their inherent inaccuracy . If the room temperature is 1-C higher than the set-point , you are potentially using up to 10% more energy . Conversely when the heating is off , mechanical thermostats are slow to respond and the room temperature can fall between 3-5-C before the heating comes back on , making occupants uncomfortable . <p> Digital technology has helped to improve the accuracy of temperature measurement and therefore control . Accuracy of greater than 1-C is the norm . Rooms rarely exceed the target temperature and energy use is therefore minimised . Conversely the heating comes back on as soon as the temperature falls maintaining a stable temperature keeping occupants comfortable . <p> Digital technology applied to thermostats has given rise to a number of variants . Some of these include : Digital Thermostat , Programmable Thermostat , Programmable Thermostat for Heating &amp; Hot water . <p> Many of today 's modern thermostats and heating systems can also be controlled over the internet . Obviously the system itself will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to access it . <p> In essence , your heating controller/thermostat will be connected to the internet and using a web app ( commonly downloaded to a smart phone or accessed via an account through the manufacturer 's website ) you can log in and set the temperature for your heating when you are not even in the same country . One point to note is that these systems and setup can be expensive ! <h> Why should I consider a Programmable Room Thermostat ? <p> The main additional feature of a programmable thermostat is the ability to set different temperatures at different times of the day " known as comfort levels . As the temperature set-point can be made to match the lifestyle of the occupant , a programmable thermostat gives far more flexibility and greater energy saving . In addition , programmable thermostats also serve as a frost stat . <p> Building regulations now state that dwellings with total usable floor areas greater than 150M- should have more than one heating circuit with separate time and temperature control . A programmable thermostat is the perfect solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or 7day version is most appropriate . Manufacturers are increasingly offering 5/2 day versions as standard due to the reduced programming required . <h> Other Types of Thermostat and Controls to Consider <p> Zone Controls <p> As already mentioned above , zone controls allow you to heat rooms in your house independently of each other . For example if you are spending the evening watching TV in the living room , there is no need to heat the dinning room . By doing so , you can save money on your heating bills . <p> Wireless zone heating control system <p> Boiler Interlock <p> This essentially turns your boiler off if neither a cylinder thermostat ( the thermostat inside your hot water cylinder if you have one ) or room thermostat require it to be on . <p> Cylinder Thermostat <p> Some homes feature a cylinder where all the hot water for your home is stored . In most cases this will be located in an airing cupboard . The water inside the cylinder is heated through an element ( similar to that of a kettle ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the element inside the cylinder does not continue to heat the water past the required temperature . <p> The thermostat itself in most commonly fitted around a quarter of the way up the cylinder from the bottom . Normally they are set to around 60-C to ensure no bacteria is allowed to develop in the water . <p> Boiler Thermostat <p> This is normally located on the front of your boiler . It usually looks similar to a dial with temperature settings on it . <p> The majority of boilers will only feature 1 dial that will set the temperature for any water that is sent to both the radiators and the hot water cylinder but in some instances your boiler may have one for each . <p> By turning the dial you can set the desired temperature for heating the radiators in your home . This can be used in conjunction with boiler interlocks and also room thermostats if you have them . <p> TRV 's - Thermostatic Radiator Valves <p> These are basically thermostats for your radiators .

@@41624748 @1624748/ <p> Summary : Guide to Flat Roof Construction - How to Build a Flat Roof . Learn how to make and install a flat roof on your building , with advice on flat roof design and planning . A guide to the recommended types of covering and links to construction kits with all the materials you need for your DIY roofing project . <h> How are Flat Roofs Constructed ? <p> The basic construction of a flat roof is made up of roofing timbers , or joists as they are more commonly known or steels that are laid across two uprights ( walls in most cases ) . <p> The steels , or RSJ 's ( Rolled Steel Joists ) are often built into one or both walls to give added stability to the roof structure . <p> The joists are then either laid on top of the steels or cut into them . These joists are spaced at a specified distance apart , usually 400mm depending on the width or span they are covering and the surface that is to be applied . <p> In the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more commonly called Stirling board . <p> When timbers are used in flat roofing they obviously need to be waterproofed so boards are normally laid across the joists and then a felt or rubber is used to cover the boards to make them waterproof . Where two boards meet and the joint is not on a joist , tongue and grooved decking boards make the joint strong enough to support the flat roof load . <p> Stirling board with tongue and groove for fitting to flat roof joists <h> When is a Flat Roof Needed ? <p> Sometimes town planners will not allow the height required for a pitched roof . This is because it may obscure a neighbours view or light . Sometimes a pitched roof is not appropriate for an extension because it would mean obscuring light to the home owners own windows . Usually however , a flat roof is used when an extension butts up to an existing building . <p> To use a pitched roof in these circumstances would mean adding roof valleys or box gutters and make draining the roof difficult and expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily away from the building into new gutters which can be connected to existing drainage systems or even new soakaways . <p> Occasionally a new flat roof will be required to replace an old roof , for example asbestos or corrugated tin roofs which are either not allowed under building regulations or are in a complete state of disrepair . <h> Sizes of Joists Needed for a Flat Roof <p> As you may imagine there is a fair amount of weight involved here , in terms of boards , felt etc .... so any timber joists that are used need to be strong enough to support this weight . To ensure that these timbers are strong enough for the span they have to cover a formula is used to calculate the correct width and height that the joists should be . <p> Additionally as part of the Building Regulations Approved Document A for structure further calculations are required to take into account additional loads such as snow that some roof may be subjected to . In most cases this depends on the area of the country the property is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property above sea level . <p> Due to these factors it is very important that before construction begins that you gain building regulations approval . <p> To aid you with this , there are 8 maximum span tables in the building regulations , which deal with the loading and span of the roof together with any slight pitch over 10 degrees that it may have to dispose of rainwater . <p> These tables and rules are designed to protect your home . A copy of these rules can be obtained by ordering from **27;180;TOOLONG or telephone 0870 600 5522 . Fax orders are taken on 0870 600 5533 . The booklet costs -10.00 . <p> Your calculations will need to be checked by a structural engineer to ensure they cover all eventualities . If , for example , the incorrect size timbers were used and as a result your roof were subject to unnecessary movement , its covering would soon become weaker and is liable to split and possibly leak . <p> The diagram below is a general one and the specified timbers must be inserted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joists at 600mm centres to avoid twists in the joists . This roof shows the traditional covering of felt , there are more applications these days including fibreglass and rubber . <h> Building a Flat Roof <p> Plan of components of a flat roof used for laying felt covering <p> Never confuse the word flat , with the word level . Flat roofing should always be flat , but never level .... not in just one direction anyway . <p> Water must be allowed to flow off flat roofs as puddles of water are very heavy and they soon force a dip into the timber roof decking which then becomes bigger allowing more water to puddle until the roof can bear the weight no longer and leaks occur . <p> The diagram above gives you a basic idea of the components of a flat roof , the diagram below goes into greater detail about how all of these component parts work together . <p> In the above diagram , gap G may be built in with masonry to avoid twist in the timbers . Failing that the joists can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below for further information <p> For timber sheet , we recommend 18 or 22mm Stirling board or ply . <p> The arris rail is purpose made and available from most timber merchants and gives a 2-inch up stand to edges from which the water flows away . This stops water dripping over edges that do not have gutters and spoiling the wall surface on which it would otherwise run down <p> The felt roofing to the correct building standards can be applied all over the roof in the specified number of layers , and strips of mineral felt are then fixed to the facia boards with the back facing out . They are then turned over the arris rail and sealed to the top of the covering . This gives a finished edge to the roof and seals the gap between roof and facia board . <h> Warm and Cold Flat Roofs <p> Flat roofs can be constructed as warm roofs or cold roofs depending on the requirement of the owner and architect as they relate to the building regulations regarding heat loss and insulation . Put simply a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available void and a cold flat roof allows air to circulate between the joists . This air is vented at either end of the roof to allow a continuous air flow . <p> The design of the roof , either warm or cold , must be precise . If a warm roof is not fully packed with insulation , yet a constant air flow is not a achieved , condensation will form in any unvented void . Condensation forms as warm air ( in insulated voids ) hits cooler surfaces ( underside of roof decking ) and can rot the roof from the inside out . <p> This type of condensation is called interstitial condensation . This warm vs cold roof situation also occurs in pitched roofs and it is vital , in simplistic terms that either no air is allowed into voids or a constant air flow is achieved . <h> Warm Flat Roof With Air Flow <p> Having laid out the rules in simplistic terms above , the most common type of flat roof these days is one which combines a warm insulating layer , with an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen in the diagram below . <p> This is a very simplistic diagram designed to show the user the principles of warm and cold flat roofs . <p> If you are designing or building a flat roof at home you need to do a little more research to show you how and where to incorporate a vapour barrier into your roof and whether or not you need ( in the case of an externally insulated roof ) to add a further layer of roof decking timber to the top of the insulation . It is impossible in a generic flat roof project such as this to " cover all bases " so please ensure you investigate your own project thoroughly . <p> Cold Flat Roof : It can be seen that warm air ( without a vapour barrier ) within the plasterboard , can rise up through the plasterboard into the void . A layer of insulation will further warm this air which will rise until it hits the cold underside of the flat roof decking . <p> It will then condense and water droplets can fallback onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not underestimate the dangers of condensation . <p> Cross section of cold flat roof with air flow and condensation <p> Warm Flat Roof : By fully packing a warm flat roof with insulation there can be no air to condense . However this type of warm roof relies on there being absolutely no voids whatever otherwise interstitial condensation will occur and this can go unnoticed for many years . <p> Warm flat roof fully packed with insulation <p> The Bit in the Middle : Where insulation above the roof void allows the air underneath to stay warm , avoiding condensation , but also allows for an air flow ( should one be deemed to be required ) through the joists . <p> As long as the air flow is small ( but constant ) the air will not get cold enough to condense and the heat will remain in the room below . <p> The in between method - Warm air flat roof with air flow <h> Flat Roofs Built for a " Lean-To " Extension <p> Section through elevation of lean-to flat roof <p> A - Internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the lean to extension is added , becomes an internal wall below the level of the extension roof . This necessitates the retrospective insertion of C , the cavity tray in the case of an added extension <p> C - A cavity tray must be inserted in all cavities where an external wall becomes an internal wall in any circumstances . This applies to new build properties as well as buildings with single floor extensions added to them . This is because all external skins ( B ) leak to some degree . The water gets into the cavity and drops down to ground level where it drains away through the bottom of the same wall it entered by ... This is one of the reasons for having a cavity wall . However , when a room is placed on the external side of the wall , allowing this water to drain into this room would be madness . The insertion of a cavity tray ensures that the water can only drop as far as the roof of the adjoining building where it is forced to drain through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it simply runs down the roof <p> D - Weephole through external brickwork . The reason for this weephole is given above . Many times the weephole will just be a perpendicular joint which has been left mortar free , but more often there will be a plastic weephole inserted into this joint . The plastic weephole vents are gridded to stop insects making nests in the cavity <p> Weepholes allow water to drain from a masonry cavity <p> E - Lead Flashing - To cover and seal the joint between the flat roof and the wall of the existing property . Lead is used because it is very flexible while very strong . The lead is tucked into a horizontal joint of the existing property masonry , retained by banging in lead wedges or clips and sealed by either repointing the groove ( or chase ) with cement mortar , or sealant . The lead is then " dressed " down onto the roof where it takes the shape of the roof tiles , slates or decking <p> F - The Flat Roof Covering : <p> This flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mineral chipping topping to soak up the heat of the sun which protects the felt from both melting and breakdown under UV rays <p> The flat roof covering can also be EPDM . This ( Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer ) rubber covering is very versatile , long lasting and very strong . EPDM , or rubber roofing , can be bought in DIY kits which include all trims and adhesives to get a neat waterproof job without any previous training other than maybe a YouTube video . More about this at the base of this project <p> The flat roof covering can also be fibreglass . Fibreglass flat roofing , also known as GRP roofing or Glassfibre Reinforced Plastic roofing . The fibreglass is made from a mixed resin and hardener which is " painted " onto a mesh mat which then hardens to form a fully waterproof surface . It is light , easy to lay and , because it is almost entirely liquid in it 's original form , is easy to get into otherwise inaccessible corners to ensure waterproof surfaces <p> G - Joist hangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , masonry or stud walls to carry the end of the joists . They are made from galvanised ( non-rusting ) steel and come in a variety of shapes and sizes . Their use allows speed and saves money from the old method of having to build each joist into the wall <p> H - Firring ( or furrung ) piece - Firring or Furring pieces , refer to a method of raising or making flat , uneven surfaces or levels which need to be adjusted in some way . It is thought the UK spelling of firring is a derivation of the 16th century word furring which means to trim out ... Whatever its origins , a firring piece is a piece of timber shaped or cut to give you the types of surface profile you require . In the case of a " firred out " flat roof , these are timbers cut to a triangular shape and fixed to the top of the roof joists . This gives the required slope to allow rainwater to run off without puddling on the surface <p> I - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Joists must be strong enough to take the weight of the immediate covering , i.e. timber , insulation , felt etc , plus allowances must be made for snow covering in winter . Roofing timbers in Norway for example are much larger than those used in England <p> J - Plasterboard - This is a universally accepted ceiling and wall covering which has many forms . Plasterboard is pretty fire resistant , is easily cut , can come in moisture resistant , sound resistant , vapour resistant forms and is easy to secure to the surface . It allows decoration of all kinds and can be plastered <p> K - Refers to the void ( or otherwise - see above ) between the joists . This void can be a warm void or a cold void depending on the insulation requirements of the home but whatever is decided it must be kept moisture free to avoid rotting the roof timbers <p> L - The Facia Board - A facia board is essentially a cover strip to present a neat facade . This covering though has a number of uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water away from the roof . It covers any gaps between the roof and the house walls , on tiled roofs it provides a " tilt " to the first row of tiles so that they do not droop down onto the property walls thereby splitting the roofing felt and finally it hides the gap N between the facia and the extension wall which is left to allow the passage of air into and out of the roof void between the joists <p> M - External wall to the lean-to extension . This can ( and most often is ) a cavity wall but can also be a single support wall <h> How Moss can Affect a Flat Roof <p> Problem : Without an adequate fall on your flat roof , water can accumulate in puddles laying on the surface of the roof . <p> Seeds and spores can drop into this fertile environment and in no time at all , the flat roof is covered in moss and even weeds . The moss in particular holds on to the water every time it rains and when wet doubles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagging of joists which in turn leads to splitting of the roof covering . <p> A moss covered flat roof can lead to sagging joists and leaking roofs <p> Solution : Add firring pieces to the roof to increase the fall and keep the roof free of moss . <p> Fibreglass and rubber flat roofs are far less likely to attract the same amount of moss and weeds that felt will especially if some effort is made to keep them free from grime . <p> A modern EPDM rubber or fibreglass roof with firring pieces can prevent water buildup and moss growth <h> DIY Doctor 's Flat Roofing Advice and Recommendation <p> In the case of a felt or fibreglass covered roof , we very strongly advise the installation of this by a professional . You will get a guarantee , usually 10 years and that is worth its weight in gold . <p> If you are felting a flat roof and you do get a leak having done the job yourself , 99% of the time a patch will not work because the water will have seeped under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately rot . <p> In this case and depending on the severity of the damp the damaged area will need repairing and in severe cases the entire roof may need replacing . Even the repair to a small area can be costly ! <h> Rubber Flat Roofing - DIY EPDM Kits <p> If you are reasonable at DIY there are EPDM rubber roof DIY kits available . Pretty much all teh kits available regardless of manufacturer will include everything you need - the membrane itself , trims , glues , fixings and the all important installation guide . <p> One thing to be aware of though is that in most cases you will be replacing an existing roof and in most cases this will be a felt roof . Depending on the age and manufacturer of your existing roof and roof felt and the type of adhesive that has been used to fix it down , the glue that is used can be detrimental to the glue that is used to fix the EPDM rubber down and can cause it to fail . <p> In respect to this you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out from scratch using only the existing roof joists or you can board over the top the existing roof . For this use 18mm sterling board . It is also advisable to remove the existing felt or covering to minimise the risk of future damage as much as possible . <p> In all cases it is ultimately better to completely strip the roof and start from scratch . <p> When it comes to DIY kits there are quite a few EPDM rubber roof suppliers in the market at present . <p> When considering which kit to purchase make sure you do your homework and confirm that the kit will include all the necessary items you will need including full fitting instructions . <p> Most companies will require you to supply them with the dimensions of your roof and they will supply the correct amount of rubber membrane to cover that area . <p> One supplier that we have worked with recently , Waterproof Systems , allow you to build your own kit by entering the dimensions of your roof area and what each side of the roof will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost and what will be included in your kit - very handy ! If you 're interested you can check it out here . <p> If possible ( this will depend on the size of the area that needs covering ) ensure that the covering is a single piece of rubber and that it is not supplied in cut sections that you then have to join together . Although this is fine ( as long as the joints are sealed correctly ) best practice is to use a single piece as the more joints there are the more chance there is of a leak developing in time . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

See our chart of standard door sizes for internal doors . Additionally , Watch a video tutorial to help you if you are hanging doors - How to Hang a Door <h> What to Know Before Hanging a Door <p> The first mistake some people make when hanging a door is to start fitting furniture ( handles , hinges etc ) before the door is cut to size . Standard door sizes are available to fit most existing frames but houses move . <p> Some older houses will have moved dramatically and one of the first things that twists and bends is the door frames . <p> Almost all doors have to be trimmed to fit the opening they are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a feature door . In this situation it is fairly easy to adapt or " build out " the frame to suit the new door . <p> If you are ever in the position of adapting a frame do not be tempted to fit the frame to suit the door or the existing opening . If the existing frame is leaning over or twisted , insert your new timbers upright and square if off . <p> You should always endeavour to start with a square frame and cut the door down to suit . Carpentry is not easy . It takes time to learn and a really good idea is to get some basic techniques under your belt before trying major projects . The two books below will help you master the basics . <p> Basic Capentry book available from Amazon <p> Home Carpentry book available from Amazon <h> Standard Internal Door Sizes <p> 525mm x 2040mm <p> Metric size door for metric frame <p> 626mm x 2040mm <p> Metric size door for metric frame <p> 726mm x 2040mm <p> Metric size door for metric frame <p> 826mm x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x 2040mm <p> Metric size door for metric frame <p> 610mm x 1981mm <p> 2ft x 6ft 6 inches <p> 686mm x 1981mm <p> 2ft 3 in. x 6ft. 6 in . <p> 762mm x 1981mm <p> 2ft. 6in. x 6ft. 6in . <p> 838mm x 1981mm <p> 2ft. 9in. x 6ft. 6in . <p> It is possible to get other door sizes " off the shelf " so always enquire , but generally speaking these are the most common door sizes and even so it is unlikely that you will get anything other than those highlighted sizes in DIY stores . You may need to go to a builders merchants for other sizes . <h> Door Styles and Furniture <p> Depending on the style of your door and the interior design of your home , it is also important that you choose the correct furniture for your door . There is a huge selection of styles , colours and finishes available today that will cater for almost every taste you can imagine . <p> Doors are either " flush doors " or " panelled doors " . A type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door is divided into panels with two side rails , a top and bottom rail and a mid rail . A flush door is simply flat on both sides . <p> For extreme sizes or sizes which can not be matched or made up , it is possible to buy " door blanks " . These are oversize , solid , flush doors which can be cut down to any size . <p> Doors come in thicknesses of 1&amp;3 eighths of an inch , 1 &amp; 3 quarters of an inch , and 2 inches . Check the measurement between the front of your frame and your door stop before you start work . <p> Internal Doors are available as " hollow " lightweight doors or fire-check doors . Fire check doors should always be fitted to the kitchen and internal garage door and if you have a loft conversion they will be stipulated throughout . <p> Their construction means that , when closed , the fire will take either 1/2 or 3/4 of an hour to burn through , depending on the door used . <p> Intumescent strips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strips which swell up at the first sense of heat and stop smoke from getting through any gaps . You will also , on the construction of a loft conversion , need to install automatic door closers to arrest the spread of any fire . <p> Intumiscent door strip <h> How to Hang a Door <p> Locate the Lock Block <p> The first step is to make sure you have the door the right way round . At the top of a new flush , or hollow panelled lightweight door the word lock will be printed over to one side . This means that there is a section of timber fixed inside the frame of the door which is there to allow the door lock or latch to be fitted . See our project on fitting common mortice latchs to doors . <p> The images below show the top of a new door . Lock is clearly marked . Obviously the hinges are hung on the other edge . The lock block usually extends approximately 200mm up and down from the centre of the door . The image below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you use a screwdriver to tap down the side of the door you will hear the difference when you get to the lock block . <p> Lock Sign on side of door <p> Honeycomb door cross section <p> Size up Your Door to the Frame <p> To get the door to fit the frame it is first necessary to " offer it up " and mark it . As you can see in the images below we had to add timber to the existing frame to get a standard size frame . This was cut to size and screwed to the existing frame . <p> The door was placed in position up against the new frame and the inside of the frame was marked on the door with a pencil . You will probably need a hand with this . <p> Filling old Hinge Recesses <p> This new door was being hung on the opposite side to the old one so the old hinge recesses will need to be filled . This can be done with either filler applied in a couple of layers , or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , gluing and pinning it in place ( punching the heads of the pins down with a nail punch ) and sanding it down to finish flush with the frame . This is called " scarfing " . <p> Cutting Your Door to Fit <p> Drawing lines and cutting timber in any form can cause the novice a great deal of problems . We often get emails asking simply " How do I cut a straight line " and " I have marked my work and cut on the line but I always cut my timber too small " . <p> The answer to the first is to let the hand saw do the work . Make sure you are looking at the saw from directly above it and not from the side . If your body is leaning , the chances are the saw will be leaning too , giving you a cut which is far from square . <p> Hold the saw with your finger down the handle pointing to the work and make sure the timber is totally secure . Any movement in the timber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cutting timber project for a good example of how to do this correctly . <p> Leave the Line and Do n't Forget the Thickness of the Saw <p> Ok , so you have the door marked to the internal size of the frame . Another easy thing to forget is that the saw has a thickness of about 3mm including the set of the teeth . <p> If you cut along the line therefore , the door will be 3mm smaller than you intended . This may not sound a lot , but should you cut marginally inside the line , you are talking about a difference of 5mm and this is the difference between a good job and a shoddy one . Remember always leave the line . <p> Whenever you mark a piece of timber , the line you have drawn it the exact size you want the wood . If you cut or plane the line off , your work will be smaller than you intended . <p> Cut the work along the side of the line , just leaving the line in place . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can always plane a little more off , but you ca n't stick it back on ! <p> People think it is so easy to grab a saw and start a piece of carpentry but even cutting a straight , square line is a problem until you have mastered it . <p> Make the Frame Square to Avoid odd Cuts <p> In this instance , as we had rebuilt the frame , the cut was square , but with older frames you may find you have twists and kinks and it will not be possible to use a saw for the cut down . <p> Using a plane is the correct option here and we obviously prefer a power plane . Fully qualified carpenters have had to practice this , it makes sense that you should do so also . <p> Fiitting Hinges to Your Door <p> Having cut the door to the correct size we have now got to hang it . This can be done on a variety of hinges but for most doors it is the standard butt hinge that is used . <p> There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the position on the door or frame but we like to keep the top of the top hinge at 7 inches down from the top of the door and the bottom of the bottom hinge at 7 inches from the bottom of the door . <p> Mark the Position of the Hinges <p> Mark the position of the hinge by opening it at right angles and laying it on the side of the door to be hung . A lot of DIY web sites will tell you to mark round the hinge with a hobby knife . <p> Do not do this it is dangerous and almost impossible to cut along the grain neatly . Mark with a pencil and then scribe the long edges with a mortice gauge if you need to . <p> Cut out Hinge Recesses <p> Using a sharp chisel , cut as shown below , tapping firmly with a mallet to avoid breaking the chisel head . Remember the pencil line is outside the hinge so you need to cut inside this line . Once again , leave the line ! <p> Cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure your hinge fits neatly and is not " proud " of the timber . Neither should it be set too far in as this will cause the door to bind . The hinge should be set in just enough to be flush with the edge of the door . <p> Practice this cut on an offcut of wood for a while this will benefit you greatly if you have a number of doors to hang . <p> Drill driver screwing hinges down <p> Drill and Screw the Hinges to the Door <p> Drill pilot holes for your hinge screws and make sure they are in the centre of the hinge holes . A screw which is against the edge of the hole will push the hinge over and out of line . <p> Check for a Uniform Gap Around Your Door <p> When the hinges are cut in , stand the door in the opening . Check all round for the gap to be uniform . In years gone by the carpenters apprentice was made to carry an old penny , this was used to make sure the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure you have enough depth under the door if you are going to lay carpets etc later . Wedge the door in place . You can cut some timber wedges for this , as you can see we use chisels ! <p> Mark the Position of the Hinges on the Frame <p> With the door in the correct place you can mark the position of the hinges on the edge of the frame . <p> Take the door away again and using the mortice gauge which is already set to the hinge width , and the carpenters square , you can mark the full position of the hinge on the frame . This can then be chiselled out also . <p> Fitting Door Hinges <p> Close up view of fitting Door Hinges <p> Fixing the Hinges to the Frame <p> Wedge the door in position once again and , if you are on your own , you may find it easier to keep the top of the door in place by pinning the top hinge temporarily in place .

Advice on screwing into plasterboard with special fixings like the Redidrive , Nylon toggle , hollow wall anchor or the butterfly fixing to put up a shelf , mirror or picture . <p> A very popular question to DIYdoctor is " how can I fix things to plasterboard walls ? " . There are a variety of fixing available just for this but what you can not do is use ordinary wall plugs . The wallplugs do expand as you screw into them , but the plasterboard is soft and the expansion simply widens the hole you have put the plug into . In no time at all it will work loose . <p> Our photographs below are done using a small piece of plywood as we did not have any plasterboard on site . Plasterboard comes in 3/8 inch and + inch sizes and is larger than the board we used . Any gaps therefore will not occur . <p> Please note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lathe and plaster walls or ceilings . Please go to our fixing to lathe and plaster project for information about that . <p> Note : Additionally , it is always a very good idea to run over the area that you are about to drill with a stud detector to make sure that there are no pipes or wires that you are about to drill into . <p> To fix to plasterboard properly you need to use proprietary fixings . This applies to hollow doors also . Below are a variety of fixing available . <h> Self Drive or Redidrive Plasterboard Fixings <p> Self drive plasterboard fixing <p> This little beauty is called the Redidrive . It is one of the strongest of all plasterboard fixings . <p> The principle is simple . A pilot hole of 2 or 3 mm is drilled into the board and the redidrive bottom section is screwed into the hole . This is done without the screw in as the top of the Redidrive casing has a slotted head . <p> It is not absolutely necessary to drill a pilot hole as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole when pushed and screwed . However if you have managed to choose a spot where there is a timber stud behind , the Redidrive will simply snap when it hits the timber and leave you with a hole you do not want . <p> Drilling a tiny pilot hole will warn you if there is anything behind the board and also stop any movement in the Redidrive when you insert it . When the Redidrive is fully inserted , you simply screw whatever you need to fix , to the wall . <p> Reddi drive come in different lengths to accommodate the different thicknesses of fixture you want to put up <p> Reddi drive screwed into wall with screw inserted ready for fixing <p> Face of the Redidrive when it has been screwed into the plasterboard <p> In the images above , image 1 shows the face of the Redidrive when it has been screwed into the plasterboard .

They are good . <h> Nylon Toggle Plasterboard Fixing <p> The second fixing we use is called a plastic or Nylon toggle . <p> Nylon toggle for fixing to plasterboard <p> This is inserted ( 8mm hole for a medium toggle but always read the hole size on the packet first. ) through a pre-drilled hole after squashing it flat . <p> When a screw is inserted it goes through the hole in the back of the fixing and as you screw it , it pulls the back up to squeeze the fitting against the back of the plasterboard . Once again anything can be screwed to the wall now . <p> This fitting is also very strong but , if used on their own , heavy items can tend to " tilt " the actual fixing in its hole and while they will not fall off , can become a little loose after a while . <p> Ideal for shelf brackets which create a pulling force from the wall as well as a weight force downwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up <h> Hollow Wall Anchor Plaserboard Fixing <p> Next comes the hollow wall anchor . Again used individually these are not ideal for fixing heavy objects but as with the toggle above and the spring toggle below , anything that creates a pulling effect from the wall is ideally held at the top with these . <p> Hollow Wall anchor <p> Hollow wall anchors in board <p> The hole is drilled in the board , an anchor pushed in . As the screw is turned it pulls up the body of the anchor . This grips the back of the plasterboard as you can see by the top picture . <h> Rubber Anchor Nut <p> There is one hammer in fixing which we use a lot . Its very easy to use , simply hammer in and it will take a fair bit of weight . <p> Rubber Anchor nut <h> Spring Toggle of Butterfly Plasterboard Fixing <p> Then we have the Spring ( or gravity ) toggle or Butterfly fixing .

You will learn about the various types of glass splashback available , what type of glass you need to use , how to measure the size of splashback you need including measuring for cuts such as electrical sockets , what types of splashback fittings you can use and how to prepare your walls surface before fixing to ensure a great finish . <p> The use of coloured glass is a great way to improve the style of your kitchen and can create a real feature . <p> The Glass splashback can be placed behind cookers or sinks or ( if you feeling adventurous ) be used as an alternative to tiling or other finished surfaces between worktops and wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashbacks can be manufactured in multiple styles and varying colours ( most bespoke glazing companies can match any wall paint colour to the glass splashback if required ) . <p> Glass surfaces can also now include digital printing where you can supply your own image which is copied onto the glass . It can be fun to have family portraits on the wall or , as we have seen once , pictures of the home owner doing the very DIY jobs on which the images were displayed . <p> Back lighting for your glass splashback can also be installed to create varying lighting moods or to highlight certain areas or your visual images . <p> The finish texture can be changed , with each panel being available in matt , gloss , frosted or metallic look . Bespoke manufactures can offer your glass splashback in any shape . Do n't get stuck with the idea of tiles having to be square or rectangular . <p> You could also consider increasing the size of your glass splashback to incorporate the entire length of your kitchen work tops ( kitchen work tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your Cooker or stove is free-standing , you will probably want your splashback to continue below the work surface height at the rear of your cooker / stove to give a clean visual finish to your splash back . You may have a gas / electric hob cut into your worktop surface then all you have to do is measure the width and height of the space you want your glass splash to fill . <p> Glass splashback over cooker and worktop <h> What Type of Glass will I Need to use ? <p> With the use of glass as a splashback , you will need to use toughened glass . This will mean if you are fixing the splashback with screw fixings , the holes for the fixings will have to pre drilled by the glass splashback provider . Any " cut outs " for power sockets , TV points and telephone sockets will need to be made before the glass is toughened as this ca n't be done after the toughening process has been completed . <p> Many people believe toughened glass is made in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed such as cutting holes etc .... is carried out on the toughened glass . This is not true . All glass work is done to ordinary glass ( be it laminated , plate , georgian glass etc .... ) and then the glass is toughened afterwards . <p> One final point here is that you should always check with your cooker or stove manufacture and splashback supplier whether there is a minimum distance that must exist between your glass splashback and the gas jets or electric heating elements . <h> Measuring for Size of Splashback Needed <p> You will firstly need to decide where your splashback it going to go and how much of the walls surface it is going to cover . <p> Once you have decided this , the best way to accurately record your measurements is to do so on a piece of paper . Draw out a plan of the whole wall ( to scale if you can ) that the splashback is going to cover , accurately recording any items that are on the wall such as cupboards , cooker hoods , sockets or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact locations . <p> Wall area in kitchen to be filled with glass splashback <p> If you are going to use screw fixings then you will also need to accurately measure and mark where these are going to go on the plan that you submit to your splashback supplier . <p> Any cuts or holes that need to be made will have to be made by the supplier of your glass for the splashback before it is toughened , so these will also have to be accurately marked on your plan when you submit it . Once the glass is toughened it will then be almost impossible to make any adjustments . <p> If you are purchasing from a supplier then its well worth having one of their reps come out and measure up for you . This may cost a little extra but they will be very experienced in this job and if there are any discrepancies in the measurements then it will be up to them to correct where as if you supply your own plans and measurements then any mistakes will be down to you . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have to allow for a 2mm gap all the way around so that you can apply some sealant and prevent any water or moisture ingress , unless your splashback is going to continue down behind your cooker as outlined above . <h> Types of Splashback Fixings <p> There are two different methods of fixing a glass splashback to a wall : <p> Screw fixings <p> Adhesive fixing <p> Using adhesive is the easiest route to go down as essentially you just need to apply it to the rear of the splashback and push it into position on the wall and ensure its supported sufficiently until the adhesive cures . This method will also produce no visible fixing points and leave you with a nice seamless finish . <p> Adhesive used for fixing glass splashback to wall <p> Screw-fixing is slightly more tricky as you will have to screw a screw into the splashback itself and as the screw head pulls into the glass you will have to be very carefuly not to do it up too tight and crack the glass . You will also obviously be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you disguise it , it will always be visible . <p> The fixings themselves come in a variety of different styles and if you have purchased your splashback as a kit they should be supplied along with it . Alternatively you can purchase your own from your local DIY store . <p> If purchasing your own , you will need some with internal threads in the head . This will then allow you to screw in a finishing cover . These types of screw are often called mirror screws . See our project on types of screws for more information . <p> Splashback screw fixing or mirror fixing <h> Preparing the Surface of the Wall <p> Regardless of the fixing method you have chosen , there are several tasks that you must carry out before you actually secure the splashback to the wall : <p> Prepare the Wall and Check its Condition <p> The condition of the surface of the wall you are fixing to is of paramount importance ! You will need to make sure that any and all wallpaper is removed , any flaking paint is scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . <p> As glass does not bend the surface will need to be flat and any undulations will need to be smoothed out , with any major dips of holes filled with a suitable filler and then sanded down . <p> If the surface is too wavey then it may need replastering before you can fit your splashback . <p> Clean the Walls Surface <p> Once the surface has been prepared and all loose material removed give it a good wipe over with a suitable cleaning agent to remove any dust or grease . <p> If you are using adhesive to fix to a bare plastered or plasterboarded surface then you will need to seal it first . This will allow the adhesive to stick much better as the porous nature of both plaster and plasterboard wo n't suck too much moisture from the adhesive and it will be allowed to dry out more naturally . <p> Seal Along Back of Worktops <p> Using a suitable silicone based sealer , seal along the back of any worktop surfaces ( between the top of the worktop and the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This will work in conjunction with the sealant that is applied around the edge of the splashback as if any water or moisture penetrates this then it will not be allowed to travel down the back of any worktops and behind your units . If this happens over a long period of time then your units will begin to rot . <h> How to Install a Glass Splashback <p> Fixing Using Adhesive <p> Before applying adhesive its a good idea to position the glass in place to ensure that it fits nicely around any cupboards , cooker hoods or sockets . <p> Now that you have sized up the fit , remove the splashback and place it front down on to the worktop surface or another flat and stable surface . Make sure there 's no dirt or anything there before you do , you do n't want to scratch it ! <p> If the splashback has nothing to rest the bottom edge on while the adhesive is drying then you will need to fit a batten to the wall to support its weight until the adhesive is fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall to ensure that it does n't come off and risk your splashback coming crashing to the ground . Ensure that the batten is fixed at the correct height allowing for the required 2mm gap . <p> Batten fixed to wall supporting splashback until the adhesive has fully set <p> To give you your 2mm gap at the bottom of the splashback and above your worktop surfaces , you will need some 2mm chocks to rest the glass on . These will need to be removed once the adhesive has set . These will be included in with some kits . <p> Apply the adhesive to the rear of the glass in dollops . Each dollop will need to be roughly 20 - 30mm in size and they will need to be spaced about 80mm apart . Also ensure that the dollops around the edge of the glass are set in about 40mm as when it is pushed against the wall these will spread out and you do n't want them spilling out from around the edges . <p> In terms of adhesive , ask your splashback supplier what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . In most cases you can also use a suitable construction adhesive such as Gripfill or No Nails or even adhesive pads . One thing you should check is that the adhesive is heat resistant . <p> With the adhesive applied , position the the splash back up to the wall and , using a clean cloth , rub gently over the surface applying a little pressure ( but not too much , do n't crack it ! ) . You may need another pair of hands to help you . <p> Using your cloth , rub over the surface feeling for any spongy areas and gaps in the adhesive where there is no support provided . If you find any , pull the glass back off of the wall and apply more adhesive in that area . <p> Once you have given the whole area a good going over and filled any gaps in the adhesive , make sure that the chocks at the base are in place and there is a nice uniform gap around any sockets , cupboards , cooker hoods or other items and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocks ate the base and/or the supporting batten . <p> Fixing Using Screws <p> As with the adhesive method above , before you mark or drill any fixing points place the splashback up to the wall to make sure that it fits correctly around any cupboards , sockets etc .... and when in position there is a nice uniform gap around each . <p> Once you have confirmed the fit , place the glass back up to the wall and using a pencil , make a mark in the centre of all the fixing points on the wall so that you know where to drill them . Once this is done , remove the glass and store it in a safe place <p> Mark all points that need drilling on the wall <p> Drill each fixing point using a suitable sized drill bit ( normally 5 - 6mm ) to the required depth . Place a wall plug in each hole ready to take the screw . <p> Now , put the splashback back up to the wall . You may need the help of a friend or family member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Starting at any edges ( left edges first , then righ to hold it in position ) , screw in each fixing screw . You might be tempted to use an electric drill/driver to do this but please do n't as you can risk running the screws up too tight and cracking the glass . Use a hand-held screwdriver to tighten each screw . Tighten until the screw head is sitting snugly in the hole in the glass and there is no movement . <p> Once all screws have been fixed in position , add any finishing covers to disguise the screw heads and your done ! <p> Seal Around Edges , Cupboards , Sockets etc .... <p> The final job to complete , regardless of the fixings used is to apply a thin bead of sealant around all edges including the base and sockets using a suitable sealant ( clear is best ) and applicator gun . <p> Once applied , wet your finger and run it over each bead wiping off any excess . This will give you a nice , crisp edge and suitable professional look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sealant around all edges <p> Now that you have learnt all about fitting a glass splashback you may be interested to know that these same principles can be applied when fitting and acrylic splashback also .

@@41624755 @1624755/ <p> Summary : A DIY guide to laying a garden shed base , including how to use formwork and shuttering for concrete . Not only do we show you how to build a concrete shed base but we also show you how to get it smooth and level and also include a damp proof membrane . <p> How to build a shed base for your garden shed is a very popular question to diydoctor and in all honesty there are a number of ways to do it . <p> We have chosen a standard construction method which allows for a damp proof membrane under the slab to stop damp rising up through it . The slab itself is designed to be above ground and is 6 inches thick . <p> For small sheds this could be dug into the ground removing the need for any brickwork around the edges . This is more of a cosmetic finish to the base , just to tidy it up . <p> A basic run down of the process is to dig the hole 300mm wider and longer than your shed floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pour the concrete onto a damp proof membrane you have laid inside the base of the hole . <p> However you build your shed base you need to make sure the ground is level over the area of the entire base . <h> Check Ground to Ensure it 's Firm Enough for a Shed Base <p> For the above ground method , you first need to decide if your ground is firm enough to lay a slab without a hardcore sub-base . To do this get a 50mm x 50mm post and without sharpening the end try and drive it into the ground . This should be hard to do beyond 150mm deep . <p> If the ground is firm enough and the peg is difficult to drive into the ground then carry on with the instructions below . <p> If the peg goes in too easily then remove 4 inches of soil for an area of ground which is 500mm wider and longer than the floor of your shed and fill this with scalpings . <p> Scalpings are crushed stone aggregate and available from aggregate and builders merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcore but much much easier to lay and compact . <p> It is necessary to compact the scalpings before adding the concrete so that they are as tightly packed as possible . If not then over time they could move and slump , removing the support for the concrete and causing it to crack as there is no support from below . <p> If it is necessary to compact scalpings for your base , then a machine called a " whacker plate " or " vibrating plate " can be hired from your local tool hire shop . <p> Vibrating plate of Whacker Plate Macine <h> Preparing Timber Formwork for Concrete <p> Now we have a base area ready . It should , in all cases , be 300mm longer and wider than your shed floor and as level as possible . Using the diagram below follow the instructions for an above ground base . <p> Dimensions and layout for a shed base <p> In the diagram above , the damp proof membrane , which should be at least 1000 gauge polythene , is shown going under the formwork ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can see where it goes in relation to the construction . Its actual position is inside the frame . <p> Using 150mm x 25mm sawn and treated timber , cut the four sides of the formwork for your base . This timber should be 300mm longer than your base and 300mm wider . <p> Lay the timber out where you want the base and using a heavy " lump " hammer bang in some 50mm x 50mm posts along the line of the timber . These posts will obviously hold the timber on its edge , but more importantly are for stopping the timber bowing out as you place the concrete . The posts should be no more than 900mm apart . <p> When the posts are banged in you need to use a spirit level to make sure the top of the formwork is level . When it is , fix the boards to the posts using small nails ( 40mm ) . <p> There is no need to use large nails or screws as the concrete will hold the boards in place . If any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off using a sharp saw . You will realise the benefit of this when you come to level and " tamp " the concrete . <p> To make sure the angles of your formwork are at 90 degrees , measure from corner to corner across both diagonals - the measurements should be identical . If they are not then you will need to repeat the above to get them square . <p> With a level and square frame in place you can now lay 25mm of soft building sand in the bottom . This is to stop the polythene damp proof membrane getting punctured . Next , lay the polythene inside the frame ( on top of the sand ) and fold as tightly as possible into the corners . <p> Rather than buy timber to form the shuttering or formwork for your shed base it 's always possible to nip down to your local tool hire shop and hire some metal shuttering lengths called Road Forms . <p> Road Forms are , as the name would suggest , usually used for forming the sides of the concrete sub-base on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are laid around the perimeter of the shed base and metal pins are driven through purpose made slots in the forms to stop the concrete pressure pushing them over from inside . <p> The Forms are levelled in exactly the same way timber is and the top of the Form will act as a great smooth edge for running your tamping bar over . <p> Road forms can be used instead of timber for concreting shed base <h> Laying Shed Base Concrete <p> At this point it 's a good idea to get the help of a friend or a second person . Using a piece of timber laid across the top of the frame and concrete ( with one person at either end of the timber ) , wiggle it about to get the top of the new base level . <p> Stand the timber upright on its edge and push and pull it backwards and forwards across the frame while dragging it from one end to the other and this will level it roughly . Next , lift the board at both ends about 4 inches above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving up and down the frame as you do so . Try and tap together so both ends of the board hit the frame at the same time . <p> This vibrates the concrete into place and it will find its own level - This is called tamping ( See image below for an example ) . <p> Lastly , have a wander around the frame tapping gently on the outside all the way round with a clawhammer . This will vibrate out any air bubbles trapped between the frame and the concrete . <p> Tamping down the concrete <h> Building Brick Wall Border <p> While the concrete is going hard , without disturbing the posts ( of which there should be at least 300mm in the ground ) dig a small trench all the way around the base , right next to the frame , about 5 inches wide and 2 inches deep . Fill this with concrete also . This will form the foundation for the brick wall which surrounds the base . <p> This brick wall serves two purposes , it holds the damp proof membrane up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slab and the membrane and it also gives a much better looking side to the slab . <p> We are assuming this base is for keeps so you want it to look good as well as being completely functional ! <p> When the concrete is hard after a day or so , pull the timber up and away from the base . <p> Lay the top course of bricks with any frog ( brick indent ) facing down so that you have a nice flat top . When these are laid , cut off any surplus polythene just below the top of slab/bricks then push plenty of mortar ( soft sand and cement mixed at 4 to 1 ) into the joint between bricks and slab . <h> Positioning Your Shed on the Base <p> Ideally , when you build your shed it should sit on the concrete base . The bricks are for decoration but if they are well laid it does n't matter if the shed sites on them too , going right to the edge , as the decorative part of the brick is its face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is really up to you and how you want your finished shed and base to look . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624757 @1624757/ <h> Laying a patio - DIY Guide to Laying a Patio and Patio Slabs , Digging Foundations and Getting the Correct Fall for Drainage <p> Summary : In this project we run through the steps involved in building and laying a patio including how to prepare the bed and lay paving slabs . In this guide we show you how to check the ground foundations to see if they are suitable for laying patio slabs , how to dig foundations and lay scalpings if needed , how to get the correct fall on a patio for drainage and also an explanation of all individual components that make up a patio . <p> Building or laying a patio or decking will probably be the most money you spend in the garden . With regard to paving slabs you will , as with all products in the building trade , only get what you pay for . It is possible to buy cheap concrete slabs for little money in deals on the internet etc but the quality is usually very poor and poor quality slabs usually have lots of air bubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezes when its cold . This ice expands and forms tiny little cracks in the concrete , which in turn fill with water . This continues until the paving stone literally falls to pieces but on the journey the face of the slab " blows " off making the whole patio very unsightly . This project can be read in conjunction with a number of other projects on DIY Doctor so every time you see a blue link click through for more info . <p> The diagram above shows a cut through one of our typical patios . In the first instance two things must be remembered . The top of the patio nearest the property must be at least 150mm below the level of the damp proof course shown as A in the diagram . The other thing to remember is that the patio must slope away from the building . The various parts outlined in the diagram are discussed below and are identified from right to left which is not to be taken as any order of events : <p> B = Paving slabs . Slabs can vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each slab ! A riven slab ( that is a slab with a surface which is deliberately uneven to give a random patterned effect ) can be as thin as 25mm in one corner with the full thickness of 38mm being seen at another corner . This can make riven slabs more difficult to lay but the same technique as flat slabs can be applied ( see below ) with the spirit level reading being taken from where it touches the slab . <p> The slabs can be seen to be sloping away from the house and a slope , or fall , of 15mm per 1.5 metres is a good fall for a patio . For an average patio reaching 3m away from the house , the fall would be 30mm or just more than an inch . <p> Block paving patio <p> Instead of slabs one might decide to use block paving for a lovely patio and an example of how good these can look is seen to the below . <p> F = We always start our patios 3 or 4 inches ( 100mm ) away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is a downpour and strong winds the water can splash against the house wall and with riven slabs especially , can form little pools in the sunken areas of the individual slabs . Leaving this gap , and filling it with Pea Shingle as shown , will allow any water to drain away down to the foundations of the house where it will not do any damage . Also , leaving this little trench can make it so much easier to hide reinforced electricity cables if you want to install outside lighting or pumps for fish ponds etc . <p> E = A surface water or storm water drain which can be found in the back garden of most properties , This is the drain , or one of them , which takes the water from your gutters to the main drainage system . When a patio is built in a garden consisting mostly of clay , where the surface water does not easily drain away , it is sometimes necessary to direct water from where it has run ( because of the slope of the patio ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may seem like a great deal of work but it solves all of the drainage problems in a great many cases . <p> Drainage channel <p> D = A layer of scalping stone which may or may not be necessary . As mentioned before this depends entirely on the ground conditions . If the ground is soft and spongy you need hardcore or scalping stone . If it is not you can lay the mortar bed ( c ) directly on the soil once loose topsoil and lawn/weeds have been removed . We also strongly advise the use of a layer of weed fabric either between D and B or under B if D is not to be used . <p> C = A layer of sand mortar on which the slabs are laid . The mixture of this mortar varies from company to company but this is how we do it . We use sharp sand or flooring grit . No soft sand , or builders sand is used in this bed . The mix is 6 sand to 1 cement and it is mixed in a mixer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wet . The test we do is the same as the one we do when we are floor screeding . A handful of the mix is squeezed . It should stay in one lump in your hand without any moisture seeping out . This is a damp mix . Laying it as a bed is dealt with later in this project . <p> Sand for patios <p> Cement for patios <p> There are two types of bed used generally when laying patios . One method is called dot and dab where small heaps of mortar are laid under the slab . Usually one heap is laid in each corner and one in the middle . We do not like , or use this method at all because after a huge rainfall it is possible for water to get through the patio joints . When this happens it possible for running water to cut channels in the ground under the slabs which can undermine the dots and dabs This makes the patio loose and wobbly . With a solid bed under the slabs the water is restricted to the joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot easier to repoint joints than relay the patio . <p> N = A gully and grid . This is a drainage product which , as long as the patio is sloping towards it , will collect all the surface water and direct it to where ever it needs to go . The gully is connected to a 100mm drain pipe and this is laid on shingle to go to either a main drain as described above and shown by the directional arrow G. It can also go further away from the hose and be laid into a soakaway . This is shown by the directional arrow H. <p> A soakaway is simply a pit full of hardcore which allows the water to collect and slowly soak away through the soil . If the soil is solid clay however , a soakaway is of little use . If the patio is huge you may need more than 1 gully and special drainage channels are available which can run along the length of an area to be drained . These are very often found under garage doors when the drive slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A drainage channel and grate can be seen below . <p> Gully for patio drainage <p> Drainage pipe <p> J = The concrete into which the gully or drainage channel will need to be set and I = The foundations of a small retaining wall . <p> K = The existing ground level which has been dug out to accommodate the slope or fall of the patio and its base or bed . Obviously if left , this ground would fall away onto the patio . The easiest way to tidy it up is to build a small retaining wall . The retaining wall however acts as a stop for all the water flowing towards the end of the patio so this is why the drainage gully or channel is required . <p> There we have all the individual components of a patio and an explanation of them . The sequence of events is that first we establish whether its necessary to put in a hardcore or scalping sub-base . We then excavate down to the correct level using the numbers we know . Start from the dpc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickness of the slab , say 38mm . Then the thickness of the mortar bed , 50mm . Then the hardcore if we need it , 150mm : This gives us a total depth , from the damp proof course of 388mm . We can dig a trench about 300 mm wide along the house wall to that depth using a spirit level to keep the base level all the way along . <p> Dig a trench and put a peg in <p> Level pegs along trench <p> Pegs all over garden <p> The image above shows the trench along the house wall . In the centre of this trench we bang in a small wooden peg and leave it 25mm proud of the bottom . Using a spirit level we bang in more pegs , about a metre apart , all along the trench so we know our trench is level as each peg should be showing about 25mm above the ground . Now we start excavating away from the house banging in pegs every 1 metre and using the spirit level to identify a slope of 15mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a patio . <p> Spirit level <p> A little trick of the trade for getting this slope or fall easily ( as you will be using it when you lay the slabs also ) is to set up two pegs 1m apart . The required fall over 1 metre is ( 15mm divided by 1.5m = 10mm ) 10mm so set the pegs level and then bang one down 10mm . Put the spirit level across them now and note where the back of the bubble comes to on the level . You can see from the image above that our bubble is up against the black increment line on the level . This would be easy to use as every peg we banged in we know that if the bubble is on the back line we have the same fall or slope . <p> If yours does not work out quite so simplistically , just stick a piece of electrical tape or masking tape in the place where the bubble shows a fall of 10mm per metre . <p> Once the area is dug out we can start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall of the house , but as said before , 100mm away from the actual wall . This line of slabs needs to be level . Lay your bed as shown below . Although we never use it we have shown the dot and dab method also . <p> The bed will be approximately 50mm thick but there is no need to get it flat and smooth before laying the slab down . The bed should maintain an average thickness of 50mm but should be almost ploughed in its finished appearance . Just the same as the mortar bed when you are laying bricks . <p> Laying a bed of sand and cement <p> Dropping a slab onto the bed <p> Dot and Dab <p> Laying the bed this way allows the high spots to be flattened out when the slab is laid down and allows some flexibility when the slab is tapped down to the correct level with the handle of a lump hammer . Never hit a paving slab with metal to level it . Either use a rubber paving mallet or hold the metal end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lay each slab to level along the house and leave a gap of about 12 - 15mm between each slab . This is the optimum gap for making absolutely sure you can point the joints well . Any larger and they may crack , any smaller and it will be hard to get the mortar into the gap . See our project here on pointing paving slabs and repointing a patio for more on this . <p> When this row is laid you can now start moving down the garden . No pro uses a string line because a ) patio laying , unlike brickwork , is not an exact science . The patio slabs are never exactly the same thickness , they are never 100% square , and they are never exactly the same size either . <p> Use your level on the top of the slabs to get the correct fall . Use your level , on its side , up against the edge of the slabs to get a straight line as can be seen in our project on laying bricks . Another reason a patio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being tripped over and in the end they get ripped out ! <p> Take your time laying the slabs . It would not matter how many words we write here , laying the base and the slabs is a matter of feel . You will get to the point where you know the bed of mortar is level and you will know how much to " plough " it about to get the slab to sink down to the correct level without too much banging . <p> 9 inch angle grinder for cutting slabs <p> Cutting disc for stone <p> Diamond tipped cutting disc <p> There will be obstacles in the garden , like manholes and coal sheds , that you need to cut slabs round . This can easily be done with a 9 inch or 225mm angle grinder . These can be hired from your local tool hire store . <p> Please wear all the appropriate safety equipment when using an disc cutter and check to make sure you are using stone cutting discs , not metal . It is a weird fact in the building world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be used for cutting metal , but a cutting discs for metal will not cut stone . If you have a lot of slabs to cut it is really worth getting a diamond cutting disc as they are so much quicker and do not wear out . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Advice on vapour barriers , insulation with battens , fixing and choosing plasterboard sheets , and battening against windows and doorways . <p> Battening a wall for plasterboard or dry lining is a great way of providing a little warmth and fighting condensation in a cold building . However , without adequate ventilation behind the board , condensation can still form on the cold wall as warm air passes through the plasterboard . This is one of the reasons for providing a vapour barrier behind the board , or better still , using plasterboard called vapour check plasterboard which has one side coated with a tin foil to stop Vapour passing through . For the complete insulation job we recommend using 25mm battens with 25mm of polystyrene insulation slabs ( called Batts ) packed in between the battens . There should be nowhere for air to settle on a colder surface , even in between the batts as Interstitial condensation ( condensation forming in small gaps ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check board used . See our project on types of plasterboards . <p> Battening for plasterboard <p> The battening itself is a pretty straight forward operation but for novices we do not recommend using full size sheets of plasterboard . Plasterboard can be bought in smaller , more manageable sheets of 1.220m long by 600mm wide . These are called plasterboard laths . See our project on fixing to masonry to see how to hold the battens and drill for plugging and screwing . There is a section in the project specifically for fixing timber battens . <p> The battens must be placed at sensible distances apart . Plasterboard comes in two thicknesses and we recommend you use the 12.5mm thickness for this job . The battens need to be as close to 400mm apart as possible allowing for the fact that you need the end of a plaster lath to fall on the centre of a batten so the next board can share the same batten . You can see more about this on our partition walls project . If the plasterboard lath is 1.22 metres from edge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measurement to the last batten needs to be made from the left hand edge of the first batten to the centre of the last batten . To fix the next batten , the measurement needs to be from the centre of the last batten , to the centre of the next until you cut the last board into the opposite wall where the batten , once again sits in the corner of the walls . <p> Plasterboard lath <p> Battens on wall <p> Battens in the corners of the room must follow the wall . If the wall is out of plumb , then the batten must go up out of plumb . It is important the very edge of the plasterboard is fixed and this can only be achieved if the battening goes right into the corner . It is also important that battens not in corners are fixed absolutely upright . So the first batten to be fixed is not the batten in the corner , but a batten about 1.1m away from the corner . This batten can be fixed plumb and then the next batten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next one 400mm from that , towards the corner can be fixed plumb too . The plasterboard can then be cut to the shape of the wall where it is not plumb but you will be able to carry on round the room knowing the other boards will be square . <p> Battens against windows , doorways etc should be fixed right on the edge as you can see from the image of the battens on a concrete lintel . There should never be any part of the edge of a piece of plasterboard without a batten underneath it . If edges are left loose and " flapping " about in the breeze they will quickly become damaged and the plaster will soon vibrate off them . <p> Battens on lintel <p> In the corner of a room two battens will need to butt up against each other to take the boards from either side and if you think that any part of your battening may not be strong enough then put more screws in now .

Do not take chances , get it right the first time . <p> Wall battening nearly done <p> In the building trade we only get paid for doing a job once . If it is n't right the first time , we have to do it again the second time .... For nothing ! You soon get used to the idea that its much better to spend a little longer on it and to get it right at the beginning . <p> You will also need to run a batten along the top of the room to stop the edges up there being loose and the same at the bottom . We suggest two , or even three battens at the bottom as this will make it much easier to put the skirting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , we have staggered the plasterboard joints . This is the same as laying bricks . It is not good to have one joint directly above another as it can easily lead to cracking when the plaster goes on .

Sealing the surface with PVA slows down this moisture absorption and allows the plaster to remain workable for longer . <p> PVA can simply be painted onto any surface , but as it is water based and needs to be absorbed , it will not stick two nonabsorbent surfaces together . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Synthetic rubber is made into a waffle-like texture with air pockets to form a flexible and durable material . There are usually three to five grades of this type of underlay available , from lightweight to luxury , so you can choose whichever is most suitable for your room and budget . <p> Crumb Rubber Underlay <p> Crumb rubber underlay is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from recycled car tyres .

These specialist products allow air to circulate , and have a low tog rating so that the heat can penetrate through . <h> Preparing the Floor for Carpet Underlay <p> Make sure the floor is completely clean before you start , and check to see that there are no nails or staples sticking up if the room was previously carpeted . Sweep and vacuum to get rid of dust and bits that could cause lumps .

Lay the strips in the opposite direction to the floorboards . If you are using rubber underlay , it should be face-down so the rubber is against the floor and the backing faces up . Foam underlay should also be face-down , with the coloured film on the floor and the backing face up . <p> Cut the underlay into doorways and any other recesses .

We show you how to repair joist ends , carrier beams and wall plates with out the need to remove them . <p> Damp and timber joists do not mix well . In fact damp and any kind of structural timber , be it roof trusses , floor joists , doorframes , window frames and sills make for ( largely ) one or more of three types of real damage . <p> We look closely at wet rot and its causes and effects , the lasting damage of dry rot and how insect attack from woodworm and other wood boring beetles can severely compromise the structural ( and other ) timbers in the home . <h> Damage to Timber Joists and Floors <p> There are three main types of timber damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timber will start to decay at above 18% moisture content ( in average softwood species , like an ordinary Pine ) , so elimination of dampness is our main concern . 18% dampness means nearly one-fifth of the timber is damp and this can happen purely as a result of condensation , leaking roofs , rising damp and other forms of exposure to moisture . <p> Timber in the home should be inspected periodically to make sure it is not exposed to any of these problems . <h> Types of Damage to Structural Timber <p> Wet Rot <p> When an area , or section is exposed to water , taking it 's moisture content above 18% , fungus or mycelium can start to " feed " off the timber and grow into and from the wood . <p> There are many types of fungus that make up the wet rot category , they include Coniophora Puteana and Poria Vaillantii with Coniophora being the main culprit . The fungus feeds off the wood making it soft and spongy . <p> Wet rot is often first noticed when floors , especially ground-floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wet-rot are . <p> Unpainted and untreated timber exposed to water from roof <p> Condensation water arising from lack of ventilation to roof or floor timbers especially with hollow floors .

The causes of the damp can still be the same but the insect attack will be fairly local .

Wall plates can be affected also . <p> If there is little or no ventilation in the damp area , the moisture will not have the chance to evaporate and the timber will develop fungus as explained above therefore any repair or treatment must include attention to the Air Bricks or other ventilation ( See our project covering air bricks and vents ) . <p> A new piece of timber is cut ( A ) to replace the damaged piece and the joists plates are positioned ether side of the joists with the end of the joist plate right up against the edge of the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearer ( A ) . <p> The joist plate is bolted to the timber making the joint ( B ) as strong as the original joist . The length of the joist plate on the original side of the joist ( C ) is usually at least twice that of the piece that replaces the damaged section ( A ) . <h> Treating Joist Ends <p> As well as a joist plate , if required , the end grain cut ( A ) and the support area should be thoroughly treated with Boron Ultra Gel and a piece of damp proofing material , such as DPC plastic should then be placed underneath , to prevent damp from finding its way from the wall into your new timber . Use pre-treated timber if possible . <p> The Boron Gel is diluted with water to create a 5% solution and painted on the ends , and joints of timber . This then provides a barrier to prevent attack from woodworm and also will fend off dry rot . <p> Applying Boron gel by brush to new or damaged timber <h> Providing Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air bricks these allow the flow of air either in roof spaces or under suspended floors and prevent the build-up damp and moisture . When it comes to air bricks on the outside wall of your property you should ensure that there is at least one brick per 2.25 meters of outside wall length . <p> You will also have to ensure that any outside ground is significantly below any air bricks as if not , this may restrict air flow and damp issues may result . <p> To these ends , ensure that air bricks are clear from soil build-up , pathways or tarmac and other obstructions . <h> Repairing Carrier Beams and Support Beams <p> Carrier or support beams are normally larger timbers than joists and in respect to this , it might not be possible to use the joist repair plate system previously mentioned . <p> Carrier and support beams are usually ( these days ) installed as steel RSJs but in older properties or barn conversions these may well be existing timbers or indeed new , very large timbers , to maintain the integrity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may also be certain conservation rules that stipulate that any repairs should maintain an existing look . <p> If timbers are larger than 10 x 2 inches ( or 250mm x 50mm ) then the most suitable repair will be to use a Timber-Resin Splice . <p> This system normally comes in the form of a kit for easy use and provides a new piece of timber ( D ) , with zinc plated high tensile metal bars or rods ( E ) . <p> Using resin bonded bars to repair joists and rafters <p> These high tensile bars will be pre-bonded into one end of the timber beam , ready for you to fit using the resins provided in the kit . <p> The basis of this repair method involves firstly supporting the timber so that the load weight is taken off the supporting point and the weight from the above floor or roof is stable and then the damaged section of timber is cut off far enough along the length of the timber so that only undamaged timber is left .

Again , be cautious when scraping as you do n't want to damage any underlying surfaces . <p> When removing cork tiles , the first task is to lever up a corner so that you can get your scraper underneath . Using a hobby knife score down the join between two tiles so that you can wiggle the scraper into the gap . <p> Use a hobby knife to score down the joint between the tiles <p> Starting at a corner , lift it slightly using the scraper pushing the scraper is as you go to lever more of the tile off the surface . <p> Use your scraper to lever up a corner of the cork tile <p> If you are working on a floor a great tool to use is a floor scraper . Normally these will feature a long handle so that you can stand up while scraping and avoid the inevitable knee-pain due to kneeling all day . If you have no choice but to use a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest on something with some padding . <p> If you have a large floor area to clear it might be worth getting in a mechanical floor scraper . These can be rented from most hire shops and will save you hours for the sake of a few quid . <p> Mechanical floor scrapers can be rented from your local hire shop <p> If the tiles have been down for some time you may find that the adhesive has actually deteriorated quite a bit so the tiles come up easier the more you work at them . When old , it tends to turn a little brittle and crack off as the tiles are levered up . This is fine when taking the tiles up but makes things trickier when it comes to getting the adhesive residue off the surface afterwards . <p> If you encounter a particularly stubborn patch of glue then you have a couple of choices : <p> Hammer and Bolster : Holding the bolster at around a 15 - angle to the floor or wall surface , gently tap on the striking plate with the hammer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short taps to work the blade of the bolster into the adhesive to loosen it . Make sure that the corners of the bolster do not dig into the surface below and cause any damage <p> Lump or club hammer and bolster <p> Hair Dryer : Instead of the hammer and bolster that can be a bit heavy-handed you can use a hair dryer . Turn the dryer up to it 's highest setting and gently wave it from side to side over the surface of the tile , heating it through . Ensure that the end of the dryer is around 3 - 4 inches from the surface of the tile as to not dwell too long in one place . Do this for about 5 minutes and then try the adhesive again . If it 's still quite solid you will need to reheat for a while longer . Ensure that you do not overheat your drier of the surface you are working on <p> Standard domestic hairdryer <p> Heat Gun : This is pretty much the same process as the one outlined above except that heat guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryer so you will need to hold it around 6 - 8 inches from the surface you are working on . Evenly heat the area for a few minutes and then get stuck in with the scraper . If it 's stil quite solid reheat for a minute or so and try again <p> Hot air or heat gun <p> Wallpaper Steamer : Success using this tool will depend on the type of adhesive that has been used . If it 's a particularly strong adhesive then you might not achieve the amount of heat required . On weaker glues the moisture generated may be enough to loosen the adhesive allowing you to lift the tile . Take care when working on plastered surfaces as you do n't want to saturate the surface too much and damage the plaster . For more information on using a wallpaper steamer check out our project <p> Continue to work your way around your wall or floor surface a tile at a time . As you lever the tiles up you may find it easier to break off the sections that you have removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stuck to the surface . This way you can also keep an eye on where you are working and make sure that you are not causing damage to any surfaces . <p> Once all the tiles are up and in a bin bag sweep or brush over the surface to remove any final debris . <p> Unfortunately we 're not quite done yet . If you used a heating device such as one of those mentioned above you may have been lucky enough to have taken most of the adhesive residue off along with the tiles . If not , then this will now need to be removed . <h> How to Remove Adhesive from Walls and Floors <p> The only method we have found which successfully removes most ( not all ) adhesives is to warm it gently with a hot air gun or hair dryer . A wallpaper steamer will be of little use here . <p> Working in small areas at a time , take your heat gun or hair dryer and heat over the surface of the adhesive , waving your chosen heating tool from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . <p> When the adhesive starts to go soft you can get stuck in with the scraper . Using the same short-thrusting motion as you used to life the tiles up , scrape the adhesive off , periodically reheating it to keep it supple and workable . <p> Adhesive goes stringy and supple when heated and softened <p> If it cools down it will start to go solid again in which case you will need to stop and spend a few minutes heating it back up . <p> In quite a short space of time you will get quite a buildup of adhesive residue on your scraper so an old cloth will come in handy to wipe it off as eventually if too much is allowed to build up you will just end up spreading it back over the surface again . <p> Work your way over the entire area until all traces of the adhesive have been removed . <h> Removing the Remaining Adhesive Residue <p> Once the adhesive has gone , regrettably there is still more to do ! <p> You will still have a small residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't as bad as the previous tasks above . <p> In most cases this can usually be removed by rubbing quite hard with a cloth , or green scouring pad , dipped in solvent thinners . The thinners will help to dissolve the remaining adhesive that can then be rubbed off with a cloth leaving you with a clear surface . You may need to repeat this several times to ensure that you get all the residue off . <p> Thinners can be bought from most DIY sheds but one point to note is that you should check the manufacturers specifications on exactly what surfaces it is safe to use on as the thinners itself may cause damage to some surfaces it 's applied to . <p> After every trace of the tiles and adhesive are gone , have a good sweep up and then wash the floor over with a warm water and washing up liquid solution then leave to air dry and you 're done ! <p> Make sure you wear sturdy gloves for this job ! Not only to protect your hands from the adhesive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heat gun ( if you use one ) . Safety specs are also a good idea as you are using solvents also old cloths as it is a mucky job ! <p> Now that you know how to remove cork tiles from a floor or walls surface you can also apply the same principles to removing carpet tiles , vinyl tiles and other flooring types that are typically glued down . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

More traditional and cottage-style kitchens look best in older properties . <p> Choose kitchen tiles and paint for the walls that complement or contrast with the colour of the units . <p> Choose flooring and floor tiles that echo the colours in the kitchen worktops for a consistent design effect . <p> Kitchen sinks come in many shapes and designs and you should consider whether you need a single or double sink and the different effect that you will get from choices between ceramic , stainless steel or moulded sinks . <p> Small changes to design elements can make your room more personal to you . Choose kitchen taps and the handles for your kitchen units carefully as these can make all the difference to your overall design . <h> Skills Required to Fit Your Own Kitchen <p> Fitting a kitchen yourself does require a great deal of skill , to get it looking right and to make sure it lasts for years . This is because kitchens have to deal with heat as well as damp and humid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the heaviest wear in the house . <p> Fitting the kitchen to a professional finish is important to the look and style of the room , but also to ensure that the materials used are working to their best advantage in what is after all the heart of the home . For this reason fitting a new kitchen is a project most suited to the more advanced DIYer . <p> There are a wide range of skills involved , and you will need to have knowledge in the following trades ; Carpentry , Plumbing , Electrical and Tiling . <h> Safety First <p> There are many safety factors involved in fitting a kitchen . The kitchen is a potentially dangerous mix of electricity and water plus many kitchens also have a gas supply . <p> Drilling Holes <p> If you need to drill holes in the walls or floor you must always check for electrical cables and water pipes , using a pipe and power detector . You will find examples of these in our shop . <p> Pipe , Cable and Stud Detectors are available in our DIY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls . This is very useful for when you want to make sure you have a solid fixing for attaching kitchen units to the wall , especially wall units . If you do not have a solid anchor to a stable surface then whenever you put weight on the fixing it will be at risk to giving way . <p> Think how much weight is on a wall unit filled with plates or mugs and then think about how strong a wall fixing directly into a stud or solid wall would be when compared to fixings into a plasterboard wall . You get the point . <p> If you have to fix to plasterboard make sure you use special plasterboard fixings . <p> Specialist Plasterboard Fixings will make Wall Units more secure <p> Using Power Tools to Fit a Kitchen <p> You will want to use power tools when fitting a kitchen to make the job quicker and easier . These can be tools that you already own , or that you buy or hire especially for the job . However , when using power tools in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An RCD ( Residual Current Device ) is a safety device which will cut off the electrical supply to the power tool if you accidentally damage the cable or get the equipment wet , which could risk electrocuting you . For more information on RCD protection devices go to our Cables and Fuses Project . <p> Use an RCD to protect against Electric Shock when using power tools in damp conditions <p> Check Your Tools <p> Always check that all power tools and leads are in good condition . If you notice damage to the tools or their electric leads do not use them until they are professionally repaired , or replace them . <p> Safety Equipment <p> You should also always wear safety equipment that is appropriate to the task you are completing .

These can be altered but it will be cheaper to keep them in their existing locations if possible . <p> Take note of the sizes of appliances that you want to fit in your new kitchen and what units will be required to fit them <p> Make a note of any kitchen appliance or furniture that you already have , or that you feel is a ' must have ' item in your new kitchen . Have accurate measurements of these appliances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design . <p> Think about the sizes of kitchen cabinets you will need for the equipment , utensils and appliances you own or want to put into the units . <p> Points to Note <p> Be careful to check the following : <p> Take the ceiling height at several points ; to be sure there are no differences in heights around the room . If there are then you will need to allow for these discrepancies in your plan <p> Ensure the kitchen is square by measuring diagonally ( or compare opposing walls ) . If it is not square you will need to adjust worktops , and you may have to cut down kitchen unit , accordingly <p> Carefully mark the location of existing power points , plumbing , gas supply , air vents and any permanent features such as windows , sills , radiators and boilers <p> Always check dimensions , if in doubt measure it again <p> Note the space required for your kitchen appliances <p> Finally check what the walls are made of to ensure that you buy the correct fixings for your units <h> Planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that revolves around your needs . Creating a tight ' work triangle ' between your cooker , sink and fridge will make a better working environment . This work triangle is simply the distance between the most regularly used areas of your kitchen " the cooker ( or oven and hob ) the sink and the fridge . We also suggest you carefully consider the location of the bin ( and recycling ) as this is also one of the most used sections of the kitchen , but is often overlooked . Well it is n't very glamorous is it ? <p> You should also have sufficient work areas around each of these work areas to allow you to put down hot items removed from the oven or hob , to pile up dirty dishes ready for washing up , to drain clean dishes and enough space for food preparation . In smaller kitchens you will probably have to make these areas multi-purpose , but try to think about how one person will move around the room , and then how two or more people will use the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's way as one person is washing up and another is making a cup of tea , for instance . <p> Planning fitted kitchens this way ensures that your workspace is never cramped , allowing you to move freely between appliances . The layout you choose will depend on the size and shape of your room - and the position of windows and doors . Plumbing and electrical points can usually be moved , so do not let these restrict your design . <p> Design Layouts <p> Most kitchens fall into four basic designs : <p> a single line of units <p> a double line of units also called a galley kitchen <p> an L " shaped kitchen <p> a U " shaped kitchen <p> Larger kitchens may also feature an island unit , and/or an eating area or breakfast bar . <p> By combining kitchen cabinets imaginatively within these designs , it is easy to totally transform your kitchen to suit your lifestyle . <p> Cooker hoods for disbursing steam and smells <h> Working out the Details for Your Kitchen <p> Designing a kitchen can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don'ts to help you avoid some common mistakes we have come across . <p> The following list of dos are advice that will help to reduce the work and keep costs down as well as ensure your safety when fitting kitchen units and later when using the kitchen . <p> If you are using paper to plan then cut out the units on the plan you have drawn and copy them across to another outline plan .

Be sure to empty all the cupboards and clear all worktops . Turn off the kitchen electricity at the main fuse board . <p> Turn off the water supply at the mains " make sure you fill the kettle first ! Then disconnect all lines to the sink and drains . Next , disconnect any appliances . <h> Removing Old Cabinets <p> Wear safety gloves and goggles when removing the cabinets " two people will be required to remove the wall cabinets . <p> First remove all the drawers and doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath to locate the attachments to the base cabinets . Remove any screws and fasteners and ease the worktop off . If it has been glued down , you may need to use a crow bar to pull the worktop off " remember to protect the wall by putting a piece of waste wood between the wall and the crowbar . <p> Now you simply have to unscrew the cabinets , detach them and clear the kitchen . <p> If your walls are in good condition you can now apply a first coat of paint . <p> Now is also the time to lay new flooring , for boxing in pipes and getting any professional help such as an electrician or plumber should also be considered at this stage . <p> Contemporary kitchen tap <h> Installing Your New Kitchen <p> Starting in the corner where you plan to begin your installation , use your spirit level to ascertain if the floor is level . <p> If the floor is not level mark where the highest point of the floor is on ' wall 1 ' . <p> From this mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top of your base cabinets . This measurement includes 150mm to allow for plinths and legs . <p> Then use a spirit level , or laser level , to make a level line for the top of the base cabinets . If you are using a spirit level you will find it more effective to use a longer level , we would recommend a metre or longer for accurate measurements . <p> Use a Spirit Level to Ensure your Kitchen Units are Level <p> Next you should decide where you want your wall units on the wall " mark level lines for the top and bottom of the wall cabinets at the right height for you . <p> Double check your level lines to make sure they are straight and level . This will ensure that your cabinets are straight , even if your walls are not . <h> Cabinet Assembly <p> Although the units are easy to put together , do read the assembly instructions before you start work as you 'll be more familiar with the task in hand . <p> Hints and Tips <p> Clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not attempt to lift or carry boxes alone <p> Open one box at a time and assemble each cabinet before moving on to the next <p> Avoid scratching surfaces by assembling on a carpet or on an empty cardboard box <p> Match each assembled cabinet to the corresponding door by sticking on masking tape and then numbering <p> Fit the wall units before you fit the base units <h> Installing Wall Cabinets <p> When fitting kitchen wall units work methodically , starting with a corner cabinet and working out in both directions . <p> Make sure someone is there to assist you , to steady the cabinets while you check levels and fixings . <p> Hints and Tips <p> Make sure the wall unit is pulled out from the corner to match your layout plans and template lines <p> On plasterboard walls , use cavity wall fixings to attach cabinets if the fixing positions do not coincide with wall studs . Alternatively you can fix battens to the wall fixing to the studs behind and then use these to fix the wall units to <p> Check adjoining wall cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet . Fix the bracket to the wall , hang the cabinet and then adjust the screws that affix to the bracket to ensure it is level and as close to the wall as is possible . Your spirit level is essential ! <h> Installing Base Cabinets <p> Begin in the same corner as you did when fitting kitchen wall units earlier . Make sure the cabinet matches your plan " and is correctly positioned in relation to the wall cabinet above . <p> Once again , you need to make sure that the first cabinet is level , even if your floor is n't . Follow the marking lines . <p> Leave the doors and shelves until last , as it is much easier to adjust an empty unit ! <p> Before affixing the base cabinet to the wall , rotate the legs to adjust the height , making sure all the units are level . Once the height matches the marking line , the other units , and is level in all directions , then use the appropriate fittings to secure cabinet to the wall . <p> Hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the levels of any adjoining cabinets are checked <p> Drill holes for pipes before installing the sink cabinet <p> Kitchen base units with fitted cooker <h> Fitting Kitchen Worktops <p> If the kitchen is fitted with three worktops i.e. one at the end and the other two running at right angles to it in a ' U ' shape , you will need to install the end one first . <p> Measure the distance from one end to the other end of the cabinets and cut the worktop to the required length . You may want to cut the kitchen worktops flush with the edge of your unit , or you may want a slight overlap ( space allowing ) . <p> If the end is butting up to walls at either end you will need to allow for any defects in the walls , or awkward angles . If in doubt cut a template of any odd shapes . <p> If you are using Formica worktops , seal all worktop edges with PVA then , if you are using them , fit joining strips to the worktops using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worktops . <p> When all the kitchen worktops are cut , position them on the base units and check that they all fit . Make any adjustments to ensure that all joints are tight fitting and flush . <p> Fix the worktops down using suitably sized woodscrews and check the joints to make certain they are level and square . <p> Fitting Kitchen Worktops is easy once they are cut to size and shape <h> Installing an Inset Sink and Taps <p> The tools you require and the amount of plumbing needed will vary depending on the type of sink and taps you have chosen . <p> Start by carefully measuring and marking out the sink outline " a template is usually provided with the sink . NB . Remember you 're not usually measuring out to the full width/length of the sink as a lip around it will hold it in place . Once marked out , carefully cut out the hole with a jigsaw . <p> With the sink on its face , seal around the rim and then fit the securing clips to the sink " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now is the time to fit your taps , following the instructions you receive in the packaging . <p> Mixer taps are the best choice for kitchen taps . Pick a style that is easy to turn on and off with messy fingers . <p> Mixer Tap Tips <p> Look to see whether the hot pipe is on the left as you look at the sink <p> When undoing the cap nuts of each connector and you 've slipped the nut and olive onto each pipe , use a spring-clip clothes-peg below each pipe to stop them slipping off . <p> Read and fully understand the instructions before you start <p> You might also want to consider buying a tap that has a hose option for rinsing utensils and the sink area <p> There are taps that deliver filtered water , and even boiling water taps so you can make hot drinks directly from the tap or use boiling water for sterilising and cooking without having to wait for water to boil .

@@41624769 @1624769/ <p> Summary : Thinking of changing your cast iron radiator for a modern steel or aluminium radiator ? Find out all about their advantages and disadvantages , from efficiency to installation . Although cast iron radiators tend to be more expensive than modern steel or aluminium they do have several advantages including the heat output compared to their size , their ability to blend with surroundings , especially within period properties and also the fact that they can be customised to provide a more modern look and feel . <p> With the re-emergence of the cast iron radiator over the past few years the choice between installing cast or modern steel radiators raises some interesting questions and points of thought . <p> The use of Cast iron is definitely an old idea but when compared to the other options available ( e.g. steel and aluminium ) they are still more than a worthy contender , proving still to be the best on several fronts from efficiency to aesthetics . <h> Period Renovations <p> For period renovations such as barn , church or warehouse conversions and extensions the cast iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these buildings and provide sufficient heat output to heat these spaces comfortably . <p> Traditional cast iron radiator in a period renovation <p> You might be thinking " why would that be ? " Cast iron is an excellent conductor of heat and therefore works far better in larger spaces with taller ceilings . Although they do tend to take quite a bit longer to heat up due to the density of cast iron as a material , once at temperature they retain that heat much longer than any other radiator type . <h> Space vs heat output of Cast Iron Radiators <p> When considering the space a radiator will take up versus it 's heat output - a cast iron radiator will take up much less wall space than it 's equivalent modern steel or aluminium counterpart . <p> When thinking about this , in order to get the best out of a modern radiator ( or any radiator for that matter ) it needs to be in contact with the air within a room in order to heat it and in order to do so needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When you look at wall space within the majority of houses these central , accessible walls tend to be " premium areas " where you want to put things like sofa 's , TV 's , beds , cupboards etc .... and if you have a bed or a sofa in front of a radiator it 's not going to heat a room space efficiently as it will be pumping all it 's heat into the item that 's covering it and not into heating the room , wasting you money on heating costs and still leaving you with a cold room . <p> So when thinking along these lines , if you can have a radiator that is smaller and not only provides the equivalent heat output of one of it 's modern counterparts but can also become a feature of the room itself , as let 's face it the modern radiator is not exactly one of the most attractive items in the world , a cast iron radiator could tick 2 boxes in this case . <h> Customising Cast Iron Radiators <p> In many cases cast iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat output requirements , colour and in many cases also design for each room space and with many companies now emerging into this market , most offer a quick turn around in terms of construction and delivery , many within 7 days of order and ready for installation . <p> Pink customised cast iron radiator <p> The above is not so easy with the more modern radiator as most are available in a set number of sizes and in terms of colours , you can re-paint , but the finish is not amasing unless you get them sprayed which again comes at an additional cost . <h> Heating pros and Cons of Cast Iron Radiators <p> Cast iron radiators have thicker walls than conventional steel or aluminium panel radiators , and they also heat up slowly , which in some respects can be a bit of a disadvantage if you are wanting to heat a space quickly but as mentioned above they do hold heat far longer , giving you more of a consistent and ambient heat output that also lasts a lot longer once a heating system is switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , steel and aluminium radiators will almost certainly heat a room much quicker than a cast iron radiator as they tend to give a quick blast of heat but as they also lose temperature very quickly your heating pump and boiler have to work quite a bit harder to keep your property at temperature whereas with a cast iron radiator , they retain heat for much longer and do n't put so much strain on your heating system components . <h> Cast Iron Radiators and Green Heating Systems <p> Cast iron radiators are very efficient when coupled with natural heat sources such as Air Source and Ground Source Heat Pumps due to their excellent heat conductivity . <p> Taking ground source heat as an example , due to the density and conductivity of cast iron as a material , the heat that is transferred from the ground is held for much longer than their more modern steel counterparts , so when the water completes a circuit of heat transfer from the ground and into the property , a cast iron radiator will retain a fair amount of heat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump has less work to do <p> Due to the conductivity of cast iron , the heat transferred into your room is much better at keeping them at a consistent temperature giving you a more efficient and comfortable heat . <h> What Does all the Above Mean ? <p> Originally , cast iron radiators were seen as the most efficient radiator for period homes only , however as we have all become more environmentally aware in the past few years , with efficiency being an ever increasing important factor to consider , the cast iron radiator has enjoyed a major revival in popularity and has become a desirable feature taking pride of place in living areas within both the modern and period homes due to their efficiency , especially when coupled with environmentally friendly heating systems . <p> Many contemporary homes today are also choosing cast iron as opposed to modern steel as they are both installed in the same manner , they are also space saving , beautiful to look at and last far longer than the majority of their more modern equivalents . <p> Cast iron radiator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well chosen colour scheme , can add dimension to a modern room and provide an attractive focal point . <p> As cast iron radiators are still quite a re-emerging product , in most cases they are going to be more expensive that your standard steel or aluminium panel radiator but when you consider the possibilities of efficiency and the money that can be saved and their longevity , cast iron radiators should always be a consideration . <p> With period renovations the cast iron radiator comes in a choice of different period styles befitting the Edwardian , Victorian , Regency or Art Deco home , unfortunately the modern steel radiator tends only to compliment the contemporary setting . <p> Reputable cast iron radiator companies are now offering paint effects to enhance their beauty such as antiquing and high lighting detail to compliment historical room decor . <p> The mindset that cast iron radiators are old school and inefficient is rapidly diminishing as today 's market is increasingly understanding and experiencing their efficiency and beauty . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624770 @1624770/ <p> Summary : In this DIY guide our experts show you how to fit a soil and vent pipe and how to change a cast iron soil and vent pipe for plastic piping . Also covered is the process for joining plastic soil pipes to clay soil pipes when fitting a new soil and vent toilet waste pipe . We also show you how to reposition the new pipework including drilling new holes using a diamond core bit . <p> Joining new plastic toilet connections to old cast iron waste pipes when fitting a new soil and vent toilet waste pipe is a very common problem encountered by DIY enthusiasts . The difference in the pipe diameters and the rigidity of cast iron soil and vent pipes makes it very difficult to cut into them to add a new toilet or even the waste pipe from a wash basin or shower . <p> Although cast iron pipes can be drilled to accept a new waste pipe and can also be ground down to accept a 100mm waste pipe collar , it is ultimately cheaper , in most circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and vent system . <p> This is a long and detailed project divided into two parts and covers the fitting of the external waste pipework necessary for fitting a new toilet or to move a toilet . The work required to fit 32 or 40mm solvent cement waste pipes for hand basins , sinks and shower waste pipes can be seen by clicking here and Part 2 of the project can be seen by clicking here . <p> Full plastic soil and vent system converted from old cast iron pipework <h> Remove the Existing Cast Iron Soil and Vent Pipe <p> The first thing that needs to be done is to remove the existing soil and vent pipe . Do not do this until you have either drawn a diagram of where it went or taken a digital photograph . Later on you will see that it is important to put things back where they were as they will have been installed to building regulations and , unless a complete revamp is required the position should not be altered too much . Although we did not photograph the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical SVP layout is fitted . <p> Just above the horizontal grey pipe you can see a couple of pink dots . This is where the old cast iron toilet waste came out of the building together with the waste pipe from the hand wash basin . A new bathroom has been created to the left of the old one , hence all the pipes need moving . <p> A cast iron soil and vent pipe is a very heavy thing ! Take great care when removing the old one and always wear safety gloves and goggles . <p> Very often the only way to remove an old pipe is by brute force and hitting the cast iron with a lump hammer will shatter it relatively easily but will create dangerous shards of iron . <p> There is a cast iron hopper to the left of the window in the picture above . This hopper collected the water from the old bath waste ( see the pink dot above the hopper ) . This was also removed later as a new bath waste was connected to the new plastic waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and vent pipes can be made of cement fibres which look very much like asbestos . If you have any doubts as to their origin contact your local council for advice . <h> Expose the Clay Drainage Pipe to the Main Man Hole <p> Break all the existing pipework down to ground level where , at some point under the surface you will see that the soil and vent pipe is connected to a clay pipe which will take it to the nearest foul drainage manhole . <p> Old clay pipe taking waste to man hole <p> In this instance the clay pipe was near the surface and by removing the old cast pipe the collar of the clay pipe broke off . It was necessary , as it probably will be with the job you undertake , to excavate around the clay pipe and give yourself plenty of room to cut the top of the pipe off square to allow a good connection to be made . <p> The walls of the old clay pipes and cast pipes are a lot thicker than the new plastic pipes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external diameter varies a great deal . <p> The external diameter of a new plastic drainage pipe is usually 110mm but the diameter of a cast iron and/or clay pipe can be up to 136mm . This is where the difficulty in joining the two arises but fortunately these days it is overcome quite easily . <h> Find the Start and End Points of Your new Plastic Soil and Vent Pipe <p> When fitting a new soil and vent pipe always work out where your start ( toilet ) and end ( ground connection ) points and draw out the system you intend to install on a piece of paper . This will allow you to work out how much pipe and what fittings you need . If you can see the finished job in your minds eye before you start it will be much easier to install . <h> Joining Your Plastic Piping to the Clay Drainage Pipe <p> Connector <p> This image above shows a flexible rubber connector . The principle is simple as you just slide the connector over both ends of each pipe and tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also flexible enough to allow for ground movement . <p> Joining pipes and connectors is not as easy as it sounds and the fittings for plastic pipes are made to be totally water , and in a lot of cases , air tight . This means they fit together very tightly and 99% of the time some lubricant is required to ease one part of the fitting into another . <p> Historically Fairy Liquid has been used as a lubricant for fitting pipes to pipe fittings but this has a habit of getting everywhere and making tools , hands and everything else very slippery . It is much better , when buying your pipes and fittings to buy a tube of pipe joint lubricant . Smear the lubricant on both sides of the work and it will slide home easily . <h> Dig Down and Expose the Clay Pipe and Fit Flexible Connector <p> Connection sleeve fitted to clay pipe <p> When you have dug down and cut off the clay pipe to the required height you can fit the flexible connection sleeve . Undo the top jubilee clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dropped in and tighten the bottom clip up as tight as it will go . <p> If you have to leave the clay pipe for any length of time because you need to go to the builders merchants , or even have your dinner , screw up a plastic bag with some newspaper in it to form a bung in the top of your pipe . If any debris is allowed to fall down into the pipe it will find its way into the manhole , or worse , to a bend before the manhole , where it will cause an obstruction which will later turn itself into a blocked pipe . <p> As we move up the wall making each fitting secure it is important that pipe brackets are fitted at regular intervals . We always fit brackets to vertical runs of pipe every two meters , and to horizontal runs , every meter . If there is a pipe fitting such as a bend or branch , a pipe bracket is always fitted either side of the fitting . It is much better to have too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ends of Cut Pipework for Easy Fitting <p> Chamferring off the end of the pipe <p> When a length of plastic soil pipe is cut the end is left fairly sharp and burred . It will not matter how much lubricant you put on the end of this , it will just rip out the rubber joint of the receiving collar . <p> To get around this issue the end of a cut pipe should be filed to a shallow chamfer to make sure the pipe slides easily into the joint . You can see from the image above we have used a 4 inch grinding wheel to create our chamfer but this can easily be done with a rasp file or even a sheet of rough sand paper . <p> Unfortunately when you do this kind of a job for a living time is of the essence so speed of work is very important ! . If you do use a grinder please make sure you have the correct safety equipment on and always use the grinder so the blade is throwing any waste away from your body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of pipe into the flexible sleeve connection and tighten the pipe bracket . This first , short section now forms the basis of all other connections as ultimately , this is where the whole system ends up . <p> You can see from the image below ( bottom ) we have now concreted in the connection and tightened the wall bracket to make sure our starting point is a solid place to work from . We try and get to this point at the end of a day so the concrete has a chance to go hard overnight . See our mixing concrete project for help on getting the right mix for this , and many other jobs . <p> Pipe fitted into sleeve <p> First length in and concreted <h> Completing the Rest of the Pipework for Your Soil and Vent System <p> From here on in it gets a little trickier as we have to join both ends ( top and bottom ) to make the system . It is now time to work out exactly where the pipes have got to get to and where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are , a new bathroom , with the toilet in a new position you will need to work out where you want the toilet and drill the hole for the new waste pipe . <p> This is best done with a 150mm diamond core drill bit and a heavy duty drill , both of which can be hired from your local tool hire centre . It will cost you about -40.00 for both tools for a days hire but you if you try to do this any other way you could be on this job alone for days . If a job is worth doing it is worth doing well and with the right equipment you will only have to do this once . If you try and make the hole by hand with a hammer and chisel you will wish you had not . <p> Hole in wall for toilet <p> Toilet put in place <h> Getting the Toilet in the Right Position <p> Put the back of the toilet to the wall and measure the distance between the toilet outlet and the wall . Now add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall to the outside surface and cut a piece of pipe that long . Chamfer both ends as described above . <p> Now slide on a 90 degree easy bend as seen in the below image and place the completed pipework into the hole in the wall . <p> As you can see , using a 150mm drill bit gives you a little room for maneuver which you will be grateful for later on . All of the existing holes on this job were temporarily filled with expanding foam to stop the cavity getting rain soaked and later we went back and replaced the holes with new , matching bricks .

Understand what causes freeze thaw damage to bricks and masonry so your can repair and prevent it happening again . <p> Most masonry , be it bricks , blocks or stone , has tiny fissures ( cracks ) in its composition . These cracks , however tiny , will fill with water when it is wet . As the weather gets colder this water freezes . Frozen water expands as it becomes ice and exerts a great deal of pressure within the crack . As the crack is already a weak point in the masonry , it expands a little under the pressure from the frozen water . When the water melts and runs away or evaporates , it leaves a slightly larger crack- which fills with water when it rains ......

Find out exactly how to damp proof walls using membranes or tanking and then how to cover them for plastering . <h> Help with Damp Walls in Garages <p> We have written this project with assistance from experts in this field Property Repair Systems . They man a completely free , no obligation advice line that you can call for specific advice on 01626 336180 , so if you want additional advice on how to treat damp walls give them a call . <p> As garage walls are almost certainly not built following the guidelines for building a wall of a habitable part of the house there are changes that need to be made to ensure that they are damp proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical cost and time saving measure there is no need to build to stringent regulations that do not need to be met . <p> Before we look at how to ensure your garage walls are dry before plastering we will run through the basic rules for a garage conversion . <p> It is unlikely you will want to keep all of the garage door opening and some of this will be filled with a new wall or windows or both . This may place additional load on the floor slab of the garage and , subsequently on the foundations of the garage itself . These foundations may have only been constructed to take the minimum weight of the garage as it stands and if any additional weight is to be placed on them the foundations may require strengthening . Please check with your local council ( you can find your local planning office here ) . <p> If your garage conversion contains a toilet the foundations should extend to below the lowest point of the drain run which removes the waste from the toilet . This is to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier garage load settles on the base you have provided . <p> An existing concrete garage floor slab can be used as a base for your new living area , however a membrane ( DPM damp proof membrane ) will need to be installed to stop water rising up through the slab . DPMs come in solid or liquid form , the latter being a better solution for garage conversion . More information about garage floors can be seen here <p> The garage floor will be below the level of your indoor floor slab . Thermal insulation may be required and can be placed on top of the membrane ( if a liquid membrane is used care should be taken to ensure the two materials do not react with each other - a separation layer may be needed ) . The exact details will vary depending on which products are used . Insulation should be used in the new floor to ensure the building meets the regulation requirements for heat loss in a conversion . <p> Any existing airbricks for the main house should not be obstructed by work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be locked they should be fitted with extensions to take trunking through any new floor so the original vent is still receiving outside air . <h> Getting Garage Walls Waterproof <p> In a great many cases the existing garage walls may only be 1 skin of brickwork thick . For any type of conversion to take place this will usually need to be upgraded to a cavity wall in order to meet the requirements for insulation in a habitable dwelling . This operation in itself will make the internal wall a lot dryer and may be all you need , internally , to solve the damp problem . <p> In many buildings , the garage is abutted to an outside wall of the house . Where this is the case this wall is usually quite damp . This is because , as an outside wall , water is driven against it many times over the course of it 's life . This water soaks into the external skin of the masonry and when it reaches the cavity it runs down to the ground . This is one of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your inside walls . <p> The water in the cavity can soak back through the wall as it runs down meaning that very often the wall , when it is inside the garage , is damp . With modern regulations a cavity tray dpc is inserted into the wall just above the roofline of any abutting buildings to prevent water running down the cavity and being allowed to manifest itself as damp inside the abutting building . The images below show how these cavity trays are installed . They can be fitted retrospectively . <p> With the cavity trays insertion , water is now directed from the cavity to the outside wall where it escapes through weep-holes , then it runs down the outside of the wall onto the garage roof , keeping the inside wall of the garage dry for plastering . <p> Cavity tray seen from inside cavity <p> Cavity trays over garage roof <h> Plastering the Damp Inside Walls of a Garage <p> Having made sure no more water can run down the inside walls of your garage it 's time to plaster or dry line them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out fully so there are special membranes and barriers that can be applied to the garage wall which will allow you to plaster or dryline them when they are still damp . <h> Wall Coverings and how to Keep the Walls Dry and Insulated <p> The main problem that you will be facing throughout the whole of this conversion process is trying to keep garage walls dry and insulated . There are two causes of these problems : <p> Cold outer walls ; These are usually single leaf and constructed of brick or block and as such they are susceptible to condensation and penetrating damp . You should address this using the steps that we have shown above <p> Cold party wall with the main house ; This particular wall will be partly outdoors and in all likelihood will not have cavity trays or weeps . Due to this it is likely to be cold and damp . Cavity trays need to be inserted to solve this situation . <h> Plastering a Damp Treated Garage Wall <p> Warning You will not be able to apply modern gypsum plasters to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally dry and feature no salt . However , if you do use such plasters it is pretty much certain that your inner decorated surface will suffer from damp patches . <p> There are three frequently used methods for plastering over walls inside garages that are going to be converted into a living space : <p> Air gap membranes Normally , these are dimpled in appearance and are usually fixed to a walls surface using specially manufactured sealed plastic plugs . Once fixed in place you can plaster directly over the surface , dot and dab fix plasterboard or batten and board with plasterboard sheets . If using battens , you will also be able to fix insulation between them for additional thermal efficiency <p> Plastering with sand and cement This form of render creates a semi-waterproof backing coat that provides a barrier between damp and salts and inner surfaces . If can be finished using multi-finish plaster and as a bonus it is also quite cheap !

This type of surface is ideally suited to irregular stone walls or walls that are loose or not easy to fix .

This can form damp patches in what is known as penetrating dampness . Alternatively , it can be that some areas of your wall are more exposed or more susceptible to letting water in , despite being sound , and this can also cause damp patches to form , or a large , uniformly damp area . This can spread to your internal walls too , resulting in patches of damp on your internal walls . <p> These patches might contain ' salts ' which have washed out of the brickwork and which form white , crunchy deposits which can erupt through your paint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cold spots ' on your wall , as damp patches on your wall lose heat 3 times faster than the surrounding wall . These cold spots can cause more moisture from your internal air to form condensation , making the area even damper and encouraging the development of black mould spots . <p> If your damp is affecting the lower area of your wall it may be being caused by Rising Damp rather than External Damp <p> Checking Your Wall for Faults <p> There are many reasons why your external brick walls might be getting damp , and not all of these problems can be solved by using a brick waterproofer . A waterproofer is usually only used as a solution for sound external walls that are exposed to enough rainfall that they just become damp if water is getting into the walls because of a fault of some kind , such as cracks in your bricks or pointing , then you will need to fix this before applying any waterproofer - in this case , once you have fixed the issue you can apply waterproofer as a preventative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why your masonry may have faults and each of these causes will have its own solution , which we will discuss here . There are a few checks that you can carry out to identify any places in your brickwork where water may be coming in , and also to identify the cause of these faults . <p> Check your external walls for any faults that may be letting damp in to your external walls <p> Rusted or Dirty Wall Ties <p> If you have cavity walls , there are ties between them securing the walls together and providing stability which can rust over time , causing them to expand and crack your brickwork and mortar . These cracks then allow water into the brickwork from outside , creating damp patches in your walls . Wall ties can become dirty when mortar is dropped onto them during the building process this is a problem because they can act as a bridge for damp that has accumulated in an external wall to travel across the cavity to the internal wall , again creating a damp or cold patch . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal detector on your outside wall wherever your damp issues are or wherever you can spot faulty brickwork . If you do find a wall tie near the affected area you can check its condition by removing the bricks from the external area near the tie ( do not remove more than two without consulting with a surveyor ) more information on how to remove these bricks is available in our Replacing a Brick project . Once you have removed your bricks , you can check your tie if it is rusted or dirty you can either clean it or replace it information on how to replace the tie is available on our Replacing a Wall Tie project . Once you have replaced your wall tie you can put your bricks back and repoint them guidance on how to do this is again available in our Replacing a Brick project linked above . <p> Check your wall ties for rusting and dirt as this may be allowing damp to travel through your walls <p> Cracks caused by spalling <p> As mentioned above , if a lot of water gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your brickwork to chip off , damaging your wall and making it more susceptible to further water ingress .

It is highly alkali resistant , is absorbed deeply into your brickwork and cures rapidly to form an effective water repellent layer .

@@41624779 @1624779/ <p> Cutting and fixing plasterboard to a variety surfaces is an important thing to learn in the DIY world . Plasterboard is such a versatile material it can be used in so many situations but lack of knowledge on how to cut and fix plasterboard stops many people using it in the first place . <p> Plasterboard can simply be sawn using an ordinary timber saw . The finer the teeth , the better and a cleaner edge is obtained with a fine toothed saw . There are proprietary saws available for cutting plasterboard and if you have a fairly large project to do we suggest you get one . Apart from anything else , plasterboard will blunt your wood saw in no time . Plasterboard saws can be bought from the tool store below . Sawing plasterboard is the best way to cut an opening , square or round , from the middle of a piece of plasterboard . <p> Drywall or plasterboard saw <p> Measure the opening you need to make carefully and mark it on the plasterboard with a pencil . Then take a plasterboard hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bang quickly into the board about 50mm inside one of the lines you have drawn . This will allow you to insert the blade of the plasterboard saw and start cutting around the lines of your opening . To tidy up any cuts you have made you can use a plasterboard plane or rasp such as the one shown below . <p> The best way to cut plasterboard in a straight line is to mark the line first with a pencil , then lay a spirit level , or other sort of metal straight edge , on the line . Hold the straight edge down firmly while you score along the line with a sharp hobby knife . You are not trying to cut all the way through the plasterboard , just deep enough to cut through the paper . About 3mm . <p> Plasterboard rasp <p> When the line is cut , stand the board up and bend or fold it away from the cut . You will soon see the board split very neatly along the line of the cut and as you fold it backwards you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the cut on the " complete " side of the board . Now simply run your blade down this crease to complete the parting of the two parts of the board . You can now use the rasp to neaten up the edges . <p> Plasterboard knife <p> Fixing plasterboard is done in 3 ways . It is either screwed , nailed or stuck . It can be stuck with adhesive ( The ultra strong construction adhesives are the best ) or it can be stuck using a mix of plaster . This method is most often called dot and dab and involves mixing a bucket of ( usually ) skim plaster to a fairly thick consistency , and placing dots or blobs of this plaster on the back of the board to be fixed . The board is then picked up and pushed against the surface it is to be fixed to . Skim plaster goes hard very quickly and also sticks incredibly well . This method is most often used to fix to masonry in situations such as dry lining . <p> Drywall screw <p> Screwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse biting thread which drives its way through the boards while keeping a good grip of them . Nailing plasterboard is traditionally the most popular way to fix the boards but the heavy hammering on one timber section can easily work another loose so Drywall screws are preferred by a lot of contractors these days . Plasterboard nails are always galvanised to protect against rust which could follow a good soaking by two or three layers of soaking wet plaster . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

For a full explanation as to why , please see our painting new plaster project . <p> To seal a surface before you hang wall paper the wall also needs to be totally dry . Information regarding this is also contained in the above project . <p> Sealing a surface for papering can be done using a solution refered to as a " Size " or " Sizing Solution " . If you go to your local diy shed or builders merchant and say you wish to seal a newly plastered wall for wallpapering and require a " size " or " sizing solution " then they should be able to point you in the right direction in terms of the products you will need . <p> Before you purchase make sure you read the manufacturers guidlines in detail and ensure that it is suitable for your wall surface . <p> Many of these types of sealer come in a gelatinous solution which is mixed with water and applied straight onto the wall and allowed to dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and for stiffening textiles . <p> Most can also be papered over while still wet but , with the addition of wallpapering paste it sometimes makes the wall too slippery to hang paper properly . <p> A dilution of the wallpaper paste you are going to use can also be used as a form of size to seal the wall . Most pastes will indicate quantities to use for a sizing solution mix on the packet but a rough guide is to use 25% more water in a sizing solution . In essence a size or sizing solution is a little similar to a " mist coat " when painting . <p> When you intend to apply a vinyl paper to the surface , it is best to prepare the walls by sizing with a dilution of a paste with a fungicide in it .

We will show you how to trun off your mains water and drain any excess , cut down your existing water main poly pipe to a more suitable size and what tool to use , what new MDPE fittings you should use and what pipework you should use to move the stock cock . <h> Where do I Find my Mains Stop-Cock ? <p> Most homes have the mains stop-cock in the kitchen . More often than not it is under the sink and usually only accessible after a mammoth clear out of a thousand different kinds of cleaning fluid and shoe brushes . <p> In older houses which have undergone many changes throughout the years , the stopcock may be found in the lounge or dining room which , once upon a time , was the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the stop cock or you may decide to have a complete change round in the kitchen .

But even before you do that you need to check that you do not share a mains connection with your neighbours . <p> If all is well , turn off the mains . Leave the stop cock open indoors for a while as you turn on all the downstairs taps and flush any downstairs loos .

You will find out about the most common types of timber used to construct a wooden garage door , what type of paint you should use to ensure a long lasting and protective finish , how to prepare the door before you paint it and what you should look out for when preparing it such as the presence of old lead-based paint , how to repair any rot and then how to prime it and apply the finishing top coat . Also find out about what order you should paint each section of a wooden garage door in . <p> As with any decorating project , the overall success of the job is all about the preparation before any finishing coats or coverings are applied . Painting a garage door , be it wood or metal , is no different . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last and not flake and fall off after a few years you have to prepare the surface correctly . A great finish will give your doors a new lease of life and let 's face it , it 's a lot cheaper than buying new doors ! <p> When it comes to the different types of door , the most common types are overhead opening wooden garage doors and side opening carriage-style doors . In essence , the techniques and processes used in their preparation and painting is very much the same . <p> For the purposes of this project we will be looking at preparing and painting swing open , carriage-style wooden garage doors as these tend to be the most popular type of door in the UK ( galvanised steel or aluminium being the overall most widely used ) . <p> Before we start - unpainted pair of wooden garage doors <h> Types of Wood used for Garage Doors <p> The type of wood used for your garage door can also vary quite a bit and this usually comes down to the cost . Each different wood has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases the wood used and its aesthetic features will be down to personal taste . <p> Some of the most common types of wood used are : <p> Cedar : This type of wood is generally used for its beautiful , natural looks and can come in two colours - red and white . A great bonus with this wood is that it has a natural resistance to insect attack and decay . It can be stained different colours to suit the property it will reside in but this will need to re-stained at least every other year <p> Mahogany : Due to the fact that this is a hardwood , Mahogany is an extremely strong and long-lasting wood with a beautiful , natural look . Because of this is is also very expensive so when it comes to garage doors it is usually used in combination with a softwood . It can be both painted and stained <p> Plywood : On the whole , plywood is a very popular and cost-effective wood and is used right across the construction industry for everything from interior doors to kitchens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and shaped to fit in any space . Normally a frame is constructed using a durable softwood such as Douglas-Fir and then covered with plywood to produce a strong , lightweight and durable door . In most situations it is painted but is can also be stained <p> Douglas Fir : Unlike Mahogany , Douglas-Fir is a softwood but do n't think that it 's lacking in strength because of this . It is a very durable and dense material and again , is used widely across the construction industry for many different things . It can be painted or stained and if finished in the right manner gives a very attractive natural grain pattern <h> What Paint to use on Garage Doors ? <p> This is indeed a good question ! With so many options available it 's difficult to know which is the best choice . Typically , an oil-based paint is the norm but this may not be the best choice in the long run . <p> This is down to the fact that they essential seal the outside of the frame and if water or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chip in the paintwork it can not escape so over time , it will rot the wood from the inside . It is possible to use this type of paint but just make sure you repair any chips , splits , knocks or cracks as soon as possible . <p> Paints specific to fences should also be avoided as most of these are geared towards rough-cut timber and may not give the required level of protection on the planed or smooth timber used to construct your doors . <p> The best type of paint to use is one that is microporous or moisture permeable . This paint type will allow the timber to breathe , allowing moisture in the timber to escape but at the same time it prevent any moisture from getting in . Most microporus paints also feature a UV filter that helps to prevent further damage from sunlight . <p> Microporous paint for wooden garage doors <p> These paints generally tend to be quite high-end and because of this can be quite expensive but over time can prove to be more cost effective . <p> At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils and stains : <p> Oils are probably not the way to go . It 's not that they do n't give a good finish as they do , it 's more about the fact that to maintain the finish , oiling needs to be done at least every 6 months if not more . <p> Using a decent stain will again give a great finish , especially if your doors are constructed from Douglas-Fir , you can really bring out that natural grain pattern , but again , try to use a microporus stain that will allow the timber to breathe . <h> How to Prepare Wooden Garage Doors for Painting <p> The first thing we need to mention before we go any further is lead . White lead was widely used in many domestic paints as a pigment right up to 1963 when it was outlawed for use on this level by the government . <p> The reason for mentioning this is because , ideally , you will want to sand or strip the existing paint from your doors and if you have lead paint present on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be releasing lead particles into the air that you could easily breathe in . To find out if your doors do contain lead you can purchase a testing kit - more information on this can be found here . <p> Lead paint test kit <p> With the above in mind , use the following steps to prepare your doors : <p> Firstly , test the existing paint ( if there is any ) on your doors to see if it contains traces of lead using the kit mentioned above . If so wear a suitable respirator mask for the next few steps <p> Using a brush or yard broom , brush over the entire door and frame to remove any cobwebs , moss or flaking paint . Apply a little pressure to make sure that you remove as much debris as possible , paying attention to any gaps or joints <p> Next , get a bucket with some warm water and mix in some sugar soap and wash each of the doors and frame over making sure that you get into any and all nooks and crannies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up . Leave it to dry out thoroughly <p> You will now have to make a call at this stage - sand down all loose paint and leave the areas that are still intact or strip all the paint off . <p> Stripping Paint : If the existing paint has tested positive for lead then you will really want to strip it off to prevent any health risks associated with sanding . For this you can use HomeStrip from Eco Solutions as it is the only product currently on the market that ensures that all lead particles are contained while stripping . Apply the stripper generously over the painted areas and leave it for 5 - 10 minutes before scraping away with a scraper . Depending on how long the paint has been on there and how many layers there are , you may need to repeat the process a few times to get all the paint off . <p> Sanding Paint : If the existing paint shows no signs of lead then you can either sand the doors and frame over , removing all the paint or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sand around the edges of all the flaked areas . Doing this will help to feather them into the surface below and ensure that you do not get any unsightly dips or marks in the finishing coat . For any deep holes or dips ( more than 0.5mm in depth ) you will need to fill these with a suitable external caulk or filler . In terms of the sandpaper - use a medium grit paper to start with ( around 100 grit ) and then use a finer grit paper ( 200 grit ) for feathering and blending . Make sure you sand all areas especially any detailed sections or mouldings as you want to create a good key for the primer and top coat <p> If your doors have windows in them it 's a good idea take them out and sand around the inside of each opening . Normally you will be able to remove either the inside or outside beading and then pop the glass out and then remove the rest of the bead <p> As we are dealing with timber there is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , splits or rot . Firstly , remove any rotten areas using a scraper to dig it all out ( if it 's really bad in places or is spread over a large area then you may need to consider more drastic repairs or even new doors or framework ) . With all the rot gone , use an external caulk or decent wood filler to fill all holes and then any cracks that may be present . Allow it to cure for manufacturer 's recommended times and then sand all areas flat if needed <p> Rot in frame of wooden garage door <p> Once sanded , stripped and repaired give all areas a good brush over to remove any dust and then a wipe over with a damp cloth and the sugar soap solution . Allow to dry completely . <h> Applying Primer to your Garage Doors and Frame <p> With any repairs made and all the preparation work completed the next job is to apply some primer to the doors and to the frame . <p> The type of primer you use will depend on the type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use matched types : <p> Use a Latex primer with latex top coat <p> Use an oil-based primer with an oil-based top coat <p> Use a microporous primer with a microporous top coat <p> Each different type of paint acts in a different way and if they are mixed they may actually fight against each other ! <p> Before you start , lay some dust sheets down around the area you will be painting to catch any spillages . Also slides a dust sheet , piece of cardboard or some newspaper underneath each of the doors so that the area beneath them is also protected . <p> Mask up any areas that you do n't want to get paint on such as and handles , hinges or locks and latches . <p> With the lid on , give the primer a good shake and then pop the lid off and give it a good stir with a stirrer or a wooden spoon . <p> Have a selection of brushes to hand including 1/2 inch , 1 inch and 2 inch - the smaller brushes for detailed areas and the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below and the following steps to complete the priming of your doors and framework : <p> Stages of painting a wooden door <p> If you have window reveals and beading to deal with , do these first as the quicker it dries the quicker you can get the glass back in and the garage secured . Do n't lay the primer on too thickly around the inside of the reveal as if the glass is a really tight fit and the primer is too thick , the glass wo n't go back in again <p> 1 - 3 : Prime the frame area in full making sure that you cover all areas including the internal section that the doors close into and any visible timber on the inside of the garage <p> 4 - 9 : Prime the top and sides of each door , again , make sure that you have a good covering on each side . If the timber is slightly rough-cut then you may need to use the brush in a stabbing fashion as opposed to a stoke to get the primer into the actual grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle the larger areas . Using the larger brush , start at the top of the left hand door and work your way down to the bottom , moving on to the next panel each time until all have a decent covering . <p> The Inside : The final task is to tackle the larger areas from the inside . Repeat the above process on all the large internal panels <p> It is recommended that you should also do a second coat of the primer as this will give you the best chance possible in achieving a great top coat finish . Depending on the primer you have used , the manufacturer may state this is not necessary but if not then apply a second coat if you can <p> With the priming now completed , leave it to dry for the manufacturer 's recommended time . When dry , check the surface over to make sure there are no sunken areas or hard edges . If you do find any and want to get the best finish you can you can fill these with external caulk or a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sand down until flat and level then apply some primer . <p> Once the primer is dry give the entire surface a very light rub over with some fine sand paper ( 250 grit or more ) as this will give a good key for the final top coat . <p> Once sanded wipe the whole surface over with a damp cloth to remove any dust . Leave until dry . <p> Wooden garage door primed and ready for top coat paint <h> Applying Top Coat Paint to your Garage Doors <p> We have now reached the final stage of this process - putting on the top coat . As you have already done the bulk of the work in the preparation . <p> This follows exactly the same process as priming and follows the same steps outlined in the above image : <p> Window Reveals and Beading : As with the primer , if you have any window reveals that you have removed the glass and beading from paint this ( and the beading ) first to give it a decent amount of time to dry . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass may not go back in again <p> 1 - 3 : Starting with the frame , paint the top coat on , starting at the top left hand side . Paint down the frame to the floor and then across the top and down the other side . Repeat this on the inside also <p> 4 - 9 : Next , apply the top coat around all edges of each door . Again , you may need to stab the brush at the edges to make sure that you get a good covering where the grain of the timber is exposed <p> 10 -19 : Finally , apply your top coat to all the large panels on the front of the doors , working from left to right and starting and the top of each panel and working down . When you have completed the outside , move onto the inside using the same techniques <p> Finishing Touches : Once you have allowed enough time for the top coat to dry thoroughly you should now be staring at the front of a very attractive looking garage ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're done ! <p> Wooden garage door finished with top coat paint <h> Final Points and Things to Think About <p> We have mentioned above about removing any windows ( if you have them ) and painting around the inside of the window reveal . Although this is possibly a bit of an ideal , if you can do it , that 's great as it will ensure that all exposed timber if then protected . <p> If not , no worries , just make sure that you sand down , prime and paint as much of the inside of the window as possible and also any beading . Mask around the glass so that you do n't get any paint on it . If you do then check out this project that will help you remove it . <p> We have also not mentioned anything about the under-side edge of each door . Normally this is left unpainted to give any moisture in the timber a chance to seep out ( when using latex or oil-based paints ) . If you are using microporous paint then ideally you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still escape . <p> As the base of most doors sit only a few millimetres off the ground water and moisture can easily find its way into the timber and over time will rot - that 's why most doors tend to rot at the bottom , so if you can protect this edge also please do so . <p> One final point to mention that we have n't covered above is spraying . It is possible to spray the paint on as opposed to brushing . This technique is not hugely popular in the UK but it is on the rise . <p> Spraying will give you a great , smooth finish and in most cases allow you to complete the job much quicker but please note - if you are spraying outdoors ask any neighbours to move their cars and do it on a day where there is as little wind as possible . <p> The act of spraying throws a lot of paint particles into the air and these can be blown around and settle on nearby surfaces such as cars , washing etc .... leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Find out how to safely use Boron and Borax products to rid your home of these problems once and for all . <p> Splits , cracks , and holes in wood are susceptible to insect attack as they open up a direct route into the centre of the timber . <p> Leaks , damp conditions and condensation can lead to end decay or mid span timber decay . Once the fibres in the wood become saturated and swell they are a nice soft bed for fungal spores of wet rot and dry rot , for and wood-boring insect eggs . <p> Dry Rot Causing Damage and Decay to a Roof Timber <p> There is a lot that can be done to treat timber decay as a DIY project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on timber decay and it 's treatment call Property Repair Systems on 01626 336180 . <h> Damp and Moisture <p> Dry rot needs a moisture content of 18% or more in timber so survive and spread . <p> The challenge has always been to bring moisture content down to sufficiently low levels to prevent the spores and fungus surviving inside the timbers , particularly large structural or supporting timbers . <p> Timber Repairs Splicing in a new piece of Timber using Joist Splice Plates <p> However using Boron-based treatments , which can be supplemented with a localised preservative paint coating , can effectively provide a no-go-zone to , over which the dry rot ca n't multiply or travel . They can also be used to dry out timber and kill off fungi and woodworm without needing to replace sections of timber if the decay is spotted early enough . <p> It is important to remove the causes of damp wherever possible to aid effective treatment . <p> Damp and insect attack are the main causes of timber decay and both can affect the structural integrity of the timbers in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it will not kill mammals which makes it suitable for use in lofts where bats ( a protected species in the UK ) are present . <h> Borax Uses <p> Borax is a trade name for Boron , it is an effective insect killer including wood boring beetles ( woodworm ) , ants and fleas . It can also be used as a moth repellent on clothes or carpets <p> As a fungicide and herbicide , it effectively alters the environment where moulds and mosses can thrive . This includes the rots that affect timber such as wet rot and dry rot <p> As a desiccant or drying agent for packaging and shipping items where moisture may cause damage . Also used for drying out saturated timber following a leak or flood <p> It is also useful as a domestic cleaning agent and even as a laundry booster <p> Boron has natural fire retardant properties which is another benefit when it is used to treat timber in the home <p> It also occurs as an active ingredient for all sorts of other domestic purposes from tooth whitening products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boron is a naturally occurring mineral compound and is a relatively safe product to use in comparison to some other timber decay and fungal treatments it is still important to take some simple safety precautions . <p> Cover Up <p> Use gloves and ensure you are covered to protect the skin from splashes of solution , gel or paste . This is especially important if you are using a sprayer because you are covering a large area as the chances of contact with the skin are increased . <p> If you get boron product on your skin , wash it off immediately with plenty of water . If you experience a reaction seek medical attention . <p> Protect Eyes <p> Wear goggle or safety glasses when using boron products . If you do get boron products in your eyes flush immediately with plenty of water and get medical advice . <p> Dust Mask <p> If you are mixing a solution from a powder you should wear a mask to avoid breathing in the dust . <p> Follow Instructions <p> Make sure you follow the safety instructions that come with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products where the is food , do not eat or drink while using boron products and it is suggested that you exclude children and pets while you are actually treating the with boron . <p> Re-Entry Time <p> The HSE Health and Safety Executive ) suggest that re-entry time after treatment is one hour or until the product is dry , whichever is the greater time . <h> Treating Timber Decay <p> Inserting Boron Rods into Affected Area <p> Solid boron rods can be inserted into affected timber to dry out the wood , halt timber decay , kill mould and fungi growth and kill woodworm . The water in the wood causes the rods to leach a boron solution right into the centre of the timbers . <p> Using Boron Rods to Treat Decaying Timber <p> This image above shows what happens after a boron rod is inserted into affected timber , you can see the active boron dissolving into the fibres in the wood . <p> Another way of getting boron right into the heart of the affected timber is to fill the drill holes with a boron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied using a skeleton gun , also known as a mastic gun , and an extended nozzle to ensure the hole is completely filled with the paste . <p> Boron Paste With Extended Applicator Nozzle to Inject Boron into Holes Dilled into Middle of the Timber <p> Boron paste can be injected into timber , or spread onto concealed surfaces .

A cable is a fairly inflexible ( although of course they can be bent ) set of wires used to supply the electricity to certain points in your home . Your meter box is supplied through a cable , sockets are supplied by cables and your lights are fed through cables . A cable can carry many wires depending on the job it needs to do .

@@41624794 @1624794/ <p> Summary : Underfloor heating is a very popular way to heat your home . Electric underfloor heating is a very popular choice because it does not take up much room and therefore , if fitted retrospectively , does not raise the floor level too much . This tutorial shows you how to install electric underfloor heating in a room in your home and also covers how to correctly lay out each heating mat , how to install the required sensor and how to run the electrical cables from your heating mat to a thermostat controller . We also cover how to test the system for resistance and continuity of current to make sure it is within an acceptable range and also to ensure that current flows throughout the whole system and that it will all work correctly . We also answer some of the most common questions that get asked when it comes to electric underfloor heating . <p> Underfloor heating cables can be stuck to a mat to make installation quicker or they can be laid loose round the room . When laid loose it is normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In some high heat loss areas such as conservatories , cable can be laid which will deal with 200W per sq m so please ensure you understand exactly what you are doing or get a qualified electrician to install the floor for you . <p> With this in mind , a qualified electrician will be required to make the final mains connection and if you are working on a large floor area , the cables and mats will need extra planning because of the load calculations required to stay safe . A completely separate power supply may be necessary for some of the larger installations . <h> Underfloor Heating Maintenance Costs and Heat Distribution <p> Underfloor heating is fast becoming the most popular form of heating . In most forms , it is inexpensive to install , economical to run , there is no maintenance and above all , the heat distribution is total . <p> Using thermostats in separately controlled zones throughout the house , you can easily control the heat to each room and keep your heating costs to an absolute minimum . <h> Advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underfloor heating mats are invisible in so much as there are no radiators or heaters showing . They can be used in both domestic and commercial properties in both a new build property and one under renovation , refurbishment and remodelling . <p> The mats can be installed under almost every floor type , including wood , tile and laminate , making it ideal for refurbishment projects . <p> Even laid on top of an existing floor and covered with tiles , the floor height is raised no more than 20mm . This means that the movement from one room to another is accomplished with only a small step which can be made to look attractive by means of a small timber moulding glued to the face of the newly heated floor . <p> You can see from the images below the advantages and ease of installation over normal , radiator type heating . The DIY nature of the electric underfloor mats , especially using the DIY underfloor heating kits available , makes it perfect for most heating purposes in most homes . <h> How do Electric Underfloor Heating Mats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vehicle by which a single electric wire can be run around the room with no twisting or kinking which could lead to breakages in the cable and circuit . The cable is stuck to the mat and the underside of the mat is stuck to the floor in whichever room you choose to lay it . <p> As the video below shows , the cable must start and finish at the same point to allow connection to the control box and thermostat . <p> The electric current flows through the cable causing heat to be generated . The amount of heat depends entirely on the possible output of the cable and the heat settings you use on the thermostat . <p> A sensor , connected to the thermostat , is also placed under the floor with the mat . The sensor measures the temperature of the floor and tells the control box to start and stop the heating to ensure it stays at the temperature you have set . <p> It is important that you select the correct type of heating mat with the correct heat outputs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under . <p> Fitting an electric underfloor heating mat <h> Guide to the Type of Underfloor Heating Mat Required for Different Floor Coverings <p> Please seek independent advice from your supplier or installer as to the type of electric underfloor heating mat you require for any particular flooring type . This section is simply a guide to the different wattage outputs of heating mats and where they are generally used . <p> Talk to the supplier about the best form of insulation under the heating mat , where this is possible .

However , insulating the floor first will stop any heat going downwards and reflect it all back up and give you greater value for money . Decisions like this sometimes depend on how much of a step you are willing to put into the room . <p> Insulated tile backer boards can be as thin as 6mm and when stuck to the floor offer great insulation and a very firm base . If installed properly and with each edge stuck to the one next to it , these backer boards can replace plywood strengthening panels on timber floors . This then gives you the rigidity you require from a timber floor plus insulation . This is very important when laying tiles onto a timber floor with underfloor heating . <p> The Romans invented underfloor heating so it is nothing new ! It is however , if installed correctly with the loads calculated properly , the most efficient form of heating available . <p> The first point in favour of underfloor heating is that it requires very little energy to run . The heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to heat the room above in a very natural way as heat rises anyway . <p> A radiator however covers a very small percentage of the walls surface and has to work very hard indeed to throw out enough heat for the rooms volume . <p> Visually , underfloor heating wins by miles . Who really wants to stare at a radiator on the wall , no matter how contemporary it is ? Underfloor heating in all formats , leaves the walls free for things that are really worth looking at . <p> The last point which swings underfloor heating into the lead is the cleanliness aspect . Radiators gather dust , hide socks and invite people to hang wet clothes and towels on them . This leads to condensation which , in turn , leads to mould . <h> How to Install an Electric Underfloor Heating System <p> Firstly , you need to decide how much you are prepared to lift your floor . If this is not a problem it is a good idea to source and fit some insulation backer boards to the floor first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the floor . You can see the various kinds of insulation in insulation for your underfloor heating project . <p> Example of the step that is created after installing underfloor heating and how it can be finished with a timber strip <p> The area where the floor heating is to be fitted is measured . A sketch is made of the floor to determine the size of the underfloor heating mat needed and marked to indicate where it should be placed , including the position of it 's power supply connections . <p> Floor tiles can be laid over electric underfloor heating <p> The mat must start and finish at the same place as you can see from the video below . The mats are usually 500mm wide and when the end of a room is reached , the mat is cut and swung round to go the other way down the floor . <p> Mats should not be placed under kitchen units or appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers and laying it right up to the edge of the skirting is pointless , so keep it 150mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mat you need and of course , keep the cost down . Additionally , never cut the red heating cable , only the mat <p> Pay particular attention to where you are going to connect your cables to and make sure you can reach the power point without damaging the floor or walls too much . You will also need to place the sensor in the floor for a thermostat so ensure you understand from the instructions where all of the cables need to go . <p> All matting and wiring laid out and planned where it should be fitted before gluing down , including all the wiring for controller and sensor <p> Once you planned exactly where all items need to be placed it 's time to start gluing the mat down . Spread the adhesive on the back of an underfloor heating mat and ensure a decent covering . The adhesive itself will be good for about 10 - 20 lifts so if you make a mistake you can simply lift the mat and relay . <p> Underfloor heating mat laid on a plywood sub-base and measured so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use a multi-meter to check you have continuity of current all the way round the heating cable and that the resistance of the cable falls into the allowable limits . These limits will be shown in the installation instructions and you can see how the multi-meter works from the underfloor heating video below . <p> Checking underfloor heating mats for electrical continuity using a multi-meter <p> As mentioned above , you should have worked out where the cables will start and finish , including the sensor cable , before you started to stick the matting down . Once you have confirmed their placement , chase out the floor to receive them . Before going to the controller , the cables must finish below the level of the actual heating mat . <p> The loose cable to the power supply should be cut into the floor to keep it out of the way and ensure it does not move about <p> The temperature sensor should be placed to finish no higher than the top of the mat and in the case of the sensor the cable should have a finished height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lay them so to stop them being a nuisance until you lay the floor covering you can glue or tape them down out of the way . <p> The next job is to work out where the floor sensor will go . This should sit mid-way between two of the underfloor heating cable runs . <p> The floor sensor will link up to the thermostat and let the system know when the required heat has been reached . The thermostat will then turn the heating off . <p> Make sure you have worked out where the thermostat will be placed and how you will get the sensor and the power cables to it . The sensor wire will sit in a small piece of conduit which should have the end taped over to avoid any damage to the sensor itself . Check your instructions to see how far into the floor the sensor should be placed . <p> Avoid damage to the temperature sensor by taping over the conduit end <p> When all the heating is laid its time to test it to make sure that current is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is within acceptable barriers . Watch the video carefully to see how this is done . The continuity should be tested again to make sure the cable is not damaged and the resistance tested ( See our video on Ohms Law to understand more about resistance ) . <p> Test resistance regularly when laying your underfloor heating mat <p> In terms of testing the matting , use a piece scrap of paper to write down your resistance figures regularly throughout the installation , firstly when the box is unwrapped and the matting removed , then when the mat is unrolled and laid out and finally when it is all stuck down . It is also a good idea to test it periodically while you are laying it also . If anything changes at least you can do something about it before it 's too late . <p> When you are happy that the mat is laid correctly it is time to tile or lay whatever surface you are putting down , on top of it . Again , before you start laying your floor , test the full circuit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are laying tiles then please use flexible floor adhesive and if laying tiles onto a plywood floor , make sure your adhesive is suitable for wooden floors . We have coated our floor with 3 coats of diluted ( 30% water/70% PVA to ensure the board is sealed and to give greater adhesion to both the underfloor heating mat and the tile adhesive . <p> When the floor is laid and dry ( e.g. tiles ) , turn the electricity off at the mains . <p> Run the sensor cable and the end of the heating cable up to the thermostat box . You have several choices on how this is done : <p> placing the cables into surface trunking that runs up to the thermostat box , hiding them within the trunking <p> Tapping a hole through the wall and running the cabling into the wall and then drawing or fishing the cables up through the rear of the thermostat housing box through a hole that is drilled through the wall <p> Chasing a run out of the wall from floor level up to the thermostat box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall as it keeps all of the cables out of site and leads to a much neater job . <p> Cable Access kits are available for this kind of cable fishing . If you click on the link you will be taken through to our tool store where you can watch a video on how the cable access kit is used before buying one . <p> The mains power can now be taken from either a suitable socket or from the consumer unit if your instructions demand this . The mains power must first go to a double pole switch , separating both live and neutral when turned off , and from the double pole switch the power is taken to the control unit or thermostat where it meets the sensor and element cables from the heating mat . <p> The unit is then wired according to your manufacturers instruction . <p> When wired up to your underfloor heating , the thermostatic control unit will enable you to set the temperature of your underfloor heating and also allow you to save energy <p> Please note : If your unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conform to our colours . Sensor units are usually wired with no polarity but please check every detail of your wiring with a specialist electrician . We strongly advise you to get your wiring checked by a professional and if in any doubt about how it should be connected up , please get a professional electrician to do this for you . <p> Once all connected , you should be ready to go . Fire up your heating and wait for it to kick in . If all is well you should have a nice warm floor within a few minutes . <h> Some Common Questions and Answers About Underfloor Heating Mats <p> Question : Why are there two different types of mat one for timber and one for concrete floors ? <p> Answer : Heating mats are all tested to European standard IEC335/EN60335 , it is recommended that no higher than 150W/m2 should be installed on a timber floor . Concrete absorbs heat at a higher rate than timber and outputs of 200W/sqm can be used <p> Question : Why are some cables on a mesh mat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mats ( on mesh ) are very easy to use but limited in their ability to heat floors when the covering ( such as concrete or deep slabs ) is thick . Thicker floors require more energy to heat them so larger cables ( up to 7mm ) are used . It is not sensible to stick these to a mat as they are just not as flexible and would probably just come off during installation anyway . The larger cables come on a roll and are manually placed in the room by clipping them down at regular intervals . <p> Question : Can heating mats be used with all types of flooring ? <p> Answer : Yes . Search for the underfloor heating system that is recommended for your type of flooring and see our page on insulating under the floor heating . <p> Question : How safe is electric underfloor heating ? <p> Answer : Very safe . Make sure you test your cables all the way through the installation and get an electrician to wire you up to the mains . You should then have no safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor heating expensive to run ? <p> Answer : Most manufacturers will tell you that the cost of running an underfloor heating system in any room is about the same as running the light bulbs used for that room . The truth is it is a little more expensive that that ( about 20% ) but a lot depends on how long you keep it on for every day and whether the thermostats is used properly . <p> Question : Who can install it ? <p> Answer : Anyone can legally install the underfloor heating mats themselves , they can even provide the sockets and switches in the wall . In the kitchen and bathroom you must get a qualified electrician to connect to the mains and if you are running the heating from the consumer unit , on a separate circuit , then this must be done by a qualified electrician also . In short , any electric underfloor heating must be fitted by a person competent to do so under current IEE regulations and the building regulations part ' P ' approved document . <p> Question : Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10-year guarantee . Under this ( usually ) the cable is guaranteed for ten years if installed in accordance with the Installation Instruction booklet . <p> Question : Will the tiles be affected by the heating and cooling of the underfloor heating ? <p> Answer : Tiles should be laid on a flexible adhesive which , if laid to the instructions and 10mm is allowed over the top of the heating cables , will not be affected at all . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

The construction of a conservatory , for example , which involves the conservatory becoming part of the existing building by removing external doors , or making an opening into the conservatory with no doors on , means the conservatory will be governed by building regulations .

@@41624797 @1624797/ <p> Anyone who has been to Mikes presentations about plastering will know that he has been trying to track down the meaning of the word hawk , in relation to the tool a plasterer uses to hold his plaster while he puts it on the wall . <p> We have finally found an answer that he is happy with and , as he promised , the person providing the answer gets a free hawk . <p> The meaning comes from the latin for hawk being " accipeter " ( used during medieval times ) and accipeter coming from the latin verb " caper " which means " to seize " . This working accipeter developed into the word assistant which we use today for working birds , mammals , and tools alike , so the modern ( last 100 years or so ) direct translation of " hawk " is " working assistant " . <p> I am very excited to be able to help and am looking forward to using my hawk to fix the plaster in my kitchen which decided to fall off the wall not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Make sure you buy a light hawk , whether you chose plastic or aluminium because it will get very heavy after a couple of hours of plastering so do n't  make your job harder by skimping on the quality for your tools .

Get great wooden conservatory ideas and make sure you understand the planning rules and regulations particular to conservatories . <p> The natural beauty of an oak timber conservatory is hard to beat . If you are planning a conservatory ( or perhaps an orangery ) then you have to weigh up a wide range of factors before deciding on the one that best suits you .

For example , beech is not durable enough to withstand the elements and should only be use internally . The most common types of hardwood used in the construction of timber conservatories are : <p> Oak - Probably the most common hardwood that is used for conservatories in this country . We all know what it looks like and it is very hard not to like it .

There are a wide variety of sub species so it is important to ensure you have the right type before you purchase as the density varies considerably <p> Sapele - This is another African hardwood . It is reddish brown with an interesting grain pattern . It can have a tendency to warp especially is seasoned too quickly . It is one of the cheaper hardwoods and often used as a face for internal doors . <p> Iroko - This is a cheaper and more readily accessible replacement for Teak , which has very strict import rules making it hard and often expensive to acquire .

The most common finishes are : <p> Painting - This will provide the most protection to your timber frame but it will obscure the natural beauty if the wood . Paints do not typically penetrate the surface of the wood , and if they do , they do not penetrate far . If water is to enter the wood it can cause the paint to peel or blister . <p> Varnish - This will provide a clear or stained film to protect the wood . An exterior marine varnish is likely to prove more durable <p> Stains and Preservatives - There are a wide range of stains and preservative that can be used to treat and preserve your timber frame , many have water repelling properties <p> It is important to follow the manufacturers ' guidelines closely to ensure that you get the most protection for your timber .

The good news is that conservatories , in almost all cases , are considered ' Permitted Developments ' and subject to certain restrictions you should be able to go ahead without having to get formal planning . If your new conservatory will not cover more than half the garden , is less than 4m high and in the same style as the existing roof , it is likely to be acceptable .

@@41624800 @1624800/ <p> Summary : Advice on attaching things to Masonry walls including brick , stone and block walls or concrete walls and floors , using plastic wall plugs and chemical anchor resins . Help when you are fixing things to walls , including tutorials on drilling into brick and concrete , recognising masonry drill bits , wall plug sizes and colour codes , and using resins and adhesives where walls are in bad condition . <h> Masonry Definition <p> Masonry is easily described as anything a Mason puts down . In other words if it is laid by a stonemason or bricklayer it is Masonry . This includes brick , stone , and block walls . Blockwork walls are made of blocks also known as breeze block , Thermalite block , concrete blocks or cinder block . They are much quicker to lay than bricks so they are usually used for the interior walls of modern houses . The walls are then usually covered with plaster or plasterboard to give a smooth finish ( although not always ) . <p> If you have a solid wall it could be brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masonry , but for the purposes of this project we have included it because the method of drilling into concrete and drilling into brick or stone are roughly the same . You will also use the same methods of fixing for concrete , stone , block or brick . <h> Drilling into Masonry <p> Masonry surfaces are hard if they are in good condition . To get through most masonry surfaces you will need to own or hire a powerful electric drill with a hammer action . DIY Doctor does not suggest you buy one less than 500W . If you will be using the drill for a sustained time for a one off job such as battening masonry for a plasterboard wall , then it makes sense to hire your equipment . Discuss your project with the hire shop and they will be able to advise you which is the best tool for the job . If you are just going to be doing smaller household jobs like putting up curtain poles , fitting shelves , and fixing pictures to walls , then buying your own drill or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these power tools from our product review section <p> Masonry Drill Bits have a flat cutting section at the end <p> You will also need masonry drill bits of the correct size for your job ( more on sizes later ) - you can tell if a drill bit is for drilling masonry or concrete by the shape of the end . Masonry drill bits have a flat cutting section at the end which is slightly wider than the shaft of the drill bit . This allows the drill bit to cut its way through the masonry or concrete and the cut material can escape through the grooves back to the opening of the hole . <p> You can see the wider end on the Masonry Drill Bit ( top ) compared with the Normal Drill Bit ( bottom ) <p> Do not buy cheap masonry drill bits . They will make your life very hard work and , if you have a lot to do , will blunt quickly . This makes you push the drill harder , making the drill bit wobble and enlarges the hole beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning out your drill . <p> If you have a large , say 10mm , hole to drill through a very hard surface , it is asking a lot of the drill bit ( and drill ) to do this in one go . Especially if you do not have the powerful tools the professionals use . It is easier to drill a smaller hole first and then increase it with a larger drill bit . You will then end up with a hole the correct size in the exact position you wanted it . <p> You may think it sounds like a faff to drill two holes rather than one , but you will find that the work is easier and does not take much more time . Most importantly it will not burn out the motor in your drill , which can make the job and expensive one <h> Fixing to Masonry <p> The traditional way of fixing to masonry is to use screws , but you can not screw directly into a brick wall , a block wall , or stone , so you need to drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be screwed into , but will also hold the screw firmly in place . <p> The usual method is to drill a hole of the correct size and then insert a plastic wall plug to screw into . Wall plugs are very versatile and using them you can add fixings for Thermalite blocks , brickwork , stone walls , or concrete , providing the masonry material is in good condition . You will be familiar with many fixings , but we also have a page explaining many different and unusual fixings for specific jobs . <p> Where your masonry is not in good condition there are other solutions for fixing to masonry or concrete using chemical resin anchors . We will look at using wall plugs first , then move on to resin fixing solutions . <h> Fixing with Plastic Wall Plugs <p> Plastic wall plugs ( also known as Rawl plugs ) help you to get a secure fitting when you are fixing things to walls . They work by expanding against the hole you have drilled in the masonry as the screw is screwed into the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your wall is made of solid masonry or concrete . <p> Using plastic plugs is an easy way to fix things when you have a perfect wall that is a wall that is easily drilled , firm and thick enough to take a wall plug . <h> Wall Plugs Colour Code <p> Wall plugs sizes are indicated by their colour code to make it easier to identify the one you need while you are fixing things to walls , without the need to carefully scrutinise each wall plug before using it . Essentially they come in four sizes and colours . <p> When you visit your builder 's merchant or DIY shop , you will see various grey and other coloured plastic plugs on the market and each has a job to do , but for the purposes of this project and to assist you in getting a good fixing to a brick , block or concrete wall or ceiling , we will just deal with the four major wall plug colours ( pictured below ) . <p> Yellow plugs fit into holes made by a 5mm drill bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall plugs fit into a hole made by a 6mm drill bit and are for screw sizes 6 - 10 <p> Brown wall plugs fit into a hole made by a 7mm drill bit and are for screw sizes 10 - 14 <p> Blue wall plugs fit into a hole made by a 10mm drill bit and are for screw sizes 14 - 18 <p> Wall plugs are colour coded to quickly indicate their size <p> Screws for Wall Plugs <p> Screws come in all shapes and sizes . The larger the number of the screw , the larger the diameter . For example a number 8 screw is smaller than a number 10 . This is the gauge number of a screw and is measured using the head of the screw rather than the diameter of the shaft . Numbers 8 and 10 are the most popular screw sizes and suitable for most fixings at home . <p> Obviously screws , and therefore wall plugs for Kitchen Cabinets will be bigger than screws and wall plugs for hanging pictures . <h> Attaching to Brick Walls A Tutorial <p> Fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pictured , but you would use the same process for attaching things to brick walls as you would for any other masonry surface . Drilling into concrete , block , or stone walls is very similar to drilling into brick . <p> Firstly lay out everything you need . Please note that the sizes of your drill bit , wall plugs and screws will vary depending on the job , and we explain this in more detail below . If you prefer to work in inches there is a handy online converter tool at Metric Conversions . <p> Electric Drill <p> Masonry Bit or Bits depending on the size of hole <p> Correct size Plugs Wall plugs also known as Rawl plugs <p> Screws of the correct size for the job <p> Electrical Tape <p> Tape Measure <p> Pencil , chalk or a nail to mark where the hole should go <p> Now you have all of the equipment you need , you can start fixing . <p> Measure the depth of the hole you wish to drill . This will be determined by the length of the screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape of some kind to wrap round your drill bit to indicate how far you want your drill bit to go into the wall ( electrical tape is good because it is colourful and sticks well ) . <p> In this example we are drilling into an external brick wall to hang a candle sconce , but you would use the same process for hanging a hanging basket bracket or , if you were working inside , for any number of jobs where you are attaching things to walls . <p> The bracket we are fixing below is 7mm thick and the screw is 50mm long , and there will be 43mm of screw in the wall . The screw does not go right to the very end of the wall plug , and there is always a little drilling dust left at the end of the hole , so we always add 10mm to the depth of the hole to allow for this . <p> Therefore in this example we have - 43mm of screw in the wall plus 10mm allowance = a hole 53mm deep <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 6mm masonry drill bit and a red wall plug to fit into a hole ( see the colour coded size guide above ) . <p> Measure your drill bit and place coloured tape to mark the depth of the hole you need <p> So in this instance you would measure 53mm from the tip of your masonry bit and mark it with a piece of tape ( see above ) . Fix the tape above the line with the bottom edge of the tape on the line . Here you can see we have marked the depth we want the hole on the drill bit using green tape ( below ) . <p> Masonry drill bit marked with the correct depth for the hole we will need for this wall plug <p> Next we hold our wall bracket up to the wall ( if possible ) to mark the position of the screws . If you do it this way you will see where it looks best , and it is helpful to have two people to judge this ; one to hold it , and the boss to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not possible , or you do n't fancy judging it by eye , then measuring accurately will do the same job . You may also want to use measurement where you are putting up more than one item at once , such as when you are fixing pictures to walls or putting up picture hooks . <p> Mark the brickwork in a V shape with a nail where you want to drill your hole to get an accurate position <p> When we measure to drill holes , you will see above , we always mark our position with a V shape . Using just a dot or a line can result ( after an interruptive phone call or a sudden rush to the toilet , ) in forgetting just where the dot is or which end of the line you were going to drill to . If you use the point of the V as the position of where we want to drill the hole , it is much clearer . This will give you a more accurate measurement than a cross too , as it is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm " of a cross . There is no doubt about the marked position if you use a V , and most Pros will use the same method . Try it yourself . <p> Make sure though that whichever mark you make it will be covered by the work you are hanging . <p> Next , drill the hole ! Make sure the drill is level and going in at right-angles to the wall . Some drills even have a tiny spirit level incorporated in the body of the drill to help you do this accurately . <p> Apply pressure to the drill , but allow the drill to do the work . You can adjust the torque and the action on many drills . Why not check out DIY Doctor 's tutorial video How To Use a Combi Drill on what the settings mean on your drill/screwdriver and how to safely use an electric drill . <p> Keep an even pressure on the drill and stop when your tape touches the brickwork . With the drill still running pull it out of the hole , this brings out more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit out of the wall without damaging it . <p> Drill into the wall until the marker tape touches the brickwork <p> Push in the wall plug you are using , in this case a red one . Make sure the plastic plug is entirely in the hole . If it does not fit in the hole it will not work as effectively , so remove it and try either vacuuming in the hole to remove dust or blow into the hole ( making sure you are wearing glasses so you do n't get an eyeful of brick dust ! ) . If the wall plug still does n't fit then drill a bit further and try again . <p> Screw your bracket to the wall - you can see the red wall plug in the hole sitting flush with the brickwork <p> Screw the bracket to the wall so that you get a secure fixing . When attaching to brick walls you normally use at least two fixing points . In this case the bracket , or sconce , is only going to bear the weight of a candle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however for most brackets you would want at least two screws to ensure it is secure and will not be easily dislodged if it is nudged from the side . Basically use the holes in the bracket to judge how many screws to use . <p> Using a screwdriver screw the screw into the wall plug until it is tight and secure <p> You will notice that we are using an electric screwdriver/drill which in our opinion is the most wonderful invention known to man ! ! You can get a wide range of electric drill and electric screwdrivers online and we have lots of product and tool reviews on our You Tube channel to help you choose the right one . Click on our toolstore link at the bottom of the page to check out the latest models . <p> Finally - standing back and admiring your work is always a good thing to do at this point ! Enjoy your work and give yourself a pat on the back . <p> NOTE : Using wall plugs in wall or floor tiles - Wall plugs expand against the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This puts quite a lot pf pressure on the building material they are placed into . So make sure you push the wall plug right into the hole , beyond the tile . Otherwise the wall plug will expand and press against the weaker surface , which could crack the tile . <h> Fixing Timber Battens to Masonry with Wall Plugs <p> Timber battens are used to allow you to get a level surface to fix plasterboard or other sheeting material to the wall . It is important that this framework is fitted accurately so that you can get a good final finish . Even though the battens wo n't be seen , if they are badly fitted , badly spaced or uneven then they will make it almost impossible to get a good job at the end , and could cause further problems later . <p> To fix a timber batten hold the batten into position on the wall , making sure it is level using a spirit level . Mark the wall with a pencil along the side of the batten . Take the batten down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push a screw through . See the Drilling into Brick section above for instructions on how to measure the depth of the hole you need and how to mark it on the drill bit . <p> Put the batten back on the wall to the line you have drawn . Push the screw through the pre drilled hole and wiggle it on the wall to make a mark where you want the hole to be . Take the batten down and make sure you can see your mark , make the mark more visible by marking a V with the point of the V on the screw mark ( see above for an explanation ) . <p> Using a 6mm masonry bit , drill a hole to the correct depth . Push in the wall plug and screw the timber up tight to the line . You can now use the masonry bit to drill right through the timber and the wall ( do n't forget to alter your depth marker on your drill bit to take account of the depth of the batten ) . <p> Push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of turns and tap it through with a hammer . You will feel the plug slip through the timber into the wall and when you do it is time to screw the screw in . <p> This method saves you marking each hole individually before you put the batten on the wall , which can lead to mistakes . To be fair it does eventually blunt the masonry bit slightly but it takes about 650 holes through timber to do this and the time saved , together with the accuracy involved , makes it worth it . <h> Fixing with Resins and Adhesives <p> Fixing things to walls with resins is a specialist area and we have taken advice from Property Repair Systems , to bring you the best advice on this method of fixing . They have many years experience supplying resins , fillers , and anchors to the trade and consumer . They are always happy to share their knowledge and you can click on their banner at the top of the page to get more information or you can give them a call free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curtain poles , picture rails , dado rails , in fact anything in the home that usually requires you drilling into concrete or masonry , can also be fixed using resins and adhesives . <p> In some cases plastic wall plugs are not the answer to fixing things to walls because they simply will not work , usually because the masonry is too soft or is cracked . In these cases resins come to the rescue ! <p> Using a chemical or resin anchor system involves fixing a steel stud , bolt or other type of anchoring fixing , by filling a drilled hole in masonry with a resin-based adhesive and setting the anchoring fixing into the resin and allowing it to set or " cure " . <p> This type of fixing reduces the load-bearing stress in the wall as the resin takes the load rather than the wall , which means they are ideal fixings for soft or crumbling surfaces where a traditional wall plug could not gain purchase and would be pulled out of the masonry wall by the weight of the item being fixed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two chemical materials together and allowing them to " cure " around the fixing holding it fast which in turn allows things to be fixed to the wall ( floor or ceiling ) using these anchors . <p> You may have come across a similar curing system if you have ever used glue with two ingredients such as Araldite . <p> 4 Stage Process Using Resins <p> There are four simple stages in the process and all tools and materials are available online from Property Repair Systems . <p> You will require a suitable stud and these are available in 8mm , 10mm , and 12mm sizes . You will need a masonry drill bit which is at least 4mm bigger than the stud you are using . For example an 8mm stud will require a 12mm drill bit and so on . <p> Measure , mark and drill your hole in the desired location . <p> Clean the hole of dust and debris . You can do this using proprietary brushes or by using a compressor to blow air into the hole . You could also use a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , close your eyes and wear a dust mask and eye protection ) . <p> Resin injection into holes for solid fixings <p> Inject the resin into the hole . The best way to do this is using the applicator skeleton gun fitted with an extension tube of the correct length and diameter to reach the bottom of the hole ( see picture above ) . Inject gently , slowly removing the tube from the hole , to deposit resin without trapping air . For accurate , waste-free injection you can pre-mark the tube with tape just like we did with the masonry bit when we were drilling holes in the project above . Stop operating the trigger when the tape appears . Make sure you set the tape at a distance from the tube end to allow for the resin that will be displaced by the stud , dowel or bar . There are various applicator skeleton guns available , depending on which resin you choose . You may already have the basic 300cc and/or 400cc skeleton gun if you have carried out other work with fillers and sealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esters no we are not sure either , but you will have been used to seeing the term polyester on clothing and the same properties it gives clothes make it suitable as a building material . The fibres are strong , shrink resistant , and hydrophobic ( resists moisture ) . What you need to know is they both form a strong and stable substance to set your fixings into . <p> Polyester Anchor Resins are available online from Property Repair Systems <p> They are available in three different setting times to suit the job you are doing , either to give you a quick result or to allow you time to get fixings in place , depending on what you are using the resin for : <p> Fast cures in 3 6 minutes <p> Medium cures in 15 30 minutes <p> Slow cures in 4 6 hours <p> The formulations are available in three main pack types : <p> Single Cartridge Tube No Hand Mixing Required - This does not require any hand mixing and it fits in a standard skeleton gun . There are two resins inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two resins mix in the nozzle , inside a spiral , which can be replaced if the resin hardens before the tube is exhausted . <p> Dual Cartridge Tube No Hand Mixing Required - Again no hand mixing required . The two resins are inside twin plastic tubes which are linked together . It requires a specific skeleton gun for each type , depending on the cartridge size and the specific mix ratio . Again the resins mix in the nozzle , inside a spiral , which can be replaced should the resin harden before the tube is emptied . <p> Single Cartridge Tube Hand Mixing Required - As it implies , here the two resins require hand mixing before use . The tube fits standard skeleton guns and mixed resin is pushed into an empty cartridge using a grease pot type pusher plate before it is applied to the surface . <h> Fixing Timber Battens to Masonry with Resin <p> We recommend you use Thixotropic Rapid Injection Resin called Thixo Rapid on Property Repair System 's website as an adhesive for fixing wooden battens to masonry . Thixo Rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical battens . <p> 5 Step Process Using Adhesives <p> Clean the wall surface with a stiff brush , to remove all loose material , paint , varnish and plaster . You may need to sand the area if the surface is very flaky . <p> Set the batten on the wall and make sure it is vertical using a spirit level . Mark around the batten with a pencil . <p> Take the batten down and coat the back of the batten and the marked wall area with the Thixo Rapid Resin . This mixes in the nozzle and will cure in 3-6 minutes . <p> Press the batten against the wall , resin side against the wall obviously ! Hold or prop in place for a few minutes until the resin begins to set . <p> Once the resin has cured you can then use the batten to provide a base for nails or screws , to hold your plasterboard , kitchen cupboard or radiator for example . <p> If you are putting up shelves onto a masonry wall the process for fixing the brackets is very similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . Do n't forget you will need to use a spirit level between each of the two supporting shelf brackets , to make sure your shelf will be level when you have finished fixing your brackets . <p> Hopefully this project will have answered all your questions about fixing to masonry , including using wall plugs and chemical anchor fixings in any type of solid walls . Do n't forget that although we have used brick walls in our pictures you can use the same methods for fixing into stone , block and even concrete walls and other surfaces . <p> If you need any further help you can always go to our excellent DIY Forum , and look for your own specific question on there .

Coaxial cable can be run externally , through the loft space , through floor voids and even clipped to the top of skirting boards . Connecting up is not difficult either . <p> This project deals with the loose TV plugs , connecting coaxial cables and how to wire up a TV aerial cable . <p> Wall mounted connection boxes can also be installed . These can be placed in surface boxes in the same way as an additional electrical socket . <p> Wall mount coaxial socket <p> A kit can also be purchased to add a TV Aerial or simply extend the one you have . <p> Coaxial cable kit with all fittings <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be screwed to a window sill . In some cases , the wire from the aerial will run down the roof , down the wall and into the corner of a window . Once the cable is inside the property it is then fixed into the below socket so that a cable can then be run between it and a TV . <p> Coaxial Socket for window sill <p> Full instructions for a plug connection are below . For fixing a TV aerial to a brickwork or block surface , please see our fixing to masonry project . Please be very careful when erecting TV aerials and use proper access equipment as you will , in most cases , be working at height . <h> What is Coaxial Cable and Why is it Used ? <p> Coaxial cable is used for connecting aerials to TV 's and radios . It is used because its make up allows it to transfer high frequency signals while at the same time it is shielded from electromagnetic interference . <p> The electrical signals run through the centre wire which is separated from the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer wire acts as an earth and a shield against electromagnetic interference . <p> Connecting coaxial wire to a television socket has given some of our users some trouble recently so we have published this project to show you how it is done .

Then cut off the surplus external sleeve . <p> Splitting coaxial cable to identify layers with a hobby knife <p> Push the braid up to the top of the inner sleeve . It will scrunch up at the end . <p> Push coaxial braid up <p> Slide the leafed cable clamp over the inner sleeve next and push it tight to the outer sleeve , trapping the braid inside . <p> Braid pushed up and leafed coaxial cable clamp pushed on <p> Push the leaves closed gently around the outer sleeve to trap it in place and hold it firmly in the socket .

Take the male plug and now slide it over the end of the cable , ensuring that the inner core copper wire goes down into the thin hollow sleeve at the end of the plug . <p> Cut inner sleeve of cable rady for male plug <p> With the male plug now in position on the end of the cable , take the main body and slide it over the male plug and leaf clamp .

One such item that we find incredibly useful is the coaxial cable splitter or aerial splitter . <p> This little device can be used to take the main feed of an aerial cable and " T " into it , allowing you to run another cable off to another TV without having to install a new cable or use an internal powered aerial . <p> The principles of installing one are exactly the same as described above , only you will be cutting the main cable and applying a plug to each end of the cut . <p> Once the plugs are in place , each one is fixed into the splitter to create the existing run to its original location and you can then plug a new cable into the spare port . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Understand the different parts of a door so that you can describe and choose your perfect composite door . Understand what is involved in fitting or hanging a composite door , what different types and styles of external composite doors are available and also what security features they have . <h> What is a Composite Door ? <p> Composite ( meaning made up of various parts especially of a synthetic building material ) doors can be made from Aluminium , uPVC or Fibreglass . The most common , and attractive of these types of door are those made mainly of fibreglass . <p> Fibreglass is a very strong material also known as GRP or Glass Reinforced Plastic where plastic is reinforced by very strong strands , or fibres , of glass . The result is an extremely strong door with several advantages over other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of a range of materials , typically including wood , PVC , foam insulation and GRP . By making a door with a variety of different materials , it gives the door the benefits of those materials often without any disadvantages they may have . They can be particularly strong and durable which makes them ideal for external doors . <h> The Different Types of External Door <p> There are a number of different types of external door that are commonly used today , including composite doors , which are the newest type of door design . To understand the benefits of composite doors fully it is easier if you understand the alternatives : <p> Wooden External Doors Wood is the traditional material for external doors . Wooden doors are very strong which makes them ideal as external doors . They are relatively insulating , but the most important benefit is that they are aesthetically very pleasing . They can warp , bend and shrink which means that they might allow draughts . While wood is pretty durable , it will not last forever , or certainly as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually made of hardwood which can make them some of the most expensive doors available <p> PVC External Doors These are " plastic " doors . They are excellent as external doors and they are incredibly durable yet amazingly cheap compared to other types of external door . They wo n't change shape which means that they will stay air tight and therefore warmer . They require very little maintenance particularly in comparison to a wooden door . Aesthetically speaking , UPVC external doors are not very popular and typically only chosen when price or other factors are of more importance <p> Aluminium Doors Aluminium is commonly used in external patio and bifold doors . It is light and hard wearing and will hold and contain large glass sheet windows securely . Older types of aluminium external doors do tend to be much less energy efficient than other types of door <p> Composite External Doors Due to the variety of material that composite doors are made from , their exact features will vary quite widely ( and so will their price ) so a little research is worth doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composite door are due to the extra strength and durability that the mix of material provides . They will weather like a PVC door but look like a wooden door ( and keep looking like a pristine wooden door ) with very little maintenance work .

You will , however , need to explain to the manufacturer what it is that you want , so here is a quick explanation of the key parts of a door : <p> The different parts that make up a door <p> Rails : The rails are the cross pieces on a door . There are typically three , although there can be more . The top one is called the top rail , and the bottom one the bottom rail . The one in the middle is generally the thickest one and this is called the lock rail , as this is where the lock and handle are generally positioned <p> Stiles : The stiles are the upright members that link into the Rails . They make the frame that the panels of the door are held by . The stile nearest the hinges is called the Hinge Style where the one on the other side of the doors is called the Lock Stile . If there is a central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be referred to as the Mullion <p> Panels : These make up the main area of the door . They are attached to and held in place by the Stiles and Rails ; they fill in the gaps between them <h> Composite Doors and Security <p> Composite doors very secure . The strength of this type of door is created by the different materials used in its construction . There is one other security benefit that is derived from the way that composite doors are constructed and this is that the construction allows the addition of more advance and sophisticated locking systems . <p> Relatively cheaply , it is possible to add high security deadbolts or multipoint auto locks . Adding extra hinges or strengthened hinges will provide more security <p> A multi point lock system in a composite door <h> Fitting or Hanging a Composite Door <p> Fitting a composite door is very similar to fitting a normal door , except that it is generally even easier because the door and frame are made to fit , and many firms can make bespoke sizes to suit your home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to dressing your door it is possible to do this in the same way as you would with a wooden external door , but we recommend that you try and order your door with the letterbox , peep holes and other features that you would like .

Here are a range of the ones that we have found to give you an idea of what is possible : <p> Modern contemporary style composite door <p> Wooden ( Oak ) finished composite door <p> Coloured composite door <p> Some companies will even let you design your own door so that you can be sure that it will fit in with your own individual styling and taste requirements . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624805 @1624805/ <p> Any decoration job , either DIY or professionally done is always only as good as the preparation and thought that has gone into it . <p> If a surface is to be varnished for example , sanding the timber across the grain prior to varnishing will leave scratches which will show through the varnish and ruin your work . <p> There is grease in the air in every home , from cooking and general cleaning . This grease settles on all surfaces and must be removed . Paint , if it to stay where its put , must have a stable base . <p> We get so many questions as to why a surface is peeling or has gone blotchy etc and the answer is , 99% of the time , because the surface has not been prepared properly . Other paint defects can be seen in the <p> New or bare timber will need to be primed after sanding if you are to paint it . Sand paper is available with different degrees of coarseness of the surface . These are called grades . The grades are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grit . <p> New timber should be sanded with medium to fine paper of about 120 grade . After sanding there may be little indents which need to be filled - nail heads etc can spoil your paint finish . <p> A very popular myth amongst DIY enthusiasts is that paint can fill holes . This is not true ! All purpose filler will usually do the trick . <p> For a varnished surface , wood filler should be used which matches the colour of the wood as closely as possible . For large areas an electrical sander may be ideal , but do n't dwell too long in one area as this can take a lot off of the surface . Using rolls of abrasive paper makes it easy to cut to length to fit in most power sanders . <p> Where any woodwork meets a wall , there is often a gap . This gap can be filled very easily using flexible filler or decorators caulk in a special application tool called a sealant gun . <p> The sealed end of the tube is cut off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the end which is , more often than not , not large enough . It can be cut back further to allow a larger bead of filler to be released from the tube . <p> Cutting this nozzle at an angle makes application much easier . The tube is then inserted into the gun and the trigger squeezed to apply the filler . Once the gap is filled a wet finger can be run down the joint to " tidy " it up . Surplus filler can be removed easily with a damp rag . <p> As with anything else in the building industry , practice makes perfect , so do n't rush to your walls straight away , sacrifice a couple of pounds on an extra tube to practice with on some old offcuts . This little bit of preparation will save you hours of frustration later . <p> Primer is a thin paint which soaks into the grain slightly and takes some of the porosity out of the new , or bare timber . If an undercoat or top coat of paint is applied to bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too quickly and the paint itself does not get a chance to soak into the timber . The paint therefore dries on the surface and has no " roots " so to speak - it will quickly peel . <p> The primer itself can only soak in properly if the surface is free from grease and the grain is a little open to receive it . This can be achieved by ( if necessary ) washing down with a solution of sugar soap which will degrease the surface and then sanding with a medium grit sand paper . <p> The best sandpapers are aluminium oxide or silicone carbide papers which are a little more expensive but stay workable longer . It is always best to wrap the paper around a sanding block to keep a flat surface with which to sand . <p> If the timber has different contours , such as chamfered architrave or skirting , wrapping the paper round a firm sponge will allow the paper to get into and onto the contours . When sanding also remember to protect carpets etc with dust sheets . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated with knotting solution which will stop the sap leaking out of the timber and spoiling your paintwork . <p> For previously painted surfaces there is no need to remove all the paint if its is not flaking and is in a stable condition . <p> Clean thoroughly with sugar soap , sand down with a fine paper to give a key for the new paint , and then apply your paint . <p> An undercoat is always a good idea on previously painted surfaces as it will give you a much better finish and stops the paint " dragging " on the surface . <p> Wear a mask for sanding existing paintwork as older paints contained lead and this can be dangerous . <p> For the safest way , use wet and dry paper and keep it wet . If the existing paint is not in good condition , it may be as well to remove it . This is usually easiest done using a paint stripper together with a shaped shave hook or putty knife to get into corners and mouldings etc .

This is the only product we choose to use . <p> If only small areas of the paintwork need to be removed , sand them down ( providing you can be sure there is no lead in the paint ) as smoothly as possible creating a very gentle slope between the existing paint and the wood underneath .

Building your own wooden bird box can be a very rewarding project especially if you have young children . <h> Why are Bird Boxes Important for Nature ? <p> A bird box can be a great addition to your garden if you want to encourage birds and building your own means that you can tailor it specifically to attract the type of birds you want to see . <p> If you have young children they can be a fantastic introduction to the world of nature and can provide a great starting point for teaching how birds and animals rear their young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , teach them to feed and fly and then let them out into the big wide world . <p> With high winds and rain being common weather in the UK , offering birds a safe and warm place to nest and bring up their chicks ensures the survival of the UK 's bird population . <h> Types of Bird to Attract to Your Bird Box <p> A full list of the sizes of holes required for different birds is shown below but if you would like to attract bigger birds the front section can simply be sawn in half so the top half of the front is left open . <h> How to Build Your Bird Box <p> The following sections show you how to build a bird box and lists all of the wood you will need . We have also listed the tools , screws and nails you will need for this job . <p> How to Mark and Cut the Timber for Making Your Bird Box <p> All cuts needed for a bird box marked onto a piece of timber <p> The timber needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this withstands the weather much better than softwood .

Make sure you drill the pilot holes before you nail the rubber hinge into place . Without these pilot holes the nails may split your timber . <p> Drill pilot holes to fit the rubber hinge to stop the timber splitting <p> Drill an 8mm hole in the top corners of the back of the bird box .

This project will show you how to fix or fit a lock by changing the barrel of a night latch , which is commonly called a Yale lock . <p> There are any number of reasons why you may need to change the locks at home . Maybe you have lost your keys or want to prevent an ex partner from getting in . The easiest lock to change is what is commonly called the Yale lock . <p> This lock is actually called a night latch and the whole assembly does not need to be changed as the internal working latch , barrel or cylinder , can be changed independently of the rest of the mechanism . This allows you to use a new key which after all is the usual purpose of changing locks . <p> Front view of Yale lock <h> Changing or Replacing a Barrel Lock <p> The images below show the sequence involved in changing a yale lock or night latch and they should be used with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door you will see the lock box .

This is the plate which holds the whole lot to the door . <p> Back plate fixed to door <p> Sticking out of the back plate you will see a thin bar with grooves across its width . This is called the shank . Above the shank and to either side of it are two screw heads , usually brass , which hold the barrel or cylinder to the back plate ( seen in the above image ) . <p> Unscrew these screws and put them with the lock box screws ( seen in below image ) .

@@41624814 @1624814/ <p> Summary : Get the right Concrete Mix Ratio using our DIY concrete calculator . A guide on how to mix concrete for different applications , including foundations , garden walls and patios . Before mixing concrete use our mixing concrete ratio calculator to find out how much agrigate and cement you will need to buy to make your concrete . Answers DIY questions such as what is ballast , what sand should I use and how much sand to cement ratio do I need ? <p> Mixing concrete correctly is vital for durable and long lasting foundations and along with our concrete volume calculator to help you establish exactly what you need for your project . <h> What is Concrete <p> Concrete is a mixture of cement , sand ( fine aggregate ) , small stone or gravel ( coarse aggregate ) and water . It has many applications , from fence posts to motorway bases and , because of this ; there are many different ratios for the constituents to be mixed . <h> Concrete Mix Ratio for a C20 Mix <p> This project will concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts , and shallow retaining wall foundations . It is a medium strength mix and is known as a C20 mix . This means it will attain a strength equivalent to withstanding a compression of 20 Newtons per square mm after 28 days . This mix is not suitable for house foundations . For these please read our foundations project and ensure all the criteria are met , including the trench sizes and ground suitability . Then , unless specified otherwise by an architect or structural engineer , a C15P mix can be used which is comprised of 1 cement , 2 sand or very fine aggregate , and 6 coarse aggregate . <p> You will see that your answer will be given in cubic meters . Input your dimensions in meters ... I.E. 500mm = 0.50meters <h> Concrete Mix Ratio Calculator <p> Width ( in metres ) <p> Height ( in metres ) <p> Depth ( in metres ) <p> Cubic Metres <p> Cement <p> Sharp Sand <p> Gravel <p> Water ( litres ) <p> Enter your dimensions to calculate the volume of concrete needed for the project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials necessary . <p> Please remember that water volumes are approximate and care should be taken when adding this . Also please remember that cement can damage your skin , so wear the appropriate safety equipment and clothing when using it . <h> How to Mix Concrete <p> Aggregates <p> A bag of ready mixed aggregate can be bought in most builders merchants or it can be bought loose and delivered to you by lorry . Buying it loose is generally cheaper and , if you have the room to " drop " , it is a more practical option . Check out your local builders merchants for some fantastic deals on bulk sand , cement and aggregates . <p> In most areas of the country , this mix of aggregates ( sharp/grit sand and small stones or gravel ) is called " ballast " , in the West Country it is most often called +inch or 10mm to dust . This describes the sieved state of the stone as it comes out of the quarry crushers . <p> Cement <p> Cement can be bought ( mostly in 25kg bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all builders merchants . It is crushed limestone , blended with other raw materials ( sometimes shale and or sand ) ground into a powder and then heated in a kiln . This process produces a cement clinker which is mixed with Gypsum and ground further to produce the cement . <p> Water <p> Water is a very important part of the mix and the volume of water used can dictate the strength of the finished mix . On site or in ready mixed concrete yards a " slump test " is used to test the water content of the concrete . <p> Testing Cement Mix <p> A cone made of steel is used for this test . The cone is 300mm high , with a top opening of 100mm diameter and a bottom opening of 200mm diameter . The mixed concrete is placed into the cone through the top , a bar is used to compact the concrete and remove air voids , within the cone . The cone is then lifted clear . By laying the bar on top of the cone , it is possible to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approx 50mm is acceptable for C20 concrete . <p> Concrete Mix Ratio for a C20P Mix <p> The proportions of materials for a C20P ( P = Portland cement ) mix are 1 x cement , 2 x fine aggregate ( sand ) and 4 x coarse aggregate . If you are using premixed ballast , then 6 of these are mixed with 1 part cement . In an ideal world , where everything is delivered dry , then a water to cement ratio of approximately 0.55 should be used .... For example , if you require 25kg of cement in your mix , then 25 x 0.55 = 13.75kg ( liters ) of water . This is the maximum amount of water that should be used . <p> Most of the time however , the sand etc is damp , or even wringing wet , and care has to be taken to ensure your mix does not become too sloppy . It should be able to support itself , almost fully , in a heap on the shovel . <p> If you are only needing a small amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing concrete path it makes no sense to mix up a great load . To these ends , your local DIY shed should stock a range of ready mixed DIY concretes ideal for this job . <p> When mixing concrete you will find that , while the ballast will heap on your shovel , the cement will slide off . This will give you incorrect proportions when mixing ... 1 part of cement should be equal to 1 part ballast . It is better to measure your quantities using a bucket to ensure correct proportions ( if an exact mix is required repeatedly a builders bucket should be used to maintain consistancy . In the video below the mix is being used for a sub base and a slight variation in the mix will not matter a great deal ) . <p> Concrete Mix By Hand <p> Mixing by hand is a bad idea unless you only have a tiny amount to do . Only very rarely will you be able to get the cement evenly distributed throughout the mix and this leads to weak concrete . <p> Using Cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool hire shops , and if you have a lot to do it often pays to buy your own . Once your project is at an end you will always have the option of selling the mixer which is what most self-builders do . <p> To ensure a well mixed batch we suggest you add your ingredients to the mixer in the following order . 75% of the water followed by 50% of the aggregates . Add all of the cement and then the rest of the aggregates and the remainder of the water . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

We show you how to locate the mains hot and cold water feeds , remove all the transit bolts from the new machine and connect up the waste water pipe . We then show you how to test your new washing machine for leaks , turn it on and run a short test cycle and then adjust the feet to get it level so that it does n't wobble during the spin cycle . <p> These are the steps required to remove your old washing machine and then fit your new washing machine into the remaining space .

It will still have pipes and cables that are connected so do n't pull it all the way ; just enough so that you can see and get to what you have to disconnect . <p> Disconnect the water supplies , both hot and cold . This should be easy done as typically they will be hand-tightened screw connectors ( as shown in the picture ) on the water inlet hoses .

There are guidelines to follow to make the installation of electrical cables as safe as possible for you and anyone else entering your home . It is as well to note at this point that if you are chasing walls for the installation of a new circuit that this work may be covered by Part P of the building regulations " see our project for more info . <p> Electrical chase cut in wall <h> The Simple Rules for Cutting Chases in Walls <p> Vertical chases should not be any deeper than one third of the total wall thickness <p> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one third of the thickness of the skin they are being placed in <p> No chases , horizontal or vertical , should be made back to back <p> Horizontal chases should be no deeper than one sixth of the thickness of the wall thickness <p> In a cavity wall horizontal chases should be no deeper than one sixth of the thickness of the skin they are in <p> Chases must go from a to b in a straight line and diagonal chases should not be used <p> Common sense really " If the chase is too deep it will impair the stability of the wall . If chases are back to back , there is no wall ! It must always be remembered that the person doing the electrical work may not be the same person who wants to hang a picture on that wall or put a serving hatch or window in it . All chases therefore should be sensibly placed to give everyone a chance of working out where they are in relation to lights , switches , sockets and appliance points . <h> How to Chase out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most electricians will own a chasing tool . The chasing tool seen in the image below is basically an angle grinder with two parallel blades . The depth of the blades can be set , a hoover hose plugged into the end and off you go . They are still dusty , even with the hoover , but the time they save is worth the cleaning up afterwards . <p> Make sure you set the depth of the cut to a little more than the depth of the conduit you will be running in the chase to allow you to fill over the top of it once it 's fixed in place . <p> You may also find it easier , in order to keep your chase line straight , to mark your lines on the wall with a pencil so that you can follow them . <p> As ever , always think safety " ensure that you are wearing protective goggles and gloves beofre you start . <p> chase cutting tools <p> Chasing tools in the above image : <p> Chase cutter " blades set to single chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolster <p> You can see the blades for the chase cutter in the image above set to a single chase as are most cutters . When the chase lines are cut you will need a hammer and bolster to chop out the middle but this is really easy as long as the chase blades are not set too far apart . You can also see a hammer and an assortment of chisels in the image . It is now possible to buy a chasing tool which fits onto your electric drill . <p> Once you have cut your chase you can now run in your cables and conduit ( ensure that your conduit is the correct width ! ) . Remove the front cap by prising it off and then fix the conduit in place and run your cables down . With the cables in place replace the conduit cap by pushing it on until it clicks in place . <h> Filling Chases <p> Filling a chase when the conduit and cables are in is a matter of personal taste .

We then paint the chase with undiluted PVA adhesive to give the mortar the best chance of adhering to the conduit in the chase . The mortar is pushed well into the chase and the chase is filled . A trowel is then placed on both sides of the wall , straddling the chase and this is pulled upwards to cut off any surplus mortar . <p> Chases can also be filled with a plaster called patching plaster or One Coat plaster .

You may find it difficult to sell your home if it is discovered that you have new wiring i.e. blue , brown , green/yellow , with no certificate of installation . <p> Generally electric bathroom heaters fall into categories such as infrared/quartz heaters , fan heaters and electric panel radiators . Other forms of bathroom heating include towel radiators , more elaborate is an under floor heating system . Naturally these choices will be subject to your budget and preferences for automated heating , rather than manual on demand . <p> Types of bathroom heating : <p> Infrared or Quartz heaters <p> Fan heaters <p> Electric panel heaters <p> Towel radiators <p> Underfloor heating <p> Since 2008 an amendment to the electrical regulations as aforementioned , stipulated zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be positioned .

From the fused spur to the consumer unit can be via the ring main but discuss this with your qualified electrician before starting the work . Generally all heaters should be run into a fused spur , no matter what the type . <p> The down flow fan heater will provide a very quick warm up within an average bathroom , containing bath , basin and toilet .

This project covers the basic techniques required in order to know when you should be using a soldering iron and how to get your soldering job done . <p> A soldering iron is a hand held tool used , with the use of solder , for heating two pieces of metal to a working temperature in order to join those two pieces together . <h> Soldering Irons <p> Soldering irons can come in a gun shaped design which people should find easy to use . The pencil design model is generally used for more delicate types of work . <p> Hand held soldering iron <p> A soldering iron has a heated element at the tip of a heat insulated handle , normally powered by mains electricity or battery . <p> The heat tip element works through the process of resistive material having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an electrical bar fire just not as aggressive or quite so hot . <p> Before using your soldering iron you will need to go through the process of Tinning ' , which is the process of heating up and coating the tip of your soldering tool with a layer of solder . This increases the efficiency of heat transfer from your soldering iron . <p> For most soldering work which involves electric circuitry , a 15w " 30w device will be suitable , any device more powerful than that might do damage to your proposed piece of work . <p> If you are considering doing more substantial soldering then a soldering iron which uses a 40w or stronger supply of power will be needed . <h> Materials and Tools Needed for Soldering <p> When soldering pieces together you will need the following materials : <p> Solder Wire <p> A fusible metal alloy used to join two metal surfaces together . These come in different alloy ratios depending on what type of metals you are trying to solder . Be careful when using solder , there can be some spitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with your skin . Check with your supplier that you have the right kind of solder for the job . <p> Solder wire <p> Flux <p> This is a chemical cleaning agent that helps the flow of the solder when worked with the soldering iron . This product will create smoke when being used which is normal . <p> Solder flux <p> Soldering Iron Stand <p> This is used to hold your hot soldering iron when not in use . It is also a good idea to have a damp cloth to hand to clean dirt from your piece of work . <p> Soldering is used in many ways but mostly in the areas of electronics , jewellery making and stained glass windows . These other types of soldering may require higher powered soldering irons depending on the two metals to be joined . <p> Soldering iron stand <p> When you start to solder you will quickly come to recognise a good solder from bad . It is quite easy to identify . A dull solder usually means that you have not created a solid solder action ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tried to join . A bright and clean solder surface usually means a successful soldering . <p> If you are just joining two items together ( for example two halves of an electrical wire ) then the following procedure should be followed : <p> The two lengths of wire should firstly be joined by simply twisting them together . <p> When you are ready to solder , start by heating the wire from below . As heat rises through the wire , wetting the tip of the soldering iron may help with the speed the wire heats as well . <p> When you are ready to apply the solder , apply your solder just above the iron , once you have reached melting point the solder will flow into the joint area with ease . If not you need more heat . <p> Continue to apply the solder till you see no more wire visible . <p> Once you have completed your soldering process you will need to cover the join with an insulated sheath or insulating tape .

How to plumb in and connect a washing machine waste pipe and make sure that it is fitted correctly . In this project typically the same information applies to washing machines and it does to dishwashers . <p> Installing waste pipes for washing machines and dishwashers can be done fairly simply by using long hoses and connecting them into the waste trap of your sink . We do not advise this method as it can take up a great deal of room in your under sink cupboards and the hoses usually need to be extra long which means they have a tenancy to sag and allow stale water to sit in them . <p> Kitchen appliance waste trap <p> Another problem is that the only way to connect a washing machine or dishwasher hose to a sink waste outlet is to use a jubilee clip onto a nozzle which is tapered . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine and dishwasher waste water is under quite a bit of pressure when it is expelled by the machine . This could force the hose off . <p> Assembeled machine waste trap <p> Another , much bigger problem with installing appliance hoses into sink wastes is the noise ! <p> Washing machine waste positioned under a kitchen sink <p> We believe it is much better to spend a bit more time getting the waste pipes done properly so the machines waste can be taken via its own trap to the main drainage outside . There are many solutions to getting rid of the waste water from the various sources in your home , the following project pages may help you further with this : <p> A washing machine or dishwasher waste is usually made with 40mm plastic pipe . We always prefer to use solvent weld or compression fittings with the waste pipe because once it is made , it stays together and there is no chance of leaky joints . <p> The image above ( apologies for the quality of the image but DIY Doctor is a company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw pretty pictures but have never done the job in their life ) shows the sink waste ( A ) and the isolation valves ( C ) which turn the washing machine and dishwasher on and off . You will note there is a hot and cold valve so these are obviously for the washing machine . <p> Due to health and safety regulations a dishwasher must only be plumbed in to a cold water supply . This is so the machine can heat the water to a recommended minimum of 120 degrees Fahrenheit ( approx 50 degrees Celsius ) which will eliminate all the bacteria . Item ( B ) is the washing machine waste pipe with the trap at the bottom . <p> The reason for the trap is to stop foul air getting back into the room as explained in our project on how waste traps work . The washing machine waste pipe , once installed , must deliver its water to the foul drainage system outside your home . This is the same system which takes the toilet and basin waste . It is illegal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the water collected by your gutters . <p> We always try to get the top of the waste pipe to a level which is 100mm under the worktop . If there is no worktop then the top of the waste pipe should finish at approximately 50mm down from the top of the washing machine . <p> The washing machine waste hose usually comes with a pre set bend which takes the hose into the stand pipe about 200mm . The pipe should be clipped to the wall at least twice in its vertical length and at every 400mm along its horizontal length . Any sagging of the pipework can lead to puddles of stagnant water in the pipe which can cause horrible smells . To take the waste pipe out of the wall see the projects above where you will learn how to drill through your wall easily , how to connect waste pipes to the main drainage and how to connect access plugs so you never have to worry about blockages . <p> A final way of connecting washing machine and dishwasher wastes is by using an in-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tube shape , about 250mm long which fit onto a standard 40mm pipe with a compression fitting . They contain a thin membrane which opens to allow the waste water through but immediately closes again to stop foul air getting back in . This waste is called a HepVO self sealing waste valve . <p> self-sealing waste trap <p> Self sealing waste traps can be put in horizontally or vertically and can be used in bathrooms as well as kitchens . Bends and adapters can be ordered with the fitting so it can be applied in almost any situation . Installing a self sealing vent , because it reduces negative pressure in the waste system , can be used to remove the noises associated with gurgling pipes and basins . It is easy to install and removes the need for air admittance valves . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

In this DIY guide you will learn all about forming openings through walls and how to do this for both load bearing walls and non load bearing walls . You will also learn how to support a load bearing wall while you insert your concrete lintel , how to rebuild and then damp proof cavities in external walls and also how to rebuild above a new opening in a non load bearing wall . <p> The wall you intend to open up may not just be supporting the weight of the wall above it . There may be floor joists fixed into the wall and in some cases , roofing beams and rafters . <p> The combined weight of these things will need to be taken into consideration when working out the size of the lintel you need to support it and we strongly advise using the services of an architect to establish the lintel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walls <p> Insert Steel Needles to Support Weight <p> The load above must be supported at all times . It is very dangerous to make the hole and hope everything stays put until you get a lintel in . Before you take a single brick out of the wall make sure everything is supported . <p> Do this by drilling or making holes as close to the ceiling as you can and inserting very strong steels or timbers through them so that these needles stick out either side of the wall by at least 18 inches to give you room to work later on . <p> These needles should be inserted every 2 feet across the full width of the opening you are to make . For example a 3-foot doorway will need a 4-foot lintel inserted above it to allow 6 inches bearing either side . <p> It will therefore require 1 needle in a central position , and one at 2 feet either side of that . We prefer to use steel needles , and your local builders merchants may stock reinforcing steel to a 50mm diameter If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using steel is much easier as the holes for these bars can simply be drilled with a 50mm core drill bit which can be hired , with a strong drill , from your local tool hire centre . <p> Support the Steel Needles With Timbers Head Trees <p> When your needles are in , a strong timber ( say 3-inch x 3 inch ) with no cracks , needs to be placed up to the underside of them at each side of the wall . These are called head trees and are held up by props ( Acroprops ) from your local tool hire shop , again at 2-foot centres . <p> It is ok to have one prop at the end of each needle , but for a large opening that means a great many props , and using a head tree allows you to reduce the props by having one prop in the centre of each pair of needles .

This may mean forcing in some sand and cement mortar and even banging in some pieces of roofing slate , which has an incredibly high compressive strength . <p> Any moisture in the cavity will be directed to the external skin of masonry and can run through the weep holes you must leave in it .

Use this guide to learn more about feature walls and help you decide if one is right for your room . <p> If you 're thinking of redecorating or want to give a room a new look , creating a feature wall is a really easy way to create a fresh feel without the bother and expense of redecorating the whole room . <h> What is a Feature Wall and Why Should I Have One ? <p> If all of the walls of a room are decorated in the same colour or pattern , it creates harmony but can be a bit plain . By picking out one wall and giving it a different , bolder colour , you can change the mood of a room or highlight a particular feature . <p> Feature walls are most often used when the rest of the room is decorated with a fairly neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint it a different colour , or wallpaper it with a bold pattern , creating a feature . <p> A feature wall can also be used to create a more defined space in an open-plan area . If you have children you might create a play area , or in a living-diner you might highlight the dining area . <h> Picking a Wall <p> Deciding on which wall to have as your feature will depend on the room you are decorating . Here are some ideas : <p> Bedrooms <p> The most common wall to feature in the bedroom is the wall behind the headboard of the bed . This highlights the main function of the room , plus having the feature behind you while you sleep means you wo n't be bothered by complex patterns or bright colours . <p> For children 's bedrooms you can buy stick-on characters and pictures to create a fun mural . <p> Living Rooms <p> If you have a fireplace you can choose this wall to make it stand out more . <p> Alternatively you could choose to highlight alcoves or a chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you the best scope , but attention will be drawn to the wall so make sure it can stand the scrutiny . <p> Create a cozy seating area with contrasting warm tones . <h> Choosing a Colour or Pattern <p> Knowing you 're only decorating one wall gives you freedom to be a bit more daring . If it does n't look right , you can always re-do it without wasting too much time or money . You 'll need to take into account the colours in the rest of the room of course " maybe you 've always wanted a pink room and think this is your chance , but if the rest of the room is sunshine yellow you 're just going to create a headache ! <p> Using paint is obviously a much easier option than wallpaper " if you 're going to be brave and go for a patterned paper , make sure you 're confident in your papering skills or get a professional in . See our Wallpapering Project for help with hanging wallpaper . <p> Even if you have plain , pale walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as devoid of colour , so when picking your feature colour it is often a good idea to draw from objects in the room " a painting , an ornament or a rug . <p> A good way of deciding on a colour if you 're unsure is to buy a match-pot and use it to paint a piece of white A3 paper . You can then hold this up against the wall and against other items in the room to see if it goes . Make sure you try this at different times of the day so you can see how natural and artificial lights affect the colour . <p> Do n't be fooled into thinking a feature wall has to be a bold , dark colour . You can use a darker colour for your accent , but bear in mind that colours can create optical illusions , and a dark colour will make the wall appear closer . This can be used to your advantage if you have a long , thin wall . Use lighter colours to create a more spacious feeling . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a similar shade to the rest of the walls " perhaps the same basic colour but a few tones darker or lighter . For a bolder , more energetic feel , try picking a colour which contrasts with existing decor . Use a colour wheel to pick colours that are opposite one another ( complimentary colours ) . <p> Colour Wheel <p> Feature Wall <h> Other Options <p> If painting or papering your walls is not a viable option , there are other ways of creating a feature . If you like the idea of a bold patterned wallpaper but are n't sure about using it on a whole wall , you could buy a piece of board and cover it on the paper , then hang it on the wall . This is a good way of creating an instant piece of art to add interest to an otherwise bare wall . <p> Photo canvases are a great way to create a really personalised feature " get a portrait of your family or a favourite holiday snap blown up to a large size and printed on canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lighting is another really easy way to create a feature out of nothing . An unusual lampshade that throws interesting shadows or allows light to reflect off of crystals can give a room a really different feel . <p> Floral Feature Wallpaper <p> Cushions and curtains are also great for creating a different mood . Bold , heavy drapes around a picture window will make it into a real feature , or a collection of colourful cushions in an empty corner can instil sumptuous undertones. 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

We prepared the ceiling by using a floor scraper on a pole to scrape off the deepest ridges of Artex as this makes the X-Tex go further . <p> Science not Solvents from the Eco Solutions range of products <h> Applying X-Tex to the Surface <p> We applied the X-Tex using a 4-inch emulsion brush but some decorators we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick layer on the surface . The video shows how X-Tex can be applied with both a brush and a scraper . <h> Removal of Artex or Other Textured Coatings <p> Leave the X-Tex on the surface for about 40 minutes and then test a small area to se if the coating is ready to come off . The scraper you use should simply slide under the Artex which you can tap into a bucket for disposal . Leaving the X-Tex on too long can result is it soaking through to the layer underneath but careful removal should cause no damage . Our site test was done directly onto plasterboard which is the most temperamental of surfaces and apart from a couple of small " nicks " which can be easily filled , the surface was absolutely ideal for painting or plastering afterwards . <p> X-Tex for removing Artex and other textured coatings safely <h> X-Tex , Artex , Asbestos , health and safety <p> We note here that Artex applied before 1970 very likely contains some asbestos fibres so if you believe that to be the case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artex . X-Tex is the best and by far the safest solution to removing asbestos based Artex as there is no dust and all of the asbestos contaminates are held in a stabilised way .

We review some of the products that you can use and in which circumstances they should be used in order to keep your timber decking , exterior timber and garden furniture in tip top condition all year round . <p> Timber decking and garden furniture can be oiled , stained or sealed . There are no hard and fast rules about which you should use , so it is really down to personal preference . We prefer to oil as it brings out the natural texture of the timber , but in certain circumstances this might not be appropriate or the most attractive thing to do . <p> Treat Decking to make it last and look great <p> Whichever approach you take , first it will be necessary to clean the timber and the easiest way to do this is with a power washer for decks ( and some larger items of furniture ) or a bucket of soapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mop , bucket and good scrubbing brush is a great way to clean timber decking . See our power washing project for more information . <p> There are dedicated products that can be used to clean decking ( and keep it clean ) . These can help to reduce the amount of elbow grease that is needed to get the decking cleaned . It is a great idea for ongoing cleaning as these solutions have chemicals that kill and suppress mould growth . Most of the leading brand names will produce a version of their own decking cleaner , and so far we have found them to all be pretty effective , and much the same in terms of performance . <h> Treating Decking With Oil <p> First treat the timber with some kind of universal wood preserver as shown below . This will make sure the timber is unaffected by rot and wood boring insects etc . Please be careful if using preserver near ponds as it is not good for fish ! <p> Most DIY stores these days have proprietary treatment products for decking and furniture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All can be used to treat and preserve the timber . The linseed oil is particularly good for hardwoods . Oil should be applied regularly , about 3 times per year , to get the very best out of your decking . <h> Treating Decking and Furniture with Linseed Oil <p> Linseed Oil in a very versatile and useful product . It is the extract of the flax seed and can also be known as Flaxseed . Not only is linseed critical to the proper seasoning of a cricket bat , it can also be used as a food additive or nutritional supplement ( due to the high omega 3 fatty acid content ) . It has some be used as a paint binder , the oil in putty , the glue ' for gilding and even the primary ingredient in traditional Lino flooring . <p> It is very safe to use and has an odour that most people enjoy . The linseed penetrates the wood and does not provide a surface barrier as a varnish would do . It also will allow water to penetrate and therefore can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decking or wood with a universal preserver before applying the linseed . Linseed will not provide protection from scratches but it does show the grain of the wood and will weather over time to a very natural look which you can not achieve with any other finish . <p> Weathered Decking finished with Linseed Oil <p> A very common question is , what is the difference between raw and boiled linseed oil and which should I use on my decking ? One of the major issues with linseed oil is that take a very long time to dry and before a second coat can be applied . To address this issue additives ( mineral spirits , Japan drier , and turpentine ) have been mixed into the linseed oil . <p> Boiled linseed oil has not actually been boiled but has had additives mixed into the raw linseed oil to promote the drying properties of the oil . It is described as boiled ' as traditionally oils had been boiled to alter their properties and this generally refers to the changed properties as if they had been boiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raw linseed oil is simple the unaltered linseed . <p> You can use whichever type of linseed oil on your decking ; the deciding factor is generally drying time . In practice it is recommended to use a boiled linseed as we want to get the job done and admire our handy work ! <p> You can apply linseed oil with a rag or a brush . Apply liberally covering all exposed surfaces . Do n't allow the linseed to pool or form puddles but try to get an even layer across all the wood . Some areas of the wood will absorb the oil more quickly ; there is no need to be concerned about this and apply a little extra here as the oil is absorbed . <p> An hour or so after application give the surface a rub down with another dry cloth . This will spread an pooled oil out evenly and give you a better finish in the long run . After a further 24 hours it will be time to apply a further coat if this is necessary . Subsequent coats can be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before with a dry cloth after about an hour . <p> Always follow the application guidelines provided by the manufacturer , as drying times will vary depending on the composition of the oil and the type of the wood . Humidity and temperatures will also have an influence . <p> Application rates will vary greatly depending on the wood and how thirsty ' it is , but typical coverage would be between 6 to 12 Sq meters per litre . Again , follow the manufactures guidance , but it is not a major issue if you get this wrong , as excess can be wiped away relatively easily and more coats can be applied as required . <h> Using Danish Oil to Treat Decking and Exterior Timber <p> Danish Oil is a wood finish made from either Tung Oil or Linseed Oil . Other plant extract oils can be used too ( mineral oil , Tung oil , linseed oil , poppy oil , cotton oil , sunflower oil , among others ! ) . It usually consists of two thirds to a half oil , with the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of both the varnish and the oil without the disadvantages . It is hard wearing and long lasting without being high gloss and slippery , it allows the wood to breath ' but is also water resistant . It is easy to apply and will dry relatively quickly without a strong odour . <p> Water on wood treated with Danish Oil <p> For decking it is recommended that the Danish Oil that you use has a look varnish content as this is what can cause a glossy and slippery finish to your decking . This finish is often desired in furniture or other exterior wood surfaces where in might be a more appropriate choice . <p> You can use either a rag or a brush ; we find a rag can be easier , although we do recommend the use of some disposable gloves , and please dispose of the rag safely . Amounts and coverage vary between product and the type of wood that is being applied to so follow the instruction on your chosen product . As a rule of thumb , you should expect that 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drying time between coats will also be affected by humidity and temperature , but leave between 3 and 24 hours . <p> Danish Oil get its name from the finish that was created for Scandinavian furniture which became popular in the middle of the 20th century . The low sheen finish became popular and the term Danish Oil came into use to describe the effect . It then began to be applied beyond furniture . <h> All in One Decking Treatments and Varnishing Decking <p> While we are not keen on varnishing decking , this is an appropriate treatment for some furniture and exterior woods . Varnish will protect the wood , but it will create a glossy and more dangerously , a very slippery surface . Clearly this is not what you want on your decking . <p> There are , however All in One decking treatments which combine all the elements of a decking stain to colour the wood , the protective qualities a wood preserver and the sealing effect of linseed or Danish oils . In a single application you can achieve a similar finish and protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . You are limited in choice , particularly in colour , although the ranges available are getting much better now . <p> These all on one products are excellent for treating new decking as they will provide a quick and durable finish . They can be harder to match to existing decking when touching up and/or making repairs . <p> While there is a huge range of products there are no hard and fast rules about which should be used when . Ultimately it comes down to personal preference . This is why we recommend testing a few solutions on some off-cuts of decking to work out what you like and which will suit the environment best . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

At that time no move was made to harmonize the colours for fixed installations . The rest of Europe however was changing over very quickly .

Another name is Quick fit plumbing which does exactly the same job and also sometimes it 's known as Push Fit fittings . The time saved using SPEEDFIT- fittings and pipe is absolutely fantastic . <p> Many die hard traditional plumbers will not use it but as the technology has improved and all fittings now comply with all British Standards , we are happy to use it . It is not ideal in places where it can be seen because even the best plumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of pipework , complete with fittings , look neat . The pipe does tend to curl and bow a little and the bends etc .... are a little awkward . <p> The fittings , by necessity , are bulky and unsightly but my goodness when you can complete the plumbing in a bathroom in half the usual time you have saved your customer a fortune . <p> Installation time is reduced by a massive 40% and the flexibility allows you to get pipework through places where you would not normally be able to access . This can save a lot of unsightly surface work . <p> It is really important not to over bend the pipe as it can kink which will reduce the water flow . If you have a tight corner to get round , use a fitting rather than try to bend the pipe too much . <p> Note : It should be noted that these types of fittings should not be used with chrome plated pipes . This is due to the fact that the gripping mechanism or ring inside the fitting is not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joint . <p> Concealed plumbing for shower using SPEEDFIT- pipes and fittings <h> Benefits of SPEEDFIT- Fittings <p> Because the pipes and fittings are plastic there is no scale build up and the elasticity of the pipe greatly reduces the likelihood of pipes bursting in freezing conditions although they should certainly still be lagged . The pipes are metal free and non toxic and being able to use long lengths of pipework reduces the number of fittings required . <p> SPEEDFIT- should not be used for fuel oil , compressed air or gas installations . <p> The image above shows some SPEEDFIT- plumbing in place for a shower valve to be fitted when the studs have been plaster boarded and the tiling done . <p> It 's flexibility allows for easy adjustment and anyone who has ever fitted a mixer valve for a shower will be grateful for this . Note the two stopcocks at the bottom which will be hidden by the bath . Due to teh ease of use with these fittings , there is no point not fitting isolation valves whenever one might be needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fittings are quite a bit more expensive than copper fittings but again , the labour saving element makes up for that . <p> SPEEDFIT- is interchangeable with copper so any run that is to be visible can simply be carried on in neat copper plumbing with soldered joints . <p> The performance specifications are within the guidelines of normal domestic activities and this includes central heating . <p> Before we go into the project and look at how to use SPEEDFIT- , here are a few things you must not do : <p> Never use a hacksaw to cut SPEEDFIT- pipe , always use a pipe cutter shown below . If you push a pipe with a rough end into one of these fitting the burrs may damage the O ring which will lead to a leak <p> Do not use damaged or scuff pipes <p> Do not push your fingers into any fitting as the teeth may cut you <p> Use pipe cutters when cutting plastic pipe <h> Making Connections With Plastic Pipe Fittings <p> The pipe is not as rigid as copper and when the fittings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipe can become a little compressive . <p> For this reason every time we use a pipe fitting , whether it is a straight coupling , a bend , an isolation valve or a stop-cock , we push pipe inserts ( as seen in the below image ) into the end of the pipe . This keeps the pipe rigid and will not allow the fitting to crush the end . <p> Insert for pipe ends <h> Different Types of SPEEDFIT- Fitting <p> The image below shows a range of the available fittings and just below the image is a description of what the fitting is for and how it should be used . <p> Different types of fittings available <p> A : A short length of pipe showing a pipe insert at each end . Pipe inserts must be used every time a joint is effected . The insert gives additional strength to the end of the pipe as it is clamped between the teeth of the fittings .

They are also very useful for repairing a burst pipe when the burst has been cut out . The top f is a flexible tap connector with an isolating valve fitted in line <p> G : A stop end .

As stated , do n't be tempted to use a hacksaw , use a pair of plastic pipe cutters ( as seen below ) . <p> Once your pipe is cut to length , push a pipe insert in to the end that will be pushed into the fitting . Before you do so , check both the insert and the pipe itself for any score marks that could cause leaks and also for any burrs or rough edges that could damage the O-ring in the fitting . <p> Make sure the insert is pushed in firmly and it fits nice and snug . If it is sloppy or can be moved easily it is not the correct one and the chances are that the joint will leak . <p> Plastic pipe insert <p> Before you go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea to make a mark on the pipe to the depth of the fitting so that you know it has been pushed all the way up to the pipe stop . <p> Unscrew the locking mechanism slightly so that there is a gap between the screw cap and the collar and hold the end of the pipe so that the tip is level with the collar and then mark the pipe with a pen where it is level with the top of the screw cap . This is how far the pipe needs to be pushed in to create a suitable seal . <p> Push pipe in to fitting up to depth mark <p> One thing to be aware of is that the O-rings within these fittings can be easily damaged if you simply ram the pipe in . To reduce teh risk of this happening , as you push the pipe in , twist it . This will also help to get the pipe down until it touches the pipe stop a bit easier . <p> Ensure the twist lock cap is in its unlock position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previously mentioned twisting action and once pushed all the way in , screw the cap down until it touches the collar . Do n't overtighten it , it just needs pinching up . <p> Once your fitting has been assembled , hold the fitting in one hand and pipe in the other and give it a gentle tug as it you were trying to pull it apart . If all is well there should be no movement at all but if there iis , check the fitting and ensure that the locking twist cap is tightened correctly . <p> You have now completed your first SPEEDFIT- fitting ! <p> As we mentioned earlier in this project page , aside from the Twist and Lock fittings there are standard push-fit fittings . These are pretty much the same except they do n't feature any twist-lock caps . The pipe is simply pushed in to the fitting up to the collar and the gripping mechanism automatically locks on to the pipe and holds it in place . <p> Standard push-fit fitting <h> Disconnecting SPEEDFIT- Plumbing Fittings <p> Disconnecting a fitting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each of the two types has a slightly different process : <p> Standard Fittings : Simply push the collet down squarely until it touches the main body of the fitting . This will release the gripping mechanism and allow you to gently pull the pipe out <p> Twist Lock Fittings : Unscrew the cap so that it is loose and then push down on the collet with equal force all the way around to that it depresses squarely until it touches the body of the fitting and then gently pull the pipe out <p> Collet gripping mechanism release collar <p> The collet can in some cases be quite tricky to push back down and in these cases , a collet release tool may come in handy . <p> Collet release tool <p> SPEEDFIT- has really turned the plumbing world on its head as it has made DIY plumbing much easier for those that have little to no experience of plumbing .

When it comes to the construction aspect , the purpose of the cavity wall was to split the more traditional 9 inch think solid wall into two parts to improve it 's weather resistance , producing one 4 1/2 external weather-shielding wall and one 4 1/2 inch internal load bearing wall . <p> This new cavity also stopped any water from getting from the outside skin to the inside and also stopped an extremely cold surface outside being transferred to the inside . <p> Wall ties effectively tie the two walls together , improving stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing capabilities of both walls . <h> How do I Know if I Have a Cavity Wall ? <p> There are a few ways that you can tell this . One method is to use a long masonry drill to drill through the outer wall or your property . If during the drilling process the drill goes slack after around 90mm and then starts to bite again this is a good indication that you have a cavity as the drill will stoop biting when it reaches the cavity gap and then start again when it hits the inner cavity wall . <p> Another method is to look at the pattern of the brickwork in the wall and how the bricks have been laid . If they have all been laid lengthways along the full width of the wall this is a positive sign of a cavity . <p> If they have been laid in such a way that you have one brick laid lengthways and then next to it you have one brick that has been laid width ways then this is a good sign that the wall is solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can identify whether your wall has a cavity or is solid <p> Vertical or horizontal cracks in brickwork Normally caused by expansion of corroded wall ties . As the tie corrodes , the rust or metallic oxide that is produced takes up more space than the original tie did and due to this the bricks above and below the tie are forced apart cracking the mortar bed . If this problem is wide-spread within your property you will normally see this occurring every six horizontal course of brick ( 450mm ) if the original ties have been spaced correctly . <p> Bulging Brickwork This can occur when the corrosion of wall ties and the resultant expansion in their mass forces the outer wall skin either up or down . If there is no where for it to expand into then the brickwork itself will have no choice but to bulge outwards . <p> Cracks or Separation of Window Reveals This issue normally manifests itself on the internal walls of a property . When expansion and movement is caused , gaps and cracking can appear between the window frame and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also appear as inconsistent . <p> Lintels Lifting or Sagging Again , due to expansion movement , lintels can either be pushed upwards or downwards . This can also be the same for window sills . <h> Wall Tie Failure and How This can Happen <p> Here follows a breakdown of the two most common causes of wall tie failure : <p> Corrosion of Wall Ties <p> In most cases this will simply be age . Over time the mortar bed between bricks or blocks that each wall tie is set into changes on a chemical level due to carbonation . Through this the mortar itself begins to attack the wall ties and cause a build-up of iron oxide ( or rust as it 's more commonly known ) . As each tie oxidises , layers of rust are formed and expand outwards , pushing apart the mortar beds and causing visible cracks . <p> The visible cracks are more common when twisted or sheet steel wall ties have been used in a more sturdy and solid mixed mortar bed . <p> In other situations where the mortar bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall ties due to corrosion may not be visible on the outer wall , apart from the possibility of bulges and you may have no idea that the wall is in fact essentially flapping in the wind . <p> Wall Ties Incorrectly Fixed or Installed During Construction <p> Aside from age and erosion , another common failure point for wall ties is incorrect installation . This occurs during the construction stage where they may not have been correctly inserted in the mortar beds between brick or block courses , the incorrect length ties may have been used meaning that they are too short and do not sit far enough into each mortar bed , they may also not have been placed at the correct spacing e.g. too far apart vertically or horizontally and in some cases they may not have been added at all ! <h> Different Types of Wall Tie <p> Over the years there has been a great many different materials used in making wall ties . In most cases the age and location of the property will dictate how its wall ties have been constructed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently , stainless steel is the chosen type but historically mild steel , copper , wrought iron and cast iron have been used . Wrought and cast iron ties tend to be quite heavily constructed and if found to be corroded will in most cases need to be removed . Copper ties are quite rare mostly down to their cost but are in fact very hardy and long lasting <p> Brick or Terracotta Found rarely and normally isolated to specific regions . They also have several disadvantages in that they have been found to create cold bridges to inner walls allowing moisture and cold to travel along them . <p> Stone or Slate Again , not commonly found and come with some disadvantages that include a tendency to snap and crack when movement is present . However , they are quite resistant to corrosion and if featured in a property where there is no evidence of movement should last a good long while . Once again however , this type of tie can transfer moisture and cold to the inner skin . <p> In most properties dating from the 1930 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to wall tie construction and in normal circumstances the mild steel used was either left as-is ( uncoated ) or coated in a bitumen type substance . As technology and awareness of rusting and corrosion developed , zinc and galvanised became the coating of choice providing the ties with a water and moisture resistant outer layer to further their longevity and lifespan . <p> Today , stainless steel has taken over from zinc coated or galvanised steel due to it 's increased resistance to rusting and corrosion . <p> In terms of actual wall tie design , there are two common types : <p> Strip Ties - aka vertical twist or fishtail . These are the most common type of wall tie <p> vertical twist or fishtail wall tie <p> Wire Ties - aka double triangle or butterfly <p> Butterfly or double triangle wall tie <p> The images above represent the more modern wall tie design but depending on the age of your property it may have more traditional type wall ties such as the below : <p> Traditional butterfly wall tie <p> Types of Retrofit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrofit and remedial ties available today and most of them fall under one of three different types : <p> Resin or Grouted These are normally pushed into a pre-drilled hole that has been filled with resin or grout . Once seated in place more resin or grout is pumped down through the tie to fill around the end in the inner cavity wall . Once the resin or grout sets it will bond with the surroundings and anchor the tie in place . These types of tie are ideally suited to buildings and properties where the condition of bricks or blocks it not that great <p> Resin fix kit for wall ties <p> Mechanical These types of tie are inserted into a pre-drilled hole and normally feature a sleeve that expands when the tie is screwed up . Normally these ties will be supplied with a setting tool that can be used in a combination-type drill . Due to their expanding nature it is recommended that they are only used in properties where the brickwork is in good to excellent condition . More can be found about these types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix wall ties <p> Helical Screw These ties look very similar to a long corkscrew and feature quite a course , wide thread . In a similar fashion to the above types , a pilot hole is drilled ( normally around 6mm in diameter ) through the outer cavity wall and into the inner to the required depth . Using a special setting tool inserted into a hammer drill , the tie is screwed into the walls in much the same way as a traditional wood screw would be screwed into a piece of timber . These are generally regarded as being safe to use on any condition brick or block walls <p> Helical screw type wall ties <h> Life Expectancy of a Wall Tie <p> Any wall tie that is made of mild steel will eventually corrode . This , unfortunately , is a fact ! Due to the materials used for wall ties in properties constructed before 1940 it is almost impossible to say how long these will last . <p> However , properties constructed between 1940 and the mid 1960 's can be roughly estimated as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strip Ties between 30 and 60 years <p> For properties constructed between the mid 1960 and early 1980 's : <p> Wire Ties between 13 and 26 years <p> Strip Ties between 23 and 46 years <h> How to Replace and Install Cavity Wall Ties <p> Before we commence with the " how-to " stage of this project it is important to mention if your property is suffering from visual cracks due to wall tie corrosion this may have gone past the point of being a DIY job . You will to consult with a qualified structural engineer so that he can assess and recommend next steps . In this situation it is almost going to be the case that the corroded wall ties will need to be removed and this is a very skilled job that will need to be carried out by someone with prior skill and knowledge so that the removal of the damaged ties causes no further structural damage to the property <p> What Type of Wall Ties do I Have ? <p> This can be a tricky one to establish . In reality the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie in the wall using a metal detector ( more information on these can be found on the Property Repair Systems website see the image below ) and then either using a Borescope ( can be hired or supplied in most cases with a full inspection from a professional ) drill a small hole and insert the camera end to identify the tie . <p> If you have cavity fill insulation is it important that you do n't use any retrofit or remedial ties that involve resins that need to chemically react in order to set as this may affect your insulation . <p> Most remedial solutions will involve you having to drill a small hole in order to insert the tie into the wall . You should also ensure that you use the ones with the smallest insertion hole possible , as this will reduce any loss in the thermal efficiency of the insulation to the absolute minimum . <p> This is another very important question that will need answering as you will have to establish if the bricks or blocks used in your home are solid or perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use . <p> There are two ways to do this if in your loft space you are able to access and view the tops of the walls you will be able to see what type of bricks you have . <p> If however you are unable to do this you will need to get the drill out ! You are going to need to drill at least one hole ( you may need to drill two or three just to be sure ) in each one of the walls of your property . This may be in at least four walls in the property is detached or two or three if the property is terraced or semi detached . <p> If the drilling rate is consistent e.g. the drill bit is in a constant state of " cutting " then you have a solid bricks or block construction <p> If drilling is not consistent e.g. the drill bit is cutting through the brickwork and then goes slack and then starts cutting again then is it a good bet that the bricks or blocks are perforated . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a suitable filler or mortar mix that will provide a waterproof seal . If left unfilled , this will provide the elements with a direct route into your cavity ! <p> Solid red clay brick <p> Perforated red clay brick <p> Which is the Correct Type of Wall Tie I Should Use ? <p> Firstly , you will need to have completed the above step to identify what type of brickwork you have . Once you have established this , you can identify your required wall ties from the four options below : <p> Solid Bricks or Blocks For this type of construction you have a choice of three tie types . You can use Resin Grouted ties , Mechanical ties or Helical screw in ties <p> Perforated Brick or Blocks For a property with perforated bricks or blocks you can use either a Resin Grouted tie in a sleeve or the Helical screw type tie <p> Properties With Fire Requirements If may be that your property is subject to certain fire regulations e.g. it may be a guest house or hotel etc .... If so you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a minimum of 30 minutes fire resistance ( check with manufacturers specifications ) <p> Cavity Wall Insulation If you have cavity insulation you will not be able to use any ties that feature a chemically reactive resin , you will only be able to use Helical screw ties or Mechanical ties <p> The correct spacing of the ties in your walls is critical ! Too far apart and your protective outer cavity wall will not be securely tied into the structural inner cavity wall and may collapse ! <p> The general rule when constructing a cavity wall is that ties should be spaced at the rate of 2.5 ties per square meter . This equates to at least one tie every 900mm along the horizontal and at least one tie every 450mm vertically . <p> These rules change slightly when openings such as windows and doors and gable ends are present . In this case you should have at least one tie every 300mm vertically and no further than 225mm away from the opening horizontally . <p> This can be quite difficult to visually imagine so a good way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diamond pattern . <p> Horizontal Spaced no more than 900mm apart <p> Vertical Spaced no more than 450mm apart <p> Openings ( windows , doors and gables Spaced no more than 300mm vertically and 225mm horizontally <p> The above spacing 's are based on standard width bricks or blocks that are 90mm thick . If widths are anything less than this then spacing rates should increase from 2.5 ties per square meter up to 5 tie 's per square meter . <p> Additionally if your property is constructed around a timber frame with a brick cladding ties should be spaced at a rate of 4.4 ties per square meter . <p> Less Than 90mm Thick Brick or Block Work 5 ties per square meter <p> Timber Framed and Brick Clad 4.4 ties per square meter <p> When it comes to retrofit wall ties , when installing you should stagger them around any original ties using the measurements and pattern described above . <p> Diagram showing the correct spacing of wall ties when placed in a wall and also around window reveals and door frames <p> How Many Wall Ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will need , will really be dictated by the size of your property and the number of openings . <p> You can however estimate the number of tie 's you are going to need by calculating your total wall space in square meters and then dividing this by the number of ties required for your particular construction type . For example : <p> If the property is solid brick or block you will need 2.5 ties per square meter so if we multiply 110 by 2.5 we get the grand total of 275 ties required . <p> Obviously this has not taken into account openings and gable ends so these will need to added also . As a general rule 7.5% is added for this and also the wastage factor bringing the actual total up to around 296 . <p> What is the Correct Length of Wall Tie I Should Use ? <p> The length of the ties you will need to be set by the width of your cavity so this will need to be measured accurately . This can be achieved several ways : <p> Measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft space and at the very edges can see down into the cavity then you will be able to measure the width from here <p> Removing a Brick You can also remove a brick from the outer wall and measure the cavity internally . This is quite and easy job to do and further information can be found in our removing and replacing a brick project <p> Drilling Using a long masonry drill bit ( at least 250mm ) , drill through the outer cavity wall and push the drill bit through until you can feel it touch the inner cavity wall . Using a small piece of tape , place it round the bit so that it is flush with the edge of the outside cavity wall and withdraw the bit . Now , measure from the tip of the bit up to the start of the tape and then subtract the width of brick or block work used and this will give you the width of your cavity <p> Now that you know how wide your cavity is you can work out the length of ties required . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall tie should protrude a minimum of 50mm into each leaf wall to create a secure anchor . You will also have to take into account the centering of the tie and also tolerances . With this in mind you should be looking to allow somewhere between 65 and 75mm of embedding in each wall leaf : <p> Width of Cavity <p> Recommended Length of Wall Tie <p> 50 75mm <p> 200mm <p> 76 100m <p> 225mm <p> 101 125mm <p> 250mm <p> 126 150mm <p> 275mm <p> 151 175mm <p> 300mm <p> 176 200mm <p> 325mm <p> 201 225mm <p> 350mm <p> 226 250mm <p> 375mm <p> 251 275mm <p> 400mm <p> 276 300mm <p> 425mm <p> Installing Wall Ties into a Wall <p> This will very much depend on the type of tie you can use taking into account the advice above . <p> In most cases it will involve drilling a hole through the outer cavity wall into the inner wall to the set depth and then inserting the tie and fixing it as instructed by the manufacturer 's guidelines . Normally this hole will be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some of the resin fixed ties . <p> It is also a good idea to ensure that the tie slants downwards and towards the outside wall a slight amount as this will ensure that any moisture that collects on the tie will run towards the outer wall as opposed to running onto your inner wall and creating damp or cold spots . Again , you may have to check with manufacturers guidelines concerning this . <p> Once all your ties have been inserted it may then be necessary to fill any holes in the outer wall to prevent any possibility of water ingress into the cavity void . <p> Other Points to Think About <p> One point to note is that by adding remedial wall ties , this will solve any immediate structural issues you may with your property but it wo n't solve the issues that any corroding ties have caused e.g. cracking and expanding mortar etc .... as if these ties are allowed to remain then the more they breakdown the worse the cracks will become . <p> In this case you should consult with an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any repair you should also consider full repointing of any cracks as this will also aid in structural stability and prevent any water ingress into the cavity area . <p> As mentioned at the start of the project , if you do need any assistance with diagnosing wall tie issues , what replacement wall ties you should be using or even how they should be installed give Property Repair Systems a call on 01626 336180. 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

In this project you will learn exactly what an instant boiling water tap is , how they work and how they can be easily installed next to your kitchen sink to provide you with instant , on demand boiling water . Also find out how much they cost to purchase and also run and how they can help you to save on energy costs by allowing you to get rid of your kettle . Also includes a helpful video and troubleshooting tips . <h> What is an Instant Boiling Water Tap ? <p> Having boiling water for a cup of tea or coffee instantly is a dream ! It is very true that a watched kettle never boils but with one of these little marvels , who cares ? <p> Fitting or installing an instant boiling water tap is not difficult . The manufacturers instructions are usually very clear on which hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a number of makes and applying our instructions to another make of tap could result in accidents . The overall installation is the same throughout however . <p> Double lever instant boiling water tap <h> Built-in Water Filter <p> The one shown in the image above has the added luxury , as many of them do , of supplying filtered water through the cold tap . The levers pull forward gently and its boiling and filtered water on tap . With taps that feature filters it is a good point to note that in most cases these filters will need replacing at some point . <h> Types of Boiling Water Tap <p> There are several different types of these taps : <p> Boiling water only <p> Boiling water , cold water and hot water <p> Boiling water , cold water and hot water all filtered <p> The above tap types are a bit of a generalisation of those available as each tap from each different manufacturer has slightly different features but the majority will fall into one of the above types . <p> When it comes to installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some insist on the unit being installed by one of their team and some come as a DIY kit , while others provide you with both options . <h> Costs of a Boiling Water Tap <p> It has to be said the 3 way taps are not cheap to buy but with the instant water heater under the sink being thermostatically controlled it is no more expensive to run one of these than it is to boil a kettle . <p> Depending on the type of boiling water tap you want will dictate the cost . Taps on their own range from -30 to well over -100 while the full kits ( tap , pipes , water heater etc .... ) range from -150 to over -1500 and as with many things these days , you get what you pay for . <p> In respect to running costs a rough guide is that it will cost you just under a penny to heat enough water for a mug full of tea using either a hot water tap or a kettle . When you think about it , most kettles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fair bit more than a mug of tea so most of the time you are actually boiling more water than you need costing you more , so you could actually save money in the long run with a boiling water tap . <p> They are a lot more attractive and a lot more convenient in that you do not have to find space on your worktop for a kettle . <h> Fitting an Instant Boiling Water Tap <p> As mentioned , there are numerous different types of tap available and each will need to be installed in a slightly different way . Having said that , regardless of the type the basic installation principles will be very similar . To these ends , below we will deal with fitting a boiling water tap into a sink unit . <p> Drilling the Hole in the Sink <p> To get the tap into the sink you have to drill a hole in the sink itself . This can be a bit of a daunting job but the manufacturers instructions will tell you the diameter of the hole you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaply . <p> It is only when you try and save money by drilling a tiny hole and filing the rest of it out , that you risk messing the job up . Every single job in the building industry , from shoveling dirt to installing a boiler , is done best with the right tools . <p> Hole saw kit with arbor <p> In this particular tap we had to drill a 38mm hole in the resin sink . Hole saws need a centre piece , called an arbor , to do two jobs . One of the jobs is to provide a small drill bit in the centre of the hole saw so it can not wander off line and the other job is to provide a shaft to put in the drill chuck . <p> Once the arbor is attached to the drill and you are sure you have marked out the correct position for the tap , you can drill the hole . <p> Boiling water tap heating unit , filter and and associated pipework <p> Fitting the Boiler Unit , Filter and Pipework <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly under the sink and the great thing about this kind of boiler is that it can plug directly into a 13 amp socket . The boiler is a neat , compact unit and fits easily into any under sink space . <p> You should select a spot under the sink to mount the tank vertically . With a DIY install , pretty much all kits will come with mounting brackets for both the filter and heating units and screws . When screwing in the fixings or brackets make sure it is level across the top . <p> The tap is then slotted into position and tightened . In most cases this will be the same way as most monoblock taps so if you go to our project you will be able to see how to do this . <p> With each unit in place you should then be able to see what pipework you will need and how much . Normally , all the pipework you will need will be supplied with the unit . Connect all pipework up according to the manufacturers instructions . <p> The tap is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturers instructions and the amins power supply lead is plugged into teh socket . <p> The whole job should take around an hour from start to finish . Here is a small trouble shooting guide should anything go wrong . <h> How Safe are Boiling Water Taps ? <p> As I 'm sure you are aware , a kettle is a dangerous thing and we are all taught from a young age to take great care when using them . A boiler water tap is certainly no different . <p> Most taps on the market have built in safety features in the form of a button that needs to be pressed or released to enable you to turn that tap on in boiling water mode . <p> Most taps will automatically shut off the boiling water supply once the safety button is released . <h> Boiling Water Tap Troubleshooting <p> Water and steam spit without turning on ? <p> Depress the tap lever to release some water from the tank . Adjust water temperature using dial on the hot tank front . <p> Water is not hot ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply and the circuit breaker and/or fuses are all ok .

How to avoid problems drilling and fixing into concrete or steel lintels . If you need to fix a blind or curtain rail into a window recess this will probably involve drilling into concrete lintels or drilling into steel lintels . This can be a tricky job as both are tough . In this guide we will also show you a method of fixing that avoids the need for drilling into concrete or steel lintels . <h> Drilling into Concrete Lintels <p> Drilling into concrete or steel lintels and also fixing into concrete and steel lintels has presented problems for years to DIY enthusiasts and professional alike . <p> For concrete lintels the answer is to start your fixing holes with the smallest masonry drill bit you can get , normally 3mm , and work up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier it will go through concrete <p> If you hit steel reinforcing in the concrete lintel however , there is no choice but to move the fixing hole or follow the instructions and diagrams below . <p> In respect to this , if you have a few spare pounds it 's well worth investing in a specialist drill bit set , purpose made for this job as it is now possible to buy drill bits that will go through both concrete and steel - <p> Due to how tough lintels can be it is recommeneded that you only use an SDS drill and drill bits . <p> Irwin Speedhammer bit set for concrete and steel <p> When drilling any holes it is also important that you hold your drill straight so that the hole you drill is also straight . You do n't want to drill any holes at an angle as when you insert your fixing or screw in any screws these will also go in at an angle ! <h> Fixing to Concrete Lintels <p> With your hole drilled to the correct size for the wall plug or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the need for a wall plug ) , position the holes in your lintel and the item you are fixing over each other and insert your screw or fixing . <p> Screw the screw in using an electric screwdriver or cordless drill/driver ( make sure you are using the correct settings on the drill e.g. set to screwdriver as opposed to drill , hammer action is turned off and the torque settings are correct ) and you 're done ! <h> Drilling into Steel Lintels <p> Steel lintels are even more difficult to fix to as , once you have drilled through the plaster and reached the steel lintel , you must then swap drill bits for a high speed steel bit and then use self tapping screws to fix the item you wish to hang . <p> This is a very difficult process not least because once you have drilled the hole for the self tapping screw , you then have to locate it again to put the screw into it . <p> Considering there is always at least 20mm between the surface of the plaster or plasterboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you decide that drilling is the best option to use other than the one outlined below then ensure that you have a decent drill to hand , a range of different sized drills bits and also ensure that they are sharp . <p> Trying to drill something as hard as steel and concrete with a blunt drill bit will take a lifetime and also put a large amount of un-needed pressure on the drill itself . <p> As mentioned above , always ensure that you hold your drill straight . <h> Fixing to Steel Lintels <p> When you get to the fixing part of the job and inserting a screw make sure that you have a decent electric screwdriver or cordless drill/driver as cutting the screw into the steel can be a tough job . <p> With your hold drilled in both the lintel and also the item you are fixing to the lintel ( if needed ) position the two with the holes aligned and pop your screw in and screw it up . <p> Ensure that you have the driver set to the correct torque setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screw it up tight . Take your time and do n't drive it in too fast to ensure that you do n't damage anything . <h> Other Options for Fixing to Steel and Concrete Lintels <p> A much easier option which will always give you a good fix is to glue a section of timber to the head ( soffit ) of the window opening and fix to that . The construction adhesives available these days are wonderful and as strong as any mechanical fixing . <p> Always read the manufacturers instructions as some construction adhesives recommend the surfaces to be glued together should be damped down slightly first . <p> In the example we have given here the client chose to have a timber glued the full width and depth of the soffit . At which point it could have been filled with wood filler and decorators caulk and painted . You could just fix a narrower timber up to the soffit and fill and paint it . <p> 8 inch x 1 inch timber to be fixed at top of window recess <p> A piece of planed square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy weight construction adhesive applied to the back .

Find out how to rejuvenate old furniture and other items around your home using decoupage techniques - you will see it is easy for anyone to do with the most basic DIY skills and knowledge . <p> Decoupage is an easy craft to practice , and you can use it to give furniture or accessories a new lease of life . <h> What is Decoupage ? <p> Decoupage is the art of applying a collage of pictures to a three dimensional object , for example a box , a photo frame or an occasional table . If you have an old object that does n't go with your decor , or if you want to add more interest to a plain item , decoupage is a great way to do it . <h> What Do I Need ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and a selection of images to use . It is a good idea to practice on something simple like a small wooden box or tray to start with , or you could even decoupage a stone for use as a paper-weight . <p> When it comes to choosing images , there are tons of places you can get great pictures to use . You might have an old collection of interesting stamps ( do n't use ones that are worth a lot of money of course ! ) , scraps of wallpaper or wrapping paper with nice patterns and old maps are all good materials . If you 've been on holiday and saved tickets , flyers etc to remind you of your trip , you could put them all together on a photo frame for a great keepsake .

A collection of different flowers and plants will go really well together though , or perhaps classic cars are more your thing . Whatever you choose , make sure you have enough pictures to cover your object , allowing for plenty of overlapping . <p> Once you 've chosen your object and images , you will need to gather a few more craft items .

Due to the nature of pull cord switches , they can wear out quite fast . In this DIY guide we will show you how to repair a bathroom light pull cord switch or 45amp shower pull cord switch . You will also learn how to replace a bathroom light or shower pull cord switch , how to replace the actual cord and also you will find out about what electrical work you are allowed to do in your home . <h> What is a Pull Cord Switch ? <p> A pull cord switch is typically mounted to the ceiling , with the pull cord hanging down , most often used in a bathroom or toilet and generally available in two types and ratings : <p> A 6 amp version to control lights <p> A 45 amp version used as an isolator for an electric shower <p> After some use and time this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears not to function properly as an internal spring can get stuck . <p> The 6 amp switch is usually part of the lighting circuit and is fused in the main distribution unit . It is very important to isolate the electrical supply before attempting any repair to the switch . <h> Repairing a Pull Cord Switch <p> Seperate Switch from Backplate and Spray Maintenance Spray <p> Undo the two screws securing the switch to the back plate and using some maintenance spray such as WD40 , apply the lubricant to the inside of the switch , where the wires are connected . <p> Supporting the switch with one hand , try to operate the pull cord with the other hand to see if the maintenance spray has freed up the spring and therefore the switch should work properly again . <p> If this does not work , then the switch must be replaced ( see Replacing the switch section below ) . <p> Repairing a 45 amp Pull Switch <p> With the heavier duty 45 amp pull switch , the spring is usually much stronger and an audible click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Occasionally these switches can break down and again , before attempting to work on the switch , you must isolate the electrical supply . Look for a fuse or circuit breaker on the main distribution board marked shower and either remove the fuse or trip the breaker ( MCB ) . <p> Most of these types of switch include a neon indicator , which will glow red or orange . If you have switched off the supply correctly the indicator will not be lit . <p> Pull cord switch <p> Undo the two retaining screws , carefully pull down the switch a little . There should be sufficient wiring to allow you to do this and as with the lighter duty switch , spray with the Maintenance spray and attempt to make the switch work properly .

To avoid fatigue and whilst on a stepladder , it is normally best to slightly undo the tightening screws of the new unit before attempting to connect the wiring to the new switch . <p> Connect New Switch <p> Connect each wire in turn , tightening the screws and then gently try to pull the wire from each side of the switch , to ensure you have connected it properly . <p> Refit Switch to Backplate <p> Then making sure you do not kink or trap the wiring , fit the switch to the backing plate and operate the pull cord to check it is functioning properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amp isolator switch follows the same principle as the 6 amp version , however the switches can differ as single pole , i.e. two wires or twin pole , designed to isolate both live and neutral . <p> Note the wiring positions and cut off the electrical supply .

@@41624844 @1624844/ <p> Summary : In this DIY how to guide you will learn all about fixing vertical blinds including information on fixing venetian blinds and fixing roman blinds . The principles of fixing a blind , whether it is fixed to the face of a window recess or fixed within the window recess itself are pretty much the same for all types of blinds . One of the most important parts when fitting a blind is to get it level and central with the window , which in some cases can be tricky but we will show you how to do this with ease . You will also find out about how to mark and fix your brackets on the wall , how to accurately measure for the size of blind you need , about the different types of fixing brackets available and how to both face fix a blind over a window or head fix a blind within a window recess . <p> Fitting and fixing Venetian blinds , Roman blinds and Vertical blinds all follow the same routine ( pretty much ) . It normally involves fixing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the internal area of the window recess ( top fix or recess fix ) or above the top of the window ( face fix ) . <p> The blind itself or its mechanism is then housed in a box called a blind carriage . The carriage ( if it has n't been fixed directly to the wall ) is then fixed into the brackets and your blind is then already to go . <p> Vertical blind carriage and fixing within window recess <p> In most cases , the carriage will be secured within brackets and these brackets themselves will be fixed to the wall . <p> Depending on the type of blind you are fixing will really depend on what brackets are used . Even a single type of blind ( e.g. Roman blind ) could potentially have several different types of bracket , depending on who has manufactured it . To these ends we will explain below the general methods of fixing the brackets as , in pretty much all cases , this will be the same . <h> Different ways of Fixing Window Blinds <p> Blinds can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wall above your window opening , called " face fixing " or up onto the soffit or head of your window opening . This is called a recess or a head fitting . Before you actually fix it in place , you will need to make sure that it is indeed the correct size . <p> Centre the blind to the window opening <p> Face Fixing <p> For a face fitting , using the diagram above , the centre of your blind carriage should be in the centre of your window opening . This means that any overhang , demonstrated by the figures B should be the same . <p> One thing to be aware of is that it is a good idea to have a bit of an overlap between the blind and the wall , so that the blind runs over the wall by at least 8cm . This way , once closed , it should block a fair bit of light also , but if you are not interested in achieving this , ensure the blind is the correct width for your needs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the centre you will have to decide how high above the top of the window recess you fix your blind . Again , make sure it goes up at least 8-10cms if your goal is to block light . <p> Recess or Head Fixing <p> For a recess fixing , the gap either side of your blind ( figures D ) should be the same . <p> Again , depending on the type of blind you are fixing and the brackets included with it , may dictate where they are fixed . In the majority of cases , brackets will be fixed to the head of the window recess , but we have seen some that need fixing to the sides of the recess . <p> With these types , once fixed in position , they will provide more than enough fixing strength but the problems comes in actually fixing them in place and getting them level , not to mention , ensuring that the blind itself or carriage are the exact width required ! <p> If you have these types of fixings , just be aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As with the above , if your main aim is to block light from the window then you will need your blind to run the full width within or over the recess so that it blocks as much light as possible . <p> Additionally , most blinds can be universally fitted as the brackets feature fixing points for both face fix and recess fix , but some blinds are more suited to fixing in a certain way : <p> Roman Blinds : Can be fitted both inside and over window recess ( face and head fixed ) <p> Venetian Blinds : Can be fitted over and inside the window recess ( face and head fixed ) <h> Measuring the Size of Blind you Need and Getting it Central <p> All blinds are fairly easy to fit but require accurate measurement at the start to make sure you have the correct size of blind and it is positioned in the correct place in the window reveal or over the window itself . <p> Your chosen method of fixing ( outlined above ) will pretty much dictate how you measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the exact recess or whether you are face fixing so can be a little more flexible with your measurements . <p> To measure for the size of blind you need : <p> Face Fix : Measure the width of the window recess and then add on 8-10cms either side , as required , if you want the blind to cover the entire window area <p> Measuring for a blind that is going to be face fixed above window recess <p> Head Fix : Measure the width of the window recess and then deduct 5-10mm or so from either end to allow for a little movement if required <p> Measuring for a blind that is going to be head fixed within the window recess <p> One final point to be aware of when measuring is that both the carriage and the edges of the blind should be equal in width . <p> If the sections that actually make up the blind extend beyond the carriage you will have to take this into account when measuring , especially if you are head fixing as if they are too close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly . <p> Additionally , always measure your window in three places - top , middle and bottom , from the top to the bottom of the recess and also in three places ( left , middle and right ) for the width . Although your window or even door recesses looks square it might not be so by measuring you will be able to tell this . <p> If it 's not and you are going to head fix , use the smallest width measurement for the width and the longest height measurement for height . <p> Which ever fixing path you have chosen you will need to make sure the blind is central once in place . This is really more of an aesthetic thing , although if your aim is to block visibility , if the blind is too far to the left or right then it may not end up covering parts of the window and also any moving parts may be too close to the walls surface to allow them to work properly . <p> To guarantee that the blind will be central , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening and mark the centre with a pencil . Then measure the length of the blind carriage and place a mark on that . You can use this method for both types of fixings e.g. face fixing or recess . <p> When the blind is fitted the two marks should line up meaning you have the centre of the blind in the centre of the window . <p> Centre line of the window and blind should both line up once fixed in place <h> Fixing the Blind Brackets or Carriage to the Wall <p> When you are 100% sure about the position of your blind carriage , the next job is to fit the brackets that hold the carriage in position , unless the blind requires the whole carriage fixing to the wall . <p> As we have established , there are numerous different types of bracket for different makes of blind but in most case the bracket is fixed to the surface using the normal fixing technique of drilling a hole , adding wall plugs and then screwing the bracket up . The carriage then clips in or slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage <p> Slot-in type bracket for blind carriage , mostly Venetian blinds <p> There should be at least two ( sometimes three ) brackets with your blind . If you have two , then each should be fixed near either end and if there are three , one at each end and one in the middle to distribute the weight of the blind evenly between them . <p> If you are fixing the entire carriage to the wall , then in most cases there will be three fixing points inside the track of the carriage , again at opposing ends and then one in the middle . <p> Fixing the Brackets in Place <p> For face fixing your blind , follow the below steps : <p> You will either be fixing brackets at either end of the carriage or above : <p> Either end : Place the brackets onto the ends of the carriage and then position the whole lot above the window , lining up the marks on the centre of the carriage and centre of the window reveal that we made earlier ( you may need a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move it around until it is at the desired height and then , using a pencil , mark the wall at either side of the bracket so that you know where it needs to be fixed . Remove blind and take the left hand bracket off and position on pencil mark on wall and then , using the pencil , mark all the fixing holes on the bracket , on the wall so you know where you need to drill your holes <p> Position blind and then mark desired location of brackets <p> Above : Using the left hand edge of the window recess as a guide , measure upwards to the desired height that you want your blind to be and mark with a pencil . Next , place the bracket on the pencil mark and then mark all the fixing holes of the bracket on the wall so you know where to drill <p> Using the left hand edge of the window recess , measure and mark bracket position <p> With the fixing holes for the first bracket marked , take you drill and suitably sized drill bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the required holes <p> Next , insert a wall plug ( should be supplied with your blind kit , if not , the red wall plugs are the ones to use ) into each of the holes , knocking them in with a hammer if needed <p> Position the bracket in place and using a screw ( these should be supplied with your blind kit , if not , screws of 6-10 size should do ) , screw it into the centre fixing hole and tighten until it just starts to pinch up <p> Now , level the bracket using a small spirit level and then use a long spirit level ( 6 feet should do ) lay it on top of the bracket and then move to the other side , lifting the end of the level until the bubble indicates it 's level . Again you may need some extra help with this . Once level , mark the position on the wall with a pencil <p> Using spirit level to level second bracket <p> Now , take the blind carriage and position it into the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the opposite end and raise the blind up until it is level with the mark you have just made . If using an end bracket , fit the bracket and then mark the edges so you know where to re-position it and if using top fix , fit it to the carriage and slide it to the edge of the recess , lining it up with the level line you have just made . Again , mark the edges of the bracket <p> Remove the blind and place the bracket back on the marks that you made and then mark all the fixing holes for the bracket , remove it and then drill the marked positions out , insert wall plugs and screw the bracket up in just one position ( the centre if possible ) until it is pinch tight <p> With the brackets fixed , again , fix the carriage into them to check that it is centrally aligned with the window and level ( place your spirit level on top of the carriage to check this ) . If you find that you are not central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-position the brackets as needed or if it 's not too bad , you may decide to just live with it ! <p> Check that the carriage is both level and central <p> If you have a third , middle bracket , fix this bracket onto the carriage in the centre ( using your centre lines as a guide ) and then pencil mark the bracket position <p> Position third bracket in centre and mark its position <p> If all is well , remove the carriage and then add additional screws in the other fixing points and screw all screws up tight <p> For the third bracket , position it back on the wall in its correct place and mark fixing holes . Using the same steps as above , drill out centre hole and add wall plug and then screw bracket up in centre fixing hole . Place your spirit level across all brackets and they should be level . If not , reposition and fix as required . If so , screw the middle bracket up tight <p> You are almost there - for one last time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed ) fix the actual blind section(s) onto the carriage ( following manufacturers instructions - more mentioned below ) and then check it all works as it should do . If not , check back through the manufacturers instruction for the blind , but if so , stand back and admire your handy work ! <p> For head or recess fixing your blind , follow the below steps : <p> This process is very similar to the above only now you are working to a fixed width e.g. the width of the window recess . If you have measured correctly for the size of blind you need then this should fit perfectly and all you need to do it fix the brackets <p> If you do n't know the exact width of your blind ( including end brackets if it has them ) and the full width of the recess then measure this up now . Once you know this information , deduct the width of the blind from the width of the recess and you should be left with somewhere between 1-4cms <p> Next , divide this figure by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to leave at either end of the blind to ensure it 's central . With this in mind , measure in by this number at both ends of the head ( top ) of the recess and mark this point with a pencil <p> Now you will need to decide how far from the front of the recess ( the window ) the blind will go , this is really up to you . Whatever you decide , measure in from the window this amount and mark with a pencil . When marking , line this up with the previous mark you made and this will now give you the position for your bracket . Do this for both ends <p> Marking for end fix brackets in recess <p> If dealing with end brackets , the above will pretty much dictate where these are to be fixed , but if dealing with top brackets ( e.g. ones that the carriage clips in to ) then you will want to move these in slightly , about 8-10cms from the actual ends of the blind carriage <p> Next , measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the blind and mark with a pencil . Now , measure in your chosen amount from the window and add a pencil mark . Again , line the two marks up to set your bracket positions <p> Marking for top fix brackets in recess <p> Before you start making any holes , take your blind carriage ( include end brackets if they are present and also fix top brackets or what ever brackets you are using to the carriage ) and position it in place , on the pencil marks just to make sure that all appears level and you are happy with the overall position . You may need an extra pair of hands to help with this <p> Take one of our brackets and put it in position on the pencil marks and then mark the fixing hole so you know where to drill . Do this for both end brackets <p> Using a suitable drill ( mains powered with hammer action or similar ) and a suitable 6mm tough masonry drill bit as if you have a lintel above the window , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your brackets <p> Insert your wall plugs , either those that came with you kit or the red-type wall plugs . Knock these in with a hammer if they are a little tight <p> Using the screws that came with your kit , or 6-10 size screws if using red wall plugs , screw the brackets up into place and tighten them until pinch tight <p> Take your blind or carriage and position it in place , either into the end brackets if you have them or clipped into the top brackets and make sure all fits well and as it should <p> If you also have a third , pop the carriage or blind down , add this bracket in place and then put it back into position in the recess . Line the third bracket up with the centre line that you made earlier and mark its position on the wall . This might be a little tricky as there wo n't be much room , but you should be able to mark the front and sides if possible <p> Carriage fixed in place to check all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Remove the carriage and take the middle bracket off . Position it back on the wall and mark the fixing point and drill out and plug as in the steps above . Finally , screw the bracket up until it 's pinch tight <p> The final job is to now put the blind or carriage up into place and check that all works . If so , well done , you 're finished ! If not , check with the manufacturers instructions for more details about the blinds operation <h> Fixing Roman , Venetian and Vertical Blind Sections to the Carriage <p> Once you have your brackets and carriage in place you may now need to fix up the actual blind sections ( or vanes as they are also known ) to complete the job . <p> If you have a Venetian blind then in almost 100% of cases the vanes and the carriage will come in one complete set , so once you have fixed to the brackets you are all done ! <p> However , if you have a Roman or Vertical blind you will probably still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of these blinds will come with the vanes detached so you need to fix these in place . <p> Due to the variety of fixing methods between manufacturers we can not advise exactly on how to do this but in most cases it will involve clipping each vane ( in the case of vertical blinds ) on to each clip on the carriage or clipping up the blind material and inserting the dividers in the case of a Roman blind . <p> For which ever blind you have , refer to the manufacturers full instructions on how to fit the vanes and complete the job . Once all fitted , give it a test to make sure it all works correctly . <p> Fitting Roman , Vertical and Venetian blinds is a fairly easy job in principle but getting all the brackets in the correct place and making sure very thing is level can soon turn complicated .

This float is generally in the form of a plastic ball on the end of an arm . <p> Cistern Noise Reduction Valve <p> When the mains cold rushes into the tank/cistern it causes ripples on the surface , the float bobs about , opening and closing the valve . It is this vibration within the valve and on the float arm which , when reverberating along the pipe , initiates the cause of water-hammer . The velocity of the water flowing through the valve means that when it is shut there is a build up of pressure behind the valve , as more water tries to push on through the pipe . This increase in pressure causes a pressure wave to form which travels back down the pipe . The wave then travels up and down the pipe until the energy is dissipated through friction , this is why there is a hammering ' effect . <p> There are a few ways to ease this problem , " professional " ways and DIY ways , none are difficult , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pipe is up against a joist , rafter or other surface , it is fixed securely . The first and most effective professional way is to install an equilibrium valve instead of the standard valve in your tank or cistern . <p> This valve works by allowing some water to get at the back of the piston washer to stop the arm jumping about . The noise reduction valve above it is a further alternative , this allows incoming water to disperse below the water line and reduces the " waves " , it slows the vibration down but most often will not stop it . The cost of a noise reduction valve is about -7.00 , with arm and ball and an equilibrium valve is approx -33.00 . The noise reduction valve does make a considerable difference to the noise your system makes when filling up . <p> The DIY way is very effective but slightly cumbersome . Take an ordinary yoghurt carton and attach it to your float arm with some galvanised or stainless steel wire , which will not rust . Suspend the carton just below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough weight to stop the vibration , but not too much to stop the arm lifting gently . <p> If your pipes are not hammering but just making creaking noises , this is normally caused by the friction of the pipe moving on the joist or rafter . Get some heavy duty polythene and fix it between the two surfaces and reduce the friction . <p> When needing to pass mains cold water pressure across to air locked hot water supply using kitchen mixer taps : Easier than trying to find another tap and having to use a long hose which may , anyway , not fit the shape of some taps . Simpler than playing around with washing machine hoses . <h> Procedure 1 <p> Squeeze the single mixer tap outlet so that the palm of your hand covers it firmly . <p> Turn on the hot , then the cold , ( this order is important to prevent confined mains pressure from forcing your hand away from the tap outlet ) . The cold supply , now unable to exit from the hand blocked tap outlet , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backflow in the hot water system , clearing the airlock . <p> Note : If you have a similarly non-mains pressured COLD supply i.e. also fed from a header tank and which also has an airlock : Same as just described but this time you need to use the mains pressured water to purge the non-mains pressured COLD supply , which , unlike the hot supply , is probably inaccessible from downstairs and therefore nowhere near any mains pressured water . <p> To do this you firstly need to create a path between the hot water supply and the non-mains pressured cold water supply . <h> Procedure 2 <p> Prior to starting the tap squeezing exercise , and if you have a non-electric shower mixer tap in the upstairs bathroom : <p> Unscrew the showerhead from the pipe <p> Place 2 or 3 layers of plastic bag over the end of the pipe to form a strong membrane <p> Re-screw the shower head with the membrane still in place <p> Go to the header tank and turn ONLY the hot outlet OFF . Leave the cold one ON . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold ON , with the diverter in the SHOWER position . <p> Go back downstairs and carry out the procedure initially described i.e. using hand pressure over the mixer taps . <p> The mains pressured water will now back flow up into the hot water system but then flow across to the non-mains pressured cold water system via plastic bag blocked mixer in the bathroom thus clearing any air locks in the non-mains pressured cold supply . <p> If you do n't have a shower mixer as described , but do have separate hot and cold taps e.g. sink taps , then steps 1 ) to 3 ) can be replaced by just connecting a hose across the two taps .

Learn how to use plastic guttering and attached gutters and down-pipes to drain your roof effectively . Find out how to safely attach the guttering to your home . <p> Plastic guttering is so versatile these days it can be installed to look exactly the same as cast iron guttering . Adapters and couplings can be used to join it to existing cast iron gutters . It can be diverted to rainwater butts and different depth gutters be installed to deal with draining the most expansive roofs . <p> Installing or replacing a gutter is pretty straightforward as long as you remember , in the first place , to keep yourself safe and viewing our project on Ladder safety is a good idea . <p> Once you have the outline of your gutter planned and measured you can buy all of the necessary pipes and fittings . This project is a general guide to installing plastic gutters but some gutters require different spacing for brackets etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your particular choice . <p> Guttering components <p> When you plan your gutter the following points should be listed . <p> Gutter ( Fascia ) brackets should never be more than 1m apart . <p> Gutter angles , Stop-ends , Running Outlets , Unions and other gutter fittings should have a bracket ( both sides of the fitting where appropriate ) within 150mm of the fitting . <p> A supporting pipe clip should be used on all Shoes , Branches and Bends of the down pipes where necessary and in all cases these pipe brackets should be no more than 1.8m apart . <p> Silicone spray lubricant should be used on all joints to allow for expansion and contraction .

Because of the weight we recommend that you have help whilst removing any iron guttering . <p> There is every possibility that , if your old guttering needs replacing , then so will your fascia boards and soffit boards . New , plastic ( uPVC ) fascia and soffit boards can also be bought from most builders merchants or DIY stores . <p> The screws holding the old guttering , brackets or clips may be rusted into place ; if this is the case you will need to saw the screws off using a mini hack saw with a thin cutting blade . If thick bolts have been used to connect the guttering you will need to use a hacksaw to saw the bolts . <h> Establish the position of the Outlets <p> The running outlet or stop end outlets , should be fitted directly above the drain position ; a plumb-line should be used to ensure that the outlet is positioned accurately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.1m ) it should slope half and inch ( 12mm ) so your brackets should be fixed to this fall . <p> You should now fix the end fascia bracket to the fascia board , taking into account the fall .

These fascia brackets should be fixed no more than 1 metre apart . <p> Newly installed guttering <h> Installing the Guttering <p> Having fitted the gutter brackets it is time to fit the guttering . Take the first length and clip it into the running outlet , then into the facia board brackets .

The offset bends can be push-fit using a pipe clip , ensure a pipe clip is fitted under the socket on the pipe immediately below the offset . Ensure a 6mm gap is left at the top of the downpipe for expansion . <p> Guttering should use either a round or square Downpipe . To attach Round Downpipes to square gutters you must use a SQ/RD Downpipe Adaptor . <p> Newly installed gutting and downpipe <p> Fix the first length of downpipe with its socket uppermost into the outlet , fixing it to the wall with a pipe clip at the top holding the pipe to the wall . <p> Fit the rest of the downpipes using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of the pipe , fit a Shoe secured with a Pipe Clip . <p> Diverted rainwater is great for your garden , slim line water butts are very useful where space is at a premium . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Learn about the main types of wallpaper that you can buy , and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each so you can choose the right paper for your home . <p> If you 're decorating a room but do n't just want plain walls , wallpaper is the choice for you . With hundreds of colour , pattern and texture options though , taking your pick can be a confusing process . We 've detailed the different types of wallpaper below to get you started . <h> Lining Paper <p> Lining paper pretty much does what it says on the tin . It 's a plain paper which is used to cover imperfections or dark colours on a wall prior to wallpapering or painting . <p> Lining paper is available in various grades , or thicknesses , with the thicker types being much better at covering imperfections , and also easier to hang , being less likely to tear . <p> When using lining paper prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , so that the joins will never match up with the wallpaper on top . <p> If you are planning to paint the lining paper , you can hang it vertically as per normal wallpaper . <p> Veneer Wallpaper Lining <h> Polystyrene Sheeting <p> Rolls of thin polystyrene veneer can be used as a wallpaper lining . This makes the walls feel much warmer and reduces condensation in rooms , so it can be useful in bathrooms and kitchens , or bedrooms that have a condensation problem . <p> The only problem with polystyrene is that it can easily be dented and marked , so it should be avoided in busy , high-traffic areas . <p> Polystyrene Veneer Lining Paper <h> Wood Chip Wallpaper <p> A leftover from the 1970 's , when it was very popular , woodchip paper is a cheap way of covering imperfect walls , but is best avoided if possible . <p> Also known as ingrain wallpaper , woodchip is made by trapping small chips of wood in the paper when it is manufactured . <p> It is available in a variety of grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , provide the best coverage and are easier to hang . Woodchip comes in plain white and is designed to be painted over with emulsion . <p> Woodchip Wallpaper <h> Anaglypta Wallpaper <p> Anaglypta wallpapers are thick , durable papers that are embossed with a pattern . There are a huge number of patterns available . <p> Sometimes anaglyptas are available in colour , but usually they are designed to be painted with emulsion paint . <p> The typically high grade of these papers make them easy to hang , and the embossing means they are suitable for covering slight imperfections in the wall . However , they are prone to stretching , so be careful when hanging . <p> Anaglypta Wallpaper <h> Supaglypta Wallpaper <p> Supaglypta is , as the name suggests , a super version of anaglypta wallpaper . <p> Cotton fibres are used in the manufacturing process to produce the embossed effect , making supaglypta particularly tough and durable . <p> The pattern on supaglyptas is often more complex and raised slightly higher than on an anaglypta . <p> Their durability means that supaglyptas are suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supaglypta Wallpaper <h> Flock Wallpaper <p> Flock wallpaper is one of the more expensive options . A velvet-like fibre pattern gives a very luxurious , old-fashioned feel . <p> It is hard to resist stroking a flock wallpaper , so they can easily become marked . <p> Flock is also a tricky wallpaper to hang , as it takes skill to avoid getting any paste on the flock , which will mark and ruin the texture . <p> Flock Wallpaper <h> Foil Wallpaper <p> Metalized papers can be very attractive . These reflective patterns can help to lighten up a dark corner , but be careful in your choice as they tend to use a lot of dark colours . <p> Because of the reflective nature of these papers , foil wallpaper shows any lumps and bumps on the wall so make sure your wall is as smooth as possible before you start , or use a lining paper . <p> Be careful not to get any wallpaper paste on the foil as it will ruin the reflective coating . Foil papers are often paste the wall ' type papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallpaper <h> Printed Wallpaper <p> Printed papers come in a huge range of colours , designs and qualities , from mass-produced , machine-printed designs to high quality hand-printed patterns . <p> The hand-printed versions are of course more expensive than their machine-printed counterparts . <p> Do not use printed wallpapers in areas where there is a lot of steam or condensation , as the inks used are often water-based . <p> Be careful when hanging printed wallpapers , as the delicate paper can tear easily and the complex patterns can be hard to match up . <p> Printed Wallpaper <h> Vinyl Wallpaper <p> Vinyl wallpapers consist of a printed skin of vinyl stuck onto a base layer of paper . <p> Vinyl papers are tough , hardwearing and washable , although some have a thicker layer of vinyl than others so will be more durable . <p> Vinyl papers are suitable for kitchens and bathrooms as they are resistant to condensation and steam . <p> Vinyl Wallpaper <h> Blown Vinyl Wallpaper <p> Blown or expanded vinyl looks similar to an embossed or anaglypta paper , with a raised pattern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be painted over . <p> Blown Vinyl Wallpaper <h> Washable Wallpaper <p> Although vinyl wallpapers are washable , there are also wallpapers available which are specifically marketed as washable . <p> These papers are printed with water-resistant ink and coated with a layer transparent plastic . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

A DIY guide to pointing paving slabs , patio slabs , and garden paths . How to use a dry mix when repointing a patio and other paving slabs following damage to existing mortar joints after movement or freeze thaw action . <p> The ground moves . Patios move . The first casualty of this movement is usually the cement joints in between the patio or paving slabs . <p> Repointing need not be the huge dilemma a great many of our users have found it to be . For example there is no need to point it as you would do a brick wall . <p> Brickwork pointing is designed to go hard quickly and is not at all flexible as you can see by cracks in many new houses . <p> If you have a patio which has been pointed this way then follow our pointing brickwork project as the principle is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the right consistency colour and we have a matching mortar project for that as well . <h> Clean out the Existing Patio Joints <p> For new patios , or patios and paving where there is not a lot of the existing pointing left , its better to cut out all of the old stuff and start again . A hammer and bolster chisel are the best tools for this , along with a plugging chisel ( images below ) for tight joints . <p> Do not attempt to use an angle grinder unless you are used to handling one as they can quite easily skid across the surface of your slabs , marking them badly . <p> Lump Hammer <p> Brick Trowel <p> Shovel <p> Bolster <p> Plugging Chisel <h> Repointing Patio Joints <p> Once all the joints are clear you can start pointing .

This is more commonly called playpit sand . The sand is mixed with cement at a ratio of 1 to 1 and spread out to dry thoroughly .

Make sure the joint is absolutely full even to the point of tamping the mix down with a piece of timber . <p> Sand and cement pointing mix ready to be swept into joints <p> The most common cause of patio pointing failure is when voids are present either within the joint or under it . These are easily formed when a lump of sand clogs up the joint and it may look as though this joint is full but in fact it is not . Water soon gets into these voids and with a freeze-thaw action soon destroys the rest of the joint . <p> When the joints are full , brush any surplus off the surface and leave .

This time use sharp sand and make sure it is dry and ALL the lumps are squashed . This should be mixed at 3 sand to 1 cement . This makes it slightly leaner and even more flexible . It should be left to dry in the same way . <p> Patios can be pointed quite quickly using this method and providing everything is dry there need be no staining of the slabs associated with ordinary pointing . <p> It is now possible to purchase bags of premixed patio jointing sand so that all you have to do it empty the contents onto the patio surface and sweep it into the joints .

Learn how to prepare a wooden floor for painting , including sealing and filling . <p> If you have good wooden floorboards but they 're not nice enough to varnish or stain , or if they 're already painted , a lick of paint will give them a fresh new look and brighten up the place . You 'll be amazed at how much cleaner and lighter a room feels if you paint the floor with a white or off-white colour . Or you can give a room a really different look by using a brighter colour . <h> What Do I Need To Paint Wooden Floors ? <p> Specific floor paints are available , and it is best to use one of these as they are developed to withstand the massive amount of wear and tear a floor receives .

Make sure the primer you buy is suitable for the type of paint you are going to be using " ask advice in a DIY store if you 're not sure . <p> You are likely to need some wood filler too , to fill in large cracks , knot holes , scratches and the likes . <p> You can paint using a brush , roller or pad . You 'll need a brush for the edges at least , and you can buy long-handled brushes and paint pads specifically for use on floors and ceilings .

Prime any bare wood , plus knots in the wood and filled areas . <h> Painting Wooden Floors <p> It is important to work with plenty of ventilation , but if you 're concerned about security and leaving windows open then make sure they are closed before you start .

To disengage the key and thus remove the spout , it is necessary to push the spout to the left ( as you are facing the sink ) and line it up with the body of the mixer . Lift , wiggle , and it comes away quite easily . There is a keyway in the body at the centre back which must be lined up with the key in the spout before removal can be effected . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

This project shows you how to how to make mortar different colours so that you can blend the new with the old . <p> Quite often it is necessary to cut out damaged bricks from a wall and while it is relatively easy to match the bricks , matching the colour of the sand and cement , or mortar , is no easy task . <p> There is no science involved in matching a sand and cement mix to that of your existing wall or property , its just a question of trial and error and even a little research is necessary sometimes . <p> There are many many types of sand and each type will produce a different colour mortar when mixed with cement .

@@41624857 @1624857/ <h> Building Regulations Approved Document A - Covering the Structure of Buildings and their Loading , Potential Ground Movement and Possibility of Disproportionate Collapse <p> Summary : In this guide you will find an overview of Approved Document A of the UK Building Regulations that cover the structure of a building or property . Approved Document A sets out construction guidelines to ensure that the loading of a building is correct in that the foundations can support the weight of walls and the roof , walls can support the weight of the roof and imposed loads such as snow can be supported by the structure as a whole . Document A also sets guidelines to ensure foundations are constructed on solid ground without the possibility of ground movement and that in the event of an accident , the building can withstand reasonable forces and disproportionate collapse . <p> The document itself is in place to make sure that walls are constructed to a certain specification ( e.g. are thick enough and supported by the correct foundation ) , cover a certain floor area , timbers and supporting beams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chimneys are a certain height , wall coverings such as render stays on the wall and roofs can support the weights they are intended to carry . <p> In light of this , Approved Document A is broken down in to the following areas : <p> Loading on areas of the building or structure <p> Movement of ground <p> Disproportionate or unreasonable collapse <h> Loading on Areas of the Building or Structure <p> In terms of the load imposed on a building or structure , the document states that any building should be constructed to make sure that all the combined loads that a building or structure will be subjected to ( imposed load such as the weight of the roof and also wind load , snow load etc .... ) should be suitably transfered down to the ground to a stable and solid foundation . <p> It also states that the transfered load should be done safely and also avoid any damage to the rest of the building or damage to any surrounding structures . <p> The above paragraph mentions " imposed load " and this needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best examples is from snow . A heavy snowfall can add a great deal of additional weight to a roof and although the area you live in may only get one or two snowfalls a year , the roof still needs to be designed to carry this additional load . <p> With this in mind , the amount of additional or implied load that a roof will need to carry that will be stated by your local authority building control office will vary depending on the area of the country in which you live and the likelyhood of heavy snowfall e.g. implied loads will most probably be greater in Scotland than they will be in Cornwall . <p> Another type of load mentioned is wind load . If you live in a particularly exposed and windy location ( e.g. on the coast of the Isle of Skye ) then the force that the wind subjects a bulding to will be much greater than one located in teh centre of a large city and due to this the structure will need to be designed so that it can withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a property is stable and that the design and construction meet with the rules stated in Approved Document A , the following guidelines need to be fullfilled : <p> The actual size of the building a proportions in terms of width and height are inline with the guidelines stated for particular construction types <p> Both internal and external walls are constructed to form a 3D box-type structure with the number of rooms within restricted to those stated by the guidelines <p> Internal and external walls should also be suitably connected together <p> Intermediate floors ( if present ) and the roof should be both constructed and connected to the walls structures in such a manner that they give support and also aid in dealing with wind load <p> Within this section of the document it also states the requirements for sizes of timbers for particular areas of the building ( e.g. roofing timbers , floor joists etc .... ) , required thicknesses of walls , maximum height of the building ( including wind speed map ) , maximum floor area , required heights of chimneys above roof surfaces , foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the complexity of many of these guidelines , please refer to teh following sections of Document A as follows : <p> Timber Size Requirements : The specifications and guidelines for timber sizes ( except for roofs that incorporate trussed rafters ) can be found in the publication by TRADA or by refering to BS EN 1995-1-1:2004 , also in the BSI published document PD 6693-1:2012 and finally by also viewing BS 8103-3:2009 <p> Required Wall Thickness : When dealing with " small buildings " such as residential dwellings less than 3 storeys high , small single storey buildings and annex-type buildings that join residential buildings such as a garage , please refer to section 2C of Approved Document A <p> Building and Wall Heights : For height details for buildings you will need to refer to paragraph sections 2C4 , 2C16 , diagrams 1 and 2 and diagram 7 table C within this section <p> Floor Area : The general guidelines here are that no floor space should be over 70m squared where it has structural walls surrounding all four sides and no more than 36m squared if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Full details can be found in Section 2 sub-section 2C14 , Diagrams 3 and 5 and Section 2C38 <p> Chimney Height : For rules on the height of chimney that you can have and the width it can be in relation to the height and construction material requirements please see section 2D <p> Foundation Requirements : For information and requirements for foundations ( using plain concrete ) for both normal foundation situations and areas where the ground may be softer you will need to refer to section 2E and section 2E4 including Table 10 <p> Masonry Strength : This section is concerned with the fact that any masonry used within a construction is such that it is strong enough to cope with any weight , load or force applied to it . Full details on this can be found in Section 2C20 of Document A , 2C21 and also Tables 6 , 7 and Diagram 9 <p> Roofing : It must be ensured that any material used to cover a roof area is capable of coping with any concentrated imposed load upon the roof .

With this in mind , foundations should be : <p> If foundations are not formed on rock , a strip foundation should be a minimum depth of 0.45m to its underside as this will avoid any affects from frost .

@@41624858 @1624858/ <p> Summary : Find out how to draught proof your home using simple and cost effective methods . In this project you will learn about draught proofing and all the common areas that a draught can materialise such as around your doors , windows and loft hatch and how to insulate these areas . You will also learn about other areas that may feature gaps that can cause draughts such as the gaps around pipework , the gaps between flooring and skirting boards and around light and electrical fittings , chimneys and fireplaces and how you can plug these gaps to prevent heat loss and increases to your heating bills . <p> Draught proofing is one of the best ways to improve the thermal efficiency of your home . In simple terms this means that draught proofing is probably the most cost effective and efficient way to make your home warmer . This is a bold claim , but for around -120 it is possible to deliver annual fuel bill saving of approximately -50 per year ( according to Which ? ) <p> The Energy Saving Trust suggest draught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -10--50 per year , with up to a further 10% savings from your heating bills . This is because a draught-proofed home will feel warmer and this allows you to turn the thermostat down . <p> The best thing about draught proofing is that it is something that can be done yourself very easily and you will see an instant benefit as your home will feel much warmer . <h> What is a Draught ? <p> A draught is defined as a " current of cold air in a room or other confirmed space " and they are generally a result of unwanted air gaps which allow cold air in from either outside or another unheated part of your home . Stop these and your will stop the cooling effect of the draught . <h> Where to Start and How to Look for Draughts <p> You will see the greatest effect , both in terms of comfort and also in terms of savings , when you tackle the largest drafts . The good news is that these are typically the easiest to find and you will be able to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a draught is to use the back of your hand as this is more sensitive to temperature and the movement of the air . Some people suggest using a candle to track down draughts as the flame will flicker in the draught , although great care must be taken as this is a fire risk . <p> You should look around any where there could be an unwanted gap that could let air in . The most common place that draughts occur are : <p> Around doors and windows <p> Loft hatches <p> Pipe work <p> Floors and skirting <p> Chimneys and fireplaces <p> Electrical fittings in ceilings or walls <p> As energy bills and concern for our CO2 emissions rise it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that your home is as energy efficient as possible . Draught proofing is the first step . <h> Where Not to Draught Proof <p> In some rooms good ventilation is vital ; if there is an open fire or open flue it is critical that there is a good supply of fresh air . Also in rooms where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilation is needed to take this moist air away . Typically these would be bathrooms , kitchens and utility rooms . <p> Air bricks are required to provide ventilation and they should not be covered or filled in . You can find out more about air bricks including when they should be used and how to fit them in our air bricks project . <p> It should go without saying that an extractor fan should not be covered , but they should also be maintained as if they are not working the room will be susceptible to moisture buildup , condensation and the inevitable black mould that will result . <h> Draught Proofing Doors and Windows <p> Poor fitting windows and doors is a major headache for any home owner . <p> There are several simple measures that you can take to help with this such as fitting draught strips around windows and doors . Many products are available today that are very easy to fit to help you with this such as self-adhesive draught proofing strips . These new products tend to last a lot longer and are substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more suited to draught proofing windows . <p> The basic principle of these types of draught sealers is that they are stuck around the inside of the opening section of a window or the section of the fixed window that the opening section closes into and seal any potential gaps that may be present around the window when it is closed . <p> For draught proofing doors and sash windows the best products to use are tack-on sprung metal or plastic strips . These can either feature a rubber strip or a compressible rubber seal . These are ideally suited to be positioned to the sides and tops of doors . <p> Draught Proofing Doors <p> For the threshold of the door ( the piece at the bottom ) special draught proofing products are available that fit to the exact width of your door . <p> Brush style excluders are fine in most applications , but if you have wooden or tiled floors , an under door excluder may work better . These are normally made of a soft rubber or foam and they are fixed to the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Depending on manufacturer and door type , normally they are fixed to the bottom of the door and protrude underneath to block the gap . Some will require you to remove the entire door as they need fixing to the actual base . <p> A very quick way to solve draughts at the foot of doors is to use a draught excluder . This can augment an existing brush draught excluder or as a temporary solution until you can fit a more permanent one . <p> Draught excluder - Image courtesy of shopcade.com <p> Another area of a door that is particularly prone to cold draughts is the letter box . Again , special products can be purchased that will fit over the letter plate area and dramatically reduce any draughts that are produced . <p> In most cases , as in the image below , the kit will comprise of 2 sealed units , one to fit on the outside and one to fit on the inside . Each section seals closed preventing any draughts from penetrating . <p> The keyhole is another area where draughts occur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops over the hole when it is not in use . This blocks the hole and stops the draught . The technical term for this keyhole cover is an escutcheon plate . <p> It is not only external doors that need draught proofing . You should also draught proof internal doors if they lead into unheated or uninhabited rooms as this in turn will also prevent the lowering of the overall indoor temperature . <h> Draught Proofing Loft Hatches <p> When insulating a loft , and often forgotten task is to insulate the hatch . Hot air rises and this can very easily escape through the hatch . Make sure that you fix some insulation to the top side of the hatch cover and this will insulate and keep the warmth in your home . <p> To draught proof the hatch , you should use the same kind of insulation strips that we have mentioned that you should use above for your doors and windows . This will ensure a tight fit and stop any air being able to pour through the gap and create , not only a nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your heating costs . <h> Draught Proofing Pipe Work and Cracks in Walls <p> While we always recommend insulating your hot water and heating pipes if they are not in a heated part of the home , there is more that you need to look out for . Where the pipes pass through walls and partitions , gaps can appear and draughts will be the result . <p> Into these gaps you should squirt filler to stop the air being able to get through . Use a flexible filler ( a decorators caulk , or silicon based mastic ) as there will be movement as the pipes heat up and expand and then cool and contract . <p> If the gaps are large you should use an expanding foam filler as this will have excellent insulating properties , it will quickly fill the gap and will get right into the nooks and crannies . Once is has expanded and set hard , you might need to cut it back flush with the wall and touch up with some caulk or decorators filler . <h> Draught Proofing Floors and Skirting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps that appear around pipe work . It is worth remembering that caulks and fillers come in a range of colours so you can match the colour to the floor board to make the draught proofing less obtrusive . <p> Fire places , chimneys and open flues are wide open gaps to the outside and they can allow the cold air to pour in when you 're not using them . You can tackle this issue from either end . <p> It is possible to fit a cap on top of the chimney stack that will stop the air getting down the chimney . It you do n't have a head for heights , you can always get a professional to do this . The other alternative is to fit a device that blocks the chimney from below . These block the air from coming any further down the chimney . They are inserted up the chimney from below and " opened " to fill the space , either opening like an umbrella or inflated like a balloon . <p> The best devices have a ( very ) obvious cord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need something obvious to ensure that you remember to remove them before you light a fire ! <p> A chimney balloon in place - Image courtesy of **28;305;TOOLONG <h> Draught Proofing Electrical Fittings in Ceilings or Walls <p> This is another area which is prone to draughts . Any gaps should be filled and blocked to stop the air getting through . <p> This can be a particular problem for down lights that are fitted into the ceiling . Here we recommend using a down light cap or cover that fits over the light fitting , reducing the air flow that can get through the light and into your nice , warm home . They are fire safe and will ensure that the loft insulation does not get pressed into the light fitting causing a fire risk . <p> A down light cover - image courtesy of efficiencymatrix.com.au <p> Draught proofing your home also has a slight disadvantage in that you will possibly be closing off a great many unofficial ventilation sources that allow your home to breath . <p> If you have fuel burning appliances in your home such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate source of fresh air in order for them to burn safely . In light of this , before you start to draught proof , it is a good idea to consult a fuel supplier or RGI ( Registered gas installer ) and ask them to check your home and see if there is still going to be an adequate source of ventilation after you have completed your draught proofing . <p> One final point to be aware of when draught proofing is that there may be an increase in condensation especially in areas such as the bathroom and the kitchen . Again , this can be solved easily with the addition of a controlled source of ventilation such as an extractor fan . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

This valve is the same as the one in your toilet cistern ( see our tanks and cisterns project ) , When the water rises it lifts the ballcock . <p> The ball is attached to an arm which closes the valve when it is lifted . When the tank is full of water , no more can get in because the valve is closed . When some water is drawn off , the ball drops , the valve opens and water rushes in to replace it . <p> To ensure no water comes in while you are draining the system down it is an easy job to place a piece of timber across the tank , lift up the valve arm and tie it to the timber . This will close the valve . <p> Closing off the valve while draining down your heating system <h> Draining Down Your Heating System <p> Now connect a hosepipe to the drain nozzle ( marked outlet in the below image ) and run it outside to a suitable point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not run onto the road or pavement where it could freeze and cause accidents . <p> Using an adjustable wrench , open up the drain valve and let the water from the system run through . <p> The water will run faster if you open any bleed valves on the radiators starting with the radiators at the top of the building . As the water level drops you can open the bleed valves in the downstairs radiators also . New valves and tools can be bought from the tool store below . <p> Various parts that make up a radiator valve <p> When no more water comes out of the hose you must check that the system has completley finished draining before you remove radiators or start work . <p> There is a chance that some air has got into the system and locked the water from escaping . To remedy this go into the loft and fill the tank with about 6 inches of water by loosening the arm you have tied up . <p> This should , in a few seconds , start running out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock and should connect the other end of the hose to the cold tap and send a short blast of water back into the radiator you are draining from .

How to fit and plumb in an inset kitchen sink . Follow this step-by-step guide with pictures , to help with cutting a kitchen worktop , plumbing a kitchen sink and fix your sink in place . <p> Fitting a kitchen sink , especially an inset kitchen sink and kitchen plumbing are not the easiest of DIY jobs and many people find them very scary , but with a little understanding of why you do things rather than just how you do them , the whole job is a lot easier . <p> Kitchen Base Unit for a Sink <h> Fitting Kitchen Base Units for Sinks <p> Kitchen sink units , as with other base units , come with an open top ready for the sinks or hobs to be inserted ( this can be seen in the first image above ) . When the base unit is in place it is much easier , at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit just to see where the kitchen taps and waste will go . See our related projects on how to fit base units . <p> This allows you to do the plumbing in a more open space , and to be able to reach down from the top , before you fit the worktop . <p> Many people fit the worktop and sink first then struggle underneath it in a really confined space , but there is no need to fit the kitchen worktop before you get the plumbing ready to accept the sink and taps . <p> If you have wood or Formica worktops you will be able to cut your own worktops to size and shape and you will be able to cut the holes you need for your sink , taps and other appliances . The best tool to use for this is a jigsaw . <p> Use a jigsaw to cut your worktops <p> There are composite kitchen worktops that have to have the sink or the holes for the sink , hob etc. moulded into the worktop by the manufacturer . As these come preformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you order your worktops . <p> You can also have stone , granite , marble or stainless steel worktops , and these are also easier to order with the holes you need already in place , although you can cut these materials yourself , it is a more advanced DIY skill to do so . <p> When the worktop is fitted and all the pipes for the plumbing are roughly in place inside the base unit , lay the sink on the worktop . <p> Most sink perimeters will be 25mm larger than the opening that they are intended to sit in , and many sinks come with a paper template which makes cutting the hole a lot easier . <h> Cutting Kitchen Worktops for a Sink <p> Place your sink upside down on the worktop to enable you to see where to mark out the cutting area . <p> Position your sink on top of the worktop <p> Place the sink where you want it to sit on the base unit , checking that the depth of the sink will drop down unobstructed inside the unit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink . Measure in from the pencil mark 25mm all around ( or whatever measurement is recommended by the manufacturer ) . Then use masking tape to tape out the area that needs to be removed .

You can drill more than one hole if it makes it easier for you to cut round the inside of the tapes .

You will learn about the type of scraper you should use and also how to use it to ensure that you do not scratch the glass or create any other permanent damage . You will also learn about specialist cleaners and paint strippers that can be used to remove dried paint from glass and windows and also about special masking tape that prevents paint bleed on to glazing while painting . <p> A badly painted window looks a mess ! Even if you have spent the time painting the frame up really nicely , if you get paint on the glass it totally spoils the overall job . <p> Traditionally using masking tape to tape over the glass around the inside of the window can help but most masking tape never seems to stick to the glass completely and the paint nearly always finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several products have emerged with the purpose of solving this exact problem , one such product can be seen in the image below . It is a special type of low-tack masking tape that reacts with emulsion paint when it touches it to form a barrier and stop it going any further . <p> Despite using special masking tape , there is a tendency to take less care as subconsciously you think that the glass is protected . This can lead to you taking less care with the brush and increase the risk of paint finding its way onto the glass . <p> fortunately , any spillages are pretty easy to get rid of . If the paint is still wet e.g. you have just put it on and caught the glass by mistake , use an old , clean cloth to wipe it off . <p> If it has dried on there are essentially two different ways you can get rid of it : <p> Use a scraper to scrape the paint off <p> Use a solvent based paint remover <h> Removing Paint from Glass with a Scraper <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grab a bucket and put some warm water in it and add some washing up liquid to it , mixing it in until you get bubbles start to form . <p> Using a cloth or sponge , pop it in the bucket and get it nice and wet and then wipe the window over around the area of the paint mark(s) making it damp . The washing up liquid in the water will help ensure that the scraper moves over the surface of the glass smoothly and minimise any risks of scratching . <p> Once the glass has been wetted down , take your scraper and insert a new blade . A new , sharp blade will make the job of scraping the paint off much easier . Be careful when inserting the new blade as they are very sharp . <p> If you have recently painted areas around the window or window sill and the paint has not yet dried properly , it may be best to leave it until it has as we will be using soapy water and spilling the water on tacky paint may cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish . <p> The scraper itself is pretty straight forward to use . Hold it so that blade is touching the glass and is as flat as possible - no more than 45- . If held at a sharp or acute angle , the blade could dig into the glass and scratch it or even worth crack or break it . <p> Before you start , test the blade on a small area , preferably in one corner to test whether all is working as it should and the blade is not causing damage . <p> When using it , make sure that you lift it off the surface of the glass between scrapes so that you are only scraping in one direction . This will decrease the chances of any scratches . <p> Additionally , make sure that the blade you 're using remains sharp . If it starts to make a scraping or scratching noise then change it for a new one . Above all , just take your time and do n't rush as this could lead to more damage . <p> Make sure that you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent scratches and also to remove any loose paint . <p> When you 're done and all the paint has been removed from the surface , use the soapy water to give it a good clean all round and then use a chamois leather or window squeegee to remove any remaining moisture or streaks . <p> The same scraper can be used to scrape unwanted transfers from ceramic tiles . Once the transfers have been removed it is advisable to rub over the tile surface hard with a cloth dipped in white spirit . This should remove any remaining adhesive . <p> Paint splash removed from PVCu door glazing <h> Removing Paint from Glass with Solvents and Specialist Paint Removers <p> There are many different types of solvents and specialist cleaners for glass and paint removal on the market all with their own positives and negatives .

Understand how to colour the adhesive you are using to get the perfect match and follow our tips so that you can hide the worktop joint . Learn about filling gap between worktops and the wall and filling gaps in granite and stone worktops . <p> Having fitted a kitchen worktop you may discover that the joints you have are not the tidiest bit of carpentry you have ever seen . Even using a worktop jig does not make the process easy for the DIY'er . <p> It takes a very skilled carpenter to produce invisible joints and we always suggest working out exactly the length of worktop you need and , if you plan to fit it yourself , to order a little extra to practice joints on . <p> Even if you order the cheapest possible worktop it is worth spending a day following our mitering a worktop project and wasting some timber to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier it will be to fill and hide .

These adhesives come in a range of colours which can be mixed and matched to suit the worktop colour you have . If you have a reasonably tight join it is possible to use other adhesive products to mitre the worktop . <p> The reason that the professionals do this is because the adhesive specifically designed for worktops can go off very quickly and due to this are the devil to clean up .

The filler will change the colour of the adhesive and make it slightly lighter so always mix a little and leave to dry for an hour or so before you assume the colour is correct . <p> Some manufacturers will caution against mixing their worktop fillers and adhesives . You should always follow the manufactures guidelines to ensure that you are okay to do this . <p> Mix colours with filler <p> Time spent on worktop joints can make or break the finish of a kitchen .

Getting it right is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A very neat and disguised worktop joint - Can you see where the joint is ? <h> Filling Gaps between the Worktop and the Wall <p> Another common area where you might find unwanted gaps is where the worktop meets the wall . There are a number of potential solutions to this problem and which to use will depend of the situation and your taste : <p> Tiling the wall : In some cases the wall might not be totally flat and then the worktop will not fit snugly against the whole length of the wall . Up to gaps of around 10 or possibly 20 mm it is possible for a skilled tiller to disguise a gap by varying the thickness of the tile adhesive . In some cases you can also use tile backer boards . Using smaller tiles will make this approach and make the job much easier . This does take some skill and practice to achieve a finish that you will not notice <p> Fixing some coving or corner moulding : If you use some tile corner moulding ( just like coving ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this might be a little time consuming <p> On the whole , filling gaps in worktops is all about covering up errors , and the bigger the error the harder it is to cover the problem . The errors may not be yours as the walls may well have been built out of square and are not at all flat . This is why we recommend that you plan the project from the start and then practice on the areas that require a little more skill . This way the gaps you have to fill will be much smaller , and you will save hours of work at the end of the project . <h> Filling Gaps in Granite and Stone Worktops <p> Typically the worktop has been cut to size in the workshop and will be brought to site to be assembled . The joints are fixed with a coloured epoxy resin . Either side of the joint should be masked to stop any resin getting onto the surface of the worktop , and then the resin should be mixed with the hardener . <p> This will cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply it to the join . Push the resin into the joint using a filling knife working it in and ensuring that there are no gaps . Once the joint is totally filled you can remove the masking tape , leaving you a neat joint . <h> Seaming a Granite Worktop <p> Granite is a very heavy , very expensive material . For these reasons granite worktops will often have more joints , or seams , than wooden worktops . <p> Smaller units are more easily and more safely transported and laid . While this can save time and money , it becomes more important that you know exactly what you are doing when joining the worktop <p> A joint in granite worktops , often called a seam or seaming a granite worktop , is only as good as the cut that has been made for it . Only absolute top quality diamond blades should be used and the top should always be placed in a jig so the cut is made as a perfectly straight line and perhaps even more importantly , perfectly plumb . It is impossible ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a granite worktop through cutting by hand . <p> Once cut , seams are often made these days with strong , 2-part adhesives using an accelerator to both clean up the surfaces and produce a rapid bond . Once seamed in this way the joints are almost as strong as the granite itself . <p> It is fairly obvious that the thinner the material used as an adhesive in the joint , the closer the two halves can get to each other and the less noticeable the joint will be . <p> Most of the two-part adhesives are pretty much instant so it is vital that both halves of the piece are lined up perfectly before the seam is pushed together . <p> Laying one edge along a straight batten can achieve this although some pros use a proprietary jig with a screw type arrangement called a " Turnbuckle " to slowly tighten the two parts into alignment and , once there , to keep them tightly clamped for the 20 seconds or so it takes for the adhesive to cure and set . <p> Turnbuckles can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The worktop parts must be laid perfectly flat before they are tightened and clamped together . It is also possible , if the worktop halves are small enough , to use sash clamps to tighten the seam .

@@41624876 @1624876/ <p> Building retaining walls in the garden is a very popular subject on DIY Doctor . Soil is very heavy , weighing over one tonne per cubic metre so any walls built to retain a part of your garden needs to be as strong as possible . Keeping garden retaining walls attractive at the same time as building them in the strongest way is not difficult and that is what this project is about . <p> In this project you will find out about the rules for garden retaining walls as well as the different ways to finish them off to look most attractive . The actual process of laying the bricks and/or block can be found in our other projects by looking in the related projects to the left of this page . There you will find out how to actually lay brick and blocks onto a solid foundation . <p> The basic rules governing the building of a garden retaining walls are simple . Firstly the foundation you place should be a minimum of 150mm ( 6 inches ) thick . For information on how to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mix should be a standard C20 mix . More can be seen about the C20 mix in our project on mixing concrete . You will also be able to work out the quantity of materials your require in our volume calculator on this page . <p> The width of the foundation should be twice that of the width of the wall you are building and the wall should be placed in the centre of the foundation . If you need to build a wall 225mm wide the foundation should be 450mm wide . This will give you a foundation overlap of 112mm either side of the finished wall . <p> To work out how thick the wall needs to be ( A ) you must first work out how deep the garden will be ( B ) at the point you plan to build the wall . When you have measured how deep the garden will be you simply divide it by 4 to get the required thickness of wall . If your retaining wall is holding back a 1m depth of garden then it needs to be 225mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the width of a standard brick @ 112mm . <p> When you excavate for your foundation we suggest that ( having worked out how high your wall will be ) you dig the same distance back to allow room to work ( C ) and to avoid any earth falling into the foundation and onto the new wall until it is hard enough to withstand it . We also suggest , when building the wall , that for the extra few pounds it will cost , it is a great idea to strengthen the wall by using galvanised expanded metal lathing in the brickwork or blockwork joints . This EML can be bought in our tool store below and is easily rolled out into the mortar joints and cut to length using tin snips . <p> A garden retaining wall of up to 400mm high can be built out of a single skin wall of facing bricks or concrete block . A wall any higher than this needs to be thicker and there are several ways of achieving this . Bricks can be laid in two skins which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 225mm thick wall as shown in the laying bricks project . Concrete blocks can be used by laying them side by side , again with mesh ties holding the two sections together , or by laying them flat to give either a 225mm wide wall , or long ways to give a 450mm wide wall . <p> There are also proprietary products for building strong walls and one of these is the hollow concrete block . These blocks are laid as normal and after every 3 courses the voids are filled with concrete for a very strong job . Reinforcing steel can also be pushed down through the voids to virtually double the strength of the wall . Another way of using reinforcing steel in a garden retaining wall is to use a brickwork bond called Quetta Bond .

This will weaken the wall and may damage it enough for the garden pressure to be able to push it over . To stop this happening it is a fairly simple job to install weep vents into the brickwork or blockwork joints for the complete thickness of the wall . The vents can be bought from our tools store and are placed end to end across the vertical joints . <p> The weep vents should be installed one third of the way up the wall . See our project on freeze thaw action to see how frost affects brickwork and blockwork. 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Push button cisterns are designed to use less water . On most push button cisterns the overflow is also internal ( just below the number 2 ) and if the inlet valve fails for any reason , the water flows over the centre of the flush unit into the toilet bowl . This is obviously seen as constantly running water in your toilet bowl and should be addressed as soon as possible . <p> When water will not stop enetering the cistern it is because the cistern entry valve is faulty . This can be rectified by reading our project on cisterns , tanks and valves and scrolling down to the valves section . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Find out how to fit a stylish concealed mixer shower with the shower valve and pipes embedded in the wall so that they can not be seen . Fitting and plumbing a concealed shower can vary in difficulty a great deal depending on the type of shower you buy . The rule is pretty much the same throughout all areas of home improvement : The better the quality , the easier it is to fit . This project focusses on fitting a bar mixer valve to a concealed shower running off a combination boiler but the principles of fitting , and concealing the pipework , are the same for most types of shower . <h> What Does Concealed Shower Mean ? <p> Fitting a concealed shower means hiding the pipework in the wall , floor or ceiling .

This project is about levelling old timber floors , repairing and replacing timber joists . We show you how to lay floor boards over the leveled joists , how to cut the floor boards to the right shape and how to use a chalk line . Ultimately you will have a level floor with well fitted boards . <p> Floors in older properties are very often out of level . Generally this is caused by a bowing of the floor joists which , very often , are not strong enough to fully support the weight placed on them . Over the years they bow and make life difficult when fitting new wardrobes or showers etc . <p> Rather than attempt to lift the floor by " packing out " between the boards and the joist ( the packing invariably works loose as the floor moves with use ) it is easier , and more cost effective in the long run , to remove the floor boards and level the joists by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also possible to repair and replace sections of joists , in situ , without disturbing the entire floor . <p> If , as shown above right , the brickwork itself is loose , damp and crumbling , then check the joist for wet and dry rot . <p> Bowed Floor Joist <p> New , sawn timbers can be bought from your local builders or timber merchants . Each new joist should be checked by laying it on a level surface , on its narrow edge , before purchasing . There is little point replacing bowed timbers , with bowed timbers ! <p> The existing bow may be the result of a weak timber , in which case simply fixing a new , straight one to the side will be effective . The new timber should be taken the full length of the old joist even if there is only a slight bow in the middle . Remember the old joist bowed because it is too weak , you must therefore give it as much strength as possible . <p> If the bow , or slope , is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber ) having crumbled away over time , then this fault must be addressed before a satisfactory repair can be effected . Old , crumbling bricks should be replaced , or jointed properly wherever possible . If it is the end of the timber that has crumbled , this will have happened for a reason . Look for signs of damp in the wall , and rot in the timbers . Get to the cause of these defects first and eradicate them . <p> If the existing joists offer little in the way of support , there is no point using them to support the new joists . You local builders merchants can supply " joist hangers " , the correct size for your new joists . These are galvanised metal brackets , into which you slot a joist . They have a strong lip , which is then inserted into a brickwork joint , or fixed on a timber or steel support . <p> To level the entire floor , it is best to start with the two end joists . Then a string line can be fixed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the level for the joists in between . The string line would be fixed in position x in the diagram below . <p> There is always the possibility , in older properties , that your floor joists have dropped at one end because the timber has become rotten and compressed . Thanks to some incredible , yet simple technology it is now possible to replace sections of joists and rafters , in situ . Take a look at the images below to see how this works . <p> There are very few " square " rooms . The diagram below represents a typical room , within which the dotted lines represent a square section of the room . 1 &amp; 2 are the walls of the room while A , B , C etc are the floorboards . D and G are the probable shape of cuts you will need to make . <p> Once your joists are in place and level as described above , floor boards can be fixed . It is important that the boards run at right angles to the joists regardless of the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out the room so that you will get the first board down in the correct position . Using the 3,4,5 method of obtaining a right angle , which is fully explained in our Tips and Tricks pages , starting a project you will be able to mark a line across the new joists running between the points marked x on the diagram . We suggest a chalk line for this . See Using a chalk line : <p> It is also important that you work out the width of the room compared to the number of floorboards it will take to cover it . Measure carefully , or even use an offcut of board , marking the position of boards on a joist . This is to make sure you have a sensible cut at each end and not a full board at one end and a -+ inch cut at the other . Additional " trimming joists " may have to be inserted around fireplaces , chimneys etc to make sure the end of each board is well supported . <p> Lay your first board through the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark and lay boards A , B , &amp; C. Do not fix these last three boards . Laying the last boards , D and G against the walls 1 and 2 , is a difficult job and can only be done properly if two or three boards , including the cuts , are pushed together and laid as one . <p> Work across the room fixing each board by your preferred method , until you get to board F. Then lay F , E and D , together with the cut G , in one go . <p> Cuts D and G can be effected by , having laid A , B , C and D , E , F in position , unfixed , laying a full board against the walls 1 and 2 , and marking the other side of the board onto boards C and D. This will give you the exact shape and size of the cut . Remove the marked boards , C and D and cut out the shape you have marked on them . Two new boards will be needed to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . Remember to make allowance for the tongue on each board when you mark . <p> The chalk line would be held on points x either by a bent nail at one end , with you at the other , or get the help of a friend . Pull the line tight , and then lift it and let it go . The " ping " of the chalk line will leave a mark across the top of the joists . Our demonstration photos below shows a standard chalk line , the chalk refill pot and how to " ping " a line . A very useful , inexpensive tool .

This projects is about using ladders and how to clean gutters safely . We show you how you can use an anchor eye and strapping in order to strap the feet of a ladder to a walls surface and prevent it from slipping or striking out . Ladder safety when using ladders to work at height is hugely important and overlooked by many so ensure that you prevent potential slips by strapping the ladders feet . Additionally , find out about how to clean your gutters safely and also how to prevent build up of leaves , moss and debris in your gutters . <p> When using a ladder , safety should be your primary concern . Never work on a ladder alone . <p> Cleaning gutters is a very popular question at DiyDoctor . We have decided to combine this project with one on ladder safety as it is a big concern to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . <p> Firstly its important to know that the optimum safety angle for a ladder is 4 to 1 . This is demonstrated in the image below . <p> Safe working angles for ladders <p> The bottom of a ladder , ( and ideally the top also ) should be secured to the surface you are working on . Usually we ask someone to stand at the bottom or " foot " of the ladder to stop the feet of the ladder sliding away from the wall . <h> Inspect the Condition of Your Ladder <p> It is also important to check the condition of your ladder before you use it . When it comes to ladders , there are two main types - timber and aluminium . <p> Most ladders available on the market these days tend to be of the latter kind due to the longevity of aluminium as a material as it does n't rust or degrade terribly quickly . Use the following checklist to evaluate the condition of your ladder : <p> Timber Ladders <p> Check both the side lengths of the ladder for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for chips , splits and cracks <p> Check any joints for signs of movement or separation <p> Check any screws or bolts for damage , movement or wear <p> Check the entire ladder for any evidence of woodworm or boring insect damage <p> Check for any damp or general storage damage <p> Single section wooden ladder - Image courtesy of ramsayladders.co.uk <p> Aluminium Ladders <p> Check the whole ladder over for signs of movement or separation in the joints <p> Check for any kinks or crush damage .

This allows you to move around clearing and cleaning gutters in perfect safety . <p> Phone a Friend <p> We would at this point suggest , especially if you live on your own , that if you intend to use a ladder and you are at all unsure , its a great idea to call a friend and tell them you will call them back when the work is finished . If something awful happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not lay there in pain for too long . <p> Workout Position for Ladder <p> Firstly work out where you are likely to need to put the ladder . Work out how far you can reach with either arm extended , and mark the wall in the position where the ladder will go each time you move it . <p> You should find , that to stay safe , the centres of the bolts need to be at about 1600mm . <p> Drill Hole for Your Anchor Eye <p> Next , drill a hole ( we use a 14mm Anchor Eye which needs a 14mm hole ) if possible under the Damp Proof Course , angled downward slightly . If any water gets into this hole it will run out again straight away . <p> Drilling hole for anchor bolt <p> Tap in Anchor Bolt Sleeve <p> Next tap the Anchor Eye into the hole . This can be done with the eye bolt screwed in , or as we have done , just the casing . <p> Knocking in anchor bolt sleeve <p> Insert and Tighten Anchor Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened the outer casing expands , griping the masonry . If you have any doubt as to the effectiveness of these bolts just picture the modern day climbers risking their lives on exactly this principle to hold them on a rope at 20,000 feet ! <p> Anchor bolt with closed sleeve <p> Open anchor bolt showing how it grips into wall <p> Secure Your Ladder With a Strap <p> Once you have inserted your anchor eye and successfully screwed it up tight and it is firmly fixed you can now go about securing your ladder to it . <p> Using a ladder safety strap or ladder tensioning strap as they are sometimes known , thread one end through the anchor eye and secure one end to the ladder at its base using the loop on the strap itself . <p> Now run the other end of the strap around to meet the feet of the ladder on the other side and secure it using whatever method is supplied with the strap . <p> Depending on the who manufactured the strap will depend on how it is clipped or secured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be very similar for all . If in any doubt , please refer to the manufacturers guidelines . <p> You can also make you own ladder strap - Thread a length of rope or webbing through the eye bolt and tie two loops in the ends at the required distance away from the wall . If you are making your own , please make sure that the material you are using for the strap is strong enough and it does not break under the tension and pressure applied to it by the ladder . <p> Wire rope can be used and can stay within the eye when removed , then just hung up in the garage when not being used . <p> Anchor Eye screwed to wall and safety strap attached <p> Once the ladder is fixed with the strap pull the bottom put until the strap is tight . This will prevent the ladder from striking out as the straps are now under tension . <p> Pull ladder out until strap in tight <p> Ladder strapped safely to wall <p> Bucket hook <p> You can see from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang the bucket on while we clean gutters . This means we have always got one hand free to hold on with . We also use an elbow length pair of rubber gloves because sometimes the stuff in the gutter is not as fragrant as one would like ! <h> Using a Ladder to Clean Your Guttering <p> Most householders tend not to think about gutters until it rains , which is usually not a great time to be cleaning them anyway ! The damage caused by blocked gutters can go unnoticed until there are bigger problems with damp walls or mould . Ensuring your gutters are able to do the job they are designed to do is therefore important . <p> This is a very simple project but one which will keep you safe and stop you putting off the high level jobs you may have been scared to tackle until now .

Thirty years ago people would have laughed at the idea of buying water in bottles until we started to realise what was in it ! <h> Types of Water Filter <p> Charcoal and Carbon Water Filters <p> Most water filters today use what is called activated charcoal . Activated charcoal is charcoal , which itself is mostly carbon , that has been through chemical processes to make it soak up more water . When purchasing a filter of this type you will need to make sure that it uses activated charcoal . <p> Additionally , you will also have to change the filter on a regular basis to ensure that it maintains peak performance . <p> The water is absorbed into the charcoal which retains the impurities and pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one kind of filter but they are not the be all and end all . Charcoal filters will absorb most of the impurities found in drinking water but they will not remove lead and copper . <p> If you are thinking about installing one of these units it has to be said that it is not the most cost-effective solution due to the changing of filters and also many people have found that storing a covered jug of water in the fridge is almost as good in terms of refining the taste . <p> Carbon water filter tap kit <p> Reverse Osmosis Water Filters <p> Another type of filter is an osmosis unit , or rather a reverse osmosis unit . This involves a great deal of water being pushed , or pumped , through a very very fine membrane removing a great deal of dissolved solids that exist in the water . It not only separates the bacteria etc .... but it separates some of the water too . <p> This water is wasted ( some estimate between 20 - 30% ) so reverse osmosis filters are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This particular type of filter also changes the physical properties of tap water and due to this many have deemed it unfit for drinking or other domestic uses . If it is to be used for drinking or cooking in the home then additional steps have to be taken to add back into the water certain minerals that are removed . <p> Installing this type of filter also has another downside - The pressure of the incoming water flow is significantly reduced . <p> You might be thinking if it ca n't be used in a domestic situation then where can it be used ? Well , this particular type of filter is ideal for use in places where removal of the heavier particles is key making it ideal for hydroponic gowning setups and photographic development . <p> Reverse osmosis water filter kit <p> Ion Exchange Water Filters <p> Another filter system is called ion exchange and involves a chemical process within the filter which exchanges filter ions with the natural ions in the water which contain minerals and salts . In most situations sodium is used to replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neutralising these salts and minerals has the effect of softening the water and reducing the build up of limescale making them great for use in hot water systems and domestic appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers increasing efficiency and also the longevity of the system or appliance in question . <p> Ion exchange filters do not work however when there is a lot of iron in the water . <p> Again , as with reverse osmosis systems it is recommended that any water filtered by this method is not used for drinking or cooking due to the higher levels of sodium and the potential health risks this can bring . <h> What Type of Water Filter Tap Should I Use ? <p> In respect to the points above , choosing a filter really depends on the water you have and more importantly , what you are going to use it for e.g. not for human consumption . <p> For best results telephone your water supplier and ask for the results of their latest analysis . This will give you a better idea of the best kind of filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next is how you install it - all filters have a cartridge and most are charcoal based ( if being used to supply drinking water ) . <p> You can exchange your kitchen tap with a 3 way tap seen in the image at the top of this page . This will give you hot and cold water as normal , then a third lever is connected to a water filter which is installed under the sink . <p> When it comes to plumbing the unit in - this is normally just a matter of tapping into the cold water feed but depending on the system you have chosen and the manufacturer will depend on exactly how this is done . To these ends pretty much all filter kits will come with their own installation instructions . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624894 @1624894/ <h> Building Regulations Approved Document L - Conservation of Fuel and Power in New and Existing Properties and Dwellings <p> Summary : Building Regulations Approved Document L consists of four different parts L1A , L1B , L2A and L2B with each part focused on either a new property that is to be built or an existing property that is undergoing home improvement works . The document also covers properties that used as dwellings and those that are not classed as such . The document is in place to ensure that and power that is used , is used in such manner that it is not wasted or allowed to escape the property . In essence it ensures that any and all materials used in construction are as energy efficient as possible . <p> With the ever-growing awareness of energy usage and conservation , depleting fossil fuel stocks and damage to the environment , the conservation of fuels such as gas , oil and electricity that we rely on every day is pretty much everywhere we go . <p> With this in mind it 's no wonder that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in home improvement and construction works to ensure that the energy efficiency of a property is at least maintained at its current level , if not improved upon . <p> To these ends , Approved Document L deals with the conservation of power and fuel . As this is quite an expansive subject , this document has been broken up into four parts so that each can be dealt with in full for both existing and new dwellings and also new and existing buildings that are not used as dwellings , they are as follows : <h> Part L of Schedule 1 : Fuel and Power Conservation <p> In essence , this part of the Building Regulations ensures that when any alterations are made to an existing property or a new property is constructed ( whether it 's a dwelling or non-dwelling ) , that the following are achieved : <p> Heat gain and loss is limited through the use of thermal control elements and other parts of the fabric of the building and also through any ducting , pipework , space heaters or coolers and hot water systems <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible and have the ability to be controlled and also when installed that they are tested and adjusted accordingly to ensure that they no more fuel than is necessary considering the circumstances <p> In most situations when you are undertaking building or home improvement works you will have an architect that will draw up plans for planning permission and then also detailed drawings for submission to your local building control departement so that they can confirm that the work will comply with any relevant approved documents , rules and also any local stipulations that they may have . <p> Whilst drawing up your plans and putting the requirements for your job into a practicable and workable build , the architect will also pay attention to the materials that will be used and ensure that they meet energy efficiency rules and regulations etc .... <p> Technically , it is possible to do all of this yourself - produce your own plans , liaise with planning and building regs , source all the correct materials that will meet the desired regs etc .... but without the knowledge and experience that is gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very long and arduous task involving a huge amount of research . <p> With this in mind , the following is a summary of the guidelines for each specific section of the Approved Document L : <h> Approved Document L1A - Conserving Fuel and Power in New Dwellings <p> The following are the key requirements of document L1A . To ensure that these are met , compliance software should be used that will give an output report that building control can then assess for compliance . <p> Criteria 1 <p> This part ensures compliance with regulation 26 and states that the rate of carbon dioxide emission or DER ( dwelling CO2 emission rate ) that is concerned with CO2 emission from the property must not be any greater than the TER ( or target CO2 emission rate ) . <p> In addition to this the DFEE ( dwelling fabric energy efficiency rate ) that is calculated must be no greater than the TFEE ( target fabric energy efficiency rate ) . This is stated in regulation 26A . <p> NOTE : This particular criteria is mandatory and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculations produced during this procedure can also be used to provide information for the production of an Energy Performance Certificate . <p> Criteria 2 <p> The guidelines set out in the criteria state that all fabric elements and services fixed within the structure should all reach a decent standard of energy efficiency . <p> It is noted that these particular rules are in place to ensure that there are n't any unreasonable trade-off 's e.g. cheap insulation material that is not very efficient is not offset against an efficient renewable energy source such as a solar system , that would still produce the required level to pass , even though certain elements are not as good as they could be . <p> Criteria 3 <p> This section is all about control over heat levels within summer months . It should be ensured that any temperature gains within the hotter summer months are controlled and thus there is no need to install counter-measures such as an air conditioning system . <p> It should also be noted that this section will need to be satisfied even if there is an existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guidelines state that the overall energy performance of the property should be inline with the TFEE and TER set rates . <p> Criteria 5 <p> These guidelines basically state that once any building works have been completed then the person that completed the work should provide the owner with suitable instruction on how to use any elements within it so that they can remain as energy efficient as possible . <p> Additionally , the owner should also be provided with any information pertaining to the maintenance of the property and any items within it to again , ensure that all runs as efficiently as possible . <p> The regs state that where an individual thermal element is to be renovated , if this renovation amounts to a major job or over 50% of the surface of the thermal element itself needs to be renovated then the entire element will still need to comply with the rules set out in paragraph L1(a) ( i ) ( limiting heat gain and loss through thermal elements and other areas of the fabric of the building ) . <p> Where a thermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the work involved amounts to a major job or more than 50% of the surface of the thermal element is to be replaced then as with the above , the entire element itself will still need to comply with paragraph L1(a) ( i ) . <p> Energy Performance Improvements as a Consequence - Regulation 28 <p> This part of Approved Document L1B is concerned with an already existing building that has a floor space than can be used that is over 1000m2 where any work being carried out is either an extension , the initial installation or increase in capacity of any fixed building services then you have to have energy assesment carried out to get an EPC . <p> It should also be noted that where paragraph 3 applies , all and any work should be undertaken as necessary to make sure that the building still complies with the rules set out in Part L of schedule 1 . Additionally you should be aware that no items included in paragraph 2 need to be carried out if the work involved is not economically , functionally or technically possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , please see Approved Document L1B available on the link above . <p> Certificates for Energy Performance <p> This section of the regs applies to both new constructions and also alterations to existing properties where existing fixed services ( heating , hot water , mechanical ventilation or air conditioning ) need to be provided or extended . <p> Where the above applies , whoever is carrying out the work will also need to provide an Energy Performance Certificate ( EPC ) to the owner and also inform the local authority that the work has been undertaken and provide them with registration number for the EPC . This has to be provide no later than 5 days after the work is completed . <p> In terms of the EPC , it should : <p> State the asset rating of the property <p> Include the legal standard benchmark or reference value <p> Be issued by a certified energy assessor that is qualified to produce a certificate for the particular works that have been undertaken <p> The issuer must also produce a Recommendation Report of improvements that could be undertaken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be valid and the certificate and recommendations must also be valid too <p> The certificate also needs to state a reference number that was entered on to the register for the data set that was used to produce the certificate <p> The address of the property ( unless it is a portable property in which case the registered owners address needs to be stated ) <p> An estimation of the buildings total , usable floor space <p> The energy assessors name <p> The energy assessors employers address ( if self-employed , their trading name and address needs to be stated ) <p> The date of issue of the certificate <p> The name of the assessors accreditation scheme to which he/she is a member <p> In some cases , certification for several units can be based on just one unit if they are all the same or very similar and all use the same construction methods , materials etc .... <p> In the case of flats or multiple units within the same building , certification is excluded if they all share a common heating system . <p> When a property features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-dwelling sections can be based on a common certificate for all the non-dwelling areas . <p> Where you have multiple , single dwellings that are all based on the same design , size , construction methods , quality of energy performance and materials etc .... certification can be granted by an energy assessor providing they confirm that this compliance will indeed be guaranteed . <p> In respect to the validity of a certificate , it can only be classed as valid if it was entered on to the register not more than 10 years prior to the date it became available and that it has not been replaced by a newer certificate . It must also not contain any personally identifiable information . <p> Recommendation Reports for Regulation 29A <p> Previously , we mentioned that an energy assessor should also issue a " Recommendation Report " that covers and details any cost-effective improvements that could be made to the overall energy performance of a property . <p> The report has to include : <p> Any reasonable cost improvements to fixed building services that can be made to a property that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be made to individual building elements that can be done without the need for major renovation <p> Information on how the property owner can access more in-depth knowledge on how they can improve theirs buildings energy efficiency and also for details on the cost of the recommendations <p> Details on what 's involved in implementing the recommended steps <p> The issuer of the recommendations must also ensure that any improvements that they recommend are actually realistic . <h> Approved Document L2A - Conserving Fuel and Power in New Buildings That are not Dwellings <p> As with the other 2 sections above , this document also pertains to the core directives of Part L of schedule 1 as a whole and ensures that any heat gains or losses are limited and any fixed building services feature effective control , are as energy efficient as possible and when commissioned , are tested and adjusted to make sure any fuel use is reasonable for where they are installed . <p> The compliance for this particular document falls into five separate criteria that are in fact very similar to those for Approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate for the building ( or BER ) should be no greater than the target emission rate ( or TER ) . <p> Again as with document L1A , this regulation is mandatory in all circumstances and the calculation data used in the process can be used to produce the required EPC ( energy performance certificate ) . <p> Criteria 2 <p> Any fixed building services and fabric elements used in construction should reach reasonable energy efficiency standards . Again , this rule is in place to limit the potential for any unreasonable trade-off 's such as the use of materials with a poor insulation value traded off against the installation of a renewable energy source such as solar . <p> Criteria 3 <p> This criteria ensures that the building will have suitable controls that can be used to reduce solar gain during hotter summer months and avoid the need to install less-than-efficient air conditioning systems . <p> Criteria 4 <p> It must be confirmed that the building , once completed , will remain within the boudries set by the BER ( building CO2 emission rate ) . This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 of document L2A that is concerned with construction quality and commissioning . <p> Criteria 5 <p> The final criteria states that provisions should be put into place to ensure that the building , once complete , continues to operate in as efficient manner as possible . In most cases this will be achieved through the builder/installed providing the owner with all the facts and information needed to operate systems such as heating and ventilation etc .... and that the owner is also aware of any maintenance items that need to be regularly looked at . <p> Many of the guidelines and points covered in this document are similar to those outlined L1B as again , we are dealing with an existing property but this time , a non-dwelling property . In respect to this the points that need to be recognised are as follows : <p> Renovating or Replacing Thermal Elements <p> When a thermal element needs to be renovated , if it is considered a major renovation or more than 50% of its surface will need renovating then it must be insured that the entire element complies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If an individual element needs to be replaced and this is considered to be a substantial renovation or ( if part is being replaced ) over 50% of the items surface area will be replaced , again , it has to be ensured that this complies with L1(a) ( i ) of schedule 1 . <p> Improvements to Energy Performance as a Consequence <p> As with document L1B , this section applies to paragraph 2 and to existing buildings with a total usable floor area over 1000m2 and involves in includes the following works : <p> The extension of the building <p> First provision of fixed building services <p> Increasing the capacity of any existing fixed building service <p> For paragraph two of this part of the document and where paragraph three applies , any and all work will need to be carried out to ensure that the entire still building with all the points set out in Part L , schedule 1 . <p> As with part L1B , any works or requirements stated in paragraph two do not need to be carried out if they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy Performance Certificates <p> The regs set out in these guidelines are very similar to those stated in document L1B ( outlined above ) and are concerned with the production , registration and presentation of the EPC certificate ( Energy Performance Certificate ) . <p> It states that the person performing the work should : <p> Present the owner with a Energy Performance Certificate <p> Present the local authority with notice of the EPC and also supply them with a reference number for the certificate <p> Ensure that the EPC is supplied no more than five days after completion of works <p> Ensure that the certificate states the asset rating in the matter outlined under regulation 24 <p> State a reference value such as a benchmark or legal standard <p> Only be issued by an assessor that is qualified to issue certificates for the type of building that the certificate itself relates to <p> Include a recommendation report of suggestions on how the properties energy efficiency can be reasonably improved <p> Ensure validity as stated in paragraph 9 <p> Include a reference number for the registered data set that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building in question ( unless portable in which case the owners address is stated ) and estimation of the total usable floor area of the building <p> It should also state the name of the assessor that created it , their employer ( unless self-employed in which case their trading name and address should be stated ) , the date that it was issued and also the name of the accreditation scheme the assessor is affiliated with <p> As with document L1B , apartment blocks , or properties split into flats can be based but exclude situations where blocks , units or flats share a common heating system . In some situations assessments can be based on units where all are similar . <p> Where you have many individual dwellings that are all based on the same design , layout , construction , materials etc .... one certificate can be produced for all but this has to be confirmed by the energy assessor that this will indeed be the case and things will not change between properties . <p> An EPC is only deemed valid if it 's details were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was made available and no other certificates have been issued since . It must also not contain any personally information pertaining to anyone involved e.g. the assessor , building owner etc .... <p> Recommendation Reports <p> This refers to the report that an assessor will issue to the building owner containing information and pointers on how the energy efficiency of the building can be improved . These improvement measures should be both practical , cost-effective and feasible and should not involve any extensive renovations for them to be put in place . <p> The recommendations should also include information on how the building owner can go about implementing these changes and also it should detail how the owner can access more details on improving the overall energy efficiency of the building . <p> As with pretty much all building regulation related information online the above information is intended to be used as a set of guidelines only . <p> When planning or researching a potential home improvement or construction project it is imperative that you are referring to the most relevant and up-to-date information and to these ends you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Planning Portal website on the links above . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

There is no shame is calling in a professional . <p> Here are a number of the things that you should consider when you are fault finding , but please remember this is only a guide and not an exhaustive list : <p> Clothing and Equipment : Make sure that you are dressed for the work that you are doing . Tie back long hair , remove jewellery and loose clothing which might get caught . Use protective clothing and other equipment . Dust sheets are very useful , but make sure that they are not a trip hazard <p> Water : Central heating water is almost always dirty . Use protective sheets on all capets and vulnerable surfaces which could be stained otherwise <p> Ladders and Roof spaces : Have a look at our project on ladder safety is you are unsure about using a ladder . You might find yourself in the roof space ; Make sure you have a torch and watch where you tread as no one wants to go through the ceiling . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave anything you could slip or tip on there <p> Hot water and scalding : You will likely be dealing with hot water or hot pipes so you need to be careful that you are not scalded . It may we worth allowing water to cool before you start work <p> Electricity and electric shocks : Some components in the central heating system will be supplied with mains electricity . Never work on a live circuit " turn off the supply before your start work . You must be competent and qualified to work with electricity and/or gas or oil heating boilers <p> Extinguish all sources of ignition - do n't use electric lights or any electric switches , such as bell pushes .

This should give you a good idea where to start looking if there are problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be checked to see that they are not causing problems or possibly the underlying problems has not been resolved . <p> These are the areas that you will need to check : <p> Boiler : Check the pilot light : In older boilers there will be a visible pilot light which will only be alight if there is a supply of gas and electricity . More modern boilers tend to have a pilot flame that is only visible when the boiler fires up , or is not visible at all . Check that there is a gas and electricity supply . Make sure that the flue is not blocked <p> Programmer or Clock : Make sure this is switched on and set correctly , with the right date and time . It will need an electricity supply . Check the batteries of a portable or remote ( RF " radio frequency ) programmer <p> Thermostat or programmer for controlling boiler , hot water and heating <p> Room Thermostat : This needs to be on and requesting heat , or the boiler will not start . The easiest way to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Circulating Pump : This needs power from the mains . You should be able to hear the pump or feel its vibration <p> Boiler pump from modern combi boiler <p> Motorised Valves : These require mains power also . Carefully move the manual leaver from " auto " ( Automatic ) to " man " ( Manual ) several times and set back to " auto " . See if there is any movement when the room or cylinder thermostats call for heat . You should be able to feel the heat from the pipes either side of the valve <p> TRV 's ( Thermostatic Radiator Valves ) : Check to see if the pipes either side of the radiator are warm . Turn the TRV to a higher setting and the radiator should warm up . If not you will have to remove the sensor head and check the valve . If the radiator gets too hot or does n't respond to the TRV the sensor might be faulty . see our video on TRV 's <p> Thermostatic radiator valve <p> Cylinder Thermostat : If the cylinder is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hot Water " on " on the programmer . This should call for heat from the boiler and it should start up . The thermostat should be set to 60- <p> Cylinder : If you can feel that there is hot water in the cylinder but it is not flowing or flowing slowly through the tap , this suggests that there is an airlock . If all the hot water taps are affected then it is likely to be an air lock in the cold feed to the cylinder or in the hot water pipes directly from the cylinder <h> Common Central Heating Faults and their Symptoms <p> These are some of the most commons problems that you are likely to find , their symptoms and an indication of the probably solution . <p> Symptom <p> Fault <p> Solution <p> No hot water , no heating <p> Boiler not working <p> Check gas and electricity mains <p> Faulty programmer <p> Check programmer <p> Faulty or seized pump <p> Repair or replace pump <p> No hot water but heating is working <p> Cylinder thermostat has a loose connection <p> Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Replace thermostat and test electrical circuits <p> Faulty programmer <p> Check programmer <p> Seized motorised valve <p> Repair or replace motorised valve <p> Faulty immersion heater <p> Check and replace immersion heater <p> Cylinder hot but no hot water at taps - Airlock <p> Remove airlock <p> Cylinder hot but no hot waterat taps - Cold water storage empty <p> Establish cause of no supply - Unfreeze pipes and insulate <p> Professional Tradesmen such as Heating Engineers , Plumbers , Gas Installers ( Boilers ) , when called to a breakdown will fault find in a logical and sequential fashion .

@@41624902 @1624902/ <p> Your choice of outdoor lighting will depend on what you wish to light , for example do you need light to illuminate a potential burglar , or do you need occasional lighting when going through dark areas , such as to go to a shed at the end of the garden ? You may only require mood lighting , where with the use of coloured bulbs you may wish to light up areas of the garden such as a patio or path - or indeed plants , trees or a pond . You may alternatively wish to use low voltage lighting including LED lights , which only use a fraction of the current necessary to illuminate a conventional bulb . <p> Other factors may include distance , a super bright 500W halogen flood light will shine a considerable distance . This type of halogen light is typically combined with a passive infra-red ( PIR ) switching sensor that when triggered will automatically switch on the unit on detection of motion . Some PIR sensors can be adjusted with day/night setting , angle of detection and a timer delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set amount of time , to avoid nuisance and also to conserve energy , as you do n't want it coming on every time a car goes past . <p> Example of good positioning of an exterior flood light for security at the front of a property <p> Exterior lights combining Dusk to Dawn Sensor is a variation to the PIR , which as the name suggests , operates from dusk until dawn These lights can be lanterns or bulkhead lights , where lighting is necessary for safety and security . Once installed , they require very little maintenance , save for changing the bulb when required . <p> It is important not only to select the right type of fitting to achieve the effect(s) required , but most importantly that your lighting will operate safely . All lights need to be positioned carefully so that you do not look directly at them . This can be very dangerous to the eyes . Consider exactly where you intend people to sit or stand and make sure that any glare can be avoided . Also those living in neighbouring properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . <p> Another form of exterior lighting is the welcome light to your front entrance door . The most popular is the four or six-sided lantern type combined with a PIR sensor , that uses a 60W ES screw bulb . These enable you to light up a step for safety reasons and security , as well an enabling you to find the correct front door key(s) . The power to this type of exterior light can often be supplied by the hall light , from the switch , through the wall to the back of the light fitting itself . Following the manufacturer 's instructions , a simple terminal block is provided with these fittings . With the 2 wire connection for the plastic casings and double insulated types and with the additional earth wire required where the unit is made from metal . See our project : Wiring an Exterior Wall Light and if in any doubt , consult a qualified electrician before proceeding . <p> All electrical work must conform to the current IEE Wiring Regulations : BS 7671 and Part P of the Building Regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Many fittings , bulbs and transformers can become very hot during use , so it is important to make sure they are not placed near any combustible surfaces and never use a more powerful bulb than the size recommended by the manufacturer and shown on the packaging or instructions for installation provided with the fitting . <p> Unless you have low voltage lighting where you can run cable to the light protected by plastic conduit , you should run cable of the steel wired armoured ( SWA ) type to exterior lights , with connecting glands . Please refer to our project on installing an outdoor socket for further details . However , the cable need only be the 1.0mm2 type , with an approximate exterior diameter of 11mm , 2 core , where the wires protecting the inner cable can be used as the earth connection . You should also consider utilising a residual current device ( RCD ) for additional safety . The RCD should be rated for 30mA . If not already part of your main consumer unit , the RCD could be placed next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying up through an adaptable box , where the SWA gland will allow connection to the RCD , as explained in the Exterior Socket Installation Project . <p> Depending on the power rating of the light , you could connect the exterior light to the lighting ring with a 5 amp fuse or 6 amp breaker ( MCB ) . For higher wattage flood lights , e.g. 500W halogen , it is probably best to connect the cable run to draw power from one of the ring main circuits , so as not to overload the lighting circuit(s) . Again , if in any doubt whatsoever , consult a qualified electrician before proceeding with the work . Please note that you may find it difficult to sell your home if it is discovered that you have the new coloured wiring i.e. blue/brown running from the consumer unit to an appliance or fitting and you do not have a certificate from a duly competent person or company authorised to issue such certificates . <p> Make sure that any fittings you select are suitable for outdoor use and have been tested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also have a CE mark . All exterior light fittings should have a minimum IP rating of 44 ( which means spray or rain proof ) or higher , depending on where they are to be sighted . <p> Bear in mind that all outdoor lighting fittings will require a degree of maintenance , so select the materials your fitting is made from with this in mind . For example if your property is near the sea and corrosion could occur , choose a marine grade stainless steel or plastic construction to avoid this possibility and always check the care instructions provided by the manufacturer and keep them for future reference . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

If this is the case then the party or adjoining wall will constantly be slightly damp . This best solution for this is to fit an Air Gap Membrane , as this will also allow the wall to breathe and also allow you to plaster or plasterboard over without the fear that any damp problems will return <h> Investigating your Damp Garage Floor <p> You need to know what you are dealing with before you start any conversion of your garage into dry storage or even a habitable living space . So , to be able to cover the floor with any type of flooring you need to : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then measure its height up from ground level <p> Check for damp and moisture use the test methods below <p> Checking your Garage Floor for Damp : <p> clear and brush an area of the garage floor so that it is totally free from any loose materials . Now cut a small square of plastic around 100mm x 100mm and , using plastic tape , tape it to the floor area on all four sides and leave it overnight . If there is moisture evident in the morning then this will confirm that the floor is damp . <h> Ways to Seal a Damp Concrete Floor <p> If the result sof the above test confirm the presence of damp then before you can lay any type of flooring you will need to seal the surface and also any floor to wall joints . <p> Currently , moisture is evaporating into the existing , well ventilated , uninhabited garage and this will generally cause no issues because it is removed through ventilation in the space . <p> However , when you turn it into a living space , the room will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can heat it effectively . <p> If you do not seal the surface of the floor , this moisture will be the cause of some serious issues when it condenses on cold surfaces causing mould to grow and due to this can also cause rot in timbers . <p> If you decide to lay a wood floor it will absorb this moisture , swell , lift and eventually also rot . <p> It is essential that the concrete floor is sealed and made damp proof . There are two main approaches to doing this : <p> Use a Vapour Barrier Membrane or Damp Proof Membrane <p> When damp proofing a concrete garage floor , a plastic dimpled membrane is required if the floor is going to be boarded ( either with chipboard , plywood or similar ) or if a concrete screed is going to be laid . <p> Opening this joint can be done with a disc cutter ( angle grinder ) and a stone blade . You should wear safety goggles and a face mask for this job as it is very dusty indeed . Keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having cut down 25mm or so into the floor , you will need a lump hammer and a 25mm cold chisel to bash out the concrete . <p> Smooth the bottom of the small " trench " with the chisel so there is as little variation in the depth along the length as possible . <p> Alternatively you can cut this joint out with a hammer and bolster chisel which is much harder work ! <h> How to Fit Floor Membrane on a Garage Floor <p> Once the joint has been sealed , the floor can be coated . Whichever coating you choose , it must be laid up the wall far enough to join with the existing DPC . <p> If you are using the Vapour Barrier Membrane , then this should be rolled out over the floor and turned up at the edged where the floor meets the walls . This should create a tray . <p> It is important that the up-turned edge of the membrane is high enough to rise above the chosen flooring . This will then protect the ends of the flooring from getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls of membrane meet and the corners , should be sealed with double sided tape . <p> The skirting will hide the turned up edges of the membrane , or the up-stands , as they are commonly referred to . The advantages of this system are . <p> This can be applied with a brush or a roller and the amount required will depend on the absorption of the concrete and the roughness of the floor surface . <p> Typically this will be between 2.5 and 7 Sq m per litre . There are advantages with this system , although it is typically a little more expensive . <p> It is very easy to apply using a brush and/or roller <p> It raises the floor level only a few mm . <h> Floor Coverings for Laying Over a Sealed Garage Floor <p> There are a number of floor coverings that you can lay over a sealed garage floor . <p> The choice of floor will have some impact of the method that you should use to seal the concrete floor . <p> Here are a number of the more common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A suspended timber floor : This will sit on joists , but they will need to be ventilated from below so that the timber does not rot . The ventilation should allow for a through draft of air at each end of the floor . One vent is not enough as it will simply let air in which will get warm and condense on any cold surface it hits . Adding another vent will create the necessary through draft which will allow the warmed air out . We recommend that any new timbers should be treated to prevent rot and woodworm . This is particularly important for any cut ends and parts that rest on or touch the walls . This should be laid over a membrane <p> A floating floor : For example this could be chipboard layed on to battens . This will also require adequate ventilation and treatment to avoid rot and pests This can also be layed over the affore mentioned membrane but also also a sealer such as ultra epoxy seal . <p> A screeded floor : If you choose a screed floor ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need a minimum of two inches ( 50mm ) of screeded concrete . You can lay this over either a membrane or even a sand blinded Ultra Epoxy Seal . Usually a garage floor is laid 100mm below the level of the house floor . This is a building regulations requirement . Raising the floor to the existing level of the house will allow you to insert some insulation which will help with the heating bills as a not inconsiderable amount of the heat from a house escapes through the floor . <p> A directly bonded floor using timber or tiles : You can lay this over chipboard , directly on a membrane or directly on to blinded epoxy seal . For this , you will need to use a product such as epoxy flooring adhesive . Using this method of flooring can only be 100% successful if the finished surface is completely flat and every single part of the chipboard ( or plywood ) sub-base is flat against the coated concrete floor . If there are any dips or bumps , the floor will move slightly when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may crack with the movement . When laying tiles or wood directly onto a floor of any kind a flexible adhesive should be used . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

@@41624908 @1624908/ <p> Summary : How to repair lead flashing . This project is about mending splits and tears in lead flashing and how to use lead flashing tape effectively . Also Understand why it is so important to repair your flashing . <h> Why Does Lead Flashing Need Repairing ? <p> The main reason for repairing lead flahing , splits and cracks in lead and failure in lead flashing is because of its high coefficient of linear expansion . What on earth does that mean I hear you cry ! Simple . Lead expands a huge amount in the heat , shrinks a lot in the cold , and wanders about a bit at all temperatures in between . <p> If this expansion and contraction are allowed to continue freely , the lead flashing will last for 100 years . Lead flashings however are usually fixed in position for one reason or another and it is this limitation to movement that causes splits and cracks . Lead should also have support for every square mm of its coverage . If the lead is not fully supported it will eventually sag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lead gutter ( not lead flashing ) this presents a good example of how lead can split when it sags . If the gutter is not supported correctly at regular intervals by supporting brackets then it will sag and weaken and then split . <p> Lead gutter full of sludge and debris <h> How To Repair Lead Flashing <p> When lead does split the correct way to repair it is to weld a piece of lead over the split . This is quite an advanced procedure which was always historically in the plumbers domain of jobs . Very few plumbers these days know how to weld lead and its very different to welding steel or ali . Welding lead uses a relatively cool flame and needs to be very precise . <p> Lead gutter full of sludge and debris <p> A DIY way to repair splits and cracks in lead and lead flashing is to use something we call Flash band ( trade name ) or sometimes it is also known as flashing tape . <h> Using Flashing Tape To Repair Lead Flashing <p> Flashing tape is comprised of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a tacky bitumen layer . It is self adhesive and can be used with a primer to help the adhesion but for lead repairs it works best when heated up . We must stress that this is not a permanent repair for lead as welding or replacement is the only permanent solution but in this , as in many other cases involving lead , it was cheaper for the customer to repair the lead every two years than it was to replace the lead gutters and flashing surrounding her property . <p> The gutter you can see above is lead lined . It looks a little orange in places because the wooden shingle roof had been sprayed a week before we arrived to repair the lead . <p> Firstly we traced the leak by looking for dripping below and then we cleaned out the gutter . It is important , both when welding lead or patching lead , that everything is spotlessly clean and degreased . We wiped the split , and either side of the split using paper towels to make sure we soaked up most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lead . <p> Cleaning the split lead thoroughly <p> Next , using a hot air gun we heated the area gently for about half an hour . This will warm the lead which in turn will warm the water under the lead which will evaporate out through the split . In all cases you must try to get all the water out from under the lead because , if it is left there and the split sealed , the water can go no where and it will eventually rot the timber it is sitting on . <p> Heat the area to evaporate any remaining trace of water <p> Tools and materials required for this job are minimal and all can be bought in our tool store . A roll of flashing tape is required , as is a heavy duty hobby knife . A good hot air gun is useful although a standard blowlamp can be used . For the novice DIY enthusiast we would suggest the hot air gun rather than the blowlamp as it is a lot less dangerous . Rags and perhaps a roll of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a good idea ! <p> Selection of tools required for lead repair <p> Once again , we must stress that this is only a temporary repair . If done properly it will last 2 or even 3 years but as the lead continues expanding and contracting with the varying temperatures in this country , it is inevitable that the patch will split also . The tape , of course , is fixed on both sides of the split so can not expand and contract well . This means that it may not move at the same time and over the same distance as the lead . <p> Cut a length of flashing tape ready . After heating the area and allowing the water to evaporate the lead should stay warm for a few minutes . This time should be spent warming the bitumen base on the flashing until it is warm and soft but not runny . <p> Heat the lead flashing <p> Quickly warm the lead again and lay the flashing tape over the split . Use a rag ( you should also be wearing gloves ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tape after a few seconds to keep the bitumen nice and warm . It sticks so much better this way . <p> Heating top of patch <p> Finally give a final press down onto the patch using a cloth . Start as you do with wall paper , from the centre , pushing towards the edges to get rid of any air trapped under the patch . <p> Press down using a rag or towel <p> Repairing lead flashing and splits and cracks in lead using this method should provide a good temporary fix and from start to finish , even with cleaning out the gutter , took 1-+ hours . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Find out the best tools for lifting vinyl and how to use them . <h> How do I Remove Lino or Tiles From my Floor ? <p> There is only one tool for this job and its below . Its hard work however you attempt it and despite many years of trying we have never found an " easy " way . <p> Floor scrapper <p> The tiles or lino should come up relatively easily using a floor scraper . To start , you might find it easier to remove just one tile and then you can get the floor scraper under the of the floor tiles to prise them up . <p> If you are dealing with lino sheet flooring , in order to get the scraper underneath to lever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can then access the rest with the scraper to get it off . Obviously if you want to keep the lino you are removing then cutting a section out may not be the best way to go . <p> When using the scraper , scrape a little at a time using a back and forward motion pushing the scraper blade further and further underneath the lino on the floor . <p> It is a good idea that once you are 6 - 8 inches under each section of lino to tear it off ( or cut it if it is quite tough ) . This way , most of the time you will be able to clearly see what you are doing and where you are scraping . <p> Continue with the above steps until you have removed all of the lino on the floor . <p> Although quite a boring and monotonous job , there are a few things that you should bear in mind : <p> Base Units and Appliances : In most cases you will be doing this job in a kitchen or bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the lino . The majority of these will feature a plinth that covers the front of the void at the base of the cabinet or base unit . Most allow you to easily remove this so that you can remove any lino that is under the item itself ( where appliances are involved you can simply remove it ) . Where the sides of the cabinet have been placed on top of the lino it may not be possible to remove the cabinet as it may be screwed to the wall or joined to other adjacent cabinets - obviously its best to move it and then remove the lino but if this is not possible you can use a Stanley or hobby knife to cut around the lino leaving only that under each side <p> When Using a Scraper : Be very careful at what angle you use the scraper at . Scrapers tend to be quite sharp and when you are using a fair amount of force to drive the scraper forwards , if your are pushing down rather than forwards and along you can very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are removing the lino to expose the nice boarded floor below it , to and it and varnish it as a feature of the room then any damage could destroy the finish <p> In most cases , once all the lino has gone , you will still be left with some nasty adhesive on the floor . To remove this is a similarly long and painful business and can either be done ( if the adhesive has gone rock hard ) with a hammer and bolster chisel ( the smaller pieces you attempt to break off , the better ) or by following the instructions below . <h> How Do I Remove the Lino or Tile Adhesive That is Left ? <p> Once the tiles or lino sheeting has been removed , the only method we have found which successfully removes most ( not all ) adhesives is to warm it gently with a hot air gun . <p> When the adhesive starts to go soft , it can be scraped off using a stripping knife . <p> When using a heat or hot air gun as they are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dwell too long in one spot as they pump out quite a bit of heat and this can damage the surface . <p> Hold the heat gun about 6 - 8 inches away from the surface and sweep it from side to side , gently heating the adhesive . <p> As when removing the lino itself , work on a small area at a time , around 8 inches square . Heat the area for a few minutes until the glue softens and then get stuck in with the scraper . <p> Due to the nature of glue , it 's sticky stuff so after you have scraped an area clear , wipe the residue off the scraper with an old damp cloth , keep the scraper as clean as possible . <p> Once the whole area has been cleared , you will still have a small residue or film of the adhesive left on the surface and this can usually be removed by rubbing very hard with a cloth , or green scouring pad , dipped in solvent thinners . <p> Hot air gun <p> Stripping knife <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safety specs may not be a bad idea as solvent can splash . Solvent thinners can be bought from your local DIY store . <p> If the adhesive is particularly well stuck you can lay ceramic or quarry tiles over the top of it . If you choose to do this then a good coat of undiluted PVA adhesive is a very good idea . See our project on using PVA adhesive for more information . Laminate flooring , or timber flooring can also be laid straight over the floor as long as the floor is not uneven and a good quality underlay is used . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

A DIY guide to planning and fitting coving including cutting coving mitre joints for internal and external corners , and fixing coving using specialist adhesive . Find out about all the different types of coving and the different materials they are constructed from such as duropolymer , polyurethane and plaster , how each different type is cut and fixed in place and where to buy good quality coving and other architectural mouldings . <h> The Different Types of Coving <p> Coving comes in many different styles but there are also different types of coving material : Plaster , polystyrene and duropolymer coving . <p> The most traditional is plaster coving , and the first part of this project deals with putting up plaster coving and is also suitable for installing coving made of polyurethane also called duropolymer coving such like the ones made by ORAC which we explore in more detail below . Scroll further down this project to find a step-by-step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method can be used to fit polystyrene coving , which is the cheapest coving , although not as durable or as versatile . <p> The most common sizes of coving are 125 mm and 85 mm . The sizing can be confusing because the size of coving is stated as the imaginary line across the coving , rather than the physical height or projection think of it as the hypotenuse of a triangle , with the wall and ceiling forming the other two sides . See the image below under the " Differences Between Coving and Cornice " section to illustrate what we mean . <h> Comparing Plaster Coving to Orac Polyurethane Coving <p> Orac Decor <p> Plaster Mouldings <p> Weight <p> Lightweight <p> Very Heavy <p> Strength <p> Non fragile/Clean cuts <p> Very fragile/easily broken and chipped <p> Installation <p> Simple , quick and easy <p> Complicated , dirty and messy , time-consuming <p> Labour Costs/Skills <p> Minimum of labour ( one person ) <p> Skilled labour necessary , 1-2 people <p> Painting <p> Only 1 application <p> 2-3 coats necessary <p> Repairs <p> Needs no repair work <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Orac Polyurethane Coving <p> The following step-by-step guide Cutting Coving with a Mitre Saw features pictures provided by ORAC who make a range of decorative mouldings and finishing products in a lightweight flexible and durable polyurethane material . <p> Their collection comprises a vast array of decorative features which offer numerous advantages over traditional plaster based products . The revolutionary nature of the material and the modern moulding process enables a sharper level of detail to be incorporated in the designs , making it perfect for the home , especially where distinction and elegance is the theme . <p> Weighing just a fraction of the weight of plaster , polyurethane coving it is remarkably strong and resilient to knocks or damage on site , or during installation . Consequently these ornaments are quick and easy to install , ( typically in around half the time compared to plaster , without the need for a second person ) and with none of the difficulties , mess or wastage : Saving the installer time and money . <p> Additionally there are none of the usual concerns about cracking or shrinkage normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building as it moves with the seasons , and will enhance the look of your home for many years to come without need for repair . <p> Orac products have been introduced to the UK from Belgium ( where it has been successfully made and supplied to more than 50 countries worldwide during the last 25 years ) , by a number of British stockists , including Davuka . <p> They also sell a range called Axxent which is an extruded impact resistant and water resistant , high-density polymer resin called Duropolymer . You can find out more about this by watching the video here . <p> We like working with these products because they are easier for the DIYer to get a good result . They are also much easier to cut , and to handle with just one person . " I cant believe how quick and easy it was to install , and how fantastic it looks " is the typical reaction from people installing the ORAC Decor and Axxent range of products for the first time . <p> These products are cut and fitted in exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornicing products . <p> The Orac DTcor range is pre-primed , ready to paint or stain to the desired finished effect , with only a single coat of paint required . All of the coving and panel styles are also available as a flexible that enables mounting to curved walls and bays or for circular patterns to be created - see the images below for examples . <p> Tradesmen and DIYers alike are realising that without doubt this is a much better material to work with . In fact it is becoming the new " traditional " product material to replace plaster mouldings . <h> The Difference Between Coving and Cornice <p> There is some confusion about the difference between cornice and coving . They are both decorative mouldings but the words are not different ways of saying the same thing . Coving is designed to fit into the corners of a room , usually in the corner between the top of the wall and the edge of the ceiling . <p> Coving usually has a uniform profile , with similar moulding on the top and bottom lengths , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Therefore if it projects across the ceiling by 10 cm then it would drop down the wall by 10 cm too . ) Coving is also usually fairly simple in design , although not always . <p> A side profile of a section of coving <p> Cornice is a decorative architectural moulding used to add visual interest to a room , or a feature in a room . Cornicing can be added to cupboards , or used instead of , or in addition to , coving to make a decorative room border . There are even cornices which are designed to hold uplighters so that you can wash light across a wall and ceiling , giving a softened indirect light , which is great for mood lighting . <h> Cornice and Coving Profiles <p> A profile is the design of the coving and cornicing . In the same way as a persons face has a profile so do these decorative mouldings . Looking at them from the side you can see the profile , which could be a simple curve or an ornate series of curves and patterns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dart , Dentil , Cove , Rope and Twisted Rope . You will also find those designs on Cornice profiles , as well as Swag and Bow , Acanthus Leaf , Swan Neck and Flemish Scroll among others . <p> We also use the term " profile " for skirting boards , the most common skirting board profiles being Torus , Bullnose , Lambs Tongue and Blenheim . <h> Tools for Putting up Coving <p> The following list of tools are really all essential to ensure that your job goes smoothly and the finished article is top notch : <p> A Hand Saw - Choose a fine or medium toothed saw with a stiff blade to ensure a straight cut <p> Mitre box ( also called a mitre block ) or you can use a mitre saw or a coving mitre template as a cutting guide such as a Wonder Mitre ( see below ) <p> Adhesives - You can use any coving adhesive , either ready-mixed or powder adhesive which you mix yourself . You can also use a silicon based adhesive and sealant gun <p> Pencil <p> Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammer and panel pins to support the coving while the adhesive sets <p> Sponge or cloth and water for cleaning up excess adhesive <p> Filling knife <p> Trimming knife also known as a utility knife or generically as a Stanley knife <p> Paintbrush for blending sealant into joints <h> How to Mitre Cut Coving <p> If you would like additional information on fitting coving in the form of a Word Document you can print , click here . <p> Additionally , if you scroll down the page a bit there are further images and diagrams walking through the process of cutting coving . <p> TIP : Cutting coving is a skill that requires practice , so the very first rule about coving for the novice is : Please buy an extra length to practice on ! <p> Mitre joints are formed in the corner of rooms or where the coving is going to finish part-way along a wall , and the end needs to be finished off with a piece of coving that returns towards the wall to give a neat finish ( see image below ) . <p> External @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitre joints are formed around protrusions into a room , such as chimney breasts . Internal mitre joints are formed in the corners of the room ( see below ) . <p> Fitting an Internal Mitre Joint There is an external mitre joint visible on the chimney breast on the right <p> When measuring coving for a cut , make sure you measure along the edge that will be placed against the wall . <p> TIP : To help you keep track of which is the wall edge scribble along that edge in pencil or write the word wall at various intervals along that edge on the back of the coving . <p> When cutting the coving place the length of coving upside down in the mitre box , in other words with the wall edge pointing up . See the images below for an illustration . <p> Illustration of cutting external left and right corners <p> Illustration of cutting internal left and right corners <p> As you can see , from the images above , this means that when you take the coving out of the mitre box you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . <p> Angles are peculiar things , and we know it can be tricky to get it right . We get hundreds of questions on our forum about how to cut coving . One tip we can give you is that cutting coving is made considerably easier by using the right tools and taking your time to measure carefully : Then measure again . <p> If you do this carefully you will be amazed at how easy it is to add a beautiful feature to the room . <h> Cutting Coving Using a Mitre Box or Mitre Block <p> The first thing you will need is an accurate cutting guide . The traditional way of cutting an angle for a corner is to use a coving mitre block , also known as a mitre box . These are made especially for coving and will come in a variety of sizes . <p> Some mitre boxes have an adjustable gauge to secure the material while it is being cut . We use a 125mm box which will accommodate the largest standard size of coving , and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> TIP : Make sure you secure the coving in the mitre box . The material needs to be held tightly in place to get a good professional finish . <p> If your coving does not fit snugly into your mitre box , you run the risk of it moving when you saw . Even a small movement can throw the mitre join out and make it very difficult to get a neat job . <p> As you can see , mitre boxes come with a straight , or butt joint slot for the saw , and two 45 degree slots for making internal and external corners . The slots have numbers on them as you can see . This is to avoid confusion when cutting , and believe me it is easy to get confused ! <p> More about how to use this numbering to make the joints you need in the " How To Plan Your Room for Coving " guide below . <h> Finding Angles in Your Room <p> Putting up coving in a square room is a relatively easy job . Where you have chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut more mitre joints . <p> If you are lucky , your rooms will be square , or nearly square . Unfortunately many rooms do not have walls at 90 to each other when you check the angles , and some areas might be far from square . When cutting coving odd angles will affect the mitre joints you need to cut for the corners . <p> For rooms that have odd shaped corners you can buy an " angle finder " like the one below also available from good DIY stores and builders merchants . <p> Angle finder to help you cut mitres for odd-shaped corners <p> Place the angle finder in the corner of the room and find its angle by pushing it into the corner , with the arms against the walls . Read the angle from the indicator . <p> Divide that angle by two and mark this on the mitre box . Cut a groove at that angle into the mitre box working gently with the saw and you will have the template for making this corner neat as well . <p> Use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but where you are using coving with an asymmetrical coving just turn the material over when you make the second cut ; i.e. you will have the top edge facing towards you on one mitre cut and the bottom edge facing towards you on the other . <p> Fitting coving is not difficult . It is a question of taking your time and getting things set out as you would like them . Be prepared to sacrifice a length of coving as a practice piece to understand how the tools work , and use it to get the mitres right . It will save you money in the long run . <h> How to Plan your Room for Coving <p> The mitre box is numbered in the way that if you are facing any wall , the right hand mitre is number 1 if it is an internal angle or number 3 if it is to an external angle and the left hand mitre is number 2 or 4 respectively . <p> Do not be put off by any of this . Use your practice piece and all will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these pictures below : <p> Number the walls according to the numbers on the mitre block <p> You need to make sure that you carefully plan the cuts you need , to avoid spoiling and wasting material . <h> Measuring Up and Marking Out <p> Measure each section of the wall and write it onto your room plan , you can also write it directly onto the wall . <p> Take a small " template " piece of coving and place it flush against the wall and ceiling , mark the wall and ceiling along the top and bottom edge of the template at various intervals around the room ( about a metre apart , depending on the length of your spirit level ) . <p> Make sure that the piece of coving is sitting in the correct position in relation to the walls and ceiling . That is making sure the coving is equally spaced between the the wall and ceiling , with the edges sitting flush on the wall and the ceiling , not skewed or angled . <p> Measuring for Coving and Marking Walls for Coving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall and ceiling using a spirit level to make sure your line is level and straight . Alternatively you could use a chalk line held between two panel pins at either end of the wall ) . These lines are what you will work to when it comes to sticking coving later . <p> You may want to offer up a full length of coving , to make sure it looks right by eye too . This is particularly important where you know that your walls and ceiling have odd angles , are not straight , or not at right-angles to each other . Do n't try to fit the coving to any imperfections , just make sure it is sitting straight . You can always fill gaps between the coving and the wall or ceiling later . <p> Make sure you remove any flaking paint or plaster and any wallpaper from the wall and ceiling between the lines . <p> Use a Multi sensor and mark the position of any pipes or cables in pencil below the line you have drawn on the wall . <p> TIP : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilute PVA onto the wall using a brush and allow to dry before you try to stick your coving up . This prevents the dry plaster sucking the moisture out of the adhesive to quickly , and gives you time to work with the adhesive before it goes off . <p> TIP : If you are working onto a painted surface , use a Stanley knife to score the area nearest your pencil marks to provide a key for the adhesive to grip to . <p> Start with the longest section first . Check the width of the wall you wish to start on . <p> TIP : It is always a good idea to work into all the internal sections first otherwise you may find yourself " boxed in " . <p> Mark the measurement you have taken from the wall onto the wall edge of the first length of coving . <h> Cutting the Coving <p> TIP : It is always best to start with the longest lengths first to avoid waste . <p> If you have a wall that is longer than a length of coving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight joint ) or , to make a neater finish and a stronger joint , you can use a mitre join at a 45 angle using the mitre block as a guide . ( You will need to cut one internal mitre and one external mitre to join two lengths together in a straight line . ) <p> A butt joint is formed by making a straight cut <p> TIP : Choose a fine-toothed saw to cut smoothly through the plaster and avoid making the backing paper ragged as you cut . <p> Let 's start with the back wall in our illustration and work around clockwise . <p> Start with an internal left hand mitre : The coving will fit into the mitre box from right to left , with the wall edge facing up so the material you are using is the left hand piece of coving and the waste material is on the right . <p> Make the first cut in the groove marked 2 on your block . This will fit into the left hand corner of your wall . <p> Mark the length you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure along the wall edge of the coving ) . Slide the coving through the mitre box from right to left . Make your second cut in the slot marked 1 on your mitre block . This will fit into the right hand corner of your room . <p> Offer up the length you have just cut to make sure the coving will fit . Make any adjustments you need to then sand the ends with fine sandpaper for a neat finish . <p> Now for the left hand internal mitre to fit into the right hand corner of our illustrated room . Check the measurement of the wall , mark the length you need onto the coving , slide it into the box from right to left and cut one mitre using the groove marked 3 on the box to create the left half of the external corner . <p> The next joint in this example is a right hand external mitre on the chimney breast so you need to cut the piece to length using the groove marked 4 on the box . <p> Secure the Coving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sliding metal pins that are holding the coving in place <p> Once each piece is cut , put it in place without any adhesive at first to check it will fit and the joint is correct . Adjust each cut if necessary then sand down the end for a smooth finish . <p> Continue to work your way around the room in this way until all the coving is cut . <p> You can stick each piece of coving in place as you go if you prefer . <p> See Fixing Coving Using Adhesive below after we look at a couple of alternatives for cutting coving . <h> Using a " Wonder Mitre " to Cut Coving <p> If you do n't want to use a mitre block to cut coving , then you could try a coving mitre tool called a Wonder Mitre which is a simple guide that sits on the inside of the cove and has shaped notches that grip the plaster , holding it securely while you cut . It is suitable for all sizes of coving up to 125mm . <p> The manufacturers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the coving it will give you a good accurate angle cut for your corner , and providing your walls are square you will find it creates a neat job with little finishing required . They are available in a metal trade model , and a DIY plastic version . <h> Cutting Coving with a Mitre Saw <p> A coving mitre saw works in a similar way to a mitre block , but after the coving is secured in place the blade guide is adjusted to the correct position for sawing an accurate cut at the correct angle . <p> The back guide of the mitre saw is marked wall and has stops to rest the edge of the coving against . The base of the saw is marked with the standard sizes of coving , so you can easily position the length of coving correctly into the mitre saw . <p> Cutting coving using a mitre saw <h> Fixing Coving Using Adhesive <p> Mix up the adhesive to a thick paste , following the guidelines on the packet , or use a ready mixed coving adhesive . <p> Alternatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealant gun to apply adhesive . <p> Whichever method you use to apply adhesive , there is no need to add adhesive to the centre of the back of the cove this does not make contact with the wall or ceiling , so you would just be wasting it . <p> TIP : Do n't be frightened of putting on too much adhesive , you will be able to scrape it off easily using the filling knife and a wet cloth or sponge to clean the wall . You want it to just be squeezing out from the edges as you press the coving into position . <p> Line up the coving with the lines you marked on the wall and ceiling . Make sure the left end is just a couple of mm from the left hand wall . <p> Press firmly into place along the whole length of the coving . <p> For the second and subsequent pieces of coving you will also need to apply adhesive to the mitre joint you are forming . <p> Scrape off any excess adhesive from the walls and ceilings , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you are concerned that a long length of coving will not stay up on the strength of the adhesive alone , tack in some small nails or panel pins underneath it to support it in place until the adhesive is hard . The nail holes can be filled later . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624911 @1624911/ <h> Building Regulations Approved Document M - Access to and use of Buildings and Domestic Dwellings Including Access and use of Sanitary Conveniences <p> Summary : This handy guide looks at Approved Document M of the UK Building Regulations which concentrates on access and using both public structures and buildings and also private domestic dwellings . The document itself has been produced to ensure that any and all users and visitors can easily approach a building and then access it . It also sets out guidelines for accessing extensions when they have been added to an existing structure . Also covered in the document are requirements for sanitary conveniences and WC 's including where they should be situated and what dimensions they should be . The core of the document is geared around providing access for disabled users including ambulant users and wheelchair users and what facilities should be featured and also minimum dimensions for room spaces , doorways and access ways . <p> This document in the building regulations series , similar to Approved Document K , is concerned with access to and around buildings . Unlike document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyone , able-bodied , non-able-bodied , old , young etc .... can easily access a building and make use of the facilities within it , whether it is a dwelling or a place of work . <p> The basis of the document is to ensure that , for example , a person in a wheel chair can arrive at the building by car ( either parking on the plot or outside it ) , easily exit the car and then access the building , in most cases , using a ramp that has been constructed within a certain pitch or elevation to ensure that they can travel up it with ease . <h> Accessing and Using a Building and its Facilities <p> The first section of the document deals with ensuring that anyone can get into a building and that essential facilities are available to them if needed . The following sections look at extensions and non-dwelling buildings and the supply of bathrooms and sanitary conveniences . The guidelines are broken into four sections as follows : <p> M1 : It should be ensured that access to the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M2 : When an extension is added to a non-dwelling building you should ensure that independent access is available <p> M3 : Where a toilet or sanitary conveniences are to be provided in an extension to a non-dwelling property it should be ensured that they are accessible and can be used <p> M4 : This point deals with toilets and bathrooms or sanitary conveniences and states that sanitary conveniences should be provided within the entrance storey ( the area that contains the main entrance ) where habitable rooms are present or the principal storey if no habitable rooms are available in the entrance storey . The principal storey is the area nearest the entrance storey with a habitable room <p> The above guidelines will apply in pretty much all cases but there are a few exceptions where they do not apply : <p> An alteration or extension to a dwelling <p> Any maintenance areas for inspecting the building itself or any fittings <p> It should also be noted that M2 does not apply when access to the extended area of the building can be accessed through the existing section and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of the building that can be easily accessed . <h> Accessing Buildings from Driveways and Parking <p> This is pretty much the starting point for anyone entering a building whether it 's a dwelling or other and in most cases a person will start their journey into the property from either the kerb-side ( property boundary ) or from a parking space on the plot itself . <p> With this in mind it has to be ensured that anyone can get from their landing destination to the property easily . We will firstly deal with parking spaces on the property . <p> Whether a person parks on the property or passes across the parking area it must be ensured that they can do so , so access has to be available at all times and enough space should be allowed to exit a parked car ( disabled parking bay if applicable ) and pass any cars that are parked . <p> Allow appropriate space for passing parked vehicles <p> One of the most critical points to note is the surface material that a person will be travelling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smooth and firm e.g. smooth concrete or bitumen/asphalt . <p> The use of loose gravel , shingles , small stones or cobbles would most certainly not be suitable in this situation as they pose a considerable tripping hazard . <h> Approaching and Entering a Building <p> When we are referring to this stage in the journey we are looking at the point at which a visitor exits their vehicle ( either at the kerb side or from a parking space within the boundary ) and then makes their way to the main entrance to the building . <p> It is stated that this journey should take place via one of the following approaches : <p> Level Approach <p> This is , in most cases , always the preferred type of access and it should be as level as possible . Where an incline is unavoidable , it should be 1:20 ( one in twenty ) or shallower . <p> In respect to an example , an even and level approach to the main entrance of a building can be obtained over a three metre run where floor levels differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of approach follows on where the above leaves off in that the gradient approach to a buildings main entrance exceeds 1:20 but does not exceed 1:15 . <p> Where possible , the ramp should run directly to the main entrance in a straight line but if this is not possible then , subject to planning permission and agreement from building control , it can run parallel along the outside of a structures external wall . <p> Ramps can be a good compromise where level access can be provided but in some situations a user may have trouble dealing with ramps more so than they do with a flight of stairs or other access type . <p> Due to this there are certain constraints that must be adhered to , to ensure that a user can traverse the ramp , have the opportunity to stop and rest , have something to steady themselves and prevent falling , can realistically travel along it etc .... These considerations should be discussed with and between your architect and your local building control office . <p> Stepped Approach <p> In the situation where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps can be used to take the place of a ramp . <p> When this is the case , any steps should be designed with the following in mind : <p> Clear width of at least 900mm with no obstructions <p> Any flights between landings should be no greater than 1.8m <p> Landing areas at the top , middle ( intermediate ) and bottom of flights should be at least 900mm in length . NOTE : The bottom landing can form part of a public footpath <p> All steps should feature suitable profiles to tread nosing 's and rises between each steps should all be uniform and between 75mm and 150mm <p> The going of any steps should be no less than 280mm . For any tapered treads , this should be measured at a point 270mm from the inside of the tread <p> Where any flight of steps is over three continuous risers there should be a handrail at one side . The handrail itself should be grippable and be situated between 850 and 1000mm above the steps . It should also extend 300mm beyond the top and bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is also another type - accessing straight from a public highway or pavement . In this case you firstly have to ensure that the floor level of the structure is no more than 150mm above the level of the footpath or public highway and even in this case it is certain that any gradients up to the entrance will be greater than 1:15 . <p> Where this is true the preferable solution is to provide suitable access to a side or rear door entrance whereby the user can then access the building . <p> If the above is not possible to achieve then a step can be used but you have to ensure that it is no more than 150mm high and that it is sited right at the door sill . In this instance you will also have to provide suitable access to the step . <p> When the main entrance is accessed via a ramp , you should ensure that a suitable threshold is supplied that allows the user to access the building easily and safely . <p> When dealing with doors you must also make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access the building and also have enough room to maneuver . <h> Moving Around Inside a Dwelling and Accessing Fixtures and Fittings <p> As providing access to a building is of top priority as it has to be ensured that anyone can get to the main entrance , once a person has entered it , their ability to move around inside falls under exactly the same rules . <p> All corridors and passageways should be wide enough to allow a wheelchair user to easily move around the interior and any obstructions that may be present such as radiators , fire extinguishers , seating etc .... should be sufficiently spaced to allow easy movement . <p> In terms of widths where obstructions are present and where doors to habitable rooms or toilets exist , the following table should be consulted ( Below information conforms to Table 4 , Approved Document M ) : <p> Width of Doorway in mm <p> Width of Passageway in mm <p> Minimum 750mm <p> 900mm when approached head-on <p> 750mm <p> 1200mm when approached head-on <p> 775mm <p> 1050 When approached head-on <p> 800mm <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Property <p> Where stairs are unavoidable in the entrance to a property , it must be ensured that they meet the following requirements : <p> All flights should be a minimum of 900mm in width <p> There is a solid handrail that carries over the entire run of flight and also any landings in between flights . Handrails should be on both sides ! <p> Any rises and goings are constructed inline with the guidelines stated in Approved Document K <p> When it comes to blocks of flats , the obvious choice here is to have a lift to transport people between floors . This is not always possible and in this situation , common stairs are the norm . When designing stairs of this nature , you should design them in a manner to suit ambulant disabled people and those with impaired vision . <p> Where a lift is present in the building for access to upper floors , it should be constructed in a manner that allows an individual wheelchair user ( not accompanied by anyone else ) to use it easily and safely . This also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point here is ensuring that lift doors give sufficient time for a user to enter before closing . <p> In respect to lifts , requirements for part M1 will be met if : <p> Any landing area in front of the lift should be at least 1500mm wide and long <p> Door openings are at least 800mm wide <p> The lift car area itself needs to be at least 900mm wide and 1250mm long <p> All controls are between 900 and 1200mm above floor level and a minimum of 400mm away from the door <p> Floor level indicators should be adjacent to lift buttons that signify the selected floor <p> A signaling system is present that provides visual indication that the lift has been called to a given floor and the doors do not start to close before five seconds has been given to allow users to enter <p> The lift is providing access to more than three floors , audible and visible indication should be present to indicate what floor the lift has reached <p> In light of this , any stairs present in a structure containing flats will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps are highlighted through contrasting brightness <p> Both landings , top and bottom , should be constructed in accordance to the guidelines in K1 <p> All steps should be uniform in terms of nosing profiles and also rise ( should not be more than 170mm ) <p> The going of each step should be uniform and no less than 250mm . Where tapered treads are used , the tread needs to be measured from a point 270mm from the inside of the tread <p> Switches and Sockets Inside Dwellings <p> Light switches and sockets are essential within any property as most amenities today require some sort of power e.g. laptop computers , mobile phones , TV , lighting etc .... With this in mind it should be ensured that any switch or socket can be reached easily by anyone . <p> In respect to this , all switches and sockets should be located between 450 and 1200mm from floor level . <h> Sanitary and WC Provision within the Entrance Area <p> When it comes to supplying WC 's and sanitary conveniences - the regs state that a WC should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy access from any habitable rooms , without the need to use stairs to reach it . <p> If there are no habitable rooms within the entrance area of the dwelling then it is suitable for the WC to be situated in the entrance storey or principle storey . <p> Additionally , if there is a bathroom located within the entrance area or storey then the regs state that it is fine for the WC to be located here . <p> When it comes to the WC itself , you will have yo make sure that it conforms to the following points : <p> The WC door will need to open outwards <p> It should be positioned so that a wheelchair user can easily access the WC <p> The width of the door itself will need to conform with Table 4 mentioned above as this will enable wheelchair users to access the area and allow movement <p> The space within the WC area allows wheelchair users cler access and movement space and any sinks located within the area do not cause an obstruction <p> When it comes to anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when referencing any points outlined within the regs that you are indeed referring to the correct information .

@@41624912 @1624912/ <h> DIY Advice on Fitting a Pressure Reducing Valve or PRV to Reduce Water Pressure in the Home <p> Summary : If you need to reduce water pressure in your house you can fit a water pressure reducing valve or PRV using our DIY guide . Reducing mains pressure can reduce wastage and save you money . If you have high cold water pressure you may need to use a PRV when installing a mixer shower so it can mix water effectively . Find out how to locate a suitable pipe to fit your PRV to , how to cut the pipe to insert the PRV , how to fit compression olives and then how tighten compression nuts . <h> What is a PRV and How Does it Work ? <p> Another question we get asked all of the time at DIY Doctor . In its simplest terms a pressure reducing valve , or PRV , allows water to flow into it and , controlled by a spring loaded internal diaphragm , reduces the pressure to one pre-set by the owner . <p> The mains pressure coming into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this water is to be mixed with water from a hot water tank which only has a pressure of 0.2 bars then the chances of any of the hot water being felt is minimal . <p> Installing a mixer shower or mixer tap under these circumstances is a waste of time and so in this instance a PRV is ideal to regulate and reduce the incoming mains pressure . <p> Pressure reducing valve with water pressure gauge <p> Most PRV 's come preset to 3 bars but this can be altered to suit the pressure you need to get down to . <p> It is important that the direction of water flow is followed with the valve and this is usually marked with an arrow on the valve itself . <p> Nowadays the spring loaded diaphragm operates a ceramic disc which is raised or lowered according to the pressure required . PRV 's can also be used on all sizes of pipe . <p> A PRV is inserted into the pipe and the fittings tightened to both keep it in place and stop it leaking . Some pressure reducing valves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter and a water pressure gauge ( as can be seen in the image above ) . <p> A water pressure gauge is a very good idea to have as it will allow you to accurately measure the exact pressure that is going through the valve and also adjust the pressure if required . <p> Find a suitable length of pipe to cut into . Make sure that the length you choose is easily accessible and is a feed supply to the item or appliance you need to reduce the pressure to . Additionally , please make sure you have turned the water off and drained down first . <p> Cutting Pipework for a PRV <p> We have shown two methods of cutting into the pipe in the image below . The first pipe cutter on the left is a wheeled pipe cutter and the one on the right is commonly called a pipe slice . <p> Both of these , although slightly more expensive than a hack saw are far more advanced , quicker , neater and easier to use . There are no burrs left on the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used immediately without having to file down the end of the pipe . <p> The image below that shows the pipe with the section cut out . As you will see from the projects mentioned above , the distance between the cuts depends on the item being inserted but . <p> With compression fittings , unless they are slip couplings , there is always a lip which the inserted , cut pipe sits up against . Measuring between these lips gives you the size of the section you need to cut out of the pipe . <p> Cutting a copper pipe using a small pipe cutter and pipe slice <p> Pipe section cut out and olives added <p> Add Compression Nuts and Olives <p> Apologies for the quality of the first image below but it does give the idea ! When the pipe is cut , remove the compression nuts from either side of the PRV . Slide them onto the pipe and then slide the olives on . <p> An olive is a circular brass fitting thicker in the centre of its width than at the edges . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of the nut and the fitting itself . This makes the joint watertight . The second image below shows how the olive fits into the inlet and outlet on the PRV valve itself . <p> Pressure reducing valve ready to be inserted into pipe <p> Olives added to copper pipe and compression nuts ready to be tightened <p> Tighten Compression Nuts <p> Double check the direction of flow arrow on the PRV is pointing in the direction that the water will be flowing and tighten everything up . You can grip the body of the valve with some mole grips or pipe grips as you tighten the compression nut to avoid twisting or bending anything . <p> Set Your Required Pressure <p> You can now set the pressure to that required and enjoy your shower . Pressure reducing valves can be inserted after the house stop cock to reduce the water pressure throughout the home if it is too great . Reducing water pressure can actually reduce wastage and therefore save you money . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

In this handy guide we run you through all you need to know in order to convert a room into a walk in shower room including how to correctly prepare the room , how to lay a walk in shower tray on both concrete and timber floors and then how to tank and tile your wet room so that it stays waterproof . <h> Wet Rooms on the Ground Floor <p> For years wetrooms and shower rooms were limited to ground floors and had to be sited on a concrete , or at least screeded , base . <p> With new technologies , particularly around ways to manage the expansion and contraction of all materials used in modern house construction , it is possible to put a wetroom anywhere in the home , including the loft and providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a wooden floor in the room you wish to use . <h> Preparation for Wet Rooms <p> The first thing to understand about a conventional wet room is that it will only ever be as waterproof as the surface used to line it . This surface , be it porcelain tiles , ceramic tiles , tile backer boards , liquid rubber membranes or some other kind of latex or vinyl waterproof covering , will not remain waterproof if the surface it is stuck ( or otherwise fixed ) to is not completely sound . <p> The first step therefore , when creating a wet room or shower room is to make sure that the floor is not loose in any way and the walls are a ) not loose and prone to excessive movement and b ) have not got a flaky surface . Surfaces must also be entirely free from dust , debris and grease . <h> Different Ways to Construct a Wetroom <p> Although all of the possible ways to complete your project we mention on this page are great ways of achieving your dream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation . <p> The tiles themselves , if laid properly , will give you a waterproof surface . However ; when constructing a wetroom the tiles ( although they should still be laid properly ) are more for form than function . There is simply too much water in a wet room to depend on the tile grout proving a completely waterproof area for very long . <p> To construct a great wet room or shower room the floor is the most vulnerable area . <p> Gravity will ensure that all water heads downwards and if your wet room floor has not been properly prepared and treated , you may have problems . <p> Take a look at the diagram below and the text afterwards will explain how this type of wet room can be achieved with both a concrete floor and a timber floor . <p> How to tank the walls and floor of a wetroom or shower room <h> Wetroom Formed on a Concrete Floor <p> The hardest thing about forming a wetroom floor when working on a concrete base such as a ground floor slab , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Usually this is achieved by using a concrete breaker to dig a channel through the floor , with a large hole at the point where the waste outlet will sit . <p> Using a concrete breaker to dig a drainage channel in a concrete floor <p> The channel needs to go directly towards an outside wall to avoid digging up any other floors in other rooms . Once outside the building the drain can be laid to an existing manhole . <p> The top of the new drain should be laid flush with the finished level of the concrete floor so any tanking can overlap the drain ensuring the water runs straight into the drain and can not seep between the edge of the floor and the upstanding drain pipe . <p> The pipe should also be trapped in the normal way to avoid foul gas running back into the wetroom . In a concrete floor it is usual to see a horizontal waste traps as shown in the image below <p> Fitting a wet room floor grid , grill or floor plate <p> Leading down , directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . This sits on top of the tanking and directs the water into the trap while holding hairs and other debris for cleaning . Should any water seep under the grid , it will of course go directly into the trap . <p> The pipe should also be trapped in the normal way to avoid foul gas running back into the wetroom . <p> In a concrete floor it is usual to see a horizontal waste traps as shown in the image below . <p> The channel housing the drain is then concreted over and a fall is constructed into the floor by using a self levelling floor compound , thickened slightly with sharp sand . <p> There is no need for a steep slope to the floor . Water will find its way to the lowest level at any angle of fall . A fall of 10mm over 2m is plenty . <p> Some wet room installers use a thicker bed of adhesive under the floor tiles to create the fall on the floor . We do not suggest that is a good idea as it means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement or adhesive compound which varies in thickness stands a good chance of cracking at the thinnest point . This could lead to movement in the floor which can not end well ! <p> The floor plate ( see above ) is positioned so the pipe goes down into the trap . The tanking is applied over the plate as are the tiles . A grid ( or sometimes a channel ) is then fitted into the top of the floor plate . <p> How to put a wetroom shower tray into a timber or wooden floor <p> To put a wetroom into a room with a timber floor , it is first necessary to take up the existing floorboards . The lowest point of the floor needs to be chosen and then the joists around that low point need to be raised a little ( the same amount of fall as with the concrete floor applies ) using strips of timber caled firring pieces . If you measure these timbers , your local joinery shop will cut them for you . <p> Making sure the joists are absolutely solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-between the joists if necessary ) the plywood ( minimum 25mm thickness is recommended here ) must be screwed down to the joists and noggins at a minimum of 300mm centres . <h> Tiling on a Timber Floor <p> Once tanked , by whichever system you choose , you can tile over the tanking to finish off your wetroom and enjoy . <p> Use a flexible adhesive and waterproof grout to complete your tiling and pay a great deal of attention to the joints . <p> Clearly if the tile joints leak it does not mean , with the tanking underneath , that your floor will leak , but without solid joints your tiles may become loose which will make all your hard work look a mess . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

These are important questions to ask if you need to move a fridge as if you do not transport it correctly e.g. by laying it down when its not supposed to be , oil in the compressor unit may be allowed to flow into the cooling pipes and it will not cool efficiently again meaning you will have to buy a new one . <h> When can I Turn my Fridge Back on After Moving ? <p> It is always recommended that you avoid lying a fridge or freezer on its side but sometimes there may be no other option e.g. if you only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some more modern units are a little better at coping with movement and especially being on their sides but unfortunately this can not be guaranteed . If you have had no choice but to transport a fridge on its side it should be left upright for a minimum of 3 hours before it is plugged in and turned on . <p> If it was on its side for more than a day let it stand for 24 hours before plugging it in . <p> Under countertop fridge unit <p> Electrolux advanced fridge freezer unit <h> Can I Lie a Fridge Down to Move it ? <p> As mentioned above , It is always best to keep a fridge or freezer upright when moving , if possible , but if you do need to lie it down make sure you carry out the following 9 steps to protect your fridge or freezer when moving . Additionally , it you are moving the unit in an upright position you should also use the below steps : <p> Turn off the appliance at least 2 hours before moving and preferably the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compact frost free model to allow any fluid to drain* <p> Unplug form the wall and secure the cable to avoid tripping or damaging the unit in transit <p> Remove all food , shelves , boxes and trays . Remember to store any food contents in a family member or friends fridge or freezer for the duration of the move as you do not want any of your food spoiling or going off <p> Give the fridge a good and thorough clean . Use a suitable spray cleaner or hot water with fairy liquid . Make sure you get into all of the corners and remove any food stuffs . Once cleaned give it a good wipe down to dry it . Also , give the outside a good clean and remove any dust , cobwebs etc .... from the rear <p> If the door will be closed for more than 24 hours you may want to place a charcoal activated odour absorber inside to prevent it becoming stale <p> Secure the door with low tack tape ( make sure it is low tack as stronger tapes can damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure the door does n't swing open in transit . If your fridge or freezer unit has two doors e.g. a top unit and a bottom unit it is also a good idea to tie both the handles together also <p> When moving your unit from its current position to the transport vehicle or new location make sure that you use the correct equipment e.g. some sack trucks ( also strap the unit to the sack trucks ) . Fridges and freezers are bulky , awkward items and trying to carry them can result in damage and scrapes to walls and , worst case , even dropping the unit and damaging it or even splitting it which will then render it useless . In the event that you have to carry it due to space restrictions , make sure that you get some help , at least 2 people and always lift in the correct manner - look after your back ! <p> Box sack truck from Faithfull - Available in our store <p> If you have to negotiate a flight of stairs during the move , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in front and one behind holding the sack truck . Due to their size and weight they can easily escape from you or topple over if you do not keep a tight grip on the sack trucks or keep the whole lot at a suitable angle . Also , always move down stairs , one step at a time <p> Lie your fridge on its side and never on its back - lie it on the side opposite the hinges so the door is not straining to open . If you have a side by side fridge freezer lie it down on the freezer side ( the side with the smaller door ) . Additionally , if possible , place a strong box or similar sturdy item under the top of the unit keeping it at an angle and minimizing the possibility of any damage . <p> *NB - Check with the manufacturer of your fridge as certain models do state that you must always transport them in an upright position . Check your instruction manual or the manufacturer 's website for more information . <h> How Should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , you should not try to lift the fridge on your own ; always lift it with at least one other person to avoid straining your back . <p> It is also a good idea to measure your fridge or freezer any doorways that you will have to go through to make sure it will fit . <p> If you do not have any of the affore mentioned sack trucks available to you they can be hired from your local hire shop . This may sound like an unnecessary expense but believe us , it 's more than worth it ! <p> When placing the unit on the sack trucks , make sure it 's on its side . Do not be tempted to lay it on its back as this could damage or crush the cooling pipes or radiator . <p> If when the unit is on it 's side it is too wide to go through any doorways or openings , transport it to the opening and unload it from the trucks and then maneuver it through and load it back onto the trucks once through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this will damage the appliance and the opening . <h> Transporting a Fridge Safely <p> Make sure you secure the fridge to avoid it moving in the van - use straps and take particular care if the fridge has rollers underneath , you may want to use chocks to make sure it wo n't roll around . <p> Cover the refrigerator with a blanket to make sure the exterior surfaces are protected and do not get scratched . <h> Moving a Fridge Freezer or Freezer <p> Moving a freezer or a fridge freezer is the same process , and obviously you should make sure that the freezer is empty and defrosted before you attempt to move it . <p> You could have a leaving party and invite the neighbours round to eat up the contents of the fridge freezer and say goodbye in style ! <h> Moving a Fridge , Freezer or Other Appliance into Position under a Countertop <p> If anyone has tried to do this before you will be well aware that it 's not an easy job . If the appliance , be it a fridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have any casters then it will usually feature small rubber feet <p> These feet normally help prevent the unit moving around when it 's in action and also help protect your floor covering and due to the nature of rubber it tends to be quite resistant to sliding . <p> When forced these feet normally cause floor coverings such as lino , vinyl or carpet to ruck up and in some cases tear <p> To get around this issue , spray a small amount of furniture polish in the space under the counter top and rub it around using an old cloth or duster , making sure that you do not get any outside of the opening as this will make the floor very slippery . <p> With the polish now applied you should be able to slide your appliance easily into position . <h> Where is the Best Place to put a Fridge or Freezer ? <p> This is one of those questions that you might never think to ask , however there are places that you should avoid placing a fridge or freezer . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source such as a cooker , radiator , Rayburn or even a south facing window as this will lead to the unit having to work much harder to maintain a consistent temperature and through this it will also use much more electricity , costing more to run <p> * Note - Manufacturers of some models recommend they should be kept upright at all times to stop drain water from running back into the appliance because of the design of the drain ( unless it is brand new and unused ) .

We will discuss using some of the tools that you can use for strip wires , flex and cables . Find out some great tips and tricks for striping cables effectively and efficiently . <p> Please also check the rules very carefully for ring mains and radial circuits . You are limited in the length of cable you are allowed to use in both circuits and long spurs could make you exceed the limit . If this is the case you are asking the circuit to use much more energy than the circuit is designed for . More energy = more heat and cables can catch fire . Part P of the new building regulations could involve a check on any additional circuitry by qualified electricians when you sell your home . This can affect your sale , you could be breaking the law and your house insurance may not be valid . Please be absolutely sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work checked by a qualified electrician . <h> Stripping Cables , Flexes and Wires <p> Stripping wires etc can be very easy . As with most jobs in all walks of life , it is much easier , and safer with the right tools . Electricians will use side cutters for all of the jobs you will see demonstrated below . You will not have the ability , touch or experience to do this and a tiny little nick out of a cable , flex or wires insulation can be lethal as it will allow current to arc across wires . This will , if you are lucky , just lead to a short circuit which will trip the fuses , or , if you are not , start a fire which could kill you and your family . We do not underestimate the danger of electricity at any level here at Diydoctor and strongly suggest that if you have any doubts about what you intend to do ... Do not do it . <p> The images below show how to strip a cable . The cable shown is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . First the cable is nicked through the sheath at the end . Get this nick in the middle . Pull the nick apart a little and you will see the bare earth wire in the centre . Clamp the wire with the side cutters gently and , holding the end of the cable in your other hand , pull the wire through the insulation . This will tear quite easily . For those with no experience its best to use pliers for this operation rather than side cutters as shown . Measure the connections you wish to make , add enough on to turn the wires over ( see below ) do not skimp on the length . " Stretching " cable to meet connections can mean they will pull out over time , do n't forget your house is moving all the time .

Unfortunately we do not have the flex stripper shown here on sale in the toolstore but it can be bought in most Diy stores . The tool allows the flex to be cut by using the left hand opening , the sheath stripped by using the centre opening and the individual wires stripped via the other . Again it must be stressed that this , as any other tool must be used very carefully as it is more than possible to nick the inner wires without realising . The alternative to using this tool is to slice very carefully around the circumference of the outer sheath with a hobby knife . Apply enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just cut into the sheath . Then bend the sheath a couple of times until it splits and you can see the wires inside . Pull the sheath off . This particular flex is for a light fitting , most appliance flexes will also have an earth wire . <p> Appliance Flex <p> Again , make sure you have measured the length of wire you need for connection without stretching the wires .

This project also includes a light fitting diagram for a ceiling rose . <p> The first rule here is , when wiring a light fitting or chaging a light fitting , if you are in any doubt whatsoever , get an electrician " Electricity kills . <p> Please remember when attempting any electrical installations at home that you are obliged to get the completed job tested by a fully qualified electrician and obtain a minor works certificate . Failure to do this may render your house insurance invalid and you may have difficulty selling your home . You can also buy the tools and products you need for many electrical projects from the tools store below this project . Please also see our project <h> Common Mistakes When Fitting Light Fittings <p> The most common mistake made by people wishing to change their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they take down the existing light and ceiling rose without marking or taking note of where all the cables went . <p> Then comes the mistake , they join all the reds together , then all the blacks , earths are connected , switch turned on and " PING " the fuse blows or the trip-switch flicks off . Why ? Well , 99% of the time one of the black wires belongs to the switch cable that controls that light . Both wires , red and black , are live wires in a switch as you will see a little later . The black wire for the switch should have a little bit of red tape around it , or a little red sleeve on it . This makes the job of identifying the switch cable easy . If there is no such labeling , an indicator is necessary . <p> Make sure you mark any wires and cables yourself when necessary . <h> How Does the Lighting Work in Your House ? <p> Not as big a deal to sort out , but first it is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The diagram below shows the circuits involved . ( Please note some older houses may be wired differently in junction boxes which will be located under the floor/loft , the principle is the same ) . <p> lighting circuit found in a house <p> Power comes into the house to your fuse board or consumer unit . The lights are fed from this via ( generally ) two circuits . One for upstairs lights and one for downstairs . Both of these circuits should be on 5 amp fuses or MCB 's ( Miniature Circuit Breakers ) . This fuse , in theory , allows up to 12 100W bulbs to be used on that circuit , in practice no more than 8 are normally fitted . The cable runs from the consumer unit , to the first light fitting in the ceiling of that floor , it enters the ceiling rose where it is looped in and out to feed the next light , etc etc . At the same time a cable is connected into the ceiling rose to the switch that controls that light . With ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one light , the diagrams and explanations below apply . For two and three way lighting diagrams , which can be identified by additional yellow and blue wires within the lighting switch cables , follow the link . <h> Removing Existing Light Fitting <p> When you have removed your existing light fitting and are faced with a mass of cables hanging out of the ceiling , life is a little daunting ... But it is not as complicated as it looks . <p> Ceiling rose wiring diagram <p> You can see from the above that the loop wires ( all wires in this kind of lighting circuit belong to the lighting " loop " ) are connected to terminal blocks . The live terminal is fed from the consumer unit and in turn gives live power to the other cables in the circuit , in this case 1 supplies the live power from the source , where it is taken by cables 2 and 3 . The neutrals of cables 1 and 2 are joined together in the neutral terminal block , this is where the neutral side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch cable . As you can see more clearly from our diagram in lights and switches this cable interrupts the live flow with a switch . The switch simply cuts off the live current . The red and black wire either side of the ceiling rose are coloured like this for clarity to show live and neutral . With your light fitting flex , they will be brown ( LIVE ) and blue ( NEUTRAL ) . <p> When you have removed your existing fitting , you will need to know which wires go to the switch . Hopefully , as explained above , they will be labeled with either a piece of red tape on the black wire , or a small red sleeve . If you have no indication whatever of which three ( red , black and earth ) wires form the switch cable then you will need a circuit tester . To use this device is not difficult but you must turn all the lighting power off first and take out the fuses so they can not be turned on by accident . <h> Identifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OFF and fuses out , turn off the light switch , ie make sure the switch is in the off position . Now it is a case of trial and error . Hold the red and black terminals of your circuit tester to a red and a black wire that appear in the same cable . ( Using the diagram above , this would mean either cable 1 , 2 or 3 . Then turn on the light switch ( With all power off to the lighting circuits , there is no power to the switch ) . If you have connected to the switch cable , the circuit tester will indicate that you have completed a circuit . If not , it will not move and you try the next set of black and red wires that are in a cable together . When you have identified the switch cable , mark the black with some insulating tape and even put a piece of tape around the cable sheath so there can be no mistake . <h> Fitting Your New Light Fitting <p> Ideally , your new light fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to take it apart . The live and neutral of the new fitting simply connect to the live and neutral the old fitting was removed from . If this is not the case , then we will , need to adapt the rose connections to suit the fitting you have . The easiest way to do that is by making all existing connections into cable connectors ( minimum 5 amp ) or a junction box , as shown below . The live cables will be joined as they were in the ceiling rose , as will the neutrals , and finally , but very importantly , the earths . With these connections made , the live , neutral and earth from your new light fitting can be connected . The base of most modern light fittings is big enough to conceal these new connections but occasionally one has to make a larger hole in the ceiling to push the junction box into . The light fitting is then screwed up as normal . <p> Using the same numbers for the cables as above in the ceiling rose diagrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replicate the circuit . The red tape on the switch live side of the circuit is shown . Good luck with your project and remember to stay safe . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

This project aims to show you how to soundproof walls , ceilings and floors and provide you with information on how to sound proof your home including types of materials to stop noisy neighbours who create noise disturbing you . <p> Sound proofing is a fairly technical and specialist area and there are n't that many companies that are very capable of it . We have had the help of Custom Audio Designs to help prepare this project ( which they are sponsoring ) , so that we can ensure that you get the information you need from trade experts actually working in the soundproofing industry . <p> The further the catapult elastic is stretched , the more force delivered to , and by the pea , the more the pea hurts when it hits it 's target . The pea is like sound here " the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point your receive it or hear it . It 's all pretty straight forward so far . <p> If you can stop the pea being fired ( or the noise being made ) there are three ways of stopping the pea hurting : <p> Wear something very thick or dense , and then the pea will bounce off . You may feel the dent where it hit , but its effect will be reduced . This is because the energy produced by the pea will be absorbed and quickly reflected by the dense material and no vibration will occur to allow the energy ( and pain ) to spread into the body . The same happens if you close the door between you and the sound and it is block , at least in part <p> Wear something very thick and soft , the power of the pea will again be absorbed by the softness . You may still feel the pea , but the force will be greatly reduced . The same happens to sound when you put your head under a pillow " the sound is deadened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you ! ! <p> The same principles can be applied to sound . Unfortunately its a little more complicated because the different frequencies ( Bass , etc ) of sound , produce different energies and need to be dealt with in slightly different ways . If we return to the pea analogy , a very sharp , small and pointed pea delivered with a lot of energy , it may well pierce the protection , whereas a larger , flatter missile would not . A giant pea would do a different kind of damage , but you need protection from both . In the same way you need to protect your home from both high and low frequency sounds . <h> Soundproof Barriers and Passive Absorption Soundproofing <p> There are two main sound control options although they come with many variations : <p> Passive Absorption Soundproofing <p> When sound passes through a material designed to absorb the sound such mineral wool insulation or acoustic foam , which are known as acoustically absorptive materials , the sound waves can not pass directly through as they are forced to change directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres of the material before the sound passes completely through the absorptive material . Each time a sound waves changes direction , a portion of the energy is absorbed by conversion to ( very small amounts of ) heat . <p> Low frequency sound ( bass ) travels much further than high frequency sound as it travels around barriers if it has the chance . This is why you can hear thunder from miles away . If living anywhere near a music festival , it is the bass noises you can hear for longer the further away you get . <p> Soundproofing Barriers <p> When there is a reflective surface behind the absorber , ( such as a wall ) the sound energy which passes through the absorber will be reflected back and through the absorber once again . Absorbers work best when there is some sort of a reflective surface behind them . For some sounds ( low frequency ) an air gap is ideal between the absorber and the reflective surface or wall . <p> Low frequency sounds have less energy than high frequency sounds and ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far , through absorptive layers , as higher frequency sounds . <p> A noise barrier can be constructed from almost any non-porous material . Since sound is energy , an effective barrier must have enough mass ( weight and density ) and a low resonant frequency to stop ( or reflect ) this energy rather than just vibrate with it . As sound pressure levels increase so does the sound power ( amplitude and energy ) . High sound power levels will excite any surface they encounter causing the surface to vibrate at its resonant frequency which inevitably makes the walls shake . Low frequency sound contains more energy , because a larger volume of air is being displaced to produce the long wavelengths associated with bass and sub bass frequencies . These low frequency sounds easily excite most common building materials like wood and 12.5mm thick plasterboard . <h> Soundproofing Solutions in the Home <p> For retrospective soundproofing , the solution at a generic level , is to retro-fit acoustic boards or layers of some kind to either deaden , reflect or absorb the energy waves . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problem soundproofing and defined the methods used to deal with the specific problems encountered in each situation . For each method an acoustic membrane can be used as well as other methods mentioned . <h> How to Soundproof Solid Walls <p> The first principle of reducing sound travelling through solid walls , which already have a good mass , is to add more mass . Sound finds it much harder to travel through tightly packed ( and therefore heavier ) material and the mass simply deadens the sound . Ideally we would cover solid walls with lead sheet but apart from being incredibly expensive , decorating would be a nightmare ! <p> Adding a dense layer to solid walls will reduce sound considerably and there are some very good , dense plasterboard and other acoustic boards on the market to assist with this . <h> How to Soundproof Hollow , Stud and Plasterboard Walls <p> Sound hits a hollow , or stud wall and then travels across the top layer ( plasterboard ) to the fixings which attach it to the studs , or upright timbers , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound through to the other side of the wall . In an ideal world one would take off one side of the wall and add an acoustic layer of mineral wool inside the wall to absorb the sound . When putting the plasterboard back it would be great to decouple the boards from the studs in some way to stop the vibration on the board reaching the studs . <p> Decoupling is possible by adding vertical bars , called resilient bars , to the studs and fixing the boards back on onto the bars , rather than directly onto the studs . This isolates the sound from the studs and lowers the vibration through the wall . These bars are called resilient channels . <p> Resilient bars are thin metal channels which effectively isolates the plasterboard from the studwork , eliminating ' direct contact ' to dissipate sound which would normally be transferred through the frame . This system is easy to install and produces excellent results especially when used with suspended high mass ceilings <p> Decoupling , or isolating the wall surface from it 's studs can cause some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved with an acoustic absorber placed inside the wall void . <p> All the solutions above are only available if you are happy to pull your wall apart and create all kinds of mess . However there are now very thin materials called mass loaded barriers , usually made of vinyl , which can be fixed to the surface of an existing stud wall to deaden sound . There are also sheets of acoustic plasterboard which can be fixed over the existing wall to create further sound barriers . Ideally a mass loaded barrier would be sandwiched between 2 sheets of acoustic plasterboard to create an even more effective sound barrier . <p> Soundproofing walls that are hollow , such as the stud wall can be a tricky job and getting a reasonable level of isolation will usually involve implementing several different techniques all used together . <p> Self " adhesive Mass loaded dense barriers can be easily installed <p> Acoustic plasterboard or SoundblocG boards are blue in colour and are of a higher density than normal plasterboard . They are either 12.5 or 15mm thick and available from most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceilings are constructed in a similar way , and therefore transmit sound in a similar way , to that of hollow , or plasterboard stud walls . The noise coming through a ceiling is obviously being transferred from the floor above ( see soundproofing floors , below ) so decoupling the ceiling is a good way to stop sound reaching the ceiling covering . While decoupling and adding resilient bars ( See soundproofing hollow plasterboard stud walls ) it is good to pack mineral wool insulation into the void . When doing this however , remember to place all electrical cables into conduit to avoid the cabling getting too warm . <p> Mass loaded barriers and other soundproofing mats can also be fixed to the ceiling , either in the same operation as changing the ceiling surface to soundbloc plasterboard or straight onto an existing ceiling . The soundproofing mats are usually about 2mm thick and made of very dense materials which simply absorb the sound when it hits them . <p> Soundbloc plasterboard has a higher density , airated gypsum core <p> If you have access to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the whole ceiling and floor construction as sound-proof as possible . <p> A high performance composite acoustic quilt provides far superior performance to the normal cavity products available as it combines acoustic fibreglass absorption with an acoustic dense membrane to block the sound . <p> Acoustic mineral wool is very useful in absorbing sound and for the reduction of noise in partition walls and/or between flooring joists and ceilings , especially suspended ceilings . The density of this material is generally at least three times that of standard loft insulation so it 's much more efficient at absorbing sound . <p> A very quick and efficient acoustic solution which , in effect is a carpet underlay . It is also cost-effective as it can be installed by any home improver or DIYer quickly and easily . See our project on how to lay carpets and underlay .

These acoustic foam grade tiles are CNC cut 25kg / m3 high density foam which has an open cell structure giving optimum acoustic performance . <p> Very noisy rooms can be sound proofed by using acoustic foam tiles <h> How to Stop Sound Travelling along Pipes , Cables and Heating Ducts <p> Baffles can be fitted within airbricks and chimney flues which are no longer used . The baffles or diffusers allow the air through but either reflect or dissipate the noise . <p> Using acoustic pipe insulation wraps is great for reducing the sound which can travel long pipes and ducts . Some pipe and duct systems can be very noisy and using a macerator system such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Even some soil and vent systems can be noisy when chains are flushed and gurgling in the basin wastes conjoined with water hammer from badly fitted water systems , can all be reduced greatly by using a dense insulation covering . <p> Decoupling the vents and ducts from the surface they are connected to is also useful . As is inserting dense washers ( which can be made out of dense foam material such as a yoga mat ) . <h> Soundproofing Materials and Products <p> There are a range of materials suited for soundproofing , many that we have already mentioned , but here are the most common that are used . There are specific characteristics and uses for these various products , which are explained in more detail here : <p> High Performance Acoustic Membrane <p> 2Kg High Performance Acoustic Membrane that is more efficient than a sheet of lead at blocking sound transmission . Rated at 22dB an only 1.2mm thick it 's easy to work with , easy to cut , and easy to install . <p> Acoustic Mineral Wool is useful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in partition walls , between flooring joists and suspended ceilings . The density of this material is generally at least three times that of standard loft insulation so it 's much more efficient at absorbing sound .

The laminated composition provides maximum performance for minimum thickness and combines excellent sound insulation with all the qualities of a good carpet underlay . It is quick and easy to install and is easily cut and shaped . Overall thickness is just 12mm so it minimises the increase in floor level . This is a product that can be fitted relatively easily yourself . <p> Quietfloor Underlay System <p> Resilient Bar <p> A Resilient Bar is a thin metal channel designed to substantially improve the sound insulation of plasterboard walls and ceilings .

You will not need separate adhesive as it is already pre-applied and you do not need to invest in specialist equipment as the only tool required is a sharp knife to cut the individual tiles and planks to fit your room . <p> As you may have guessed , dry back tiles are the opposite of this and do not feature a self adhesive layer . Instead you will have to purchase suitable adhesive and apply it to the rear of the tile or plank before you lay it . These types of tiles tend to require additional tools to lay and can also be more difficult to lay than the self adhesive type . <p> If you are installing vinyl tiles or planks , in most instances and for most manufacturers they recommend unpacking them and leaving them out for at least 24 hours before you plan to lay your floor . <p> Vinyl needs to acclimatise and relax in an ambient temperature of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Vinyl is generally not suitable for conservatories but can be laid in all other rooms of the home including bathrooms . <p> During this time you may also find it useful to get a plan together of how you want the finished job to look ( if you are using a selection of different colours and styles ) .

All subfloors must have an effective damp proof membrane and , whether you are laying directly over new or existing concrete , an existing stone floor or removing old vinyl , the surface must be smooth , hard , clean and dry ( min 75% Rh with regard to new subfloors ) . Vinyl tiles and planks also require the subfloor surface to be primed to isolate any existing contaminants such as paint , plaster , oil and grease . This is essential as it will also provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To begin , sweep , vacuum and clean your subfloor . If you are laying over existing ceramic or quarry tiles , they should be in good condition and fully bonded to the subfloor . A proprietary smoothing compound should then be applied by following the manufacturer 's instructions . <p> If you are dealing with an existing vinyl flooring , it should be removed , together with any residual adhesive , before applying a smoothing compound . <p> For wooden subfloors , secure all loose boards , hammer down any protruding nails and sand down high spots . A smoothing compound may be used to level the surface before covering the floor with 6mm plywood and fixing it with 25mm ring shanked nails at 100mm centred spaces across the board . <p> Once your subfloor is clean and level , brush or roller apply a coat of floor primer covering the entire surface . In most cases ( depending on brand etc .... ) it will form a white film , which turns transparent as it dries ready for use . This usually takes between 15 - 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your flooring from the centre of the room ( as described above ) . To determine this point , measure the width and length of the area and strike a chalk line halfway across both . It is best to check the positioning and patterning by loose laying a single row of tiles or planks both widthwise and lengthwise along the guideline line to ensure even spacing on both sides . <p> If necessary you can now reposition the guideline so that equal cuts can be made around the perimeter . Cut the required tiles or planks with a sharp knife ( if you do n't have a decent , sharp knife check out our utility knife tool review and also our review on utility knife blades ) . Now lay the tiles and planks from the centre point by removing the backing paper to reveal the adhesive ( if you are using the self adhesive type ) . If you are not using self adhesive tiles then apply some adhesive to the back of the tile and then lay it accurately . <p> Try to avoid sliding the tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes force the adhesive in between joints and in some cases can cause a bad fit . <p> Cacao Flooring <p> Once in position , ensure the joints are tightly butted together and press firmly from the centre to the edge of each tile or plank to make sure that no air bubbles are trapped . <p> In the event that some joints are not level you can even them out . Find a nice clean and flat piece of softwood and then lay it over the proud joint and then gently tap it down with a hammer . <p> It is then ad visible to wipe around all joints with a damp rag to remove any excess adhesive before it goes off hard ( only if you are using dry back tiles or planks ) . <p> A few days after fitting , as the adhesive cures , it will automatically rise to form a perfectly sealed , waterproof join , remaining firm even in bathrooms . You can then clean any excess from the surface with a cloth saturated in white spirit . If you are laying vinyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter edges with a silicone sealer . <p> You may find that your tiles finish in a doorway . In this case it is advised to use a metal threshold strip to give a neat edge and join between the 2 rooms . Many styles are available to match your floor finishes . In most instances door stips are purchased in a set length and are then cut down using a hacksaw to suit the width of the door gap you need to span . <p> During the floor laying process you may find that you need to cut in around architrave or pipework . Unlike ceramic or quarry tiles this is considerably easier : <p> Architrave - The easiest and in most cases best way of cutting in around architrave is to actually cut out a section of the architrave at the base so that the tile will fit underneath it . To do this lay a floor tile on the floor and butt it up close to the architrave . Using a hand saw , lay the saw flat on top of the tile and push it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuring that you maintain a level cut to ensure that the tile will then slide nicely under it . You may then need some sandpaper or a chisel to tidy up the cut . If you are not comfortable doing this then you can use a profile gauge or piece of cardboard to create a template which you can then transfer to the tile and cut out . <p> Pipework - In order to fit tiles around pipework you will need to punch a hole in the tile that is slightly bigger than the diameter of the pipe you are laying around . Using a waste piece of pipe ( copper or other metallic material ) sharpen around one edge with a file and then align the piece of pipe on the tile to the corresponding location on your floor and hit the up-facing end of the pipe with a hammer to punch a hole through your tile . Once you have done this , using a pair or scissors , cut a straight line from the edge of the tile into the hole and then you can lay your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You may find over time that one or more of your tiles or planks may start to lift up . Depending on the brand of tile or plank and the adhesive used you may be able to re-position and re-stick the tile or plank back down . <p> Heat it with a hair dryer to soften both the flooring and the adhesive before smoothing it back down using a cloth working from the centre to the edge . Then simply apply pressure to re-adhere it . <p> In the event that the above does not work then you may need to remove and replace . <h> Replacing Damaged Tiles and Planks <p> It is well worth keeping a few spare tiles or planks as it is possible to replace individual tiles and planks should they become damaged . <p> Greystrip Flooring <p> To do so , cut the damaged tile or plank into strips using a sharp knife before applying the heat of a hair dryer to soften the flooring and the adhesive . You will then be able to lift the strips but do this carefully and begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks . Once removed , install a new one using the methods described at the beginning of this tutorial <h> Maintenance <p> Much of today 's vinyl flooring types are coated with a PU ( Polyurethane ) coating making them quite hardwearing and ensuring that with regular cleaning they stay looking fresh and new . In respect to cleaning regular sweeping and mopping with a general floor cleaner will suffice . <p> However it is advised that you do not use any solvents as this can cause damage but you can use white spirit to remove marks or stains but before you do use this test on an inconspicuous area to ensure that no damage will be caused . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624927 @1624927/ <p> A very popular question to Diydoctor is " How can I stop my basin/shower gurgling when I pull the plug out ? " . To solve this problem its a good idea to know what causes the problem . <p> Basin with valves <p> The water leaves the basin and begins its run into the trap underneath . This trap has water in it which stops smells coming back up through the pipes into the room through the plughole . When the water from the basin passes through the trap , it begins its run to the main waste pipe and out into the external manholes and main sewers . Some of this journey is made through ( inside the building ) vertical pipes and sometimes through pipes which have rather more than the 1 in 40 slope which is recommended for foul water drainage . This encourages the water to run very quickly and sometimes this causes a vacuum behind the flow . This vacuum sucks at the water which remains in the trap . Most often this " sucking " causes the water in the trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes the water is sucked out of the trap completely and this is when foul gasses can get back into the room . <p> Fitting an air inlet valve is easy . The pipe from the trap can be cut ( as near to the trap as possible ) and a Tee piece inserted . The pipes in the image above have been solvent welded together put with pipes that push-fit together the principle is exactly the same . The air inlet valve is then fixed to the top of a vertical length of pipe from the Tee piece . <p> When the valve is fitted the water runs away as before but instead of the vacuum sucking water from the trap it just sucks air which is admitted through the valves . This allows the water to run away noiselessly from basin , bath and shower . <p> If you have little space under your sink or basin , then fitting an anti-vac trap could be the answer to this problem . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Many gallons of lead-based paint remained however and it was still legal to use it . As a general rule , if your home was painted up to 1970 there is a good chance that lead was used in the paint and stripping it with a heat gun could be dangerous . <p> To strip paint you are unsure of in a safe way you should use a non-solvent paint stripper called Home Strip . You can find out more about this in our stripper , in the section marked Home Strip and Lead Based paints . <h> Buying a Heat Gun <p> The higher the wattage of a heat gun , the more powerful ( hot ) it is and a gun of about 2000W is plenty for the majority of jobs you will need to do around the home . <h> Using an Extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power and when this current is pulled through the cables of an extension lead they can get warm if the lead is left coiled on the drum .

On the whole these are quite good as they provide a constant heat source to the mirrors surface and in most cases ensure that the mirror itself remains relatively fog and mist free . <p> On the down side they require connecting to a mains electrical supply and due to this will require an electrician with the previously mentioned Part P certificate . They will also obviously cost you money to run ( as a very rough estimate about 2-3 pence per week to run , depending on the model and manufacturer ) and also impact on the environment . <p> If you are going down this route there are a world of possibilities for back lighting using LED lights fitted into the mirror and a range of other features from clocks and thermometers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mirrors and styles that can be seen all over the web ; search for " heated mirror " or have a look here for one of our favourite suppliers here . <h> Suction Cup Twist Lock Anti-fog Mirror <p> These feature a special anti fog coating property that is built into the mirrors surface that helps it to stay mist free . As this very much depends on the quality of the coating and build quality of the mirror , these can be a bit hit and miss . Also bear in mind that it 's not always the case that the more expensive the better , some cheaper models can be just as good . It 's always advisable to do some research online first . <p> The mirrors them selves in most cases require no drilling or fixing . Most feature quite an ingenious twist lock system . The suction cup is placed flush to the surface to which the mirror is to be fixed and the locking system is turned holding the mirror in place .

Plastering walls after damp treatment needs to follow these specific instructions to work effectively : <h> Traditional Render <p> Hack off all old plaster to at least 450mm clear of all signs of damp or salt and at least 1 metre above ground floor level - use a damp meter to test the walls and remove plaster at least 450mm above the highest level that readings can be obtained . This is to ensure that the residual ' salts ' do not climb above the new plaster in the future . <p> Brush the walls to remove all plaster residues , particularly around angle beads . Old plaster will ' salt ' through your new plaster and will cause damp spots to appear in time . <p> Repair any holes or poor joints with sand and cement ( 4:1 ) using washed , sharp ( means slightly gritty ) plastering sand ( sometimes called screeding or rendering sand . Do not use fine , unwashed sands . Use Renderproof additive ( detailed below ) in the water . Fine , unwashed sands often contain salt and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bond together tightly - these two problems make for a weak render , prone to the easy passage of ' salts ' . <p> Special Note - walls made with non-porous stone or brick , like granite or blue brick , will require an adhesive to help stick the render coat to the wall - use SBR concentrate . Normal renders and plasters stick to the wall by suction - the wall surfaces need to absorb some water for renders to be able to adhere . Without this suction the render or plaster will not grab the wall and may become loose , cracked and hollow as it dries . <p> Scratch the render surface liberally all over with a nail board , trowel , metal float or similar object . Without these scratches the natural drying shrinkage will cause cracking , crazing and hollowness to develop - the next coat will probably pull the first coat off as it dries . <p> Use only Renderproof waterproofer/plasticiser in the water that the render is mixed with , at the rate of 1 part Renderproof to 40 parts of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Renderproof binds the sand to the cement and prevents liquid water passing through . It also makes the mix stickier ( plasticising ) which help to hold the render together . Wet sand weighs more than dry , so it will make your mix weak . Fine sands produce a weak , powdery render , which will not resist ' salts ' . Do not allow the plasterer to add plaster ( finish or ' browning ' ) or washing up liquid to the mix . <p> Renderproof waterproof plasticiser for mixing with render <p> When the render surface is firm enough ( but not bone dry , or it will need re-wetting ) apply a second coat to exactly the same specification - if further coats will be needed to reach the desired thickness do n't forget to scratch liberally . In hot weather spray the render surface with water to slow the drying process . Excessive drying out increases the suction and can prevent one coat sticking to another . Rapid drying always increases shrinkage , which gives rise to cracking of the render or finish plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply a skim coat of universal Multi-Finish or Board Finish . Do not polish or add water to the surface . This will produce a shiny , glazed finish which looks good , but is prone to condensation , black mould growth and poor drying . <p> Delay any decoration for at least one month and then only apply a thin coat of breathable emulsion paint ( not a heavy vinyl ) . Do not repaint for at least three months . Avoid wallpapering at all , if possible . The paint or paper will fall off the wall due to the water vapour that will be trapped underneath in the new render . Wallpaper also absorbs water into its lining and is prone to mould growth . <h> Modern Membranes for Damp and Cold Spots on Walls <p> If you are having issues with damp and cold spots and patches on your walls then you may wish to visit our lining damp walls project .

For the sake of a small extra cost , it is better to purchase 3 core cable , which includes a separate earth lead . <p> Supply wiring for outdoor socket <h> Installing an Outdoor Socket <p> SWA cable is connected and secured to the exterior socket box by glands .

Using a pair of good quality side cutter pliers , or nippers as they are sometimes called , from the point where the outer covering has been cut , judge 20mm ( 3/4 inch ) and cut each strand of the outer steel wires . The inner exposed wire will be around 250mm long at this stage . <p> From the point where the cut steel wires are , measure a point 50mm along the inner wires which have the protective covering . <p> With great care , so as not to cut into the insulated current carrying wires within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In most cases you will also then want to fill the radiator so you will probably need to top up your system . <p> Clean the threads up with wire wool and wrap some PTFE tape around them four or five times . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Screw the adapters into the new radiator . <p> Remove and Refit Blanking Plugs <p> Use a bleeding key to undo the bleed valve at the top of the old radiator , then use a radiator spanner to undo both blanking plugs .

Some radiators come with a template for fixing the brackets , which will make your job a bit easier . Drill and plug the holes , then screw the bracket into place . <p> Try hanging the radiator on the brackets to make sure it fits well . Additionally , when fitting the brackets use a spirit level to make sure they are level . You do n't want a wonky radiator ! <p> Screw in Top Valves and Bottom Valve Adapters <p> Screw the top valves ( normally bleed valves ) and bottom valve adapters into the radiator if they are not already fitted , making sure to wrap a few layers of PTFE tape around the threads before you screw them in . Make sure the joints are secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Access the Existing Pipework <p> If the pipework is underneath floorboards , take up the floorboard nearest the wall to reveal the pipes .

Find out how to painting sash windows in the right way and using techniques to avoid windows sticking . <p> Painting a sash window can lead to all sorts of trouble . If it is not painted in the correct order the sashes will stick together or each sash may stick in the frame rebate . This demonstration is one example of the best order to paint the various parts of a sash window . There are other ways but this is the one we have found to be best . <p> Different stages of painting a sash window <p> Remove all locks and handles from the window frame . Its hard enough to paint as it is without painting round all the ironmongery . See our project on replacing a sash cord if the window does not open or shut in a balanced way . Just as with every decorating job these windows will need proper preparation . Sash windows fit very tightly together and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At some point in the decorating life of a sash window one has to start again and strip the paint back . If this is the time it may be best to follow the instructions in the project above and take the window to pieces . <p> To get at all the parts of the sash window its necessary to reverse the sashes . Lift the bottom sash as high as it will go and pull the top sash down . Many people try to put masking tape on the glass but this causes more problems than it solves . Do n't worry about a bit of paint on the glass , we will deal with how to get that off later . Make sure you remove all dust when you have sanded down . Use the hoover on the window to be certain of this . One of the reasons for painting windows and doors in the order we do is simply to do it in a way which keeps your fingers and elbows out of the wet areas you have just painted . Its not a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ! <p> Start painting the bottom section of the sash which you have pushed up to the top . The mullions come first . Mullions are the division strips within the frame that hold the individual panes of glass . Paint carefully but do n't worry about a little paint on the glass . As already said we will deal with that later . If you are right handed start at the top left corner and work across to the right just as you do when writing . Many people prefer to paint one side of all mullions first , then go back to paint the other side and finally the front . This is a good way to do it as the job is time consuming and painting all of 1 mullion can lead to the paint getting a little " sticky " as you finish . This makes it harder to get a really smooth finish . We tend to paint the left hand side of each mullion first , then go back to painting the right side.We also paint the underside of each horizontal mullion separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mullions in the lowered to sash . You wont be able to get to them all but paint the ones you can get to easily . Use the same method as above . <p> Paint the face of the frame on the lower sash which you have pushed to the top . <p> Paint the underside of the rebate into which the top sash will push when the job is finished . Push the top sash back up now but do not push it all the way into the rebate . Stop short of any painted surfaces meeting . <p> Window scraper <p> Paint the remaining mullions and frame faces . Anything you could not reach before is now accessible . <p> Finally the frame casing and the cill can be painted and the special weapon bought in to tidy up the paint on the window panes . Push the blade of the scraper onto the glass and run gently in towards the mullions . Now hold the blade vertically and run it carefully along the edge of each mullion where it meets the glass . This will cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lift and leave a clean edge . <p> Another common problem with sash windows are the draughts caused by gaps in the frames . Once your paint is fully dry , this can easily be overcome by installing Gapseal leaving you with beautifully painted and draught free windows ! <p> Take a look at our video section on painting and watch a film on how to paint window frames for a visual demonstration on this common DIY task . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

For example , how does a monoblock tap differ to a mixer tap ? With this in mind , we are here to help you by explaining what some of the terms used by the trade refer to and also what certain objects are . <p> Are you planning a new bathroom , and baffled by the terminology ? Do you need to know the difference between a close coupled cistern and a back to wall toilet ? Use this Glossary of Bathroom Terms to take the mystery out of plumbing , planning , and purchasing bathroom ware . <h> Asymmetrical basins <p> Some bathroom basins are asymmetrical or offset . So when you look at them from above they are not symmetrical . The bowl of the basin is off to one side and there is a small shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit may incorporate a drawer or towel rail too . <p> Asymmetrical basin in bathroom - Image courtesy of Bathroom Heaven <h> Back-to-Wall Toilet <p> This is where the pan or base of the toilet fits against the wall , and the cistern is not visible . This may involve building a false wall or using a cabinet to hide the cistern . <p> This give a clean streamlined look to the bathroom , but bear in mind that you may need to get access to the cistern so if it is fitted into a false wall you should allow for some sort of maintenance access . <p> Back to wall toilet - Image courtesy of Bathroom Heaven <h> Bath Filler Tap <p> This is a tap that mixes hot and cold water through one spout into the bath tub . This allows you to fill the bath to a comfortable temperature from one tap fitting . <p> It may have one inlet hole and mix the hot and cold supply under the bath , or two separate ones - one hot and one cold and mix them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two tap hole option accordingly . <p> Bath filler tap - Image courtesy of Bathroom Heaven <h> Bath and Shower Mixer <p> A single tap fitting that has hot and cold inlet and mixes the water in the body of the tap . It has a spout into the bath tub , plus a shower head with a valve that switches between the tap spout and the shower head . <p> Bath and shower mixer tap <h> Bath Tub <p> Baths can be made of acrylic , ceramic , enamelled steel , and occasionally stone or even wood . The bath tub itself can vary in size but standard lengths are 1700mm 1600mm and 1500mm . Normal widths are between 700mm and 800mm but again this can vary depending on the design . <p> Corner baths and offset baths are also available and may fit into difficult sized or shaped rooms better than a conventional bath . <h> Bidet <p> A bidet looks a little bit like a toilet pan and is designed for washing intimate parts of the body , although it has been known for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Bi-Fold Door <p> A door or screen that folds in half to open , and often slides to one side . This is a term used for shower screens and shower doors . <p> Bi-folding shower door <h> Bottle Trap <p> A bottle trap is a waste trap for a basin which is designed to be seen and is used where there is no pedestal . <p> Bottle trap for use below sink where it will be exposed <h> Brassware <p> This is a term for taps and wastes . Although the finish is often chromed the interior is usually made of brass because it can be precision engineered and will not corrode when wet . <p> Brass effect bath taps <h> Cistern <p> A cistern is a tank for holding water . A toilet cistern usually sits on or near the pan and has a connection to allow it to flush the toilet . See back-to-wall toilet , close coupled and low rise for more information . <p> Toilet cistern <h> Close Coupled Toilet <p> This means that thee cistern is stitting directly onto the toilet pan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sits low on the wall . <p> Often close coupled toilets are designed so that they appear to be one single unit . These are now the most popular types of toilet sold in the UK . It is vital that the toilet is sitting on a completely level surface otherwise the joint between the cistern and the pan may leak . <p> Close coupled toilet <h> Combination boilers <p> We have an entire project devoted to explaining combination boilers , but in a nutshell they are pressurised systems which generally operate between 0.8 bar and 1.5 bar of pressure . It is always recommended to check what your manufacturer stipulates as the optimum working pressure before you set the pressure on your system . <p> Vaillant combi boiler <h> Comfort Height Pan <p> This is a term for a toilet that has a slightly higher pan , making using the toilet slightly easier for those with mobility issues . <p> Comfort height toilet or pan <h> Corner Bath <p> Corner baths come in various sizes and are often used to give a full sized tub while taking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give a good wide base for using a shower over the bath . Some models have a seat built into the corner section , to make it easier to wash you feet , presumably ! <p> Standard sizes for corner baths are 1500mm x 1500mm , 1200mm x 1200mm , or 1050mm x 1050mm , but other sizes are available so it is worth shopping around to find one that fits in best with your room plan . Offset corner baths are also available . <h> Countertop Basins <p> This basin sits on top of a counter , which could be the top of a vanity unit , storage unit or even a shelf . The basin has a central waste outlet ( plug hole ) , and may not have an overflow , unlike conventional basins . <p> Taps may be fitted to the basin , wall or the countertop , depending on the style of the basin and yrou personal preference in terms of styling . <p> Some are designed to look like they are simply sitting on the counter-top and are sometimes referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Digital Shower <p> This type of shower allows you to pick a temperature of water that suits you and at the touch of the button the shower will mix hot and cold water at the correct amounts to supply water at a temperature that is just right for you . <p> Digitally controlled shower <h> Dual Flush <p> These are designed to save water when you only need a short flush , shall we say when the contents are just liquids ? The short flush will typically use 3 or 4 litres of water . New UK regulations require a full flush to be less than 6 litres of water . <p> Dual flush push button for cistern <h> Electric Shower <p> Electric showers take water from the cold supply and heat it on demand when you turn the shower on . The greater the wattage of the shower the better the flow of hot water you can expect . <p> Electric shower <h> Enclosures <p> This term referrers to shower screens and shower cubicles . This normally encapsulates the shower , allowing you to keep any and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the room it is located in . This normally sits on top of a shower tray . <h> Gravity-fed Systems <p> This is where the mains water is fed into a tank at high level " usually in the loft , or in an airing cupboard . <p> This usually delivers a low pressure of water but if you want greater pressure you can usually install a pump for a shower or even to increase water pressure to the taps . <p> If you need to calculate the water pressure from a gravity-fed system you can work it out by checking how high the water tank is above the shower or tap . If it is 2 meters above the shower it will deliver 0.2 bar pressure , if it is 5 meters it will be 1.5 bar . <p> Care should be taken to work out pressure on the system when buying showers and pumps to make sure they will work effectively with the system you have . You may wish to take advice from a plumber to be sure you have your calculations right . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for high pressure systems ( such as a combination boiler , or unvented system ) . <h> Low Pressure <p> Showers marked low pressure are suitable for use on a low pressure system ( such as a gravity-fed system ) . <h> Mixer Shower <p> A mixer shower takes the hot and cold water supply and mixes them within the shower unit to give you a shower at a temperature that you can control to suit your needs . Manual mixers are most common and rely on you adjusting hot and cold to suit your needs , digital showers and thermostatic showers are also available . <p> They come in units that are surface mounted , or can be fitted into the wall , known as recessed . <p> Mixer shower <h> Monoblock Mixer Tap <p> A single body tap fitting which only needs one inlet hole . It takes water from the hot and cold supplies and mixes them at equal pressure . The temperature and flow are easily adjusted using the lever on top of the fitting . <p> These types of tap are suitable for kitchens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a toilet pan that can be connected to any of the three toilet outlet systems . With the correct plastic outlet fittings they can be attached to and S-trap , P-trap or bottom outlet waste outlet system . <h> Offset Corner Bath <p> Like a corner bath an offset corner bath will not be as long as a conventional bath , because the actual tub is set at an angle . They are basically triangular in footprint , with a curved front edge and the two other edges being of different lengths . They are often used in ensuite bathrooms or where space is limited to give flexibility of design . <h> Pan <p> A term for the base of the toilet ( the bit that you sit on ) , directly below the toilet seat . <p> Toilet pan <h> Pivot <p> A pivot shower door swings open on a supporting upright bar or brackets . <h> Pop Up Waste <p> The plug on a chain is history with these systems which have an operating rod to raise and lower the plug either by moving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basins and baths . The rod is concealed behind the taps , and basin or tub and so gives a tidy finish with clean lines . <p> Some systems operate by pressing the plug to close and pressing again to pop up and let the water out . The downside of these systems is that you have to put your hand back in the water if you forget to do it while you are using it ! <p> Pop-up waste <h> Power Shower <p> The power part of the power shower comes from a pump in the system . This type of shower takes hot and cold water and mixes them to the desired temperature before pumping the water through the shower head . This usually gives a stronger flow of water than you would get from an electric shower . <h> Quadrant <p> This is usually applies to showers and is a triangular shape with a curved front edge . Basically it is a wedge from a circle " like a big slice of pie ! Quadrant sizes are given as a radius and standard sizing is 800mm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bathroom fittings that include toilets , bidets , baths and basins . <h> Sealed System/Unvented system <p> These are not very common water systems , but are becoming increasingly used in flats and houses where space is limited as they do not require a cold water tank or cistern . They have a hot water tank which is under pressure , and usually delivers water at about 3 bar . <h> Semi-recessed Basin <p> This is a fitted basin that is partly set into a bathroom furniture unit . The front of the basin extends out beyond the front of the unit and some people find this easier to bend over than a fully recessed basin . <p> Semi-recessed basin <h> Short Projection <p> This is term for bathroom sanitary ware that has been designed for small spaces . So a short projection basin will be small from front to back , a short projection toilet will be narrower from the wall to the end of the rim . <p> Short projection sink for a small space <h> Shower Bath <p> These baths are designed with more room at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an L shape . The wider end is designed to give more space to shower and are typically 800mm or 900mm wide at the widest end . <p> They come as a left hand or right hand option and may be available in various lengths to suit the size of the bathroom . <p> Shower bath - Image courtesy of Wickes <h> Shower Tray <p> A waterproof base for a shower enclosure fitted onto the floor and with a waste fitted below . Typical sizes for shower trays are : <p> Sizes vary between manufacturers so shop around to find one that best suits your needs . <p> Standard shower tray <h> Sliding Door <p> A shower door which consists of two or more panels which slide to one side to allow you in and out . <h> Soft-closing Mechanism <p> This is a hydraulic closing mechanism that slowly closes doors and drawers or gently lowers toilet seats rather than allowing them to bang shut . The mechanism is hidden inside the hinge or runner and it gives a luxurious feeling finish to the bathroom fittings . <h> Space-saver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to give more room where there is limited floor space . Sometimes they are shorter than a traditional bath too . <p> Space saver bath - Image courtesy of standup-magazine.com <h> Thermostatic Shower <p> A shower with a thermostatic valve can changes in water pressure and will adjust the hot or cold intake to compensate . This means that if someone else if drawing water elsewhere in the house you do not get a blast of freezing or scalding water mid-shower . <h> Towel Radiator <p> There are many styles and finishes of towel radiator available now . They are connected to the central heating system , and aredesigned to be attractive as well as functional . They often have spaces to hang towels through the bars , to dry and warm them , as well as heating the room . <p> Make sure you pick a radiator that is big enough for the room if this is going to be the only method of heating . You can also have an electric element to make the unit into a heated towel rail which can be used even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running off central heating supply <h> Walk-in Shower <p> This type of shower enclosure has a screen or screens but does not have a door or curtain that you need to close to use the shower . <h> Wall-hung Basin <p> These basins are hung on brackets and have no pedestal . They can make a bathroom appear less cluttered and more spacious . This style means the trap beneath the basin is on show and so you should choose one that is chrome or coloured rather than the basic black or white plastic that is usually hidden by the pedestal . <p> A normal basin height is between 780mm and 820mm from the floor " depending on your own preference ( and height ! ) <h> Wall-hung Toilet <p> These types of toilets have a pan that is hung on brackets from the wall rather than standing on the floor . The cistern is usually separate from the pan and concealed in the wall . This type of fitting gives a stylish , minimalist finish , especially if combined with a wall hung basins , and they can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor easier to clean . <p> Wall hung toilet - Image courtesy of victorianplumbing.co.uk <h> Wet Room <p> This is a shower that does not have a shower tray , but the water drains into a drain in the floor . Sometime the shower is open to the rest of the bathroom and sometimes it is separated by wet room panels ( essentially a fixed shower panel ) . <p> Typical wetroom tiled floor to ceiling <p> We will continue to add terms to our Bathroom Glossary as we progress , but the above should cover the main terms to get you started . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Shut off valves can make maintenance easier and this project gives you an explanation of the different kinds of valves available to the DIY enthusiast and what they should be used for . <p> Isolation valves , sometimes called shut off or service valves are used to cut off the water supply to anything in the home that is permanently connected to the water supply . This includes taps to basins , baths and sinks , toilets , showers , washing machines , dishwashers , outside taps and water tanks . The most common type of isolation valve is called a Ballofix which is often abbreviated to Ballfix by plumbers . <p> When doing any work at home it is a great idea to add isolating valves whenever the opportunity arrives .

Also find out why vertical damp proof courses are needed to prevent damp travelling sideways through adjoining walls and how they are used to provide damp proofing and prevent heat loss around windows and doors and any other cavity closing areas . Additionally find out how you can further reduce heat loss from these areas by installing an insulated vertical damp proof course . <h> What is a Verticle DPC ? <p> A vertical DPC is similar to a horizontal DPC ( or Damp Proof Course ) in that it stops damp travelling through your masonry . Whilst a horizontal DPC stops damp rising up from the ground through your walls , a vertical DPC is used to stop water travelling sideways through walls and surfaces that may come in contact with each other . In builders speak we say that walls of this type are being " returned " . <p> Vertical damp proof courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being installed in a cavity wall .

The vertical DPC is inserted between the walls around the window to stop water travelling in from outside through the external wall from reaching the internal wall . <p> Vertical DPCs are usually damp proof membranes , but laying a normal damp proof membrane intended for horizontal DPC use is n't actually sufficient for use as a damp proof course around windows , it is usually recommended to use an insulated DPC ( these can be purchased from most DIY stores or builders merchants ) . <p> If you would like additional help and advice on what types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 01626 336180 . <p> Hold the vertical damp proof course in position until the cavity is closed <h> Heat Loss from Cavity Closing Around Windows and Doors <p> The cavity closing around your windows or door means that your warm internal wall is brought into contact with your cold external wall . Without any treatment or insulation this means that you lose internal heat more easily from this wall area as the heat from the warmer inner wall is transfered through to the colder outer wall . <p> Additionally the outer wall can also help to keep the inner wall at a colder temperature as it passes cold from outside to inside through the touching surfaces . This will in turn make your heating work harder to heat your home and maintain that heat costing you money and wasting energy . <p> These cold areas are known as cold spots . Not only do these areas make the internal air around your windows and doors feel cold , these cold spots can also attract moisture from your internal air this becomes condensation on the wall area around your window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the fact that these cold spots around your windows and doors are costing you money in terms of energy , they can also be bad for your health because of issues like mould .

This is an angled cut made to both pieces of timber . <p> Mitred Joint <p> The angle at which each piece of timber is cut is half of the total angle involved . For example , most rooms are square , or very nearly in the case of most modern buildings ! This gives each corner a value of 90 degrees . Both sides of the timber are therefore cut at 45 degrees so they meet to form the 90 degree turn . <p> The length of one side of the wall is measured and at each end a mitre is cut .

Then fold the paper in half so that each of the sides which were touching a wall are now aligned with each other . The angle now formed can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two timbers should be like unfolding the paper again . Do n't forget , practice first . <p> If you have a lot of mitres to do it is definately worth buying an electric mitre or " chop " saw , but do remember to wear safety goggles . <h> Other Alternatives to Mitre Joints <p> There are many situations where the cutting and joining of mitre joints are required and in most cases this is the best course to take . However in some instances a joint of this type simply is not strong enough unless you combine it with other jointing techniques and additional support - e.g. if you were building a work bench or shelving unit for your garage or shed you would want this to be sturdy enough to take the weight of items such as tools boxes and paint tins etc .... <p> In this case it may be better to use a specialist jointing system such as the one we have used in our how to build a work bench project .

We explain how to fit a flue liner into the chimney and insulate it with vermiculite . This DIY project includes pictures of a real installation of a wood burning stove . <p> Fitting a flue liner into an existing chimney can certainly be a DIY job but certain , very important rules have to be adhered to . Any work done to an existing chimney needs to comply with the Building Regulations . In particular Approved Document J. This document can be downloaded from our projects pages . <p> Flue liner and insulation diagram <p> The size of the flue used depends on the size of the flue outlet on the woodburner . The flue used must , under no circumstances , be smaller than the flue outlet of the fire or stove . For a wood burner or other solid fuel fire or stove producing up to 30KW a 150mm flue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel only ) producing up to 20KW , a 125mm flue can be used . The amount of soot deposit created by a woodburner is quite considerable and a 150mm flue is suggested in every case . If you open up an old fireplace and would like to place a wood burner in the opening you must first arrange for the chimney to be smoke treated to see if it is safe to use without a liner . If the flue needs a liner , check with your supplier as to the best liner to use under your circumstances . A flexible liner is the easiest to fit . <p> Pull through flue liner <h> How to Fit a Flexible Flue Liner <p> Please make sure you stay safe while you are working on the roof . Proprietary scaffold and roof ladders must be used and under no circumstances should you attempt this job on your own . It is a two person job . <p> First , clean the chimney . You will regret not having done this when you start work . Chimneys accumulate a lot of soot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation of a new liner . When it is , the entire room will be covered ! <p> Now tie a large knot in the end of a rope ( preferably a 10mm nylon rope ) and lower it down the chimney to the hearth at the bottom of the fireplace . Tie the other end of the rope to the chimney pot . It is heartbreaking having spent ages getting the rope all the way down only to watch the other end disappear as well ! If you feel the rope go slack before it hits the hearth it has probably got caught on a ledge or a change of direction in the stack . Lift and drop the rope a couple of times to allow it to fall down . When the rope is at the bottom , tie a piece of string to the top at the top of the pot or mark it in some other way . The distance between this mark and the knot that the end of the rope is the length of flue liner you need to buy . You also need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can order a closing plate . The closing plate should overlap the inside edge of the brickwork by about 25mm leaving 75mm of brickwork exposed all the way round . <p> Having obtained your liner you now need to remove the chimney pot and the surrounding haunching . If this is done carefully you will save the pot . Place the pot somewhere safe and squash flat the last 9 inches of the liner and fold the flat section back on itself . Push the rope through the fold as shown in the diagram and tie it together under the fold . Now use some strong duct tape and tape the folds together . Put plenty of tape on the actual crease of the fold itself to smooth off the sharp edges . You will soon be pulling this liner down the chimney and the more times it gets stuck ( and we promise it will get stuck ! ) The more you will wish you had " wasted " a bit more tape rounding off the end . <p> Now tie a large knot in the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney . When it gets to the bottom get your work mate to pull it through while you feed it into the hole from the top . when it gets stuck , pull it up a little and tug it down again . Very few chimney stacks are straight up and down so there may be a few bends to work through . You should now go to our project on fitting a woodburning stove or fire . <p> Flue liner all the way down <p> The image on the right shows the liner hanging down out of the chimney . Flue liner is not the cheapest of materials but do not be tempted to cut costs by being too accurate with the length of liner required . Admittedly there is a little too much showing here but it is so much better , and ultimately a great deal cheaper , to cut some off than it is to be 25mm short . <p> Talk to your supplier about insulation for your flue pipe also .

If the liner is not insulated the hot air could condense causing a lot of water to run back down the liner into your stove . This makes the stove or fire totally inefficient .

@@41624965 @1624965/ <p> Summary : How to paint kitchen units . In this DIY how to guide you will learn all about how to paint kitchen cupboards and kitchen units , also including painting timber kitchen worktops . You will find out what types of kitchen worktop you can paint , how to prepare your worktop before painting , how to clean your worktop and how to prime it , apply undercoat and then apply the top coat . In terms of your units and cupboards you will find out what types of paint are best to use , how to prepare units and cupboards before painting and finally how to prime , undercoat and then top coat them in such a way that you will get a beautiful smooth finish . <h> Painting Kitchen Worktops <p> Can I paint any Type of Worktop ? <p> As far as worktops go , unless they are timber , such as a hardwood worktop , they should not be treated or painted with anything or in any way as in pretty much all cases the varnish or paint will not penetrate or bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laminate coating on a traditional worktop is designed to keep water , moisture and food stuff etc. from penetrating the wooden core and thus will prevent varnish and stain from soaking in and also paint from keying to the surface . <p> The paint , varnish or other covering or treatment will eventually ( quite soon in most cases ) chip and crack . Worktops are used continually even if it is only to dump things on and they will mark ! These imperfections will then harbour germs leading to a very unhygienic work surface . <p> As mentioned above , you should only try and paint a timber or wooden worktop . In many cases the worktop will have been treated with an oil , varnish or stain at some point and depending on the length of time that it has been on the surface will depend on the finish and success of the job as a whole . <p> The nature of a stain or oil is that it soaks into the wood and prevents things from soaking in , in this case the paint . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary bond to hold it there then it will eventually crack and flake off . <p> If it is possible to find out if the worktop has previously been treated and what with , this information will be very useful . If it has been treated with Danish oil then , depending on the manufacturer , it should be possible to prime and paint as most oils of this type can be painted over . <p> However , if the stain or oil is non-porous and has been on the surface for a considerable amount of time then it may be possible to get a positive outcome . <p> When it comes to the type of paint to use the best choice is a semi or part gloss as this will minimise any visible brush or roller marks . Flatter , more matt finishes will also give a resistance when wiping over as it will produce a chalk-like finish . <p> Painting Wooden Worktops <p> The following is a guide to how to paint a treated wooden worktop that we have had some success with over the years but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome , its up to you if you want to give it a go but be aware if it goes wrong then you may need a new worktop : <p> NOTE : If it is at all possible , it 's a lot easier to get a good finish on your worktop if you move to a garage or other area rather than try and work on it in the kitchen . <p> Treat with White Spirit : Using an old rag or soft brush , scrub the surface well ensuring that you get into any nooks . Scrub the surface at least 2 times , working in the white spirit to remove as much of the oil and stain as possible . Work in a small area at a time and use a clean cloth to wipe of residue as you go . Ensure that you wear gloves for this step <p> Sand Down the Surface : Once the white spirit from the previous step has dried ( allow at least 24 hours ) , use a fine sandpaper ( 300 " 400 grit ) to sand over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into any nooks and crannies . Make sure that you sand with the grain and not against it as this will cause scratches that may show through your final finish . Brush away and then vacuum up as much dust as you can <p> Wipe Over with White Spirit : Once sanded , wipe over the surface again using white spirit to remove the final traces of dust and grease <p> Prime : When it comes to primer and paint you are going to need something tough and hardwearing due to the amount of punishment that a worktop receives . Dacrylate have quite a range of primers suitable for this or you can check out your local DIY store . With your primer selected , apply one coat using a brush or roller and allow to dry following manufacturers guidelines <p> Apply Undercoat : One you have primed the surface you will then need to apply 2 coats of undercoat . Ensure that this matches with your choice of primer and top coat and that it wo n't react . Apply using a brush or roller and allow to dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting a finishing top coat make sure that it is suitable for applying to your primer e.g. if it is water based then you should use a water based top coat etc . As this will be the finishing coat , you will want to get the best look possible so use a very fine roller or brush to minimise marks and strokes . Once the first coat is applied allow to dry for the manufacturers indicated time and then apply a second coat and then third coat if necessary <p> Once completed it is a good idea to leave the worktop for at least 24 hours for it to harden off , preferably you should leave for at least 48 . <h> Choosing the Paint for Your Kitchen Cabinets and Cupboards <p> The traditional coating for kitchen cupboard doors is gloss . This is fine to use and will give a very nice finish but is does have one drawback in that it is not very forgiving on any imperfections in the doors themselves and will also show up any brush strokes created during the painting process . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way to go . This will provide a very good finish and will also be quite forgiving when it comes to brush and roller marks . <p> When it comes to the type of paint e.g. water based , oil based etc. check with the manufacturers guidelines on the packaging in terms of what surfaces the paint can be used on to ensure its suitable to use on your kitchen units , cupboards and doors . <h> Paint Cupboards or Units in Situ or Remove Them ? <p> When it comes to where you carry out the work to , the best solution is to remove all the items e.g. units and cupboards and prep and paint them in a garage or other space . This will give the advantage that you will have plenty of space to work in and avoid having to paint around worktops , walls and appliances . You can paint the entire object in one go . <p> This should certainly be possible for any unit or cupboard doors as these can be easily removed by undoing the hinges but this might not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , appliances , have worktops on top of them and generally be a pain to remove , especially if you have a family and need a functioning kitchen , so you may need to work on them where they are . <p> If you do have to paint each item where it lays then make sure you use masking tape to mask off any area that you need to avoid getting paint on . Your masking up should be done just before you start painting , after you have completed all the cleaning and preparation work . <p> Another solution , if you do n't want to gut your entire kitchen in one go , is to remove and paint one unit or cupboard at a time . This way you can still maintain a working kitchen , albeit missing a base unit or cupboard . <p> Whichever route you go down , ensure that you remove all handles and hinges before you start . Keep them in a safe place such as a container or bag so you do n't lose any screws etc .... <h> Cleaning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cooking and preparing food often releases grease and moisture into the air and this can settle on all your units even if it is invisible to sight and touch . <p> Because of this , before you start you will need to give everything a good clean . Ideally , if you can clean everything over with a decent multi-purpose cleaner or degreasing substance and then after this clean over with sugar soap , this should then give a good surface to paint on , ensuring that no grease or film will remain preventing the paint from keying into the surface . Now , leave the surfaces to dry out and see below once dry : <p> Timber Surfaces : If you are painting wooden or timber doors or units or it they have been previously painted , you will now need to rub them down . For this , use sandpaper with quite a high grit count e.g. 100 " 120 grit ( information on the different types of sandpaper can be found here ) . Rub gently over the surface ensuring that you do n't spend too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that you get into any nooks and rub them down such as decorative mouldings or routed or planed edges . Once done , wipe the surface you have sanded over with a slightly damp rag to remove dust and any other particles <p> Laminate Surfaces : If the surfaces you are painting are laminated or coated then you will not need to rub them down , you can just apply a melamine primer ( see below ) . You will still need to clean them thoroughly though ! <h> Priming and Undercoating Units and Cupboards <p> In the final part of the decorating process we get to the actual painting stage . There are several different levels of painting that will need to be completed in order to get a good finish . In all cases it 's also a good idea to use a decent paint brush with fine bristles as this will help to reduce the number of visible brush marks . <p> The way in which you apply the primer , undercoat or top coat can also have an effect on the finish . Where possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. either up and down or side to side . <p> Priming Surfaces <p> The first stage is to prime the surface . Depending on what surface you are painting will depend on what primers you will need to use : <p> Wooden and Timber Surfaces : For this surface type use a specific timber primer . It is possible to purchase all-in-one primers and undercoats but we recommend using a specific primer and the all-in-one varieties can be a bit hit and miss in terms of finish quality <p> Laminate and Melamine Surfaces : As mentioned above , you will need to use a special melamine primer . These can be purchased from most DIY stores <p> In respect to the number of coats , one should be enough if existing colours are quite light but if they are quite dark or glossy then it may be best to go with two just to be sure you do n't get any bleed through from the darker colour . Give the first coat a quick rub over with sandpaper to flatten it back . Thoroughly remove and dust before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly you should then be able to use any undercoat on top of the primer , as long as the manufacturer has stated this ( check manufacturer 's directions on the tin ) . <p> In most cases , one coat should be enough but if you find that you have quite a few brush strokes showing then apply a second . If you need to apply a second then give the first coat a light rub over with some sandpaper beforehand . Make sure you wipe off any dust before applying the second coat ! <p> In respect to what colour undercoat to use , try to choose one that is a close match to your topcoat as this will help with the final finish . <p> Applying undercoat to primed kitchen cupboard <p> Top Coating Surfaces <p> Once the undercoat has dried thoroughly it 's time for the top coat . As before , give the undercoat a very light sand over to flatten it back and then remove any traces of dust . <p> You will need to apply a minimum of two topcoats to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it a light sand over to flatten it back before the next coat . <p> Do n't overload the brush with paint and only apply in thin layers as you do n't want the finish to look clumpy or be full of runs . <h> Furniture for Your Kitchen Units and Cupboards <p> Now that you have given your cupboards or units a makeover the final finishing touch is to replace the handles and /or hinges . <p> Depending on your choice of colour and style you are going for , you can pretty much guarantee that there will be a range of fittings to suit . Whether you are going for a minimal contemporary look or more of a traditional style , you are sure to find what you are looking for . <p> When searching for new kitchen unit or cupboard furniture , make sure you take a selection of your old fittings with you ( if you are going out DIY stores etc .... ) .

Use an old towel or flannel to dry off the tiles when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grout , mix one part bleach with two parts water , in an old spray bottle if you have one , and coat the problem area . Let it soak for a few minutes and rinse with cold water . If the grout is really grotty , you might want to consider re-grouting . See our replacing grout project if you want to give this a go . <p> Use the above method on your bath or shower tray too . If you live in a hard water area and you find limescale spots build up , these can be removed by scrubbing with a mixture of equal parts hot water and white vinegar . This mixture also works really well on taps , levers and other chrome elements . If you live in a hard water area and limescale is a problem , see our project on dealing with hard water for help . <p> Wipe a coat of furniture polish over the wall tiles when you are done " this will help prevent dirt , mildew and limescale from sticking in the future . Just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and none gets on the bath or shower tray , as it could make it slippery . <h> Shower Doors and Curtains <p> Use that white vinegar again " neat this time " with a sponge to clean soap scum off glass shower doors and make them sparkle . Stubborn water spots on metal door or enclosure frames can be cleaned with lemon oil . <p> Most shower curtains are machine-washable . Put it in the machine with a couple of towels once a month on a cool wash to stop mould and soap scum building up . Do not use fabric conditioner . Hang the shower curtain up in place to dry . <h> Shower Head <p> Shower heads often become clogged up , so the spray is reduced or going off at odd angles . You should be able to unscrew the shower head and remove it . Place it in a bowl of white vinegar for a few hours , or overnight if it 's really bad .

You need to remove all the fluff and hair that 's built up , which will be partially blocking the drain . Grab a plastic bag and your rubber gloves , and unscrew or lift up the drain " depending on how it works . Pull out any clogs of hair you can see and throw them in the bag . Then get a wire coat hanger , unbend it enough to fit down the drain , and poke about a bit , pulling up as much hair as you can . <p> When you think you 've got as much gunk and hair out of the drain as you can , pour some bleach down . Leave for a few minutes , then pour some water down to rinse the bleach away . This should remove soap scum build-up from the pipes . <p> And there you are , a lovely clean shower .

@@41624971 @1624971/ <p> Summary : What is lead flashing ? In this project you will find out the answer to this question along with a great many others including why lead is used , fitting lead flashing corectly including how to chase out masonry and fix the lead in place and then how to then waterproof these joints and also all about the different number and colour codes such as code 3 and code 4 and what these mean in terms of what each code should be used for . We will also explain why lead has traditionally been used in roofing and flashing and we also look at why flashing tape is a sensible alternative in a lot of places due to its cost effectiveness . Additionally you will also find out about lead slates known as quick slates and how these can be used for boiler flues and soil and vent pipes . <h> What is Lead Flashing ? <p> Flashing is a term applied to any thin strip of material used to prevent water ingress into a property . Before the introduction of lead flashing , which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed . The most common of these was to mix lime mortar to cover the joint where two surfaces met . Another commonly used method was to use timber shingles ( small thin timber roof tiles ) . <p> Flashing can also be constructed from any other thin , sheet material such as copper flashing , aluminium flashing and even zinc flashing . <p> It is quite common these days , admittedly more often on commercial roofs , to have galvanised steel made up in sections of flashing and also as box gutters . <p> Lead flashing comes in different thicknesses and widths <h> Who fits Lead Flashing ? <p> Is it a plumber or a roofer who fits my lead flashing ? This is a question we get asked a lot . The name plumber comes from the Latin noun Plumberium which translates as a worker of lead . Years ago all plumbing pipework was made from lead and so lead work and plumbing became synonymous . <p> The Latin for lead is Plumbum and it was used in Roman times for pretty much everything it is still used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper but much of the original Roman jobs that were done in lead , are still being done in lead today . <p> These days , in 90 percent of cases , it is the roofer who will fit the flashings unless there is a great deal of dressing to be done . If this is the case , there are still many plumbers about who are practiced in the art of lead dressing . <p> Lead is used as roof coverings as well as flashings <h> What Does Working or Dressing Lead Mean ? <p> Dressing lead is to make sure the lead is fitted as close to the surfaces it covers as possible . Lead is very pliable and can be stretched to make sure it covers some very odd shapes . This stretching is done by using special tools called Lead Dressers . <p> Lead can be worked into the most complicated of shapes and some lead dressing can almost be described as art . <p> Lead Dressers are historically hardwood timbers cut and shaped to suit the type of covering required but this stretching , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny bit at a time . If you try and dress lead too quickly it will split . <p> It is important not to dress lead with any form of sharp edge . All lead dressing edges should be rounded . <p> Dressing lead is done with lead dressing tools <h> Why is Lead Flashing Used ? <p> When any part of a roof meets a vertical surface or any kind of abutment as with an extension , roof window , a dividing wall between two terraced properties or between a property and a conservatory , there is potential for the joint between the surfaces to leak and it is this joint needs to be sealed against leaks . <p> Lead is usually used for this because it is completely waterproof and very flexible . <p> The different parts of a house are made of different materials and , especially on a roof where temperatures vary greatly with different weather conditions , they can move around a lot as the expand and contract . <p> Lead is a great choice to fit over the joints between different materials as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's flexibility . <p> As mentioned , the lead is worked by using different tools to stretch it and get it to take the shapes necessary to form a water-tight seal . <p> Lead is dressed over the shape of the tiles on a long porch roof <h> What do the Various Lead Codes Mean and why are They Used ? <p> British Rolled Lead must be supplied in accordance with British Standard 12588 . Historically it is coded , or labelled , into various weights per square foot . These days the codes remain the same , but metric measurements have been applied and the results can be seen below . <p> In imperial measurements , Code 3 lead weighs 3lbs per square foot , code 4 lead weighs 4 pounds per square foot and so on . <p> You can see the various codes and uses for them in the paragraphs below . Obviously , if code 4 lead weighs more than code 3 lead for the same sized piece , the heavier ( code 4 ) must be thicker . This means that different codes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Code 3 lead is generally the thinnest lead used on roofs <p> Lead is also used for jobs other than flashing and it is very unusual for flashing to be completed in lead greater than code 5 . <p> Flashing is usually done in code 4 lead . Roofs and gutters however , where there is much greater movement and potentially wear and tear , are usually done in a very thick code 8 lead . <h> Lead Flashing and Colour Codes <p> You can see from the rolls of lead in the images on this page that they have tape wrapped around them . This tape is of different colours . This is a deliberate coding system used to identify lead rolls and lead sheets at a glance . The different colours refer to the different codes and these can be seen in the table below . <p> Code 3 Lead <p> Code 4 Lead <p> Code 5 Lead <p> Code 6 Lead <p> Code 7 Lead <p> Code 8 Lead <p> GREEN <p> BLUE <p> RED <p> BLACK <p> WHITE <p> ORANGE <p> Code 4 lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Weights <p> Let 's have a look at how the codes for lead work and how they have survived the metric changeover ! The roll of lead shown in the image above is Code 4 lead . This means is should weigh approximately 4 pounds ( lb ) for every square foot . <p> It is 1.8mm thick , as it should be , and 240mm wide . It 's total length is 3m and we can see from the label it weighs 15kg in theory . <p> This means that the weight has been calculated by multiplying the length of the lead roll by the width of the roll and then multiplying the area by the weight of the given code . <p> Our table below shows what these weights should be but we can work backwards from the theoretical weight just to see how the transfer from the original coding system works . <p> Chasing Code 4 flashing into stonework requires a straight cut <p> The lead in the image above weighs 15kg so this should mean that it is 33lbs . <p> The area of the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is 0.72 square m . <p> So with this in mind , Code 4 lead weighs 46lbs for every square metre . <p> A square metre is 10.76 square feet so each square foot of this Code 4 lead weighs 4.2 lbs , slightly more than the 4lbs given in the code . <p> We can see therefore , that the metric system , when applied to lead flashing means we get more for our money ! ! <h> What are the Different Codes of Lead Used for ? <p> Code 3 - is pretty much used exclusively for soakers as it is comparatively thin and too much movement in a roof could make it split if it were used as a roof covering or flashing <p> Code 4 - is used for soakers sometimes , lead flashings , lead roof valleys and lead hip flashings . It can be used as cladding also for small roof or wall sections <p> Code 5 - is used for all the above , although rarely for soakers , and is used for valleys and pitched gutters where the water flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all used almost exclusively for roof coverings <h> What is a Lead Soaker <p> Lead soakers are squares , or rectangles of ( usually ) code 3 lead which are fitted to slat roofs or plain tile roofs where the tiles butt right up to a vertical abutment . <p> Each soaker sits on the top of the last slate or plain tile and the next tile or slate is laid on top . Half the soaker is folded up the wall . <p> The soakers then form a flat gutter between the tiles and the wall and the top of the soakers is covered by an apron flashing or sometimes a stepped flashing . <p> Lead soakers on a plain tile roof with an apron flashing <h> What is a Lead Valley ? <p> Where one roof meets another at right angles , such as in the addition of a dormer window , a joint is formed between the two roofs . This joint is called a valley . <p> This valley can be made in lead before the tiles are laid . Lead valleys can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better as a great deal of water , and movement , occurs in roof valleys . <h> What is an Apron Flashing ? <p> Where a flashing simply hangs down from its fixing point ( usually a chase in masonry ) and is cut square at the bottom , it is called an apron flashing . Apron flashings are often seen at the front of chimney stacks and covering soakers on a plain tile roof . <p> Chimney stacks often have apron flashings <h> What is a Stepped Flashing <p> Where it is impractical or would look untidy to cut out one long chase for an apron flashing , the much trickier stepped flashing can be fitted . This gives a waterproof and tidy finish to the flashing . <p> Putting an apron flashing into a sloped chase would invite the back edge of the apron to lift . This could easily cause a leak so stepped flashings are installed on the side of chimneys and when one gable end abuts the roof of a semi detached property . <p> Stepped flashing to the side of a chimney stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What is a Hip Flashing ? <p> Lead flashings are used on hips when getting a hip or ridge tile to remain waterproof would be impossible or would look really untidy . <p> This might be because a traditional roof has been built with a very high hip board which prohibits a ridge tile sitting squarely over the joint between the two sides of the roof . <p> Hip flashings are not used widely today as the range of tiles and their associated special tiles , such as hip and valley tiles , is much greater . <p> Roof hips are sometimes covered with lead flashing <h> Metric Measurements , Weights and Codes for Lead Flashing Rolls <p> The table below shows only the three most commonly used Lead codes and those you are most likely to use at home . For much more information please take a look at the Lead Sheet Associations website . Lead comes in 3m and 6 m rolls . For the weight of a 6m roll , please double the weight of the 3m roll shown here . <p> Code 3 Lead <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sq m <p> 15kg <p> 20.41kg <p> 25.4kg <p> Thickness of lead <p> 1.32mm <p> 1.8mm <p> 2.24mm <p> Width in mm <p> Closest Imperial <p> Kg Weight per 3m roll <p> Kg Weight per 3m roll <p> Kg Weight per 3m roll <p> 150 <p> 6 inches <p> 7 <p> 9 <p> 11 <p> 180 <p> 7 inches <p> 8 <p> 11 <p> 14 <p> 210 <p> 8 inches <p> 9 <p> 13 <p> 16 <p> 240 <p> 9 inches <p> 11 <p> 15 <p> 18 <p> 300 <p> 12 inches <p> 13 <p> 18 <p> 23 <p> 360 <p> 14 inches <p> 16 <p> 22 <p> 27 <p> 390 <p> 15 inches <p> 18 <p> 24 <p> 30 <p> 420 <p> 16 inches <p> 19 <p> 26 <p> 32 <p> 450 <p> 18 inches <p> 20 <p> 28 <p> 34 <p> 510 <p> 20 inches <p> 23 <p> 31 <p> 39 <p> 600 <p> 24 inches <p> 27 <p> 37 <p> 46 <h> Fitting Lead Flashing <p> Fitting lead flashing takes a little practice to get it right and we do recommend that you go somewhere to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> If lead flashing is not fitted properly it can leak and believe me , if it does , it is a horrendous job to put right . Flashings are one thing that really has to be done 100% right first time . <h> Cutting the Chase for Lead Flashing <p> The chases for lead flashing are almost always done with a disc cutter . Please be very careful when using one of these machines , especially on a roof . <p> A flashing needs to overlap the joint with another surface by a minimum of 150mm where the abutting roof is sloping with 50% of the overlap distance going up the wall vertically . At least 30mm needs to be tucked into the chase . <p> For flat roofs , the lead which pays on the flat roof should be at least 200mm . <p> Lead flashing needs to be a minimum of 75mm up the wall <p> For a standard 30 degree lean-to roof , against a brick wall , the lead on the roof should be minimum 150mm . The vertical lead should be minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the lead tucked into the chase should be a minimum of 30mm . This gives an overal minimum width to the lead of 255mm . <p> A professional , who can dress the lead very close to the roof surface , giving maximum protection , might well use a 240mm lead roll in this situation but as a home improver we strongly suggest you go up a width to 300mm rather than take chances . You can make the chase 100mm up the wall instead of 75mm and have a little more overlap to the roof . <p> Lead can be chased into stonework <p> The next step is to cut the chase . Make sure you have a stone cutting disc on your disc cutter and you are wearing the best personal protection equipment you can get , The dust created cutting chases is crazy so do not cut more than you can see . <p> The chase should be cut as straight as possible to make putting the lead in a little easier and it should be cut in about 30 - 40mm deep . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall as , when the air is full of dust they are very easy to miss . <h> Cutting and Folding the Lead Flashing <p> On the ground , roll out your lead and , using a batten or other straight edge , fold the lip of the lead which will be going into the chase . If you do not have a lead dresser , use another piece of batten to make sure your lip fold is sharp . <p> Trying to feed the edge of a full width of lead rool into the chase will get you into all sorts of trouble so fold the lip on the ground , slide the lead up the roof , and feed the folded lip into the chase . <p> Folding lead flashing to fit into chase <p> Regardless of the length of the roof you need to protect , you should not attempt to work with a lead section any longer than 1.5m . <p> You can overlap the sections in the chase so make sure your chase is 10 - 12 mm wide when you cut it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need in order to be able to lap the lead and to ensure you can get some mortar or sealant in there afterwards rather than the chase be too tight to work in . <p> Remember , if the water gets into this chase and behind the lead , it is the devils own job to fix this leak . <h> Fixing the Lead into the Chase <p> Traditionally this has been done with what we call lead wedges . A strip of lead about 25mm wide is cut from roll , about 150mm long . <p> This strip is folded over on itself then bashed flat with a hammer . This lead wedge is then about 8mm thick . <p> It is pushed into the wall chase , over the top of the lead lip you have pushed in , and then it is bashed in hard with a timber chase wedge to trap the lead flashing lip in the chase . <p> Lead wedges can be used to hold flashing in place <p> Inside the chase the lead is gripped fast by the wedge shape as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using a chase wedge will secure lead wedges <h> Cutting the Lead <p> The easiest way to cut lead for flashing is to use a sheet lead knife with a hooked blade . You can of course use a normal hobby knife but you will have to keep changing the blade . <p> Use a sheet lead knife for best results cutting flashing <h> Using Flashing Fixing Clips <p> Moving out of the more traditional ways of fixing lead flashing into chases , you can now buy Lead Flashing Fixing clips which do exactly the same job as lead wedges , but in all honesty , probably do it a lot better . <p> The flashing clips are sprung loaded so as you push them into the chase , on top of the lead , the top and bottom of the clip grip hard . It then takes an enormous amount of expansion and contraction to shake these clips loose whereas wedges can become loose after a few years . <p> Lead Flashing clips for fixing flashing into chase <h> Sealing the Flashing into the Chase <p> When the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to seal the joint . It is absolutely imperative that this seal is perfect as water can be driven into the chase , get in behind the lead and ruin the work inside . <p> Cement mortar is not a good thing to use to fill the chase . It is inflexible and cracks easily . Also it does not bond well to the lead . If you wish to use mortar to fill the chase , please use a lime mortar which will move with the lead and is far less likely to crack . <p> Lead flashing sealed in to chase with lead flashing sealer to prevent water ingress <p> The best method of sealing this joint is with proprietary lead sealant . This comes in mastic tubes and is easily applied with a sealant gun . The sealant is totally waterproof , guaranteed for 25 years and is a neutral grey colour which should match most masonry joints <p> Before you apply the sealant , make sure you have brushed all the dust out of the joint <p> LeadMate sealant for sealing flashing chases <h> Lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead flashing is the piece of lead used to make the joint waterproof where the soil and vent pipe comes out of the roof . This type of flashing is called a lead slate . <p> Lead slates are either made completely of lead where the pipe upstand is soldered onto the main slate , or they are what is called quick slate , where a rubber circle is fitted into the centre of the main lead slate and this rubber is cut to allow the soil and vent pipe through . <p> vent pipes can be waterproofed with a lead quickslate <p> 100mm pipes can go through roofs protected by a lead slate <h> Flashing Tape <p> There are products available as an excellent cost effective alternative to traditional lead . They are most commonly known by the name Flashing Tap . They are also quite often less expensive than traditional lead but still retain the lead look and finish and they can also be easily used in a DIY situation . <p> These types of flashing tape can be purchased from most builders merchants and also the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instructions on your particular type of tape as a primer is often necessary to get the best possible adhesion to some surfaces . <p> Tape 's are ideal when used in a situation where weight could be an issue , for example , in between a house wall and porch that has a sheet plastic or glass roof . <p> The tape itself is also very easy to apply as unlike the traditional lead flashing mentioned above they usually feature adhesive on the rear side which forms the watertight bond between the two surfaces . <p> Generally supplied in sections , the tape is easy to use even on those awkward shapes , as you simply remove the backing tape as you apply , smoothing down with a dry cloth as you go . <p> Flashband flashing tape <p> In general , the brand Flashband is one of if not the most commonly used tape of this kind and we sell this in our onlline store as well as use it ourselves .

The information you need may be in the project below , if not , call them . <p> A damp proof course ( DPC ) is a physical barrier inserted into the fabric of a building to stop water passing from one place to another . This can be on a horizontal plane , stopping water rising up from the ground by being sucked up by the dry masonry above , or vertically to stop water passing from the outside of a building , though the masonry , to the inside . DPC 's have taken many forms through the ages and one of the earliest forms was to use a layer of slate in the construction . Slate is still used but the less expensive plastic version is now more widely used . <p> A horizontal DPC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunction with a damp proof membrane which stops water rising to any part of the ground floor from the ground .

It is not practical in most cases , to remove a course of stone to place a plastic , lead or slate DPC in the wall and new methods have been found of introducing a DPC where there is either none , or one that is broken in some way .

There is one brush with the kit but two would be an advantage . <p> Use a soft brush to apply primer to seal wall <p> The Everbuild tanking kits come in differing sizes , and the basic kit is big enough to waterproof an average shower cubicle of approximately 4.5 square meters . The larger kit covers 7.5 square metres . <h> Alternative to Tanking and Tiling <p> Another way to ensure your wetroom or shower room is completely watertight is by using Shower Panels . <p> Shower panels are usually uPVC panels which slot together into pre-formed channels which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be fixed to existing plastered walls , timber or steel studwork or stuck on top of existing tiled bathroom or shower room walls . A drawback to panels is that they can not be used on the floor . For further information regarding these panels see our project on decorative shower boards . <p> Shower boards can create waterproof walls in the bathroom <h> Preparing for Tanking <p> Tanking is just making a room water tight , like a water tank . This is usually created by applying material to the surface of the wall . You may also have heard of the term being used in building with a cellar or without a damp proof course ( DPC ) where injection DPC or tanking is carried out by injecting walls with chemicals to prevent water ingress from the ground . <p> In this instance we are going to coat the walls with a liquid rubber compound by simply painting it onto the walls . <h> Tanking Wetroom Walls <p> The walls will need to be sound and flat so remove any old tile , tile adhesive , flaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You should fill any holes and make sure that the filler has had sufficient time to dry before you proceed , because the same water resistant properties that prevent water getting into the walls will also prevent any filler or fresh plaster from drying out . <p> Fill all holes to get wall as flat as possible <p> The tanking system works on plasterboard walls , plastered walls , concrete and brick . <p> As all these surfaces are porous to some degree , they will first need to be sealed using a primer . <p> The primer comes in the kit and should be applied by brush and allowed to dry before the membrane can be applied . <p> One coat of primer should be sufficient to seal most surfaces . However if there is any doubt then you should apply a second coat to be certain that you do not have an area that is very porous which could cause the liquid membrane to dry out too rapidly and might then cause it fail later . <p> Everbuild tanking primer will seal the walls and floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least an hour between coats , and before moving onto the second stage , which is to apply waterproof tape to the joints in the room . This includes the vertical joints between the walls and the horizontal joints between the walls and the floor . <p> You will also have to prepare the joints between the walls to ensure water can not seep in between these areas . This is done using the self-adhesive tape mentioned above after the primer has dried . <p> When you are taping the walls you should always work from the bottom up . This means that where you have joints in the tape , each join overlaps the join below it . That way when water is running down the wall it will not get behind the tape where there are joins . <p> Tape all joints to allow movement when tanking <p> The waterproof tape is also included in the tanking kit , and it is self-adhesive and slightly flexible so that any slight movement in the wall will not cause the tanking system to crack and leak . <h> Tanking Wetroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the brunt of the water carrying duties , and so it needs to be sound and secure , because excessive movement and flexing could cause the tanking to split . <p> Solid floors are ideal , but boarded floors are acceptable providing they are properly prepared . <p> Rubber tanking membrane will allow walls and floors to stay flexible <p> If you have a timber floor you will need to tape the joints between the floorboards . This obviously helps to ensure the joints remain waterproof , but also allows for a degree of flexing and movement , without causing the membrane to crack . <p> If your floor is not stable you may need to lay hardboard down over your floorboards screwing it down firmly into the joists , to provide a solid foundation for your wetroom floor . <h> Waterproof Sheet <p> The third part of the system is a sheet or mat , which can be cut around the drain to make sure there are no leaks in this vulnerable area . Any other pipes coming in to the room should also have the sheeting cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the tape , and so allows a small amount of movement in the seal , keeping it watertight . <p> Once the area is primed , all the joints are sealed and the drain and pipes are surrounded by the fabric membrane the liquid tanking membrane can be applied . <p> Apply the rubber membrane to the wetroom walls <p> The liquid membrane is applied in two coats , the first is applied horizontally and the second is applied vertically . The liquid membrane needs to be allowed to dry for at least six hours between coats . <p> The liquid membrane should be 1 mm thick all around the wet room , and we are aiming for an even coat all the way around . <p> After twelve hours the room will be ready to tile , and once the tiles are on the wall we can be absolutely confident that the spray of water from the shower will not be able to go anywhere other than down the drain . <h> Waterproofing a Wet Room or Bathroom - a Step by Step Guide <p> Make sure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should remove any old tile adhesive or flaking material such as loose paint or flaking plaster , as this will not provide a good base for the sealant or the new tiles .

Work along the room from the floor to the ceiling and make sure you are working methodically around the room so that you get an even coverage <p> Allow the primer to dry for at least six hours <p> Apply a second coat of primer working horizontally across the walls , again making sure you cover the whole area and work from the bottom of the wall to the top <p> Use the self-adhesive tape to seal any joints between materials including floorboards , walls and floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the drain , by cutting a hole the correct diameter for the drainage pipe and sticking it down firmly all the way around <p> Use the roller , supplied with the kit , to make sure the tape is stuck securely , and there are no air bubbles in the seal between the membrane and the floor <p> You should do the same for any other pipes coming though the floor or the walls <p> Seal the joint between the walls and the floor making sure the tape is pressed right into the joins and corners . This will not only ensure a waterproof joint but will also allow for a small degree of movement between the materials , without the tanking splitting and leaking <p> Again use the roller to ensure the tape is firmly stuck <p> You should preferably apply the liquid rubber membrane to the floor first .

@@41624979 @1624979/ <p> Summary : This DIY guide provides a summary and rundown of the regulations stated in Approved Document F which covers ventilation within buildings . It states that adequate ventilation needs to be provided to prevent excess condensation buildup that could cause rot and decay in timbers and also provide a building with a decent air flow to prevent stale air . It also states that ventilation needs to be controlled so that it does not have an adverse effect on the energy performance of the building . <p> Approved Document F of the Building Regulations deals with the ventilation in and around a property . If you have browsed through Approved Document L then you will be aware that this document is in place to ensure that buildings are as energy efficient as possible that includes essentially insulating and sealing a building against draughts . <p> Document F may seem like a bit of a contradiction to Document L - first you seal a building up and then you are told that you must ventilate it ! In actuality both documents are concerned with controlling ventilation - Document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency and Document F to ensure there is air circulation in a building etc .... <p> As with other Approved Documents there are set rules for both dwelling and non-dwelling buildings due to the nature of their use . <h> F1 - Ventilation within a Building <p> The requirements of point F1 of Document F state that there should be adequate and suitable ventilation provided for a property and the people within it and point F2 states that where mechanical ventilation is used it should be first commissioned through a testing process where it is adjusted via controls to ensure that point F1 is met . <p> Where mechanical ventilation is present and testing is required the following points should be adhered to : <p> Whoever installs a mechanical ventilation system should provide the owner with full operating and maintenance instructions so the system can run at the required levels <p> Where applicable , a new system needs to be fully tested in line with the guidelines stated by the Secretary of State <p> All test results should then be submitted to the relevant local authority <p> All data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Secretary of State <p> Test results should be supplied to the local authority not more than five days after the final test is completed . Where the regulations do not apply , the local authority should be notified no more than 30 days after works are completed <p> It should be noted that these regulations do apply where paragraph F1(2) states but they do not apply to the extension of any fixed ventilation system or manner of control where adjustment to the system as a whole can not be made . <p> In terms of Approved Document L , where paragraph L1(b) is relevant , the regulations apply to any and all building works but these rules do not apply where any fixed services are to be extended and testing or adjustments can not be made or where improvements to energy efficiency of the service can not be improved . <h> Ventilation within Dwellings <p> Where the regulations stated above apply to a dwelling , in most cases there are three different types that are needed : <p> Whole of building ventilation <p> Extract ventilation <p> Purge ventilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensures that air within a building space in continually changed . This type of system itself can also be reduced ( turned down ) and even turned off if the building is not in use ( e.g. an air conditioning system ) . <p> Extract Ventilation <p> This type of system is normally put into use in areas of high humidity or pollution and is used to draw the whatever is required from the air space within a room . An example of this type of system would be an extractor fan within a bathroom used to reduce the amount of moisture in the air and help to reduce condensation . <p> Purge Ventilation <p> The third type of system is the purge system . This is also used to remove items from the air within a room or building . With this system type there does not necessarily need to be a complicated series of fans and vents , it is as simple as opening a window or a door ! <p> Depending on the nature of the room and what will need to be extracted from the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be installed . <h> Ventilation in Non-Dwelling Buildings <p> In pretty much all cases , regardless of the usage of the building , you will need to pay attention to the following : <p> Air that is continuously circulated via air conditioning or other mechanical ventilation systems <p> The potential for Legionnaire 's disease <p> Ensuring that the system can be easily repaired and maintained <h> Offices and Places of Work <p> The regulations that cover offices and places of work also cover areas such as leisure centres , commercial kitchen etc .... Rooms that are found within office buildings and complexes such as store cupboards , changing and wash-rooms and toilets etc .... also fall under these defined regulations . <p> In essence , due to the presence of people within them , these types of structures require similar levels of ventilation largely for the same reasons .

It should be ensured that any new windows comply with rules set out in Approved Documents L and N. <p> The above is a brief rundown of what is covered and stated in Approved Document F and as with all other Approved Documents you should ensure that you are referencing the most current and up-to-date regulations before commencing and building work .

Also includes information on ventilation issues after sealing . This project covers the specialits issues relevant to stopping draughts from sash windows and the best products to use . <p> A sash window can provide a home with a real touch of character but like many areas of your home they do require maintenance . Common issues if this is ignored can include wet rot , cracked putty , failure of joints , rattling or sticking and draughts . <p> A poorly maintained sash window can cause draughts within a room space that can be the equivalent to a small open window , making your living space uncomfortable to be in and also wasting you money on your heating bills and impacting on the environment . <p> Sealing a sash window to stop draughts is difficult . With the window halves sliding up and down , they tend to rip off any glued-on window seals . The gaps are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that sometimes several layers of traditional sticky seals are applied leading to even bigger problems with peeling . <p> It is also almost impossible to seal the space between the two window halves . It is certainly impossible if you do not want to show the seal when the window is opened in the summer . <p> In essence when it comes to draught proofing a sash window and any form of draught proofing for that matter , the name of the game is to bring the ventilation of a room back under your control and not at the mercy of gaps and draughts . <h> Beads , Weather Strips and Draught Excluders for Sash Windows <p> There are literally hundreds of beads , weather strips and draught excluders on the market today and they come in a great array of styles , designs , materials and applications including compressions strips ( usually made from a foam-type substance or springy plastic material ) such as those available from Draftfix.co.uk , bristle strips ( usually featuring a bristle similar to a brush ) and some even in a weather proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash windows <p> Some are designed for general draught proofing and can be used on sash windows while others have been designed specifically for sash windows such as those available from Exiseal.co.uk . <p> Easiseal beads for draught proofing sash windows <p> As you might imagine they all have varying degrees of success , some better than others but in most cases they inherently suffer from the same problems - if they are glued or stuck in place then they will eventually come loose and peel off and if they are nail or screw fixed then they will either damage the sash frame itself or look unsightly . <p> In light of this we do not recommend any specific makes or brands and if you are tempted to go down this route for sealing your sash windows then it is very much " trial and error " . <p> One product we have seen that is quite good is the sash window seal Gapseal .

The sealant is pushed into the gaps around the window with a handy applicator . The sealant stretches so that small gaps can also be successfully filled . Once inserted , the magnolia coloured seals are invisible to the eye . The seal will always try to expand to its original size , making it fill any gaps created through expansion or contraction of the wooden frames . <p> Fit sealer between sash window sections <h> Secondary Glazing <p> It is often through by many that fitting secondary glazing will completely ruin the aesthetic pleasure of a sash window and in the past this was true . Secondary glazing units tended to be bulky , ugly and difficult to use and live with but today there are quite a few specialist companies around that supply bespoke secondary glazing units that are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobtrusive as possible . <p> This is all very well but what are secondary glazing units I hear you ask ! Well on a basic level its a window inside a window . <p> A secondary window is fitted behind your existing sash window , as near or far to the existing window as you require . This secondary window , once closed , then seals the existing sash window in front of it preventing any draughts from passing into your room space . <p> Secondary glazing unit fitted to double glazed windows <p> They come in a variety of different designs that include upward and downward slide opening , inward opening and they can even be removable enabling you to fit them in the winter when you will be less likely to want to open them and then remove them in the summer when it 's warmer . They can also be purchased as glass or light weight perspex . <p> Aside from the draught proofing and cutting heating costs benefit , they also come with quite a few additional ones that include a reduction in condensation and noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Additional Insulation from Hanging Thick Curtains <p> Although this may sound silly , a heavy , thick set of curtains can go a long way in reducing draughts and heat loss from a room space . Although they will help hold heat in a room and prevent it for the most part from escaping through any gaps they will not block any gaps at their source e.g. the sash window itself so cold air will still pass in . <h> Ventilation Issues After Sealing Draughts <p> Ventilation is a necessity in any room as without it humidity can increase causing condensation and eventually mould growth . If you are too effective with your draught proofing and seal a room up to a level where there is no longer any ventilation then it is likely that you will eventually experience the afore mentioned mould and damp issues . <p> There are also building regulations that state a minimum background ventilation for a given room space and in most cases , fairly new sash windows will comply to this regulation but by their very nature , the opening and closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the initial ventilation provided by will increase and this is where the above draught proofing techniques come into play . <p> On this note there is also one other point to remember when undertaking any kind of sealing or draught proofing in a room - if you have any kind of gas appliance in the room or in your home e.g. gas cooker , gas fire , gas boiler then these appliances need a consistent supply of fresh air in order to burn safely . If they do not have this then they will not operate correctly and will produce a build up of carbon monoxide which can be fatal ! 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

We show you how to hang a mirror or heavy picture , including methods of hanging mirrors and heavy pictures with mirror hanging brackets and fixings , so that you can ensure that they are securely fixed to your wall . We also cover concealed picture hanging . <p> There are various methods of hanging mirrors on a wall , if you are buying a mirror from a glass merchants cut to your specific size , a neat way of fixing is to have holes drilled through the glass and to utilise mirror screws . These are widely available from various outlets such as hardware stores and DIY centres . They are typically sold in packs of four . They employ a screw which is tapped in the centre to allow a domed cap to be screwed in after fixing . <p> If you enjoy a challenge and are brave enough , you could drill these holes yourself . The method is to use a ring of putty surrounding where you intend the hole to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which looks like a speared tip . <p> The notion is to fill the putty ring with a light oil to cut down on glass breakout and to cool the bit , whilst drilling . The initial stage after marking , is to lay the mirror onto a flat surface , ensuring it is well supported . Clamp the mirror in place with some form of cushioning , to avoid cracking the glass . <p> Felt pads , self adhesive foam pads or cardboard can be used for this , as long as the glass is prevented from moving . With a hardened nail or tile scoring bit or even a glass cutter , slowly etch your mark on top the glass surface , making a small indentation where the drilling is to take place . <p> Put the point of your tile drill bit in the indentation and drill slowly . Allow the tool to do its cutting and do not force it . Glass/tile drills come in various sizes , but 6mm is the optimum size for standard mirror screws , which are number 8 gauge ( 4mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can treat it as if it is a picture and use string or wire running between screw eyes at the back - see our project on How to Hang Pictures . <p> Another method for a timber framed mirror , for a more secure fixing , flush to the wall , is to utilise mirror plates . These are typically metal electro-brassed with a key hole type of slot . At least two will be required fixed to the frame at the back at the top . Depending on size and weight , it may be best to use four , one at each corner , then four screws in the appropriate positions to be fixed to the wall . The mirror is then hooked on to these four screws . Accuracy is important , to ensure a firm fixing and a plumb mirror . <p> With metal framed mirrors or mirrors without any frame , the manufacturer will usually supply some form of mounting kit . This takes the form of four J shaped brackets , which are attached to the wall and then clip down onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clips supplied are made of plastic and may break . <p> A far better solution is to purchase a mirror fixing kit that is hidden behind the actual mirror itself .

The top brackets are spring tensioned for easy installation and this kit can also be used for signs and panels . <h> Hanging a large and heavy mirror to a dry lined or plasterboard stud wall <p> The modern method of dry lining interior walls using the dot and dab method , and internal stud partition walls with 12mm ( half inch ) plasterboard present a problem when trying to hang large mirrors in the exact position required , because behind the plasterboard there is a void . <p> There are a couple of fixing options available , the first is commonly known as a Redidriva ( see picture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large coarse screw , which can be in plastic or metal with an attached centre screw , which is used to drive in the coarse female part of the fixing .

This method will provide a very secure fixing in a plasterboard or hollow wall , but unfortunately requires a special setting tool , which is a little expensive if you are not a frequent user . <p> The centre machine screw of this type of fixing is available in various lengths , following the manufacturer 's instructions , the method is to drill the appropriate sized hole , where required , push in the anchor , use the setting tool which grips around the head of the centre machine screw and with pressure applied , squashes the anchor behind the plasterboard . <p> The centre machine screw can then be withdrawn to be used again as the fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line or wire for the mirror or picture or could be used in conjunction with mirror plates if required . <h> Large pictures <p> Large pictures can be treated in the same way as mirrors ; if they have wooden frames , mirror plates can be very effective .

Alternatively many canvas prints which are purely canvas stretched over a wooden frame come supplied with a keyhole fixing already embedded in the top horisontal part of the frame . <p> This can also be a triangular plastic piece , with a keyhole cut out of it . To mount the canvas using these fixings , fix a screw into the wall , leaving 12mm ( half an inch ) sticking out and hook the canvas directly on to this . <p> Some houses still have picture rails and there are proprietary picture hooks which rest on the rail .

The joint will sand down and look very similar to the board surface but because of the PVA content , will not stain in the same way . <h> Wooden Strips <p> This will need to be done before you sand your floor ! <p> This method , although a little tricky and time consuming is probably the best and if done with care can give an amazing finish . <p> What you have to do is cut strips of wood ever so slightly larger than the width of the gap between each of the floorboards and the same depth and then apply some glue ( wood glue or similar ) to each of the insides of the boards . <p> Now using a soft mallet , hit the strip of wood down into the gap to create a air and dust tight seal . <p> Continue this process for the whole of your floor until all of the gaps have been filled and then leave for an hour or so for all of the glue to dry . <p> Once the glue has dried you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots that may be left due to any wooden strips sticking above floorboard level leaving you with a smooth and gap free floor . <p> As you may have guessed , how well the joints blend in with the rest of your floor will depend on the colour and shade of the wood that you use . If you have dark floorboards and use a light wood for the strips then they will stand out even if you stain the boards and the joints afterwards so this is something to be aware of , but if done carefully can give a fantastic effect . <p> Wooden strip knocked down between floorboards <h> Flooring Filler or Decorators Caulk <p> Another method is to fill the gap with either flooring filler , which comes in a light tan finish and will blend in quite well with the lighter stains and varnishes , or you can use decorators caulk to fill the gap . Decorators caulk does accept stain and it will darken down from its original colour when stain/varnish is applied . <p> The above two types of filler also have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little with the floor and do not over emphasize any further movement . They can also be applied to boards with no tongues or grooves as you apply the sealant to the edge of the board and build it up until it fills the gap . <p> Although these options do have the advantage of being quite flexible , over time they will in most cases separate from the edge of the boards and eventually fall through the gap . <p> Once your floorboards have been sanded and finished with your chosen varnish or lacquer , you should allow the floorboards to completely dry and for the finish to reach maximum hardness , which is typically 48 hours . Once dried , you can fill the gaps with DraughtEx with minimum effort and with no need to sand and finish them again . <p> Simply select the required thickness and using a credit card , blunt knife or similar tool push the Draughtex down into the gap ensuring that the full width of the gap has been filled and then trim any ends as required . <p> Stopgap works on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squidgy sausage it comes in the form of a thin " V " shape , fairly springy plastic . Application is very similar to the above in that you push it down into the gap using a credit card or blunt knife . <p> Due to it 's springy nature and " V " shape it will naturally spring outwards and fill the entire width of the gap and hold itself in place . It only comes in one size which makes things quite a bit simpler also . The only trimming that 's required is cutting it to length . <p> Stopgap floorboard gap filler <p> An additional advantage of Stopgap is that once it has been fitted the natural shadow of the gap itself will make it almost invisible to the eye ensuring that the natural finish of your floor is not in any way compromised . <p> We have heard many other suggestions for filling floorboard gaps and have tried most of them .

This projects shows how to fit a TV bracket , specifically a mantel bracket on a wall to allow it to be manoeuvred into a position where it can be watched at a comfortable height . You will need a specific type of bracket for this particular operation but the principle of fixing TV brackets is the same . We show you how to fix a wall mount bracket for large televisions screens to the wall . Learn how to attach a large LED , LCD or Plasma screens to the wall securely . This project covers 40 inch to 50 inch televisions , using pictures to explain each step to getting your large screen fixed to the wall . <h> Why use a TV Bracket ? <p> TV Brackets are designed to fix a TV to the wall rather than use a surface to place the TV on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Most TV brackets however , in order to save the maximum amount of space , are fitted quite high up on the wall which can make viewing quite uncomfortable . <p> Modern flat screen digital televisions all have the facility for wall bracket fixing . Essentially , the larger the television , the larger the wall bracket . <p> TV brackets . The larger the TV , the larger the bracket <p> Brackets come as fixed , twist and turn or twist , tilt and turn . For televisions over 40 inches the bracket is fairly heavy duty and therefore requires some heavy duty fixings . <p> The best of these is the twist , tilt and turn bracket as it allows for viewing from almost every angle and at a height conducive to comfortable viewing . The best of these that we have found to date is the Mantel Bracket from Tranquil Mount . <p> The hooks on a TV bracket <p> Almost every TV comes with the side brackets which actually fix to the television . These brackets have hooks in the top which , when fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV mounting bracket . Today 's TVs are made with the screw holes in place to receive these side brackets . <p> This is called being VESA compliant ( more later ) but as there are many different types we have not shown this in full here as it may confuse . <p> Suffice to say that , when the side brackets are fixed to the television , the TV then slots onto the main wall bracket as you can see from the video . <p> Tilt , twist and turn TV brackets are the most adaptive of all TV brackets <h> What is VESA Compliant ? <p> VESA , or Video Electronics Standards Association is an association which sets Industry rules for the standardisation of ( for one thing ) the spacing of mounting holes in the back of a TV set to which wall brackets are fixed for TV mounts . <p> The most common spacings are : <p> 800 x 400 <p> 600 x 400 <p> 400 x 400 <p> 400 x 200 <p> 300 x 300 <p> 200 x 200 <p> 100 x 100 <p> 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , both vertically and horizontally , between the screw holes in the back of the TV . This allows TV mount manufacturers to make the TV bracket mounting bars with fixing holes in the right place . <p> TV mounting brackets should be VESA complaint <h> What is a Mantel Bracket ? <p> The dictionary definition of a mantel is any stone shelf , but it has primarily come to mean a shelf over a fire of a description and is usually referred to as a mantelpiece or mantlepiece . Both spellings can be used . <p> A mantel bracket is a bracket which is designed to fit over the mantelpiece , or shelf , without disturbing any item placed on the actual shelf . <h> Setting out the TV Mounting Bracket on the Wall <p> Measure the height you would like the TV bracket to be fixed . Check the manufacturers instructions as to the height which will correspond to the top and bottom of the TV compared to the various parts of the bracket . <p> It is very disappointing , especially with a twist , tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise the TV ends up not in the right place or at the right height . <p> The TV bracket must be at the correct height for the TV when it is fitted <p> Mark the centreline of your TV bracket on the wall you are to hang it on . This line is useful if you want your TV in the dead centre of the wall and also , even if it is going in any position on the wall it is very useful as a double check that your TV mounting bracket is absolutely upright . <p> TV brackets can be checked for upright by marking their centre line <h> Drilling Holes for the TV Bracket Bolts <p> To hang our bracket we have used 70mm long wall bolts with the associated wall plugs . The holes needed were 10 mm diameter but it is unwise to try to drill this size hole without first drilling a smaller pilot hole . <p> Fixing a TV bracket usually requires 70mm coach bolts in 10mm holes <h> Drilling to the Correct Depth <p> Place the coach bolt alongside your drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can repeat the same depth of hole every time . <p> Use a depth gauge when drilling repeated holes in masonry <h> Make Sure Your TV Bracket is Level <p> As you can see the bracket has slots , rather than holes , for the fixings . This gives you plenty of play from side to side but the really important thing is to get the bracket level . <p> You will notice from the image and the video that there is a very small level placed on top of the bracket while marking the holes . <p> It is very important that the bracket is level as even if it is a couple of mm out of level it will be magnified by the size of the TV when it is hung . The bracket might only be a few mm out but the TV will then be 20 or 30mm out of level and look awful . <p> Make sure the bracket is level when you drill fixing holes <p> The more expensive brackets have a built in bubble , or the manufacturer supplies a mini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracket to the wall but always double check with a spirit level . <p> Drill the holes for the TV- bracket making sure the drill is level . If the holes go in out of level , the screws may not line up properly when you attempt to put them in . <p> Drill all holes with the drill in a level position <h> Fixing the TV Bracket to the Wall <p> When the holes are drilled , the wall plugs pushed in and the bolts are in place you are ready to tighten up on them using a suitable sized socket . The images below show you the next steps . <p> Using a box spanner or socket to tighten bolts <h> Fixing the Hanging Rail Brackets to the TV <p> Position the hook brackets on the back of the TV and line the holes in the brackets up with the screw holes in the back of the TV . Make sure the bottom of each bracket is the same distance from the bottom of the TV and the hooks are at the top . <p> The hook bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Hang Your TV on the Wall Bracket <p> The TV is then lowered down on its hooks , onto the wall crossbar and a guide screw is tightened to stop the TV from accidentally being knocked off . <p> The top and bottom runners have stops on them to stop the TV sliding off the end . <p> Once the TV is in position on the bracket it can be slid to one side or the other and the bracket will allow you to face the TV at any number of angles . <p> When the TV is fairly high on the wall you may need to adjust the swivels at the side to get the TV to face angle down a little . <p> TV wall brackets are designed to have the TV hook brackets placed over them <p> Once the TV is hanging properly on the wall brackets it can be swivelled into position whenever and wherever you want . <p> The Tranquil Mount TV bracket , called the mantel mount is the one we have shown you in the images in this project and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit as this one and they are certainly not as strong or versatile . <p> Make sure you have the right TV bracket for the use you want to put your TV to , the height you want to view it from and the position in the room you will spend most time watching it from . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624991 @1624991/ <h> How to Fix a Curtain Pole Correctly to a Wall Above a Window or Door and Make Sure it 's Level <p> Summary : In this DIY how to guide with video tutorial , we show you how to fit and fix a curtain pole above your window or door in order to hang curtains to the correct depth and width of the size of reveal you have . This method can also be used for fitting or fixing curtain rails , tracks and runners . We will also tell you about how to fix to masonry surfaces and what fixings can be used and also how to fix into the steel and concrete lintels found above windows and doors . We also take a look at the different types of curtain headings , finials , poles and brackets available and why you should decide on the exact type and style you are going for before you begin hanging them . <p> Curtain poles offer a little more variety and style choice in the way you hang your curtains than using a basic curtain rail or curtain track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip your curtain to the track itself but with a pole you can do so much more . <h> Types of Curtain Pole , Finials , Brackets and Headings <p> Starting with the pole itself - these are available in huge range of styles , from traditional timber , brass or pewter looking poles to the more modern coloured or stainless steel poles , you are certainly not short on choice and are also pretty much guaranteed to find something to match your existing furnishings or to complement your new chosen look . <p> Modern contemporary chrome curtain pole <p> In almost all cases you will get the finials to match your pole when you purchase , but it is possible for you to also buy these separately , allowing you to " mix and match " styles slightly . You may be asking yourself ; what are finials ? well , these are the items that fix to the ends of the poles and provide a nice feature rather than just a view of the end of the pole . <p> Again , they are available in a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timber , steel , brass etc .... , to either match or contrast your chosen type of pole . In terms of fitting , normally they are screwed on to the pole using a screw ( only with timber finials and poles ) or screwed on to thread actually cut into the end of the pole ( normally for steel , plastic , brass etc .... ) . <p> Wrought iron curtain pole finial <p> When it comes to the actual curtain pole hanger ( the part that holds the pole on the wall ) , these also come in a wide and varied selection of different styles , fixings and materials . The type of pole that you choose can in some cases determine the fixings or brackets that you will need to use , but the correct ones for your poles should be included when you purchase them . <p> Common steel curtain pole fixing bracket <p> One final interior design point to cover is that of curtain headings . This is the top section of the curtain that fixes to the pole and holds the curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few different ways by either using curtain hooks that clip on to rings that run on the pole or the pole itself is threaded through the actual curtain . <p> Coming back to the headings , these can really make or break the look you are going for and can also determine what poles , hangers and fixings you use so this is definitely worth spending some time on . Some of the common finishes are as follows : <p> Pencil Pleat <p> Pencil pleats are made by sewing in a cord to the top hem of the curtain and pulling it really tight to bunch up the heading of the curtain , This type of finish is very traditional and looks great on a curtain pole . <p> Pencil pleat curtain heading - Image courtesy of John Lewis <p> There are many different styles that can be created by bunching pleats into two 's or three 's . As you would expect these pleats are called double pleats and triple pleats . This technique is based on the pencil pleat method . <p> Cottage Pleats <p> Cottage pleats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of inches down from the top of the curtains . This gives a type of rural " informal " look which is ideal for a lovely cottagey feel . <p> Goblet headings are quite a formal arrangement which look great in a formal dining , drawing or sitting room . Goblet headings require each curtain pole ring to be set in the centre of each goblet and that the top of the curtain sits below the pole . If it does not the pole forces the top of the curtain heading to push out a little and while this is fine for the pleated headings , it does not work for the goblet . <p> Goblet headings are a formal way of fitting curtains to a pole - Image courtesy drapes.co.uk <p> Eyelet Headings <p> Eyelet headings can only really be fitted to a curtain pole and when doing so , unlike many other headings they make the pole itself a feature of the window . <p> Eyelet headings on curtains specifically for curtain poles to be threaded straight through <p> Another curtain heading designed specifically for a curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from the same material as the curtain or , for a really contemporary feel , made from a different material . <p> Tab style headings on curtains also allow the pole to be threaded straight through - Image courtesy of **30;390;TOOLONG <p> As mentioned , it 's well worth the time considering what type and style of curtains , poles , finials and fixings you want to use and these choices will determine how and where your curtain pole brackets are fixed e.g. above the window , to either side of the window or within the windows recess . <h> How to Fit or Fix Curtain Poles to a Window <p> There are quite a few different ways in which you can fix your curtain pole to the wall and the method you use will very much depend on the material you are fixing to e.g. bricks or blocks , plaster board etc .... <p> With this in mind , we have different projects covering these different methods so please see the list below and click on the link for the type of material you are fixing to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you measure and mark the fixing positions , make sure all is level , drill our your holes , fix the brackets to the wall , install you curtain pole and curtains , but depending on the material your fixing to will depend on whether you use rawl plugs , plasterboard fixings etc .... : <p> You may also want to see our different type of fixings project page for more information of the various types of fixings there are . No two houses are constructed the same way and you may find that you have large gaps between wall coverings and the actual wall behind it , so specialist fixings will be needed . <h> Tools you will need for fitting a curtain poles <p> We have put a bundle of tools together for you for fitting a curtain pole ( and many other carpentry jobs around the home . Just click on the link to the curtain poles bundle or on the image and you will be taken to our toolstore where you can choose the specific tools you would like from the bundle . <h> How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - Check the Ceiling and Window Head for Level <p> Check your ceiling and window head are either level , or parallel with each other . If they are out of level it is often better to put the curtain pole up so it follows the line of the ceiling rather than put the pole in level . <p> Unless the curtains are likely to slide down the pole on their own due to the fact that they ceiling is way out of level , it is better to get the pole and curtains looking visually correct rather than being 100% level . The ceiling only has to be slightly out of level for this to show very clearly . <p> Checking if a ceiling is level <p> Step 2 : - Measure to Find Centre of Window <p> To ensure your curtain pole has the same overlap either side of the window it is important to mark the centre of the window . Measure the full width of the window , divide by two and mark the centre with a pencil . It 's always a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spot on . <p> Measuring the centre of a window opening <p> Step 3 : Measure the Height you Want the Curtain Pole Brackets <p> When hanging curtains on a curtain pole , there should never be too much curtain sticking out over the top of the pole so measure where you want the top of the curtains to finish and then mark the position of the brackets from that . <p> Getting curtain brackets at the correct height <p> Step 4 : Measure Your Curtain Pole Overhang <p> Put a small piece of insulation tape ( watch the video below ) on the centre of your curtain pole and hold it up to the mark you have put on the wall in the centre of the window . Check you have enough overhang on each side of the window for the curtains ( when they are open ) not to take up too much of the window opening and block too much light in the day time . <p> Making sure your curtain pole is the right length <p> Step 5 : - Mark the Position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in step 3 , mark the position of your brackets . 1 bracket goes in the dead centre of the window and the others at either side at a distance beyond the window suggested in the preceding step . If your curtain pole has finials that slide on to the end of the pole , remember this when marking out for the brackets . <p> Fitting a curtain pole bracket <p> Step 6 : - Drill or Make Holes for the Curtain Pole Brackets <p> Depending on the type of wall you are drilling into you will need to follow all the links to the relevant pages above . The important thing here is that the brackets are fixed securely to the walls as curtains can be very heavy . In terms of the size of hole you need to drill , this should be around 6mm so use a 6mm masonry drill bit . <p> Drill a hole in your wall ready for bracket fixing <p> Step 7 : Fix the Curtain Pole Brackets into Position <p> When the holes have been made , screw the brackets into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixings page ) which are not to long and hit the lintel or wall as you are screwing in . This has the potential of not allowing the screw to be fully tightened and the bracket will then be loose . Also , make sure that you use the correct wall plug for teh size of hole you have drilled . The red wall plugs should fit tightly in a 6mm hole . <p> Screwing the pole bracket to the wall <p> Step 8 : Place the Curtain Rings on the Pole <p> Place all rings , except 2 , on the pole . Divide them equally left and right of centre and holding the pole and rings in each hand , offer up to and place in the brackets . <p> Curtain rings ready for placing on pole <p> Step 9 : - Positioning the Curtain Pole in the Brackets <p> Place the curtain pole in the centre of the brackets using the insulation tape as a guide for the centre bracket . Double check that the overhang at each end is the same and you are happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pole and tighten up the bracket screws . <p> Curtain pole rings either side of centre bracket <p> Step 10 : Add the End Ring and Finial to the Curtain Pole <p> Slide the last rings onto each end of the curtain pole or if you are using curtains with eyelet headings , thread the pole through and then fix the finials to either end. - For those needing a definition of the word finial ( also see above ) , it is an ornamental terminating part . <p> Finials are used on roofs , fences , curtain poles , fireplaces and even tent poles . They date back thousands of years and all mark the completion of a " project " by attracting attention to it 's end- ( or final point . <p> The finial adds the final touch to a curtain pole <p> Step 11 : Finally Hang Your Curtains ! <p> Once you have completed all of the above , the final task is to actually hang your curtains on the rings . As mentioned previously , this will most likely be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip each one to a ring . Once this is done , you are now done ! <p> Curtains hung on a curtain pole 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

The Multi-Purpose Cleaner takes the best bits of all of the Eco Solutions , solvent free product range and puts them all into one container to make pretty much every cleaning job around the home much easier . <h> On Site Test of the Multi Purpose Cleaner <p> We gave a spray container to a cleaning company who were cleaning up a ground floor refurbishment project we had been working on . Their first comment was how sweet is smelled ! There are no toxic gases or solvent smells . We also asked them to test it without wearing their stock-in-trade rubber gloves to test the claims of Eco Solutions that this product is not harmful to skin in any way . <p> Please do not try this at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , Multi Purpose Cleaner is not harmful to your skin . <p> The claims made by Eco Solutions of the Multi Purpose Cleaner include cleaning stains and removing ink . These problems were not evident in the building work we had undertaken so we asked our cleaners to pop upstairs where the owners of the property were only too pleased to have some free work done ! <p> One multi purpose spray-on cleaner for many problems <h> Cleaning Dried Paint Splashes <p> They started on some dried paint splashes on a couple of panes of glass and on a small melamine worktop . A couple of quick sprays of the cleaner were left for 20 minutes before being wiped off very easily with a damp cloth . One of the paint splashes was quite thick and needed a " second coat " of Multi Purpose Cleaner but 20 minutes later that was gone also ...... Result 10 out of 10 . <h> Cleaning Stains <p> This was a little beyond the remit of our refurb cleaners but they duly found a little dirt stain on the stair carpet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed into the carpet and washed out with a wet cloth removed most of the stain in one go . 2 more tries , in the same way , removed the stain altogether . The owners were very impressed ! ....... Result 10 out of 10 . <h> Cleaning Glue Residue <p> We use construction adhesives such as Everbuild 's Clearfix so this was never going to be an easy task but the Multi Purpose Cleaner took to it manfully . We are always very careful when applying adhesives like this so there was no actual evidence of it having been used . We therefore applied a little smear to a worktop to test the cleaner and it immediately worked it 's magic . It did take a little longer than suggested on the tub and it also took a little more elbow grease but it did shift the dried adhesive residue eventually ........ Result 8 out of 10 . <h> Cleaning Ink <p> Not so much ink around on a building site these days so once again we sent our cleaners upstairs where they asked the youngsters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom corner of a wall .... We promised the owners that we would redecorate the room if the Multi Purpose Cleaner did not work . Thankfully it did ! The spray was left for a minute as directed , then a short scrub with a damp cloth lifted the ink right off the surface , excellent ................ Result , 10 out of 10 . <h> Super Degreaser <p> This test was done on an old oven that we had been instructed to replace . The results were almost the same as those achieved by Eco Solutions Super Strength Degreaser which can be seen here . The cleaners were amazed at how something without the pungent smell of solvents associated with most cleaning products could clean such a filthy object so well .......... Result 8 out of 10 - The only reason this product did not get 10 out of 10 is because Eco Solutions have a Super Strength Degreaser which is a bit stronger . <h> Graffiti Cleaner <p> To test the graffiti removing abilities of the Multi Purpose Cleaner we painted a left-over brick with some gloss paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving each spray on the brick for an hour and a half over the course of the day , but by the end of the day the paint was gone ......... Result 10 out of 10 <h> Benefits of using the Multi Purpose Cleaner <p> Completely solvent free <p> Will not harm your skin <p> Non toxic <p> Cleans everything from walls to tools <p> Smooth Spray action <p> Works in minutes <h> Doc 's Opinion of the Multi Purpose Cleaner <p> The results above really speak for themselves . We now all carry a spray tube of Multi Surface cleaner in our vans and would not go onto a job without it . Even if it is only used for getting the glued on labels that manufacturers insist on putting onto toilet pans and bath panels , it 's worth the money ! 
@@41624997 @1624997/ <p> Painting a garage door is not a simple operation . Most garage doors these days come ready primed so if you are painting a new door it will be a matter of applying ( preferably ) a proprietary garage door paint to the primer with however many coats are recommended on the tin . If however , the door is unprimed and , as most of them are galvanised to stop rust , the procedure is slightly different . <p> Just like trying to paint ceramic tiles , normal paint will not stay on galvanised metal for very long at all . If you try , it will look good for about 4 days before it starts peeling of in huge flakes . <p> Degrease the door with sugar soap then allow to dry . Apply a metal primer before applying your garage door paint . If you are over coating a previously painted garage door then a light sanding is required along with the same degreasing process . When painting metal it is really important that any loose paint is really well rubbed down and if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then this metal must be primed . It is never a good idea to put a top coat straight on top of the old top coat so use a suitable undercoat first . Remember the better the job is prepared , the better it will look and there is nothing quite as scruffy as a peeling , faded garage door . Many companies make a metal primer and undercoat mixed <p> Metal garage doors can be painted by brush or by roller but if using a roller remember to buy one with natural fibres rather than a man made material . After rolling , for a top class finish , run over the paint with a good quality , dry brush . This will " polish " any roller marks out and give you a lovely shiny finish . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

This is achieved by using two small compression couplers either side of the new section . <h> Compression Joints <p> Compression coupling <p> A compression joint , as mentioned above , is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " olive " against the copper pipe , by a nut tightening onto a thread . The openings on compression fittings are made to accept the pipe , and a small amount of the olive , which is accommodated in a small bevel machined into the fitting . The nut is then tightened , while the fitting itself is held fast with another spanner . The olive is compressed , forming a water tight seal between the pipe and fitting . Care must be taken not to overtighten these fittings as it can lead to squashing the pipe slightly causing the joint to leak . No amount of tightening , should that occur , will remedy the situation . <p> Compression coupler <h> Push Fit Repair <p> The easiest way to effect a repair in a leaking pipe is with a push fit system . Simply cut out the burst or damaged area of the pipe , as described above , and push on this purpose made repair pipe at both ends . The collars at each end of the push fit flexi hose will seal over the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very quick and easy fix . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41624999 @1624999/ <h> Why do Radiators Need Balancing ? <p> Some radiators occationally get quite a bit warmer than others . When this happens it usually means that your central heating system is out of balance . <p> In some instances , radiators can be different temperatures due to the distance that water that heats them has to travel from the boiler or pump . If your heating system is not balanced then the radiators that are closest to the boiler or heating source may get a lot more heat than those that are further away . <p> To be absolutely sure of even temperature distribution around the home you can buy or sometimes hire radiator thermometers which clip onto the radiators pipes and measure the difference in temperature between them . The proper name for radiator thermometers is Differential Thermometers and in the digital age these have become so advanced that the temperature of both the incoming and outgoing radiator pipes can be measured , at the same time , with one thermometer . <p> Radiator thermometers can be bought from some plumbers merchants and have clamps , or springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve pipes . They are not widely used in the trade and you may have to make do with a digital thermometer . <p> Take the measurement at the flow side ( wheelhead ) first , then at the Lockshield and adjust accordingly using the instructions below . <h> Balancing Your Radiators and Heating System <p> Turn off Your Heating and Open Valves <p> To balance your central heating system , turn off your heating system and allow all radiators to cool down . <p> Open both of the valves for all of the radiators and turn on the heating . You may need some help but you now need to go to each radiator and work out when they heat up and what order they heat up in . Note the order down . You will need a small spanner or an adjustable wrench to adjust the Lockshield valve . <p> Types of Radiator Valve <p> There are two valves on all radiators .

This time as soon as you fire up the heating boiler , go to the very first radiator on the system and fit the thermometers to the pipes on both valves . <p> Turn off the Lockshield Valve <p> Turn off the Lockshield valve completely and then turn it on again slowly until the difference in temperature between both thermometers is about 11 degrees C. <p> Continue round the system doing the same thing .

@@41625000 @1625000/ <p> The first step to a simple gravel driveway , path or patio base is to find out how firm the ground is underfoot ( or car ! ) . This project is written mainly to walk you through the process of how to gravel a driveway and path , but the sub base preparations are the same for a patio . Toppings can vary and you can see a couple below . <p> We use the same principle as designated by the building regulations for foundations and get a 50mm x 50mm square timber peg and a lump or club hammer . See our Foundations DIY How To Project for this . <p> Driveway completed using light scalpings and patio slabs <p> Typical lorry used for delivering scalpings <p> Weed fabric layed down to prevent weed growth <p> Patterned Paving created using paving slabs <p> From the surface of the proposed drive you will have approximately 200mm of material forming the driveway , so as an exploratory measure dig down 200mm for an area of about a square metre . Drive a 50 x 50mm peg in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 inches ) then the ground is firm enough for your driveway . You can now excavate out the full area of your drive . <p> Excavation can be done by hand , or you can hire a digger from a local tool hire store . A digger could be quite expensive ( you will usually get a free driving lesson from the company when they deliver it but check this at the time of hiring ) but can save you days of back breaking work . You will probably need to hire a skip also . <p> If while digging you find any areas which seem softer than the rest , dig these out . The base you are laying is flexible and will sink into soft areas of soil making unwanted dips in your drive . Try and find a base which is solid throughout the entire area . Admittedly this base structure can be " topped up " from time to time , but a little time and effort spent now can save a great deal later on . This does not apply to patio bases where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base later so it 's vital you fill all soft spots at this stage . <p> It is just as well to lay weed fabric before filling the sub base . Weeds can fight their way through the most compact of materials and a few pounds spent at this stage will save so much trouble later on . <p> The stone we are using for the base is called scalping stone . This is what is left when any particular quarry stone has been used for the purposes it was excavated for . It 's one of the cheaper forms of base and much easier to lay and level than the old traditional broken brick hardcore . You can see what scalping stone looks like in our Garden Makeover How To Project . <p> Clearing the area for laying path and driveway <p> Digging side of pathway down <p> You have a choice at this stage . You should be able to dig the side of the drive or path down vertically and when the base is in it will obviously keep the soil or lawn in place as shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when laid on top , is very likely to spread when walked and driven on and you may wish to contain this . If you have a lawn either side of your drive or path , stray shingle can not only damage your mower , but the mower can easily " throw " stones out . This can be very dangerous . To find out how to contain your shingle and support the sides of your path or drive , see our Edging Stones DIY How To Project . <p> Working out how much scalping you need can be done using our graph below . Measure the area you need to cover and find it on the square metre range of the graph . Read across to the depth line ( 150mm ) and then down to the volume . <p> Scalping calculation table for a new path or driveway <p> For the example above we have chosen an area of 15.50 square metres . Follow the line across to the 150mm depth line and you can see that we would need 2.35 cubic metres of material . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aggregates are sold by the tonne . Scalping has a similar weight to volume ratio as gravel and averages out at about 1.85 tonnes to the cubic metre . This material is put on a weighbridge before it gets to you so try and order it after a few dry days . It weighs a lot more when it 's wet . Check with your supplier for the conversion rate they use for weight to volume . Aggregates and stone vary quite a bit in weight and you do not want tonnes of stone left blocking your garden . Please note the above figures are only a guide . <p> Before the scalping 's are delivered , you need to hire a vibrating plate from the local tool hire shop . As you can see from the photo it 's not a huge weapon but very very heavy . Be careful when loading and unloading . Get this on site before the scalping delivery and run over your excavation with it first . This will definitely show you where the soft spots are . <p> Vibrating compactor plate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire store <p> Scalpings layed and paving slabs laid for pathway <p> When the scalpings are delivered , ask the driver to back in and tip slowly at the far end of the drive and drive forward as they begin to tip out . Most drivers are used to this and will not mind at all . This makes your task of leveling them very much easier ..... BUT .... If the ground is not suitable the driver will not risk getting his lorry stuck so be prepared for a long haul . <p> Level the scalpings using a shovel and large rake . Keep an eye on the level across the width of your drive . You do not want any humps or dips which will retain water . Use a long piece of straight timber to make sure you have the correct level . <p> 150mm of scalpings will compact with a vibrating plate to about 125mm . To finish with 150mm you will need to lay approximately 165-175mm . This is not an exact science and it is never going to be absolutely perfect , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you prepare , the better the job is . <p> When the scalpings are laid you can now add your shingle , gravel and patio slabs . There are several varieties of shingle and gravel and this is purely a matter of personal taste . Take some time out visiting builders merchants , DIY stores and garden centres to compare the types and , of course , the prices ! <p> We have used a lot of crushed slate recently as you can see above . Very nice but expensive . The quantities can be worked out by using the graph above , but which ever route you decide to go down to gravel your driveway and path ensure that you have a solid base to lay on top of and that you are happy with your choice of materials as once it 's down it 's an expensive job to rip it all up again . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Find out more information about core drills , how to use them safely and effectively and what is involved when you use a core drill on masonry or concrete . <h> What is a Core Drill ? <p> A core drill is a drill bit which cuts large holes from masonry and concrete removing the centre part of the hole ( core ) as it drills . <p> There are many core drill sizes and each one is manufactured to represent the size of a commonly used pipe , cable or duct . <h> Before you Start Drilling <p> Before you start your drilling you should always make sure there are no cables or pipes hidden in the wall . You can never take for granted that work has n't been done by someone else in this area before . <p> A cable and pipe detector can be used to scan the wall area for any hidden items . Clicking on any of the tool images below will take you through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a pipe and cable detector as well as the core drills and accessories themselves . <p> Core Drill Hole <h> What Type of Drill do you Need for Core Drilling ? <p> You will need a high powered SDS drill . Most SDS drills come with built in clutches which are highly recommended for this process of hole drilling . Core cutting SDS kits are easily available and are not really that expensive for what you get ( 100 - 120 ) . If you plan to be using this process of cutting a lot , it will end up being cheaper than hiring . <p> All hire companies will have a suitable drill for you to hire , if purchasing a drill is deemed too expensive . Remember you will also be charged for the amount of wear on diamond tipped bits . <p> A core cutter , once within the hole it is cutting , can snag or grab at any moment without any warning . You will be surprised how easily your wrist or arm can be harmed in this way . <p> If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 3 holes ; 117mm for your toilet waste , 55mm for your bath and shower waste and possibly 40mm for your basin waste .

The arbor screws into the core bit and then slots into the SDS chuck of the drill . When hiring or buying a core bit always make sure you have the correct sized arbor . <h> Drilling a Hole with a Core Drill <p> Never use hammer action when core drilling . The drilling action needs to be as smooth as possible and the jerky action of the hammer can snap expensive diamond teeth very easily . <p> If you are able to drill right the way through the wall in one go , the core drill will remove the core at exit .

You do not want to drill in at an angle and cause the hole to slope up or down ! <p> When you have repeated this process a few times you will be near the other side of the hole you are cutting , now is the time to decrease your pressure ! <p> If you keep forcing the core cutter through , when you actually break through you will force a large amount masonry away from the outside of the hole . <p> For the neatest cut it is advisable to allow the drill guiding bit to penetrate the wall , then finish the hole from the other side . This guarantees a neat entry and exit hole . <p> As always at DIY Doctor we advise the use of purpose built tools for DIY use . Safety must always come first .

@@41625014 @1625014/ <h> Choosing a Greenhouse - Understand the Different Types of Greenhouse and How to Build One in Your Garden <p> Summary : How to choose a greenhouse and understanding the different types of greenhouse . Get guidance on how to build a greenhouse , the materials to use and making a sound base . Learn what you should consider when siting your green or glasshouse in your garden . <p> A greenhouse is a very useful addition to your garden or allotment , but choosing which one to buy is a difficult decision . Size , style , construction , price , even colour " all these are things you 'll need to consider . <h> Reasons for Buying a Greenhouse <p> Firstly , think about what you are going to use your greenhouse for , as this will have a bearing on the size and other aspects of your choice . <p> If you like to grow your own fruit and veg , a greenhouse will extend your growing season " allowing you to plant seeds earlier while the ground outside is still cold . Some crops need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you will have a wider range of varieties to choose from if you decide to add one to your garden . Tomatoes , sweet peppers and cucumbers are all greenhouse favourites . <p> Traditional style greenhouse <p> If flowers are your passion , a greenhouse will enable you to care for tender varieties and will prove invaluable for propagation . <h> Greenhouse Location <p> Where is the best place to situate your greenhouse ? Obviously , it will need a good deal of sun so you need to pick a spot that 's not too shady . If your garden is quite exposed , try to avoid locating your greenhouse in the way of a cold northerly or easterly wind . Not only is a strong wind liable to cause damage , but a cold breeze will affect your plants . <h> Size of Your Greenhouse <p> If you are planning on having a few grow-bags , you 're going to need a fair amount of space . Do n't choose a greenhouse that 's going to take up your whole garden though ! There 's a delicate balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can afford . When thinking about the size of greenhouse to purchase , keep in mind that it 's useful to have space for a worktable " an area where you can pot-on seedlings etc . <p> The higher the greenhouse roof , the more effective it will be " a good , sloping roof space enables excess heat to be dispelled . If you are going to be working in the greenhouse a lot , make sure you have enough space to stand up and move around comfortably . <p> If you have a very small garden , greenhouses are available as small as 4ft x 6ft , and if even that 's too big , you might consider a mini growhouse . See below for more information on types of greenhouse and growhouse . <h> Types of Greenhouse <p> Mini Growhouses <p> Usually constructed from a tubular frame with a plastic covering , these are ideal for anyone with a garden too small for a full greenhouse . There are a variety of sizes available , from about 70cm wide and 50cm deep . They have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or taller plants . Be aware that these growhouses are generally quite flimsy and will need fixing to a wall or fence . <p> Lean-to Greenhouses <p> A lean-to is the next step up from a mini-growhouse . If you have a small space next to the house or garage , adding on a lean-to greenhouse can be a good , space-saving compromise . Having one wall made of brick means that a lean-to is n't quite as efficient as a free-standing greenhouse , but brick will hold in heat well , meaning that it will stay warm late into the evening . <p> There are a massive range of sizes and styles , from simple little 2ft x 4ft aluminium versions up to luxurious 8ft x 20ft wooden frames , with everything in between . <p> Free-standing Greenhouses <p> Free-standing greenhouses are available in almost any size imaginable , from a little 4ft square model up to giant 10ft x 20ft and even larger . Whatever space you have available , you can be sure to find a greenhouse to suit it . Smaller greenhouses generally have a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will usually have a double sliding door . Exceptions are wooden-framed versions , which sometimes have a standard hinged door . <p> Most metal-framed greenhouses are of a similar basic style , although there are now versions available with curved rather than angled eaves . Wooden-framed greenhouses have a bit more variety in shape . <h> Materials Needed for Building Your Greenhouse <p> Aluminium or wood are your main choices for the greenhouse frame . Galvanised steel was used before aluminium became popular , and is still available in a few places . An aluminium frame requires much less maintenance . Timber frames require painting or staining every few years . Metal frames are often available powdercoated in green or white now , which enables you to choose a finish that will blend in with the surroundings . <p> When it comes to glazing , there are now a few options available . Tempered safety glass is harder to break and a safer but more expensive than standard horticultural glass . Polycarbonate is a popular but more expensive glazing option - the fact that it is shatterproof and has good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beware of inferior quality versions " some cheaper polycarbonate panels may only be 4mm rather than the usual 6-8mm thick , and may not have exterior treatment , meaning that it can discolour and become brittle . A few cheap greenhouse manufacturers use acrylic glazing , but this is to be avoided as it is flimsy and does not last well in the elements . <h> Greenhouse Base Construction <p> If you are buying a new greenhouse , complete sets with frame , glazing and base are available . The term base ' can be a bit misleading " this is a four-sided galvanised steel upframe , which the greenhouse fits on top of , and allows you to fix the greenhouse directly onto a concrete foundation ( see our building a shed base project to find out how to make one ) or slabs . <p> If you are planning to use slabs , make sure they are securely bedded in as any movement will put stress on the greenhouse frame . Our laying a patio project will help you with this . If you have bought or inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base of the correct size , in which case you can make your own base using bricks . <h> Greenhouse Accessories <p> Auto-vents are a worthwhile investment , allowing the windows of your greenhouse to open automatically when a certain temperature is reached . Ventilation is vital to plant growth , and opening and closing windows and vents every day can get tedious . <p> Lightweight staging tables are good for sitting pots and growbags on . Shading material is required to protect plants from being scorched by direct sunlight when the sun is at its strongest . If you plan to use your greenhouse throughout the winter , a heater and insulating material will be needed . <p> Rainwater kits can be fitted onto guttering , draining into a water butt to give you a ready water supply . See our installing a water butt project . Whatever water supply you have can be used in conjunction with a drip watering system to ensure your plants never go thirsty . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Solving problems with existing concrete floors including damp patches , holes and cracks . <p> If your ground floor timber floors have become infested with insect damage or dry rot you might choose to replace them with concrete floors . However laying a concrete floor to replace your timber floors may not be the end of your troubles if you do n't  take care to treat the problem before you lay a concrete slab for your new floor . <p> Dry rot can spread through and over most building materials once it is established so it is really important to treat it thoroughly before you replace your floor . <p> If you would like any additional expert advice on treating timber decay and damage call Property Repair Systems on 01626 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer any further questions you may have . <p> These points all need consideration before you lay a new concrete floor in your home : <p> Dry rot in the original timber floor must be properly treated or it may re-emerge at the edges of the new concrete , causing expensive and extensive damage to skirting boards and other joinery . Dry rot can spread out into dry areas , so great care must be taken to remove ALL debris before filling the void under the old timber floor to raise the level with rubble hardcore . Rake any soil thoroughly for timber chippings . The soil must be sterilised , you can do this using a boron treatment which is available from Property Repair Systems . <p> Dry rot present on timber joists <p> Hardcore rubble and brick , brought in to fill up the old floor void , may also be contaminated with Dry rot , so be sure to also treat this thoroughly with the same boron fungicide . <p> The original wall damp proof course ( DPC ) was designed to protect the timbers , skirting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is usually made from black bitumen , slate or plastic , and should be should be visible below the timber joists . By laying a concrete slab you may alter the original level of the floor and bury the DPC . You will in effect cause a bridge between the ground and the wall by doing this and in fact we use the term bridged when describing this effect . If your new concrete floor bridges your existing DPC you may need to inject a new damp proof course at the correct level , and we explain how to do that in Damp Proof Injection Project Page . <p> Unless you live in a detached property your new floor may also bridge your neighbours damp proof course in the Party Wall , causing their wall to suffer from rising damp . Under the Party Wall Act you MUST ask your neighbour for permission before doing any work that might affect the Party Wall.You can also ring Property Repair Systems for more advice on the Party Wall Act on 0843 636 8193 . Check the position of the DPC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a problem with the level of your new floor in relation to your neighbours DPC you may need to consider tanking the wall to prevent lateral penetration of damp between the two properties . To find out what to use when tanking walls you can visit Property Repair Systems for more information . In our experience neighbours are frequently involved in expensive legal actions when this Law is ignored , so please seek expert advice before you start work . <p> Most new concrete floors are laid well , BUT , even the best builders can forget to seal the floor to wall joint properly . This leaves a small gap between the wall face and the plastic DPC sheet that rises up the wall from under the new concrete . This becomes a high pressure area for water vapour . Even if a damp proof course has been correctly fitted , if the gap is not prepared and sealed properly , damp can be drawn up the wall and the vapour alone can cause rot in the skirting boards and salting in the plaster above . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grout , which you will find on Property Repair Systems website . <p> Epoxy pouring resin used to fill gaps <p> Pipes and other services may pass through the original void gas , water , electricity , sewage etch . You should consult a professional before burying any service pipes or wires , most require ducts to be laid and specific safety regulations apply . You will also need to seal around the pipes or ducting to prevent moisture build up . <p> If you are laying a concrete floor following extensive insect damage you should ensure that all remaining timbers and skirting are thoroughly treated before you pour your concrete floor , to eliminate the chance of further infestation in other parts of the house . <h> Concrete Floors DIY <p> If you have decided to lay a concrete floor yourself there are some points you need to know . The floor construction of a house , or dwelling , must fulfil several criteria , and the following design functions must be taken into consideration when laying your concrete slab . <p> Your floor must comply with the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It must be sufficiently strong and stable <p> You must exclude damp from coming inside the building <p> Thermal insulation to current regulations <p> Resistance to fire <p> We have provided a sketch below to show the most common form of concrete floor slab construction . However it will not be applicable in every case . Speak to the Building Control officer of your local Council for instruction and to obtain the necessary Building Regulation approval . You may also need to apply for Planning Permission , if you are constructing a new building , and we go into this in more detail in our Planning Permission project . <p> Foundation cross section for concrete floor <p> Where we indicate insulation on the drawing , we should point out that this must be to the specification shown by the architect , if it is required . <p> All hardcore should be compacted to refusal , that is to the point where is will not compact any further this should be done using a mechanical compacter . Then place a layer of sand blinding on top to avoid puncturing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables placed in the screed must be accessible through proprietary ducts with removable covers . <p> When it comes to the actual thickness and construction of the foundation you may find it helpful to visit our Foundations Project for a fuller understanding . Basically the foundation sizes and depths for local authority approval is the entire thickness of all the layers : hardcore , concrete , insulation and screed , together with the gauge of the damp proof membrane . <h> Repairing a Concrete Floor <p> Concrete floors are very durable and are relatively maintenance free during their long life . However if there were any problems with the original laying of the base it is possible that , if you have an existing concrete floor , it may need some repair or maintenance after it has been down for a period of time . <p> Concrete floor problems <p> Concrete floors suffer from four main defects : <p> Open joints between the edge of the slab and the walls . This can cause floor-to-wall damp , resulting in damp patches , wet and dry rot in skirting boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur due to subsidence , a poor or unstable foundation , or they may be a symptom of rapid drying when the concrete was poured . <p> Holes and voids , this can be caused if the concrete is not poured correctly or again by a poor or uneven foundation . It can result in localised damp patches , hollow spots and in severe cases collapse . <p> Punctured Plastic or Liquid Membranes , usually caused by a poor foundation where rubble has not been properly compacted and levelled and then a blinding sand laid to protect the DPC form puncturing . This can cause damp patches , and lifting of floor tiles and other coverings . <p> Lack of DPC membrane . If the foundations were not covered with a damp proof membrane before the concrete slab was poured then this can cause moisture to leach up into the floor from the ground . This can cause damp patches , overall dampness , which in turn will damage floor coverings by lifting floor tiles and laminates , and causing fungal and mould growth under floor coverings such as vinyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concrete Floor <p> If you see damp patches forming on your concrete floor you must make sure you check out the possibility that you have a water leak , above or below the floor . The possibility of a leak MUST be eliminated before you attempt to carry out a repair . Otherwise you could cause a problem in an adjacent area ( See our Checklist ) . If the damp is caused by a water leak eg from a leaking radiator pipe , it will be much more easily fixed then a punctured DPC . <p> Cracked and broken concrete floor <p> If cracks , holes or voids have developed you should consult a Structural Engineer to establish the cause . If they recommend that you make repairs then the remedy depends on the problem with the floor , here is a guide to the best way to deal with damaged concrete floors : <p> Cracks - these should be opened up to slots at least 1 inch x 1 inch ( 25mm x 25mm ) , using a disc cutter or grinder , but without penetrating deeply enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly to remove all dust and debris and then should be filled with a special Structural Epoxy Pouring Grout , see link above . <p> Holes and voids excavate to the full depth of the defect carefully . If you reach as far down as the waterproof membrane layer then extend the hole laterally to expose enough sound membrane to be able to effect a repair . This should be at least 150mm ( 6 inches ) from the edge of the hole . Remove all dust and debris from around the area . The hole can then be repaired , either using Structural Epoxy Pouring Grout ( as mentioned above ) , or for holes larger than 8 litres in capacity , a combination of the Epoxy Grout as a base layer and concrete as a filler . The final surface can then be covered with levelling floor screed , however the repair edges must be primed and the screed mixed with Ultra BondAcryl , to avoid shrinkage and cracking . <p> Punctured Membranes remove all floor coverings to expose bare concrete , and then run a Dehumidifier until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce any further . This drying time can takes a number of weeks depending on weather conditions , temperature in the room and the amount of moisture the concrete has absorbed . When you have a defined damp patches , mark the areas with chalk and excavate them carefully to expose the defective membrane punctures . The hole can then be repaired in a similar way to Holes above , either by using Structural Epoxy Pouring Grout , or as above if the holes are larger than 8 litres in capacity , use a combination of the Grout as a base layer , and concrete as a filler . As previously mentioned the final surface can be screeded , but prime the repair edges first and mix screed with Ultra BondAcryl , to avoid shrinking and cracking of the repaired areas . <p> Lack of Membrane To be sure there is no membrane you should first remove all floor coverings to expose bare concrete , and then run a Dehumidifier until the damp completely disappears . If damp patches remain see ( 4 ) above . If not , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash with detergent , and then thoroughly rinse ) , then repair any defects with Ultra BondAcryl Primer and Mortar . Seal the floor to wall joint as in ( 1 ) above and then apply two coats of an Epoxy Sealer ( you can also buy this from Property Repair Systems ) . If you intend to lay flooring that requires an adhesive , then check with the manufacturer for bonding details you may need to sand blind the second coat of Epoxy Seal to provide a mechanical grip . <h> Causes of Dry Rot and Insect Attack <p> Many buildings with suspended timber floor suffer from rot and insect attack in the ground floor timbers due to poor sub floor ventilation . We look at this more thoroughly in our air bricks and air vents project , but quite simply if air bricks become blocked with debris or ground levels are raised this cuts off the air flow and water leaks may also occur . Timber damaging insects and wet and rot all thrive in these moist humid surroundings . <p> So in many cases the floor timbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only answer is to replace the damaged timber floor with a concrete floor .

Find out how to fix noisy water pipes and stop banging in pipes . This project looks at noisy toilet cisterns in particular , and shows you ways to stop the noise of the water hammer . <h> Noisy Pipes " Water Hammer <p> One of our most frequent questions is how to stop " water-hammer " when water has been drawn from a system . First it is important to know how it occurs . The entry of cold water into your tank and toilet cisterns is controlled by a " ball valve " . As hot water is drawn from your emersion , so cold water rushes in from the cold tank to replace it . When you flush the loo , the same thing happens in your cistern . The incoming flow is regulated by a float , which rises with the water to shut off the valve when the tank is full . This float is generally in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Components that make up a toilet cistern <p> Noise reduction valve within a toilet cistern <p> When the mains cold rushes into the tank/cistern it causes ripples on the surface , the float bobs about , opening and closing the valve . It is this vibration within the valve and on the float arm which , when reverberating along the pipe , initiates the cause of water-hammer . The velocity of the water flowing through the valve means that when it is shut there is a build up of pressure behind the valve , as more water tries to push on through the pipe . This increase in pressure causes a pressure wave to form which travels back down the pipe . The wave then travels up and down the pipe until the energy is dissipated through friction , this is why there is a hammering ' effect . <p> There are a few ways to ease this problem , " professional " ways and DIY ways , none are difficult , but the first thing to make sure of is that wherever a pipe is up against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securely . The first and most effective professional way is to install an equilibrium valve instead of the standard valve in your tank or cistern . <p> This valve works by allowing some water to get at the back of the piston washer to stop the arm jumping about . The noise reduction valve above it is a further alternative , this allows incoming water to disperse below the water line and reduces the " waves " , it slows the vibration down but most often will not stop it . The cost of a noise reduction valve is about -7.00 , with arm and ball and an equilibrium valve is approx -33.00 . The noise reduction valve does make a considerable difference to the noise your system makes when filling up . <p> Torbeck valve <p> The DIY way is very effective but slightly cumbersome . Take an ordinary yoghurt carton and attach it to your float arm with some galvanised or stainless steel wire , which will not rust . Suspend the carton just below the water line . When full of water it has enough weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm lifting gently . <p> If your pipes are not hammering but just making creaking noises , this is normally caused by the friction of the pipe moving on the joist or rafter .

Also learn about stepped lead flashing and sealing chased mortar joints and lead soakers . <p> The purpose of lead chimney flashing is to form a water proof bridge between the sides , front and back of the chimney and the roof structure and is normally constructed out of lead . Click here to find out more about lead flashing in general . <p> There are three main factors you must take into consideration when installing lead flashings . <p> Water penetration due to the action of gravity <p> Water penetration due to the action of wind <p> Water penetration due to the action of surface tension with water <p> If you are installing lead flashings to a chimney you always need to start at the lowest point of the visible chimney above the finished roof . This is because gravity obviously takes water downwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the section underneath , as with roof tiles themselves . <h> Apron Flashing <p> The purpose of the front lead apron is to make the joint between the chimney and finished roof water tight . Whether your finished roof is constructed from tile or slate the procedure for installing your front apron will be the same . <p> Apron and stepped flashing to chimney <p> Your front lead apron will need to be cut into a mortar course of your brick or stone chimney so when cutting your apron you will need to work out which mortar course you are going to fix into . This will give you the height you need to cut your apron to ( normally about 50mm " 100mm up the existing chimney ) . This dimension will help you work out which course to cut out to accept your lead . <p> The mortar course will need to be chased out to accept the lead apron . You can hire a small angle grinder that comes with a special cutting disc especially designed to remove mortar from mortar courses in one cutting action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will need small folded lead tacks or wedges ( you can cut these your self or buy pre-made ones ) to hammer into the cut out mortar course to hold the apron in place till it is ready to be pointed or sealed permanently into position . The lead apron will also need to return up both sides of the chimney . These returns will eventually be covered by the side stepped lead flashings when they are installed making the chimney flashings complete and water tight . <h> Stepped Lead Flashing <p> Stepped lead flashings are the flashings which make the side of the chimney water tight ; they follow the roof pitch up to the rear of the chimney and return around the rear of the chimney . <p> Stepped flashing to side of chimney " Image coutesy of the Lead Sheet Association <p> They are called stepped because they use and are cut into the brick courses of the chimney in increasing height , therefore looking like steps . <p> The side step lead flashing can be cut from a profile taken , or created in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashing over laps the other still producing a step looking finished flashing . Thanks to the Lead Sheet Association for the above image . You can also get help for this from our Book , Teach Yourself Basic DIY detailed below . <p> Both these methods will be water tight but the profile method will give more defence because it is made from just one piece ( less opportunity for leaks to occur ) . <p> Teach Yourself Basic DIY by DIY Doctor <p> Whichever method you decide to use the lead flashing should always cover at least 150mm out from the brick surface across the roof tiles or slate . <p> Before the stepped flashing is done you will need to install a lead soaker that will run out to the side of the chimney across the roof battens and down the roof under the roof tiles to take water away . This is a secondary layer of protection . <p> Once this part of the lead flashing is in place you can install the stepped lead flashing . <p> When installing a chimney single step flashing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay your roof tiles and lead flashing at the same time . Each layer of flashing is then covered by the roof tile as you work your way up the side of your chimney . This avoids the need for climbing up and down the roof later . Roof ladders are a must - ladder roof hook kits are available to buy , or hire a proper roof ladder . See our project on ladder safety for more tips . <p> Lead wedges to hold lead flashing in place <p> There are also other ways of securing your lead into the chased out mortar courses as mortar pointing may eventually fail due to heat ( expanding &amp; contracting ) and sun exposure . Mortar might be very good at adhering to masonry but not to smoothed surface lead . There are many sealant products available on the market now that replace the need or use for mortar pointing they are more flexible , heat resistant and bond better to the masonry and lead . They can also be colour coded to match your existing or required finish . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

This project features clear , animated illustrations and diagrams showing you every step you need to make a solid join with a blow torch or brazing rod . <p> 1 . Two pieces of steel sheet are to be brazed . The steel must first be cleaned so that grease and dirt is removed . Wire wool or emery cloth are the most suitable abrasives . <p> A borax flux ( powder ) is mixed with water to produce a paste which is brushed along the joint . Flux prevents oxidation taking place on the metal surfaces as this would prevent brazing being successful . <p> Clean the faces of steel properly to remove dirt and grease <p> 2 . <p> The compressor is turned on and this pressurises the gas and air . As the gas-air control is slowly turned on , gas is fed through the nozzle and this is ignited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Brazing torch turned on and flame ignited <p> 3 . Once alight the gas-air control is turned to allow more air/gas through the nozzle which gives a longer , more fierce flame . The length of the flame can be adjusted with the control until the desired type of flame is achieved . As a rough guide , a blue section of flame will appear near the nozzle , the end of this is the hottest part of the flame . <p> Adjust gas and air control of brazing torch to get the required flame strength <p> 4 . The two pieces of steel should have already been placed on the rotating table . Fire bricks are used to raise both pieces slightly off the surface of the table so that heat can flow all the way round it . Fire bricks should also be placed at the back and sides of the metal so that heat does not escape and is reflected back . <p> The steel is given a gentle overall heating first which raises the temperature slowly . This allows the steel to expand slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving the steel out of position .

Serious burns can result if safety procedures are ignored . <p> Leather aprons and gloves will offer good protection if you accidentally touch hot metal . Goggles are essential as splashes ' of hot flux or brazing rod ( solder ) could damage eyes permanently . Furthermore , if there is a need to pick up materials that have been heated on the hearth , always use steel tongs and place the hot material on a steel plate/block . The steel block/plate will conduct the heat away from the material without cooling it too quickly . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

This will provide you with additional security for your home . You will learn the best positions for fixing your door bolt or bolts , how to fix them so that they are level and also how to cut the door keep into a section of architrave if needed . <p> Fitting a barrel or sliding bolt is one of the easier DIY projects . To fit a door bolt , follow through the instructions below . <h> Different Types of Door Bolt <p> You will need to decide on what type of sliding bolt or barrel bolt you are going to use , there are quite a few available . Most of these types of door bolt can be surface mounted on the door or window making them easy to fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Fitting a Sliding Bolt or Barrel Bolt <p> In order to complete this project we recommend that you have the following tools available : <p> Door bolt kit <p> Pencil <p> Small spirit level or boat float <p> Medium grade sandpaper <p> Hammer <p> 1/2 inch chisel <p> Flat edge screwdriver <p> Philips screwdriver <p> Cordless drill/driver <p> Selection of small drill bits 2 - 4mm if possible or a bradawl <h> How to Fit a Door Bolt and Door Keep <p> Decide on Height of Door Latch <p> The first task is to decide at what height on the door you want your bolt to be at . There are no rules for this and now is the time to decide if you actually want two bolts , one at the top of the door and one at the bottom . Two bolts will obviously provide a bit more security than just the one and considering the cost it 's well worth adding two . <p> Door with door bolts fixed top and bottom <p> With your position chosen , hold only the bolt on the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhanging the door itself and touching on the frame . Position it right on the edge of the door so that you have the maximum length available from the bolt . <p> Mark First Screw Hole and Drill Pilot Hole <p> Using a pencil , make a mark inside the screw hole on the bolt furthest from the edge of the door . To ensure that the bolt is fitted straight and level we are going to insert one screw and level it up from there . With your hole marked , remove the bolt from the door . <p> Next , we are going to create a pilot hole for the screw . Due to the small size of the screws normally used to fix a door bolt you will need to use a very small drill bit , 2 - 3mm should be fine ( depending on the size of screw you are using - manufacturers instructions on the packaging should state the size of hole ) . If you have a bradawl then this will be ideal . Drill in about 5mm . <p> Position the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole and then screw up , but not too tight <p> Screw on Door Bolt in First Screw Hole <p> Now , position the bolt back on the door ensuring that screw hole is over your pilot hole . Using a screwdriver or cordless drill/driver insert the screw into the hole but do not tighten it all the way just yet , allow a little movement . <p> Level Door Bolt and Mark Second Screw Hole <p> Now , swing the hanging bolt up until it 's level by eye . Using your boat float , position it along the flat top edge of the bolt and adjust until it 's absolutely level and mark the top left hand screw hole with your pencil . <p> Remove the level and allow the bolt to swing back down out of the way and drill another pilot hole for your second screw . Swing the bolt back up and insert your screw and tighten it all the way up and also now tighten up the top right hand screw . <p> Insert Remaining Screws <p> Depending on the type and size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes . You can now work your way around them , inserting screws and screwing them up . <p> Level up the door bolt and then mark , drill and screw the top screw hole nearest the door <p> Mark Fixings for Door Keep <p> With the door bolt now fixed firmly to the door the final job is to fix the bolt keep onto the door frame . <p> Extend the bolt out slightly and push the bolt keep over it . Close the door up until the keep touches the door frame . This will now mark the position on the frame where the keep will need to be fixed . <p> Chisel out Architrave if Needed <p> At this point you may now need to chisel a little out of the architrave to allow the keep to be fixed at the same level as the bolt itself . <p> If this is the case , use your pencil to mark around the the area that needs removing and open the door up . Take a suitable size chisel ( should be around 1/2 inch ) and carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please make sure you are gentle . Remove only small pieces at a time and do n't just whack it as you may end up splitting the architrave or frame . <p> Fix door keep to door frame within recess in architrave <p> Tidy up the Recess <p> Once you have removed the bulk tidy up the edges using the chisel and then a medium grade piece of sand paper . As this will probably be quite a tight area to get into you can wrap the sand paper over the end of the chisel or a screwdriver and use it as a sanding block to really get into those corners and give yourself a nice sharp , tidy finish . <p> Fix the Door Keep <p> Now , put the bolt keep back onto the end of the bolt and close the door back up . With the keep flush on the door frame use your pencil to mark the screw holes on the frame . Ensure there is a little movement around the bolt in the keep so that once all fixed , it is not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door again . <p> Drill your pilot holes using the same method described above and then screw your bolt keep firmly to the frame <p> Do n't Forget any Painting ! <p> NOTE : Just before you fix the keep to the frame , if you have had to chisel out a section of architrave now is a good time to paint the bare wood that now remains .

@@41625026 @1625026/ <h> Why Sharpen Chisels ? <p> Sharpening wood chisels and plane blades is almost a forgotten art with all of the honing wheels and modern grinders but there are still those of us who believe that a good chisel should be treated with the utmost respect and sharpened , by hand , to the point where it will cut a cigarette paper with no tearing . <p> Old fashioned ? Yes , but a good tradesman knows the real value of sharp tools and the money it saves when you can cut in a door hinge without even using a hammer . <p> Set of chisels waiting to be sharpened <h> Angles Used for Sharpening a Chisel <p> Chisels have two blade angles . The shallow , long angle which is usually set to 25- , is called the grinding angle as the chisel is ground down to this angle when first made . <p> The second angle ( usually 30- ) is called the cutting angle and allows for easier sharpening of the chisel itself . <p> The side edges of a chisel blade are usually beveled also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dovetail joint . <p> The two angles used for sharpening chisels <h> How to Sharpen a Chisel <p> Use an oilstone to sharpen your chisels and , having laid a small amount of oil on the stone , place your chisel on at the correct angel . A honing guide can be used for this but these guides do not allow you to sharpen the chisel in a figure of eight pattern very easily . <p> The reason the chisel is usually sharpened in a figure of eight is that this allows you to use the full width of the sharpening stone and you do not wear away a groove up and down the stone . <p> It is important that every part of the chisel edge touches the stone at all times and this will come with practice . <p> Sharpening or oil stone for sharpening chisels <p> You do not need to press hard , just run the chisel round the stone and get used to how the angle feels . Every now and again , run your finger over the back edge of the blade where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a slight metal burr . <p> At this point , turn the chisel over and lay the back flat against the stone . Rub up and down gently a couple of times to remove the burr . <p> Plane blades are sharpened in the same way but , as they are wider ( except for rebate plane blades ) there is no need to use the figure of eight method . <p> Chisel sharpening set including honing wheel , oil and oil stone <p> As with everything else in the building trade , practice makes perfect , so just keep trying . Its not rocket science but it is tremendously satisfying when you get a chisel really sharp by hand . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

We also suggest some alternative solutions to scaffold towers that might be appropriate . <p> There are many reasons why a normal tube scaffold should not be put up in a DIY way . Scaffolding is not only a trade in itself but it is a very dangerous one and if a scaffold is not put up 100% correctly , the results can be fatal . Back in 2003/4 , falls from height accounted for 67 fatal accidents at work and nearly 4000 major injuries ... and yes .... it could be you . <p> In 2005 , regulations were brought in to cover working at height . However falls from height is still the top cause of workplace fatalities and again in the top three causes of injuring requiring over 7 days hospitalisation . Thankfully the numbers are falling ; a decade after the new legislation has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year but this is still unacceptably high . <p> This project will concentrate on the use of tower scaffolds which can be used to gain access pretty much everywhere . <h> Working with a Scaffold Tower <p> Scaffold towers are easily portable and can be carried , in lightweight sections , directly to their place of use . Most have lockable wheels so once a job like cleaning out gutters is started , the scaffold can simply be pushed further down the line allowing safe access to all parts of the project . Always dismount the scaffold tower when moving it . <p> Please follow the comprehensive guidelines provided in the useful links above , but as a summary please ensure that : <p> The tower is level and on firm ground . Make sure the castor wheels are locked and the tower can not move or wobble <p> Many towers have out riggers ; do n't take a risky short cut and use these . Follow the instructions for constructing your tower carefully <p> Never exceed the manufacturers limits , particularly in height <p> Do n't use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength of the tower comes from all the parts and if one or some are missing it could weaken your tower dramatically <p> Reduce the height of the tower and remove all equipment ( and people ! ) from the tower before moving it <p> Check for cables and overhead obstructions when moving <h> Buying a Scaffold Tower <p> There are many companies throughout the country that hire and sell scaffolding and tower access platforms , aluminium towers , podium steps and all other access equipment and you can find information on these companies by simply searching on the internet . <p> It is sometimes cheaper to buy enough scaffolding for your project and then re-sell it on once you have finished , so this is also worth considering this . <p> In the majority of cases these towers can be erected by one individual but we always suggest that two people ( with , sometimes , a third person ) are involved for safety . <p> It is important that all towers are designed specifically to comply with the requirements of ( European Standard ) , the BS1139 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towers supplied are warranted . <p> Scaffold towers come in a range of sizes , the taller the more expensive that the get . Towers typically range from 3 - 7 meters and can be constructed in a variety of configurations " please check the instructions before attempting this . <h> Alternatives to a Scaffold Tower <p> Multi Purpose Ladders <p> These are ladders that can be converted into a platform , although their height does n't come close to a scaffold tower . These can also be used as normal ladders and step ladders so they are very versatile . <p> Using scaffolding is another option ; however we do not think that this is a DIY project due to the great risk of injury . We strongly advise that you use a professional firm ( you can find one in your area on our find a tradesman page http : **38;422;TOOLONG ) . <h> Hiring Scaffold Towers <p> Scaffold towers of all kinds can be purchased but it is more usual , in a domestic/DIY situation to hire them . General hire rates for are below but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 1.8m x 1.4m and the price increases the higher the platform . Standard heights and their weekly costs are listed below . These prices are valid in the South West of England for 2014/5 . <p> Working Height <p> Platform Height <p> Cost per Week <p> 4.2m <p> 2.3m <p> -62.50 <p> 4.7m <p> 2.8m <p> -67.50 <p> 5.2m <p> 3.2m <p> -72.50 <p> 5.7m <p> 3.7m <p> -77.50 <p> 6.2m <p> 4.2m <p> -82.50 <p> 6.7m <p> 4.6m <p> -87.50 <p> 7.2m <p> 5.1m <p> -92.50 <p> 7.7m <p> 5.7m <p> -97.50 <p> 8.2m <p> 6.2m <p> -102.50 <p> 8.7m <p> 6.7m <p> -107.50 <p> A 5.1m high platform tower is usually the maximum height hired by DIYers as this will reach the highest domestic gutter . For a normal 2-storey house the gutter height will sit at between 5m and 5.5m so you may want to hire a slightly shorter tower to avoid bending down ( or nose-bleeding as it 's called in the trade ) for any length of time . <h> Working at height legislation <p> Here are some do 's and do not 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when working on a mobile scaffold or scaffold tower . <p> Using the Scaffold Tower <p> Do not use a scaffold tower in strong winds <p> Do not use as a support for ladders or any other form of access equipment <p> Do not use with any of the parts missing or any parts which clearly belong to other types of scaffold . Each tower is only at it 's correct strength when all off the correct parts are connected together <p> Moving the Tower <p> If you need to move a tower you must always ensure : <p> The tower height is reduced to 4m or less <p> There are no tools , materials or people on any part of the tower <p> There are no wires , cables overhead power lines or telephone lines in the way of any movement <p> There are no obstructions such as bay windows etc .... in the way of movement <p> Movement can take place on solid ( fairly level ) ground and no scaffold leg will dig into a lawn or flower bed 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

@@41625033 @1625033/ <p> Summary : Gas Safety and DIY Gas Installation . In this guide you will find information on gas safety for both homeowners and landlords . Find out about what you are legally allowed to do when it comes to gas work in your home and what responsibilities you have to tenants as a landlord . Also , discover how to find a Gas Safe registered engineer to ensure any gas work is undertaken safely and legally so that it complies with local authority building regulations and wo n't effect your home insurance and how to check the credentials of your gas safe engineer and ensure they are allowed to work on your gas appliances . <p> Important new changes have taken place in Great Britain and the Isle of Man gas industry recently . The previous CORGI ( Council for Registered Gas Users ) scheme has been replaced by the Gas Safe Register . <p> This is intended to ensure that all persons carrying out work involving gas are properly qualified and technically competent . <p> The Gas Safe Register - Ensure your gas technician is qualified <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered with the Gas Safe Register by law and firms must also be registered . All engineers are issued with a Gas Safe Register I 'd card and they should show this to householders before starting work . This applies to all domestic and most industrial work . <p> When it comes to check the credentials of an engineer , not all registered engineers can carryout all jobs , some will only have specific qualifications to do certain jobs . <p> The jobs they are allowed to carry out should be on the back of their Gas Safety Register I 'd card ( see sample images below ) . <p> Front section of the Gas Safe Register engineers card <p> Rea section of the Gas Safe Register engineers card showing the work the engineer is competent to carry out <p> The Gas Safe Register should be your go-to place to check any individual engineer or company before you invite anyone into your home to carry out work on your gas system . The Gas Safe Register site also supplies a service whereby you can find registered gas engineers in your local area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this service can be found here . <h> Home Improvements Using Tradesmen Involving Gas <p> If you are planning or involved in a home improvement project that involves some gas work such as remodelling a kitchen or work that could involve moving gas pipes such as a loft conversion then you will need to make sure that the tradesman carrying out the work is either gas safe registered themselves or is going to subcontract this part of the job to another tradesperson that is . <p> According to the gas safe site , over 100,000 home improvement jobs that were carried out resulted in unsafe , illegal or downright dangerous gas work and in pretty much all cases the homeowner assumed that the tradesman or project manager would ensure that this part of the job was undertaken by the appropriate person when infact they had either bodged it themselves or contracted it out to a " mate " with some gas knowledge . In either case the work was illegal and unsafe . <p> With this in mind please ensure that you check the following : <p> Ask your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and check it on the gas safe website <p> When project managers are involved , ask them to supply I 'd numbers for any/all tradesmen they are being employed for gas work and check them using the method above <p> If , after the installation of your gas appliance or completion of any works , you suspect that the work has been undertaken in an unsafe manner then you can request a free check of your property . Information on this can be found here . <p> A worthy point to note in respect to the above is that if you have a new heat producing appliance installed such as a boiler for example the installing engineer should then notify your local authority on completion as each engineer in responsible for their compliance with building regulations . <p> If your engineer does not notify the local authority and later down the line it turns out that the appliance is the cause of the fault then you , as the homeowner , are responsible . This again highlights the need for you to ensure your chosen engineer is fully on the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on this can be found here . <h> DIY and Gas Installation <p> In answer to the hundreds of questions we get about DIY gas installation we can state the following . <p> There is no law to say you can not do a gas installation yourself providing ( under the law ) you are competent . <p> Competent , in this situation however , means you are able to check your installation for any variance in gas pressure from before and after an installation together with a complete understanding of how to check any fitting and/or appliance for leaks that could cause explosions and unwanted or dangerous emissions such as carbon monoxide . <p> This use of the word " competent " disqualifies most home owners or tenants from DIY gas fitting and any form of gas work and furthermore , without an engineers safety certificate it is almost certain that your home insurance would not pay out in the event of anything going wrong . <p> According to the Gas Safe Register site the only gas work you are allowed to carry out yourself is that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliance e.g. a new cooker , boiler etc .... Outside of what is stated in the user instructions should not be touched or attempted by the home owner . <p> Also stated is that you ( the homeowner ) should not carry out any work that results in the disturbance of a gas carrying or supply component e.g. a gas supply pipe . <p> Cooker connected to gas main and secured to wall with chain check-strap to prevent tipping - image courtesy of mybuilder.com <p> When it comes to DIY gas , the real message here I guess is that if you are in any doubt what-so-ever e.g. you are not currently a gas safe registered engineer or ex-professional registered gas engineer with the necessary skills and knowledge to carryout a job to the letter of the law then leave it to the professionals ! <h> Gas Safety Information for Landlords <p> Landlords and property owners involved in letting flats , houses and holiday accommodation for rent have a legal obligation to comply with laws dealing with gas safety . <p> Holiday accomodation including cottages and flats , caravans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private houses , bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation and also room rental in a bed-sit <p> When it comes to the landlord 's responsibilities for rental properties that feature gas appliances , these can be summarised as follows : <p> Maintenance : Any and all gas appliances including all pipework and flues ( where fires are concerned ) should be services at least once a year or in accordance to manufacturers guidelines . In some cases an engineer may recommend that a certain appliance is serviced or inspected on a more regular basis e.g. several times a year <p> Annual Check : An annual or 12 month gas safety check should be performed on all and any gas appliance ( including flues ) to ensure their safe to use <p> Inspection Records : The above annual safety check must also be provided to any residing tenant within 28 days of the completion of the inspection .

@@41625036 @1625036/ <p> Summary : Laminate floors are a great way to waterproof a floor : Find out how to waterproof your kitchen and bathroom floor using snap together laminate planks . Learn how to successfully lay laminate floors and ensure that your floors remains waterproof at all times . <p> Bathrooms and kitchens are wet and humid places ! Using a waterproof floor of some kind is essential . Until now the choices were limited to lino and tiles . Many people have made the mistake of using ordinary laminate or wooden floors in these two rooms only to watch them swell up and warp as the water soaked in . <p> Water Spilt on Laminate Flooring <p> Over recent years there has been an explosion in the numbers of different flooring options you now have such as waterproof laminate flooring , vinyl laminate planks , stick on laminate effect flooring to name just a few with each having it 's own different type of fixing an installation process - some use snap together and locking joints and some can simly be glued down . <p> In this project we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tend to be the most commonly available . Before laying your flooring through the use of this guide please check the manufacturers instructions for your flooring and how the joints are snapped together as the methods involved may be slightly different to those described below as if any of the joints are not snapped together correctly or are damaged then this may effect the waterproof abilities of the flooring . <p> With most waterproof laminate flooring the planks themselves are not designed to be submerged at any time , only to resist water from the top . It is therefore important that your existing floor is 100% dry before you lay them . If your floor is newly laid concrete or screed it must be allowed to cure for 60 days . <h> Fitting the Flooring <p> Prepare the existing floor well . Ensure it is dry , solid , smooth and flat . Any carpet , carpet glue or tape or any other fixings should be removed . Voids or hollows in the floor should be filled and bumps should be removed or sanded down . Any bumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn may allow them to leak . <p> Lay the first board in the left hand corner of the room 6mm away from each wall . Use 6mm spacers to ensure the gap is the right size . This 6mm gap must be preserved along the length of each wall . If your walls are uneven see our project on scribing timber to resolve the problem . <p> Lift the end of the first board and , with both boards at an angle ; slot the next board in place . Press the joint down flat on the floor to ensure proper waterproof joint is made . <p> Continue in this way until you are in reach of the right hand wall . If the last board in the row needs to be cut turn it over and mark where it needs to be cut . Do n't forget to allow for the 6mm gap . <p> Start the second row with the offcut from the first row providing it is 300mm or longer . If it is not you should cut a new board . <p> Press the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and subsequent ) row , press forwards and fold down at the same time . <p> For the second board of the second ( and subsequent ) row , place the short side at an angle against the first board and fold down ensuring that the board is positioned in the interlocking strip of the floorboard in the previous row . <p> Lift the board you are holding as well as the previous board from this row and push to slide the current board against the row in front . It will then align with the previous plank . The current and previous plank can then be folded down to the floor . <p> Continue to the end making sure you keep the 6mm spacers in place and follow the diagrams below . Each carton of the flooring contains 10 boards 146mm x 1210mm each at a thickness of 5mm . Each carton covers 1.77 square metres . <p> Laying waterproof flooring step by step <h> Sealing the Edges <p> The jointing systems supplied with your flooring will , once snapped together , provide a sealed joint that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow and rot the softer underbelly . <p> When the floor is laid it is time to cover the 6mm expansion joint you have left around the perimeter of the floor . You will have to ensure that this joint is also sealed to prevent water seepage . Use a suitable sealer such as silicone based kitchen or bathroom sealer . Firstly seal the edge of the flooring to the walls edge . Once this is done fix your edgeing in place ( this can be done using very small tack nails but may be better to use a construction adhesive ) . <p> Quadrant trim is the usual method of covering this joint and this is easily applied using a mitre saw . See our project on cutting skirting board to angles , the principles are the same . <p> Flooring edging strip or quadrant trim applied to floor edges <p> With the quadrant strip fixed in place you will now have to seal the joint between the bottom of the strip to the floor and the top of the strip to the wall . Again , use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specified time indicated on the packaging . <p> When you have finished admiring your handy work ensure that you have not dropped any sealer in any undesired places . If so clean it off and then give your floor a good clean using a suitable cleaning solution ( check the manufacturers instructions on your flooring for what you can use ) to remove any unwanted dust and debris . <p> Give Your Floor a Good Clean 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Learn how to correctly wire a plug to the UK standards and also how to safely strip electrical cable . Please note that this project should only be used for wiring a British electrical plug . <h> Stripping Wires and Cables <p> Stripping wires etc can be very easy but a great deal of care needs to be taken . As with most jobs and as we keep repeating in this book , it is much easier , and safer with the right tools . Electricians will use side cutters or cable cutters for all of the jobs you will see demonstrated below and to the side . <p> You will not have the ability , touch or experience to do this and a tiny little nick out of a cable , flex or wires insulation can be lethal as it will allow current to arc across wires . <p> Changing a plug can be every bit as dangerous as drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The images below show how to strip a cable for wiring into a socket or switch . The cable used for appliances is called " Flex " this is dealt with further on . <p> The cable shown is a 2.5mm two core and earth . First the cable is nicked through the sheath at the end . Get this nick in the middle . Pull the sheath apart a little and you will see the bare earth wire in the centre . Clamp the wire with the side cutters gently and , holding the end of the cable in your other hand , pull the wire through the insulation . This will tear quite easily . <p> For those with no experience its best to use pliers for this operation rather than side cutters as shown . Measure the connections you wish to make , add enough on to turn the wires over ( see second image to the left ) do not skimp on the length . " Stretching " cable to meet connections can mean they will pull out over time , do n't for get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to have a little more than you need folded into a socket than too little . <p> Fold back the bare , stripped wires <p> An earth sleeve should be placed onto any bare earth wires . <p> Stripping flex is often more difficult than cable as it is usually more flexible because of thinner sheathing . Nicks in flex wires must be avoided . <p> Proprietary flex strippers can be bought at all DIY stores and these usually rely on a spring to close the cutting blade over the insulation covering . If this spring is too strong it can force the blade through the flex cover and make tiny cuts in the wire insulation beneath . <p> Because the blade is so sharp these nicks can go unnoticed so before connecting a plug or an appliance , twist the wire a little to make sure no nick opens up in the insulation . <h> Wiring a plug <p> Plugs are bought with a paper strip over the three pins which is , most of the time , taken straight off and thrown away .

The connection is made at the end of the fuse in the plug . The live electricity has to pass through the fuse before it gets into the cable leading to your appliance . If anything is wrong , the fuse blows . <p> Wiring diagram for a domestic plug <p> The neutral wire is on the left of the plug and coloured blue and the earth wire , at the top of the plug , coloured green and yellow .

This is to ensure that if the cable clamp fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose , making sure that the electrical appliance continues to be earthed . Most plug terminals have small holes in them into which you place the stripped end of the appropriate wire . <p> Some plug terminals have small , brass , ring clamps which you position the cable under and screw the clamp down to fix the wire . Make sure all connections are tight including the clamp which holds the main body of the flex tight to the plug . If this is allowed to move around it will not be long before it loosens the wires in their terminals and a short circuit could occur . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

Understand how your shower controls work and how you can repair bath or shower mixer valves . Work out the problems with your mixer tap and resolve them easily . <p> There are a number of mixer valves , They all do the same job but in different ways . A bath mixer tap , as with all other taps , is a valve . A shower mixer is the same thing . The differences between them all is how they deal with the water and at which pressure they deal with it . If you are not sure which type of shower would be the best for your home , please see our project on choosing the right shower for your water system . <p> First we can deal with the bath mixer tap . From the dark ages some of us can remember a rubber hose we pushed onto the end of the bath taps to wash our hair . These days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking manual mixer valve tap fitted to bath <p> There are two types of bath mixer tap one simply mixes and let 's you play with the tap controls until the water is at the right temperature for you then you switch over to shower and it sends the same water out through the shower head . <p> For this type of mixer valve , called a manual mixer , to work properly , the hot and the cold need to be at the same , or almost the same , pressure . This is usually ok in an upstairs bathroom because the cold water normally comes from a cold tank in the loft and the hot from an immersion , or hot tank in the airing cupboard . <p> Problems will only arise when one or the other of the supplies is of a different pressure . The other problem with a manual bath mixer tap or valve , is that the water it uses is shared by others in the house . As soon as someone uses a tap elsewhere it will affect the supply to the mixer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click on any of the images above or below to find out more . <p> If different water pressures are encountered , special valves can be installed into the pipe . These are called pressure reducing valves and they are dealt with in a separate project called pressure reducing valves or PRVs . Either the hot or cold pressure can be reduced to equalise pressure going into the valve . <p> The next step up from a manual tap mixer valve is a thermostatic tap mixer valve . These valves are more expensive than manual mixers but they contain a device which measures the temperature of the water leaving the valve . <p> If , as in the case above , someone else in the house flushes a loo the valve will sense that the cold water flow and pressure has dropped within its body . It will regulate the flow of the hot water immediately to stop the water scalding the person in the shower . <p> Thermostatic mixer valves come in varying ranges also and it really is no wonder the layman gets confused . The valves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both . <p> The manufactures label on the valve you buy will tell you which it is but if you want to be specific : - Low pressure valves can be used where the water pressure at the valve or tap can be measured from 0.2 - 1 bar . This is the usual situation in a bathroom where both hot and cold water are fed by a tank . <p> From bath mixer valves we move up to shower mixer valves . These valves , as well as coming in the ranges described above , offer two further choices . Surface mounted or hidden . The important thing to remember with shower mixer valves is that if they are low pressure and you are relying on the existing pressure you have at you bathroom taps , a shower valve will certainly not make it any better , in fact more often than not it will make it worse . <p> Large style contemporary shower head <p> Wall face mounted mixer tap <p> In a normal bathroom , with water supplied by tanks , the water pressure is entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This height is called the head and by placing a mixer valve halfway up the wall you are in fact reducing the head . This will reduce the pressure . <p> The surface shower mixer valves , above , do exactly what it says on the tin . You can see all of it . The valve itself , whether manual or thermostatic , is quite a big affair and although , usually , attractive , can take up quite a bit of room . The pipework can very often be surface mounted also making installation much easier especially if you are putting a pump in the system . <p> Cross section diagram of pumped mixer valve installation <p> Hidden valves require a bathroom refit basically . They are really attractive and give a really modern feel to the bathroom but the installation is tricky and not for the faint hearted . <p> The pipework needs to be hidden behind the tiles as does the shower valve . All that is exposed are the controls and the shower head . In the example on the right above the shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shower head and controls but many hidden valve sets come with a head which is fixed to the wall and is fed from the supply which is hidden inside the wall . This can be seen in our diagram to the left . <p> If you plan to install a hidden shower valve make absolutely sure you tighten every single compression fitting and gland . If the system leaks you may not know anything about it until your lounge ceiling caves in . <p> The diagram on the left shows the installation of a hidden dual control thermostatic mixer valve . In this diagram it is pumped but it does not have to be . The water enters the valve and is mixed as with every other type of mixer valve . The power control then decides how much water to send to the head . <p> All of the parts shown here , including the hidden pump , can be bought separately , as can pressure reducing valves should you need them .

The principles of this job are exactly the same for changing iron water mains so the same steps apply . <h> Why would I want to change Lead or Iron Water Pipes ? <p> Until the 1960 's lead was used for almost all water supply pipes and although the water is treated by your local authority , small amounts of lead can find their way into the water you use . This also applies to rust from iron pipes . All local authority water boards will , if asked , take samples of your water and test it for you free of charge . <p> You are responsible for all of the pipework in your property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street the main is in . This main will normally be fairly close to the property boundary . The diagram below outlines the situation found with most properties but there are exceptions to this rule . In the case of an exception , such as you property being beyond the end of a main , contact your local water board to see who is responsible for the incoming pipe . <p> Lead water main cross section <p> If you share a water pipe with a neighbour you are jointly responsible for that pipe . If you then want your own connection to the main you may have to pay for this . <h> What do I Change Lead Watermain Pipework to ? <p> The new pipe should be a blue plastic pipe which is made from Medium Density Polyethylene ( MDPE ) . It will have a minimum of 25mm external diameter until it gets to your internal stop tap when copper is usually installed . If however there is any possibility that your ground , or the ground surrounding your property may be contaminated with petrol or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these situations a special foil wrapped pipe must be used . <h> What do I do if I Want to Change Lead Mains Water Pipes ? <p> Contact your local water authority . They will come out and check if you share a supply with anyone . They will advise you if there would be any charge and advise you on where to lay your new pipe . <p> Where to Lay New Pipework <p> You will , in most cases , be expected to lay your new pipe slightly beyond the property boundary for connection to the main by the local water company . You will also need to get prices from local plumbers for changing the internal pipes from lead to copper . <p> Depth of New Watermain Pipework <p> Your pipe must be laid in a trench between 750mm and 1350mm deep and it must enter the property and remain at that depth for a minimum of 750mm from the external face of the wall of the property . It will then rise up to the internal stop tap usually located under the kitchen sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bend upwards and for all pipes higher than 750mm deep the pipe must be insulated to BS 6700 . <p> Lagging must also be used for all lengths of pipe passing through unheated parts of the property such as basements and underfloor voids . The lagging insulation should be as follows : <p> For a 25mm pipe , 28mm of insulation must be used <p> for a 32mm pipe , 35mm of insulation must be used <p> The insulation must also be designed for frost protection <p> Do I Have to Change Anything Else ? <p> When your new pipe is installed to your stop cock , if the first internal length of pipe , i.e. the length of pipe from your stop cock to the first ( drinking water ) tap is lead or iron , this must be replaced also . <p> Passing Through Foundations and Under Buildings <p> If the new pipe needs to pass through any foundations or is buried under the building , it must be placed in a duct of at least 100mm diameter . The duct must allow for the pipe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipe , and clamped to it when it gets inside the property , to trace or pull through a new pipe should any faults develop . <p> Get it Checked <p> Before you fill the trench in a member of the local water authority must inspect it to make sure it has been laid correctly . <p> Earthing <p> Please check that your old water pipe , where it entered the building , was not used as an earthing point as many were pre 1966 . You need to contact and electrician if you are in any doubt . <p> Filling the Trench for Your New Watermain <p> When you backfill the trench care should be taken . No stones or bricks should be near the pipe , nor should any other sharp objects . For safety 's sake it is recommended that the first 100mm of backfill be sand and the pipe itself is laid on 100mm of sand also .

@@41625047 @1625047/ <p> Summary : How to attach a security chain to your front door . Security chains allow you to partially open the door to talk to strangers and find out why they have knocked . If set properly they will allow the caller to pass you an identification card if necessary but it will not open wide enough for them to gain entry without your permission . The security chain gives you full control over who enters your home . In this DIY guide we show you how you can fit a door chain in 3 easy to follow steps and ensure your home is safe and secure . <h> Step 1 : Fitting the Security Door Chain to the Frame <p> The first step is to locate the strongest part of your door . Usually this is wide rail fitted horizontally in the centre of the door , called the lock rail . <p> Not all doors feature this so if yours does n't , do n't worry . Given that it is an external door you are fitting your security chain to , it will have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , so you will be fine to fix it in place here . <p> The lock rail for an external door is designed to receive mortice locks and latches so needs to be a little thicker than the rest of the door , as the mortice lock itself is quite wide . <p> How to identify the different parts of an external door <p> Having decided where the main chain keep will go , look to the door frame to position the chain . The chain bracket can be fitted horizontally as shown in the image below , or it can be fitted vertically if needed . <p> Most security chains are made to similar dimensions , so if you are thinking of buying one check that you have at least 34mm of door frame showing on the closing side ( leading edge ) of your door . <p> Dimensions of a standard door lock positioned horizontally <p> Hold the chain bracket to the frame , opposite the top half of the lock rail ( A ) . The reason we fit to the top half of the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted in the centre of this rail . With a big hole cut for the letter box , the centre of the rail is marginally weaker than the timber top and bottom which run straight through the mid section of the door without interruption . <p> Identifying the wide lock rail of an external door <p> Mark the position of the screw holes for the chain . As mentioned it does not matter if the chain is fitted vertically or horizontally , it depends on the room you have available on the frame . What does matter however is that when the security chain is not being used it is fitted in a way which allows the free end to be hung in the chain bracket slot . This saves it dangling about and getting caught between door and frame which could potentially damage the door and also the frame . <p> Marking position of screw holes for security chain bracket <p> Drill pilot holes for the door chain bracket screws . Make sure you use screws which are at least 1-inch ( 25mm ) long . <p> Fix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have just created . Be careful if you use a battery operated screwdriver in this position as the door frame is very often close up to the door reveal and , if the screws are driven in straight as they really should be , the spinning of the drill chuck could easily rub against the door reveal as do some damage . <p> In the video below you will see us fitting the screws in at a slight angle . One reason for this is that a door chain had been fitted on this door before but the screws were too short and the chain got ripped out . We therefore screwed in at an angle to ensure we were getting the best fix possible . <p> Use a screwdriver to fit security chain bracket <p> Hang the security chain in the slot provided ( A in the image below ) to keep it out of the way for step 2 . <p> Keeping the security chain out of the way will reduce risk of damage to the edge of the door <p> The security door chain bracket is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be hung up , out of the way in the spare section of bracket ( A ) . This stops it accidentally swinging in between the door and the frame and damaging the edge of either , or both . <p> The position of the security chain bracket must allow for safe keeping of the chain <h> Step 2 - Fitting the Security Door Chain Keep to the Door <p> Place the security chain keep onto the lock rail of the door opposite the chain bracket you have just fixed . Drop the chain into it . Slide the fitting towards the centre of the door so that the chain tightens up but you are still able to lift it out when the door is closed . <p> Mark the keep position of the security door chain by sliding it along the lock rail until you are happy <p> The door should not be allowed to open wide enough for even the tiniest hand to be able to lift the chain out of its retaining bracket . <p> In most cases this will mean that the front edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door . The nearer the edge of the door you place the keep , the wider the door will open when the chain is locked in its closed position . <p> When you have established exactly where the keep needs to go so that it can easily be fitted and removed from the keep and also prevent the door from opening too widely , mark its final position . <p> When you are sure of position of chain keep and mark it <p> Hold the keep in position or mark the holes if needed with a pencil or pen . Additionally , before marking them , use a small spirit level such as a boat float to make sure the keep is level . <p> Once you have ensured it is level and you have made your marks , drill your pilot holes as before . <p> Drilling pilot holes for security chain keep <p> With your holes now drilled you can fix the keep into its final position . <p> Carefully screw a security door frame keep into position <h> Step 3 - Testing the Fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door chain keep into position , drop the chain into the slot and open the door .

In this project we show you how to correctly cut differing types of metal including metal pipes such as copper pipes and also sheet metal . We also show you what specific tools can be used to do this including hacksaws , jigsaws and also tin snips and how they should be used safely to avoid any injury . We also explain how you can then use a file to clean off any sharp edges . <p> Firstly before you start cutting any form of metal you will need to take precautions . Freshly cut metal edges will be rough and have sharp burrs , painful to remove . So gloves and eye protection and overalls should be worn at all times when dealing with metal work . <p> When cutting metal you will have several choices on how to carry out this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The metals you are most likely to find yourself using are steel , iron , aluminium , brass and copper . <p> Hacksaw frame and blade - Available in our superstore <h> Cutting Metal With a Blade <p> This operation can be carried out with either a hacksaw , jigsaw with metal blades or cutting / scribing blades if the metal is lead . <p> Different blades will be needed to cut different metals as some metals are harder than others eg : cutting aluminum and say stainless steel . The softer the metal , the smaller and finer the teeth will need to be to cut a controlled straight line in sheet metal . The piece of metal that you are cutting should also be clamped so no slip can occur while you are cutting . <h> Cutting Pipe <p> When cutting a metal pipe it is always advised to clamp the pipe so the cut is stable and controlled . This procedure is normally carried out with the use of a hacksaw or junior hacksaw depending on the size of pipe . If cutting copper pipe , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pipe cutters and pipe slices , as well as the affore mentioned hacksaws . <p> Jigsaw fitted with metal cutting blade - Available in our superstore <p> To cut metal pipe with a hacksaw , firstly clamp your pipe , then measure and mark the required length with a scribe as pencil may smudge or rub off . Check that your blade is new or of a good working order and fixed securely in the cutting tool . Always start your cutting movements slowly to create a cutting groove which your blade will remain in for the duration of the cut . Once you have finished your cut you will find that the edges of each piece of pipe will have rough edges ( burrs ) which are sharp jagged fine pieces of metal created during the cutting process . Remove these with a file or emery paper . ( metalworks version of sand paper ) . <h> Cutting Sheet Metal <p> Position the sheet of metal to be cut onto a stable work bench with the section to be cut over-hanging the work bench . This way any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below your cutting line . If possible , always clamp your sheet metal to the work bench . This is another safety procedure but also enables you to produce a clean and straight cut . <p> Tin snips and sheet metal cutters available in our superstore <p> This procedure will normally be performed with the use of a Jigsaw ( with metal blade ) or Tin snips . If using an electrical device always commence your cutting action slowly and gently . Forcing a cutting action will always lead to a mistake or damaged tool . If the section of metal being cut off is too big for one person to handle then it is advisable to have another person on hand to help you out . You do not want an accident to happen ! <p> Files and file sets available in our superstore <p> Remember newly cut edges of metal will always be rough and sharp .

Understand the pros and cons of the different types of laser levels and which you should use for you project so that you choose the right laser level . Learn how to use a fixed or rotary laser level accurately . <h> What is a Laser Level and What 's it Used for ? <p> A laser level is used to project a constant and common level line of light onto a surface on a horizontal or vertical plane . This is most useful in transferring a level from one place to another as is required , for example , when fitting picture rails or dado rails to the wall of a room . <p> There are many different types of leveling devices but a laser level will consist of a device which incorporates mainly a spirit level or pendulum level with the use of a laser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Spot Laser Levels <p> This type of laser level is a fixed laser level that is fixed in a set position to project a level line of light . It is just for projecting a straight line of light on a single plain from which markings can be made for positioning or using for calculations . <p> Using a Spot Laser Level to align and level brackets on a wall <p> This type of laser level simply points a laser spot at the wall which you transfer by moving the head of the laser . They are very simple to set up and use ( Have a look at the video below ) . <p> As they are less sophisticated than other types of laser level , they tend to be cheaper and simpler to use . They are less versatile and are ideal for periodic use at home rather than continuous use on site where a more fully featured device might be preferred and warrant the extra cost . <p> Spot levels are used to transfer a level round the room for 1 item , perhaps getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spot levels are ideal in the garden ; laying a patio to the correct fall for example . <h> Line or Cross Line Laser Levels <p> This is a slightly more advanced levels than the spot or line level as it will project a cross on to the wall . This is very useful of you need to make sure that you have a vertical line as well as a horizontal level line . <p> How to use a cross line laser to put pictures or hooks <p> It is a static laser which you move by hand to transfer a point or continuous line from one side/end of a room to another while another line at 90- to the horizontal line is shown on wall . This is slightly more complex than a simple spot or point laser level , so it does take marginally more setting up , but most models are very simple to use these days . They do tend to be a little more expensive but they allow you to get the job done a little more easily and quickly . <p> Like the fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting up shelves , pictures and hook ; anything that you need to attach to the wall and that must be level . A line level is good for seeing at a glance how level the wall you are building is and how it corresponds to the wall you need to build on the other side of the garden or the top of the fence . <p> Line levels would be used for getting a constant line to put lots of sockets in , or a dado rail , or floor screed , floor slab . When you are working on projects where a level critical all the time and need the line to be constant then a line laser level is what you should use . <h> Automatic Rotation or Rotary Laser Levels <p> A rotary laser line of light is projected with use of a laser and the use of mirrors . A rotating projection unit which spins at speed while projecting a constant line around an enclosed space ( colours of laser lights most commonly used are red / green ) . <p> This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the laser that is all at a uniform level - this can be seriously helpful if you need to get a precise level across the whole room . This is great to skirting , dado rails , levelling windows , doors and other openings - there is no shortage of uses ! <p> To set up a laser level on a tripod you must firstly erect the tripod . Most modern tripods come with a levelling bubble built in and individually adjustable legs . This process will be repeated on the laser levelling device once it is position on the tripod . More expensive models of the laser level will come with a fully automated levelling system . These levels are used when an accurate measurement for setting out , measuring and calculating a required distance are needed . If this much accuracy is required it is advisable to buy or use a device with a built in self levelling action . <p> The most common use of a Rotary Laser Level is to find a set constant height around a room for a vertical measurement ( up or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of setting or constructing i.e. level floor surface , also ceilings / suspended ceilings .

Clear out your blocked drains without having to call an expensive plumber , and find out all the equipment that you need to get it unblocked with the minimum of effort . <p> Unblocking toilets etc can be a relatively easy , but still dirty job . The key here , as with 99% of jobs in the building and DIY world , is to have the right tools . It is also necessary to wear a very good pair of rubber gloves . We will not go into the diseases toilets and waste pipes can carry , but trust us , you do not want any of them ! <p> Rubber Gloves <p> A sink , bath , basin and shower tray can be unblocked in a few ways . An ordinary plunger can be used by placing it over the plug hole and pushing up and down on the handle . This creates a force in both directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release . The idea here is that the blockage is dislodged and breaks up allowing it to flow down the drain . The plungers we recommend for this are below . <p> Hand Operated Plunger <p> Power Plunger <p> Water Injection Plunger <p> Toilet Plunger <p> For an easier way to unblock sinks etc .... you can now use what is known as a power plunger . This ( above centre ) tool is simply " pumped up " by pumping the handle at the end and placed over the plug hole . By pressing the trigger all the compressed air is released , forcing the blockage down the pipe or breaking it into bits . <p> Our personal favourite at Diydoctor is the one above , the water injector . Put some water in the sink , basin , bath or shower tray and stand the pump in it . Pull up on the handle to fill it with water . Then place it over the plug hole and push down hard , then pull up again etc etc . The water is pushed at great force through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces explained in the first example with the plunger are put into operation . If your blockage is within a couple of meters of the plug hole , this little beast will clear it . <p> Finally , for sinks , basins , baths and showers , there is the corkscrew cable . The flexible wire is pushed into the drain pipe , wiggled about to break up the blockage , and wound back in . Very simple , very effective . <p> Corkscrew Cable <p> For unblocking toilets , the blue plunger at the top is the tool to use if you think your blockage is in the U bend at the back of the toilet . The action is exactly the same , push and pull to break up the blockage . For blockages which appear to be further down it may be necessary to open the manhole to inspect and clear . <p> You may have a visible soil and vent pipe ( SVP ) coming out of your bathroom which you can follow down to the ground and look around for the nearest manhole to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be needed . There are two types of manhole for the purposes of this project . The surface water manholes which collect water from your rain gutters , and the foul water manholes which collect the waste water from the sinks , basins , baths , showers and toilets . <p> These will smell so identification should not be too much of a problem . Although your toilet may be blocked there is a chance that some seepage is occurring through the blockage and you may need to identify this to see which manhole it is running into . This can be done by adding a little dye into the water and watching at the various manholes to trace the flow . <p> Drain Dye <p> Drain Rod <p> Once you have traced the manhole or manholes you may well be able to rod back up towards the house . Drain rods come in lengths of one meter and are screwed together to make a long length . They are very flexible and are simply inserted into the drain pipe and pushed into the run . You will feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blockage with the rod . <p> Drain rods come with various fittings to screw on the end which , in theory , make the removal of blockages easier . We always start with nothing except the rod , prodding and poking until the obstacle ( usually loads of toilet paper or nappies ) clears . Occasionally we have had to use a worm screw ( this comes with the set ) . <p> Sometimes you may not feel a blockage as it is either too far or too soft to register . Then its time to screw on the rubber plunger . Use the rods then as a giant plunger , pushing and pulling up and down the pipe . This will create the same pressures again as mentioned above and release the blockage . <p> Cross section of drain when viewed through manhole cover <p> The diagram above represents the basics of what you will find in a manhole . Usually a brick built structure ( modern manholes are sometimes formed with precast concrete rings ) with a sloping floor called benching , which slopes down into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing the manhole cover which can sometimes be very heavy , the rods should be screwed together one at a time and pushed into the drain pipe . Sometimes if your pipe is well blocked , the channel and benching may be covered in water making the drain hole difficult to see .... Poke around with the rod until you find the entrance . <p> A word of warning : some manholes can be quite deep . These manholes are normally fitted with iron steps built into the sides of the brickwork or concrete . This is obviously for climbing down ... BUT ; manholes are very dangerous places as the gasses they contain can be overpowering . Do not go down into a manhole without someone at the top to make sure you are ok .... Sounds very silly in your own back garden , but professional builders have drowned in manholes because they were overcome by the fumes . <p> Very occasionally you will meet a blockage which can not be reached from the toilet end or from the manhole end . This means it may well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these will have access plates , which should be undone very very carefully for obvious reasons . A lot of SVP 's will be boxed in and this can cause real disruption . If you can not unblock the drain/pipes etc by your self and you feel you have established that the blockage is in your SVP then I 'm afraid it may be time to call a plumber . The mess that can be created by this kind of blockage is something you really do not want to deal with if you are not sure of what you are doing . <p> One last word of warning . Drain rods will screw together in a normal clockwise way . When you are rodding a drain , the rods will turn in your hand , its impossible to stop them .... Make sure you deliberately turn the rods as you push and prod and make sure you are turning them clockwise . If you do not do this , and without you realising the rods are slipping anti-clockwise in your hands , they can undo themselves . <p> Leaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help your blockage we can promise you that . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775

In this project we will show you how to build a set of fitted shelves in an alcove without using any brackets to give the effect that they are floating shelves . <p> We therefore decided to use Redwood for the shelves so they could be stained later to match the floor and doors . The skirting we used when we did the floor was 6 x 1 inch Redwood so we used the same for the top of the shelves and to hide the support battens we clad the underside with tongue and grooved matchboard . The support battens were 2 x 1 inch treated softwood and were fixed using red wall plugs and 3 inch number 8 screws . See our fixing to masonry project for details on how to do this . A battery screwdriver is a must when undertaking a project like this . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every screw is driven in properly . When buying a cordless drill/screwdriver do not buy one under 12 volts and if possible pay a little extra for one with 2 batteries . Its a real nuisance if your battery runs out half way through a job and you have to wait 3 hours for the battery to recharge . <p> To fix a timber batten hold the batten in position on the wall making sure it is level . Mark the wall with a pencil . Take the batten down and drill a 5mm hole in the centre of the batten to push a screw threw . Put the batten back on the wall to the line you have drawn . Push a screw through the pre drilled hole and wiggle it on the wall to mark it . Using a 6mm masonry bit , drill a hole to the correct depth . Push in the wall plug and screw the timber up tight to the line . You can now use the masonry bit to drill right through the timber and the wall ( do n't forget to alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Push the wall plug into the timber , turn the screw in a couple of turns and tap it through with a hammer . You will feel the plug slip through the timber into the wall and when you do it is time to screw the screw in . This method saves you marking each hole individually which can lead to mistakes . To be fair it does eventually blunt the masonry bit slightly but it takes about 650 holes through timber to do this and the time saved , together with the accuracy involved , makes it worth it . <p> Alcove Suitabel for Adding Shelves <p> Shelf Bearers fixed in position in alcove <p> Above left you can see the alcove we started with . The 2 x 1 battens are fixed to the wall at heights dictated by the clients books , stereo etc . Make sure you think about this before starting your project .

Although work can be undone its much easier to get it right the first time . <p> The wall at the back of the shelves was bowed as this is a very old house .

Quite often , building work involves replacing old bricks or mortar with new and this replacement always tends to stand out from its old , weathered and faded surroundings . The brick tint from Bebbingtons allows you to match the new brickwork and mortar to the old making the repair work much less obvious . The simple to use dye involves applying a new coat each time you want to darken an area and adding water to lighten making it very easy to use and blend with existing colour tones . <h> What Does Brick and Weathering Tint do ? <p> This review of the Bebbington Weathering tint shows that it is possible not only to match new bricks and other masonry products to those around it but that by using Bebbingtons , the new work will weather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down new brickwork has been an age-old problem in the construction industry . <p> Today 's enlightened home-owners are saving thousands of pounds by improving , not moving . With extensions , conversions , refurbishments and alterations come new roofs , new walls , new patios , new stonework and many other projects involving masonry . <p> Bebbingtons Weathering Tint for matching bricks <p> In most cases , the new work sticks out like a sore thumb but with an application of Bebbingtons as shown in the review video above , these " striking " changes can be a thing of the past . <p> The review shows that Bebbingtons is excellent for all properties as the Weathering Tint does not clog the masonry or the joints and does not form a surface film . <p> This keeps the masonry breathing all the time , allowing moisture to evaporate . The colour stays " fast " and the quality and integrity of the original work is not compromised . <h> On Site test of Bebbingtons Weathering Tint <p> A Very old building with a huge barn conversion going on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some builders who did not consider matching the mortar colour when they added new stone and we have a property which looks a little like a patchwork quilt . <p> As well as the old stone building you can see in the video , we took Bebbingtons to a recently altered stables where the new blockwork stood out so much it nearly shone ! ! <p> Then we tried it on an old replacement clay Pan-Tile close to Nunney Castle in Somerset . The answers to all our questions are obvious in the video but this on site test really did put Bebbingtons Weathering Tint through its paces and it came out a clear winner . <p> On the stonework and the tile you can see in the video , we had to darken the original application of tint . This is done simply by over coating as many times as is necessary . The tint gets darker the more coats that are applied but do follow the instructions below to make sure you allow a suitable time in between coats . <p> On the blockwork in the video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bebbington 's . This too was easy ; we just watered it down to reach the desired colour shade ! <p> When applying the tint , try it out on a hidden or out-of-the-way corner to make sure you have the right shade . Remember the tint will dry out lighter than it 's original application colour so give yourself plenty of time . <p> However excellent this product is ( and you can see our opinion of it below ) It is not a " Harry Potter magic trick " and as with everything that is long-lasting , the better the preparation , the better the job . <p> A couple of hours spent making absolutely sure you have the right colour match will be a job that lasts you a life time . <h> How Bebbingtons Weathering Tint works <p> We had to put this section in the review because the answer is : No-One knows ! !

To do so you will need to shake the bottle thourghly for at least 15-20 seconds and once you have done this , pour the contents into a suitable container . Also , please make sure that there is none of the pigment remaining in the bottle . <p> Once the above steps have been completed you can then start to apply the tint . When applying , ensure that you stir the tint after every other brush application to make sure that the tint remains at the same tone . <p> In terms of what brush to use : <p> Bricks : Use either a two and a half inch brush or a two inch brush with natural bristles <p> Standard Joints : Use a half inch brush for most joints but please select the correct brush for the size of joint you are covering so that you do not inadvertently cover any surrounding surfaces <p> As with most painting jobs , to avoid any drips and spillage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any excess . <h> Things to think about Before Starting <p> To confirm the colour match it is always a good idea to test on a small and discreet area first . To get a good idea of the final colour you will need to leave the tint to cure for a full 12 hours . <p> In respect to the surface you are covering , it will need to be completely dry . Any tinting should not be done in temperatures below 5c . <p> If you require a lighter finishing tone , this can be achieved easily through diluting the tint with water . This can be done up to 50% , but if you go over this you risk weakening the mix to such an extreme that it may not correctly bond with the surface it is being applied to . <p> To create a darker tone , simply apply additional applications of the tint until you reach the desired colour .

We also wanted to see if the addition of the retarder allowed for a better finish due to the extra time that we had to work with it and also what benefit this would give to a plasterer out on site . <h> What is EXTRATIME Plaster Retarder ? <p> We organised a way to test the setting time of EXTRATIME against the setting time of an ordinary plaster mix by dividing a plasterboard stud wall in two halves using scrim tape as a boundary marker . One half of the wall was done in plaster containing the retardant while the other half was done , at the same time ( albeit 3 minutes difference ) . <p> It was clear , even after the first of two coats that EXTRATIME was going to hold back the setting of the plaster .

That is an extra hour to get 5 square meters finished and all you have to do is add 1 sachet of EXTRATIME to the water before you mix your skim plaster . <p> The trade will find a massive use for this plaster retarder too . Huge warehouse walls would usually have to be done in two hits as its impossible to get huge amounts of plaster laid on and floated without quite a few guys . Now a single plasterer can cover a greater area giving him plenty of time to come back and float up . <p> To sum up , this really is a great product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , for years .

All of the old tile adhesive was removed and the existing skim plaster had a coat of PVA applied to remove some of the wall absorption . <p> Mixing multi-finish skim plaster in a bucket using plaster retarder <p> Two buckets of multi-finish skim plaster were then mixed at the same time . 1 bucket contained plaster with EXTRATIME in the water , the other , a perfectly ordinary bucket of multi-finish skim plaster . The sachet was simply cut open and tipped into the water , which was then thoroughly whisked using a mixing paddle as you can see in the video . <p> Once the buckets were mixed they were taken over to the prepared wall which had been divided in half by using a couple of lines of scrim tape vertically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape , as plasterers know , can be used to provide a straight edge when large areas are plastered in sections .

Two coats of plaster were applied , giving a total thickness of 4 to 5mm of skim plaster . The walls were then allowed to set for the usual 10 minutes it takes for a skim plastered wall to start going hard . <p> Comparision of plastered walls <p> We used the fingerprint test to see if the walls were ready .

It took another 35 minutes for that half of the wall to be ready for trowelling . <p> Once set , the EXTRATIME wall was trowelled up to a lovely smooth finish just as the ordinary wall had been . Apart from the setting time , there was absolutely no difference in the feel of either plastered surface . The workability was not affected and the finish was the same . <h> How Plaster Retarder Works <p> A little like the KFC Chicken recipe and the secret sauce used in Heinz Baked Beans , the chemical formula for the retarding agent used is a well kept , and closely guarded secret .

They know how much to lay on so that when they get to the end of one wall , the first wall they did will be ready for trowelling up . This allows the to move round a room freely , easily and quickly . <p> An hours working time gained with skim plaster by using ExtraTime plaster retarder <p> The Home Improver however does not practice . Because it looks so easy , they start on a wall with little preparation expecting to float gracefully over the surface of the wall making it nice and smooth in no time . <p> It 's not until they have spent 20 minutes trying to flatten out the first section that they realise the plaster is almost hard in the bucket with 3/4 of the wall left to do . <p> Its benefits are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include such things as allowing larger areas to be plastered before the setting time is reached providing more time to get a much more professional finish . <p> The real benefit to the tradesman that uses bag after bag of skim plaster , is that every sachet of gives exactly the same results , in the same conditions . The timing can be worked out perfectly and there is no panic , however much of the wall you have laid on . <h> Docs Opinion of EXTRATIME Plaster Retarder <p> We love it ! ! ! <p> We knew from the moment we heard about it , just how useful this could be for both the Home Improver and the trade . Our job of course , is to keep an eye out for things that will make DIY and Home Improvement easier for you guys clicking into DIY Doctor regularly and this is certainly one of those things . <p> In the same conditions , it will give you the same results time and time again .

@@41625058 @1625058/ <p> Summary : Connecting waste pipes from sinks , basins , baths and showers to main drainage pipes . In this project we show you how to connect a variety of waste pipes such as 32mm and 40mm plastic waste pipe into the mains drainage or soil pipe . We will be joining the pipework using solvent weld to ensure that any joints are long lasting and do not leak and we will be using a strap on boss to join the new pipework into the existing soil pipe . <h> Connecting Waste Pipes to Main Drainage on the Ground Floor <p> Your waste pipe has been marked to finish at the face of the wall . When a bend is glued onto this pipe it will stand far enough away from the wall to enable you to fix pipe clips to the wall to keep the waste system solid . <p> The image above shows a typical installation with the waste pipe from the washing machine meeting up with the waste pipe from the kitchen sink in a Y junction . Both wastes then go down into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drainage run and onto a foul water manhole . The end of the pipe is concreted into the gully but the end can still be seen through the grid . <p> Access gulley <p> Different Sizes of Plastic Waste Pipe <p> In order for the pipe you have fitted to get down into the gully you must fix a bend to it . Waste drainage in this country is either 32mm , 40mm 0r 50mm. 50mm is generally used in public toilets and wo n't be seen a great deal in domestic situations . 32mm is generally used for hand basins and low volume outlets and 40mm used for showers , baths and sinks . <p> Solvent Weld or Push Fit ? <p> To make life difficult there are also two types of pipe ! One type is called " Push fit " and the other " Solvent weld " . Push fit is the real DIY type where all of the fittings have rubber collars on and the pipes simply push into them . This should be simple , but it is n't . It is a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of pulling off at the most inappropriate of times , we recommend solvent weld every time . <p> Its considerably cheaper and so much easier to work with . Basically its a tin of glue with a brush built into the lid . Paint the glue on both ends of the joint , push them together and they are welded for life . They will never leak and you can blow them as hard as you like with any type of pipe unblocking equipment and the welded joint will never move . <p> Layout Your Waste Pipe System Before you Stick it Together <p> One thing to remember , where ever possible lay out your system in a dry dummy run . When you glue it together it is permanent so any mistakes can not be undone and you need to start again . The first image below shows a joint being welded and the image below that shows the completed joint . <p> Solvent welding 32mm waste pipes together <p> Solvent Welded joint <p> Solvent welding leaves the whole job looking much neater than push fit as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more professional . <p> Starting Your External Waste Pipe Run <p> For our scenario in part 1 , we now need to glue a bend onto the pipe we have in the wall . You have already taken it out so give the end of the pipe a wipe and wipe the inside collar of the bend . Apply glue , push the two together with a little twisting motion and you have a solvent weld joint . Put the pipe back through the wall and connect it back to the under-sink drainage . <p> The pipe can now go down into a back inlet gully . These gullies are used so it is possible to watch the water pouring out into the gully . This makes it easy to see if there is a blockage or not . It is the same principle as a toilet overflow . The quicker you can see there is a problem , the quicker you can put it right and the less damage caused . <p> Adding an Access Plug to Prevent Blockages in Your Pipework <p> In the system we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall from the washing machine and immediately turning right to meet the other drainage . If there was a blockage it would probably occur right on this bend as this is where the water is most constricted . <p> For this reason the bend needs to be accessible and this is done by using an access plug . In the examples shown below , instead of a bend being fitted to the end of the pipe , a T junction is welded on . The access plug is welded into the end of the T junction and the pipe into the other end . Now the entire length of the pipe run can be rodded in the event of a blockage . <h> Connecting Waste Pipes to a Soil and Vent Pipe on Upper Floors <p> For an upstairs installation nothing changes until the pipe has the bend on and it is all sticking out of the wall . Then it needs to be connected to the nearest soil and vent pipe ( SVP ) . <p> Measure a length of pipe , allowing for the piece that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position on the SVP where it needs to be fitted . <p> Line up waste pipe with SVP <p> Cutting a Hole in a Soil and Vent Pipe and Fixing the Strap on Boss <p> Drill the hole out with a hole saw . You will see down the page that we are fitting what is called a strap on boss to the pipe which will make a watertight connection between the waste pipe and the SVP but the strap on boss has a small lip on the underside which fits snugly into the hole you are now drilling so do n't just drill the hole to the diameter of the waste pipe , it needs to be bigger to suit the lip on the boss . <p> Glue strap on boss into position <p> Measure the diameter of the lip and drill the hole . Because a hole saw bit has a normal pilot drill bit in the centre it is easy to line up and the pilot bit stops the drilled circle of plastic falling into the pipe . Brush some glue around the hole and push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe . <p> Strap on boss in position <p> Fit a Rubber Gasket <p> As well as the strap on boss you will need a rubber gasket . Rubber gaskets come with two sizes of hole . 32 and 40mm allowing you to use the same size of strap on boss for both types of pipe connection . Ignore the pink blob in the below image , this is expanding foam used to keep the pipe in place as it comes out of the wall . <p> Pipe ready to be fitted with rubber gasket in place <p> The top of the pipe , and the collar of the wall outlet can now be glued and the pipe can be fitted between the bend and the strap on boss . You will need a little room to play with here and its a good idea to have the wall outlet pipe still loose at this time . We had not finished connecting the soil and vent pipe so we had some movement there . <p> Cutting the Waste Pipe and Joining to the Soil Pipe <p> When cutting the pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you do not cut it too long . If any of the pipe sticks down into the soil and vent pipe it could possible catch a piece of toilet paper and start a blockage . If you have ever had to rod a drain you will be amazed at how easily a blockage can form . The other reason for not cutting it long is because without a lot of movement in the other parts of the pipework its really hard to squeeze it into the collar at one end and the strap on boss at the other ! <p> Pipe in gasket and finished <h> Compression Waste Fittings <p> There is one more type of waste pipe we should tell you about and its called the compression type . This type uses joints and fittings which can all be tightened up onto either 32 or 40mm pipe and it is useful if ever you have to join the two or you need to join solvent weld pipe to pushfit pipe as these are not compatible in any other way . <p> The drawback is that compression fittings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to use them at all if we can help it . Having said that , there is always one straight compression coupling in our bag in case we have to make a difficult connection . <p> We hope our waste fitting projects have gone someway in solving the mysteries of getting waste water out of the house !

@@41625062 @1625062/ <p> Summary : Tiling is one of the most popular DIY projects but before you begin your tiling job you need to choose the right tiles . We are often asked ' What Tiles Do I Need ' whether you are tiling a wall or picking floor tiles . In this DIY Project you will find information about the various different ceramic tiles for kitchen , bathrooms and other areas in the home . We provide information on standard tile size and shapes . Which colours and patterns to pick and what textures and finishes are available . We give advice to make sure when you 're choosing tiles for kitchens and bathrooms , they will suit the room or area that you are tiling . We also give you some ideas and different ways you can lay tiles to create different patterns and effects . <p> Whether you are planning on tiling a wall or floor , a kitchen or a bathroom , you will need to choose from a plethora of styles , sizes and colours of tile . Our guide will help you to choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think About When Choosing Wall Tiles <p> Tile Sizes <p> When considering tile size you should take the size of the room into consideration . A small shower room will look odd if you choose to use very large tiles in it , and a huge kitchen wo n't look right tiled with small mosaic tiles . Pick the size of tile that will complement your room space <p> Kitchens are traditionally tiled with standard 100mm square tiles , but rectangular tiles to resemble brickwork are becoming popular now , as are larger tiles . <p> Standard white wall tile in a shower cubicle <p> Brick effect tiles <p> It depends in part in how much of the kitchen you are going to tile " you might want just a few rows of tiles above the worktop , or you might be planning to tile the whole wall , in which case a larger tile is more appropriate . <p> When tiling a bathroom , the space in between the toilet , sink and bath or shower needs to be considered . If these items are close together , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow better and reducing the need to cut tiles into awkward shapes . <p> If you have a large room , larger tiles mean less grout showing and a sleeker feel to the space . <p> One very important thing to think about and in many ways will dictate the size of tile you can use , is how flat your walls are . We say this because if your walls are particularly wavey and uneven then using large tiles is not the way to go due to the fact that any peaks or raised areas in the wall will be accentuate and tile will not line up . <p> In this situation you have a few choices , the first being stripping the whole wall back , leveling it off and then replastering to give a flat surface or you can use smaller tiles that will be a little forgiving over the raised areas . <p> A plain square layout can be broken up with a border of feature tiles " thin rectangular or small mosaic tiles of a contrasting colour . <p> Bathrooms often use large rectangular tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rows are higher than the width of a column . <p> Smaller rectangular tiles ( even down to mosaic size ) can be used in a brickwork pattern to great effect . <p> White tiled wall broken up with border - Image courtesy of the gbtilesbathrooms.co.uk <p> In the image below you can see that with a little hard work , well , quite a lot of hard work , you can create some great effects using different coloured tiles . A good point to note if you are thinking of going down this route is make sure that you plan your design first and also mark it out so that you know exactly where the different coloured tiles and more importantly the different sized tiles will go . <p> Colours are always driven by fashions , but if you look around pretty much any colour is available somewhere . When it comes to choosing wall tile colour , there are a number of things to consider . Are you completely redecorating , with new paint or wallpaper , flooring and accessories ? In that case you might choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to fit in with it . <p> Or do you need to choose a colour that fits in with the rest of the room ? When it comes to kitchens , you will need to pick a colour that goes well with the units and worktops . <p> Darker colours will of course shrink a room and make it seem darker and smaller , but a highly reflective surface will help to combat this . <p> Bathroom decoration does n't necessarily follow the same rules as other rooms " it is acceptable for a bathroom to use dark colours as it is generally accepted that the room is small . <p> You do n't spend a lot of time there doing different activities , so natural light is not as important as it is in other rooms . <p> An effective way to combine colours is to choose a plain base colour for the majority of the tiling , but offset it with a decorative or contrasting border ( as can be seen in the images above shapes and layout of your tiles ) . <p> Alternatively , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well together , and lay them in a pattern . Mosaic tiles are often sold in sheets that are pre-patterned with a selection of varying tones or shades . <p> Another option is to have plain tiles intercepted by feature tile inserts or panels " panels made up of a number of tiles which fit together to make up a picture can look particularly effective if you have a large wall to fill . <p> The below image , obviously not to everyone 's tastes , is a great example of how simply , base colours can be used to great effect if planned well . <p> A modern black and white themed bathroom - Image courtesy of the blenture.com <p> Colours come and go with fashion <p> Are you designing the room around the tiles or do they need to fit in with an existing design ? <p> With kitchens , pick colours that compliment worktops and cupboards <p> Dark colours make a room look smaller <p> Bathrooms do not necessarily follow the same rules <p> Choose a plain base colour <p> Choose colours that go well together <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern or rustic , high gloss or matte ? There are a number of different finishes to choose from . Ceramic tiles can be made to look like stone , and a nice country style kitchen will look very good with uneven , rustic tiles to match . <p> Bathrooms are more likely to suit a high gloss finish , as it will reflect light to enlarge the room . If you have a large room though and want a warmer feel , choose a matte finish . <p> Keep in mind who is going to be doing the tiling " if you are planning to do it yourself , then some tiles are much easier to cut and grout than others . <p> Vitrified porcelain tiles are very effective and can look just like stone , but they are impossible to cut without a good wet tile cutter . Rough and rustic tiles look good , but they are much harder to grout ( and clean ! ) than a nice , smooth finish . <h> What to Think About When Choosing Floor Tiles <p> It is generally held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you lay small format tiles on a very large floor , you can find that the lines make your eyes go funny ! <p> Larger tiles are generally used in kitchens and conservatories , but bear in mind , as with wall tiles mentioned above , larger tiles require a flat floor otherwise you will have very unsightly joints . <p> You might think that the floor should be flat anyway , but you 'd be surprised at how many floors are uneven , particularly in older buildings . <p> When it comes to budget , you will probably find that the cheaper tiles are a standard 30cm square . Mosaic tiles can work out very expensive , and unless you are tiling a wet room , would not normally be considered for floors . <p> Smaller floor tiles will make a room look bigger but may not work in large rooms <p> Make sure that the floor is flat ! <p> Generally , the cheapest floor tiles tend to be 30cm square <p> Mosaic floor tiles are more suited to bathrooms <p> Shapes and Layouts <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are now a couple of other options . Many ceramic floor tiles have a rectangular option , and certain ranges are available with a selection of sizes and shapes . A combination of square and rectangular tiles can be used together to a very good effect , making the floor look like old-fashioned paving . This is known as the Versailles pattern . <p> Versailles Floor Tile Pattern <p> Square tiles do n't have to be laid out in a boring straight pattern " you can turn them around for a diagonal pattern , turning the squares into diamonds , or you can combine two different sizes of tile . This is known as a Pinwheel pattern , and it helps to break up the straight lines of the tiles . <p> Pinwheel Floor Tile Pattern <p> Rectangular tiles can be laid either in a herringbone or brick pattern . <p> Brick Floor Tile Pattern <p> Ceramic floor tiles can be both square and rectangle <p> They can be used together to great effect <p> Square tiles can be layed diagonally in a diamond pattern <p> Different sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floor tile colours and patterns are more restricted than wall tiles " generally because too much colour on a floor can be overwhelming . Also , the current fashion is for natural or stone-effect floor tiles , so popular colours tend to be a range of creams , browns and greys . <p> A classic black and white chequerboard pattern can look very effective on a floor , either straight or turned at a 45- angle . Terracotta tiles , glazed or not , look great in conservatories and kitchens . <p> As with wall tiles , feature panels can be used on floors . You may need to find a specialist supplier to obtain patterned floor tiles , but if you are renovating an old house , an old-fashioned patterned tiled floor can look really good . <p> Too much colour on a floor can be too much ! <p> Chequerboard patterns work very well <p> Terracotta tiles are very well suited to conservatories and kitchens <p> Feature panels can also work very well on floors <p> Floor Tile Textures <p> Texture is very important when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a floor as they would be dangerously slippery . <p> Make sure you buy tiles that are designed to be laid on a floor rather than a wall " they will be thicker and stronger , and will have at least some degree of texture to avoid slipping . <p> If you are tiling a wet room or bathroom floor , you 'll want to make sure you buy some sort of non-slip tile . Either a textured glaze or dimpled tile surface will help to improve grip . Small mosaic tiles can be suitable too , as the edges of the tiles and the grout joints offer a good level of texture to add grip . <p> Porcelain tiles are much tougher than other ceramics , and more suited to areas of high foot traffic .

@@41625063 @1625063/ <p> Generally speaking , this can be a relatively straightforward procedure if you follow the manufacturer 's instructions carefully . All electrical work must conform to the current IEE Wiring Regulations : BS 7671 and Part P of the Building Regulations 17th edition , see DIY Doctor Project on this . You may have problems when selling your property if it is discovered that you have run electrical installations which include the new colour wiring ( blue/brown ) without a certificate from a qualified electrician or electrical company . <p> To fit an exterior lantern of the non-metallic type , with PIR sensor and double insulated , to the exterior wall at the side of the front door , the procedure would be as follows . <p> Before you start , you need to determine the length of drill bit you will need to penetrate from one side of the wall to the other . If your property is a post-war build , it is likely to be a cavity wall type . The depth of the cavities have varied over the years from 13mm ( half inch ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure the thickness of the wall . For solid wall construction , you should choose a 300mm ( 12 inch ) drill bit and 400mm ( 16 inch ) for the majority of cavity walls . A 10mm diameter drill bit should suffice , as you will only need 1.0mm2 TWE wire for this unit . <p> With the intent of adding this as a spur to the lighting circuit , having determined where you want to position the lantern , hold the unit up to the wall and make a pencil mark on the bricks or render , tracing the shape of the back plate . Remove the lantern , measure and mark where the screw fittings have to be . Some units incorporate machine screws with domed headed nuts , which will secure the unit and leave a nice finish . Also mark the entry point of the wire you are going to use to power the unit . <p> Now from the inside , with the electric lighting circuit supply turned off , you need to remove the front part of the light switch by unscrewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Observe whether the back box within the wall is made of metal or plastic . Also look for how the switch is wired and any additional wiring in the box . In some houses a double switch may be present the second switch being a two-way type linked to the upstairs landing light . Observe the wiring going in and out of the switch and determine if the cable for wiring is marked to indicate the live feed . <p> Wall switch wiring diagram <p> If this is not evident , with a mains tester screwdriver and turning the electrical supply back on , by probing either side of the switch , where the wires are connected and secured with small brass screws , ascertain which side of the switch is the live feed wire . Now switch the electricity off again . With this type of assembly , you may find that there will be a minimum of two neutral wires , commonly black or blue , that may be connected together . They may be enclosed within a terminal block or may simply have insulation tape around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as the ' common side ' . <p> If the back box or pattress is metal , note how the wires come into the box and if the holes where the wires come through have a grommet , which will be a black flexible rubber ring , then it is likely that the wires to the box are run in plastic conduit . However if you observe from within the box large metal nuts , then you can be confident that there is metal conduit , either side of this box . Looking at the top of the box , see if there is only one wire coming in through a central hole . If there are 2 knock out holes in the backing and only one has been used , then it may be possible to chase a slot in the wall , going up to where the light fitting wire will go through to the exterior wall above the second ( unused ) pattress hole . <p> Your aim is to judge whether you can cut a slot in the plaster or render of about 12mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without affecting the existing wiring . The new wiring to the light needs to be run in the trunking , either buried in the wall , if you can safely do this , or it will have to be surface mounted , to link with a surface mounted 16mm plastic pattress . <p> You are seeking to create an additional live feed to the lantern . The switch to the lantern is the PIR sensor itself , so at the internal switch you are looking to connect a wire to the live feed and to the neutral blue/black wires . Next , take the mini-trunking , measure the distance from the switch to the height of where the lantern will be positioned on the outside of the wall , add a short length for tolerance and cut the mini-trunking with a hacksaw or cutters . <p> Offer this up to the interior of the wall and using a spirit level , ensure this trunking is plumb . Mark either side of the mini-trunking with a pencil . So within the two pencil lines you are looking to chase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will encase the wire , allowing for plaster filler when decorating afterwards . <p> Having determined the point at which you are going to drill though the wall , with a centre punch or other pointed object tap an indentation in the wall with a hammer , to prevent the drill bit slipping from the mark . Drilling through from outside to inside or vice-versa is not really critical , what is important is that you do not break out a chunk of brickwork or plasterwork , when breaking through . Knowing the thickness of your wall , from the tip of your drill bit , measure this distance and affix some insulation tape minus 10 - 15mm to the drill bit . Whether you use a conventional hammer drill or a percussion drill usually with an SDS type chuck , the idea is to turn off the hammer action when the tape marking reaches the wall edge and the final few millimetres is with rotary action only . This should prevent and significant break out from either side . <p> With a clean hole , check that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fix the mini-trunking within the chased wall ( if using that method ) , or use the self adhesive at the back of the trunking , by peeling away the protective film and mounting on the inner wall surface . If you are using the second , spare pattress hole , knock the circular disk out from the top of the box , with a screwdriver and remove the disc with a pair of pliers . Fix a grommet to the hole . Now feed your wire through the hole , carefully pull it through then fix it into the mini trunking and through your drilled hole , to the outside . Leave sufficient cable on either side to allow for final trimming and adjustment . <p> If using surface mounted mini-trunking then you will need to add a 16mm surface mounted plastic pattress . The lantern is usually fixed to the wall using a metal plate , fixed to the wall with screws and rawlplugs : see DIY Doctor Project on Fixing Items to Masonry . The wiring goes through the plate .

Following the manufacturer 's instructions connect the wires , fix the lantern in position and secure with the nuts supplied . <p> From inside and ensuring the lighting circuit is switched off , prepare the new wiring to be partnered to the existing wire . It may be necessary to extend the live feed wire and common wire using a 5 amp terminal block . Adding the live wire to the switch and the new common wire , which may be taped or connected by other means . Ensure all connections are tight . With the switch still away from the wall , reconnect the electrical supply and use the switch , taking care not to touch any metallic parts behind . if all is OK the new outside light should light up . <p> The lantern may stay lit , but should switch off after a short time . Switch off the electric supply again and ensuring that the wires behind the switch are not severely cramped or kinked , fix the switch into place and secure with retaining screws .

This lighting unit acts as a diffuser which is a device which spreads the light from it 's source ( in this case , the sun ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tube itself is to get the light from it 's source on the roof , down the tube and out of the internal diffuser fitting with as few bounces as possible , as every bounce that occurs degrades the light slightly . <h> What 's Best - a Rigid or Flexible Sun Tunnel Tube ? <p> The answer to this question really depends on the situation , space available and where the sun tunnel is to be installed . <p> If you have plenty of access around the installation area , in both the loft and room area where the diffuser is to be installed and the roof is also easy to access then a rigid tube is always the best option as they transmit more light over a greater distance and also work much better in low light conditions . <p> If access to the loft , roof or ceiling area where the sun tunnel is going to be installed is limited and awkward and has to go through a series of bends then you are never going to get a rigid tube correctly fitted so a flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also marginally cheaper than their rigid counterparts so will save you a few pennies when purchasing . <p> In respect to this question we can sum up as follows : <p> Rigid Tubes : The best choice for capturing as much light as possible , especially over long distances <p> Cross section of a roof showing rigid sun tunnel pipework <p> Flexible Tubes : The cheaper of the two options for both purchase and installation and more suited to shorter distances as can loose a fair amount of light energy due to the ribbed construction of the tube <p> Cross section of a roof showing flexible sun tunnel pipework <h> How Much Light can a Sun Tunnel Provide ? <p> In most situations a sun tunnel will produce enough light to satisfy most people 's needs during the day . <p> Many manufacturers claim that their particular brand of sun tunnel will generate much more light than their rivals . On the whole , and speaking to others in the profession , we have found that most brands of tunnel and tube comparatively generate pretty much the same levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage that one manufacturer has over another is in most instance just down to the statistics and is in no way noticeable to the naked eye . <p> Most manufacturers will give light output figures in lumens . This is a measurement for the total light emitted from a single source . In domestic situations this means very little so for the purposes of this project we will do our best to explain any output figures in the more familiar measurement of watts . <p> A rigid sun tunnel , installed in the ideal conditions of 1m in length and south facing , will provide the equivalent amount of light in the following sizes : <p> 10 inch sun tunnel = Around 150 - 200 watts <p> 14 inch sun tunnel = Around 200 - 250 watts <p> In the less perfect conditions outlined above , using a tube that 's installed on a non-south facing roof with only ambient light and using a flexible tube 2m in length you can expect somewhere around the following results : <p> 10 inch sun tunnel = Around 40 - 60 watts <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As you can see from the results above , the amount of light generated by a given sun tunnel installation can vary quite a bit depending on where it 's installed and what materials you 're using so to sum up , the main detrimental factors for light output of sun tunnels and tubes is : <p> The length and type of tube : The longer the length of tube you use to transfer the light from your roof to the ceiling below , the less light you will get at the end . This is due to the number of bounces the light needs to make in order to reach the end . Each bounce loses a fraction of the lights initial power . If the tube is flexible then it will also feature ribbed sections - each of these sections will also loose an amount of light , so the shorter , straighter and smoother your tube , the better ! <p> The position of the dome on the roof : The best roof position for the sun tunnel dome is south facing . This way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this down in to your room space . If the dome is non-south facing then only ambient light will be used . Ambient light , in this case , is the light is the light collected by the suns reflections and redirections from surrounding buildings and surfaces <p> The angle at which the dome or window faces the sun can also be a factor . The most efficient position is one that allows light to travel down the tube with the minimum number of bounces possible : <p> The effects of different angles on light output from a sun tunnel <p> You might be thinking , well , it 'll be useless at night ! This is not so . In some cases a light fitting can be incorporated into the sun tunnel that can be switched on at night and used as a light in its own right ! <p> Again , consider the position of the bulb and housing within the tube as if it is allowed to interfere and cause an obstruction to the light bouncing down in the tube this will restrict the light output from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should also be taken into consideration . As you can imagine a 60 watt light bulb will light a small landing area or bedroom quite nicely but that same 60 watt light bulb would be totally useless at lighting something the size of a football stadium . <h> Cutting and Removing Timber for Sun Tunnel Installation <p> Before we start , this is a very important point to raise ! In no circumstances should you cut or remove any structurally integral timbers in your roof without first consulting the relevant professional such as builder with the necessary knowledge or a structural engineer . <p> If either of the afore mentioned professionals confirm that it is ok to do so the general rule of thumb is whatever piece of timber you remove you have to put back twice , and they have to be of the same size as that displaced . <p> So ; if you cut a section out of a floor joist or ceiling rafter you will have to put back two horizontal supports to then provide the required support . <p> How to strengthen cut trusses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check out the Installation Area <p> Your sun tunnel installation depends to a degree on the sitting of your roof trusses , rafters and joists . While these can of course be moved , it is considerably cheaper to work round their existing positions . A good survey is recommended to determine the best course of action . <p> You should also check for any cabling or plumbing pipe work that may be in the ceiling void above where you are going to cut . If it turns out there are obstructions , then you will have to decide whether to move them or to re-think where your sun tunnel is to go . This may necessitate a move from a rigid sun tunnel to a flexible one . <p> Inspect and clear the installation area in the loft <p> The Sun Tunnel Kit <p> Sun tunnel kits come with templates for cutting out holes in the roof and ceilings . Your kit should also come complete with fixing brackets for the reflective tubing . <p> Any holes should be cut in accordance with manufacturer 's instructions so read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and disturbing the main roof structure last . <p> Cutting the Internal Hole <p> Remember to use eye protection because a lot of dust and debris may be in your ceiling void and this will fall through when completing this part of the installation process . <p> Using the provided template , carefully mark out the area to be cut in the exact position you require it on the ceiling . Ensure that you will only be cutting through the plasterboard or ceiling covering and not through any joists or noggins as this may compromise some structural integrity . <p> The easiest way to do this is to access your loft area , take note and measure where any joists are positioned and then transfer this to your ceiling . Failing this , you can use a stud detector to find and mark joist positions . See our project on using a stud detector . <p> If you are installing into a flat roof , using a stud detector will really be your only choice when it comes to finding joists as in most cases there will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To cut your hole , the weapon of choice is usually a pad saw as you will be cutting plasterboard . This tool , sometimes called a jab saw and a board saw will allow you to easily follow the line to be cut . Take your time when cutting as you want to get the smoothest cut possible . <p> Jab saw or board saw <p> To give you a starting point and allow you to insert a blade ( whether it 's a pad saw or jigsaw ) you will first need to drill a small hole around 10 - 12mm . This should be enough to get your blade in to start cutting . Use a flat drill bit for this ( as seen below ) . <p> 10mm flat drill bit <p> You can also use a jigsaw but ensure you use it in a safe manner . Cutting upside down is tricky and you can easily loose grip of the saw and drop it causing damage or injury . <p> A proprietary jab saw has a really sharp and strengthened point which will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the flat of your hand . <p> Once you hole is cut , remove the section of plasterboard and you should have a nice smooth , uniform hole to fit your bottom tube section and diffuser . Do n't worry too much if you have a few rough edges , once the diffuser is in place this should hide these . There will always be some making good to do with jobs of this kind . <p> The final job now is to fit ceiling manifold and in some cases this will also involve a bottom section of pipework that the main pipework is connected to ( mostly for rigid pipework ) . Otherwise it will simply be a ring section that is clipped into your hole . <p> Each manufacturer has a variation on sun tunnel fittings and fixings so please refer to the instructions , but in most cases it will either need clipping in or screwing in . <p> Once it is clipped in place , use the provided sealing tape to tape all the way around any gaps between the ring and ceiling plasterboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room below . <p> Replace any insulation that you have had to move around the edges of the manifold . <h> Installing a Sun Tunnel - External Roof Work <p> We are now moving into the trickier parts of this job , accessing the roof in order to fit the roof dome and flashing . <p> Depending on the type of roof you are installing on , whether it is flat or pitched will depend on how difficult this becomes : <p> Accessing the Roof <p> The following information should help you safely access the area of your roof you need to : <p> Pitched Roof : If your roof is a pitched roof above you will need to take safety precautions for access i.e. the use of scaffolding to provide a safe working platform . You will need to ensure that your scaffolding is fixed in position and will not topple over or move . Roof ladders are usually required also . These are laid up the pitch of the roof and hooked over the ridge and allow you to climb up the roof safely . These can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the necessary safety equipment <p> Flat Roof : In most cases a flat roof will be a single story roof so accessing with a ladder should be quite easy . The difficult part comes when you need to get on top of the roof . Most flat roofs are only constructed using ply board and non-loadbearing joists so standing on it is probably not a good idea . Instead , using a second ladder , place it across the 2 available structural walls and then place a plank or piece of board on the ladder . By doing so you will then spread your weight evenly across the roof and not fall through . <p> Again , we have to reiterate , working on ladders , roofs and at height is dangerous so please take every precaution necessary to ensure that you are safe and will not damage yourself or your roof . <p> Ladder safely secured to wall with ladder strap <p> Once you have accessed your roof area the next task is to make the hole that you will mount your flashing and roof dome in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again depend on how easy and straight forward this will be . <p> Making a Hole for a Sun Tunnel in a Flat Roof <p> Due to the nature of the roof being flat , the most important factor here is the drainage and water ingress . When we say flat , in most cases the roof will not be dead level but will slope slightly away from the property so ensure that no water is allowed to pool . <p> If we go cutting a big hole in it , as I 'm sure you can imagine , this is going to compromise the drainage somewhat . To these ends we have to ensure that the hole is completely sealed so that no water or moisture can get in and rot the roof area or spoil any internal decoration . <p> The roof dome for a flat roof will , in most cases , come with a section or even several sections of flashing that will sit over the housing and on top of your existing roof covering , effectively sealing it down . The flashing is then sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Depending on the type of roof dome and its manufacturer will depend on the type of flashing used and the number of layers it 's used in . <p> The dome and any associated covers are then placed on top , in their indicated order , with each level creating an overhang that prevents water and moisture penetrating up into the dome , very similar to the principle of tiles on a pitched roof . <p> Roof dome and housing with flashing , fitted to flat roof <p> Due to the nature of the thickness of a flat roof , in most cases there will be little room in the ceiling void between the actual ceiling and the roof so the process of cutting the hole in the ceiling outlined above will pretty much dictate where the hole in the roof needs to be cut as you should be able to see the underside of the roof quite easily ! <p> The tricky part here is getting the two holes to line up exactly over each other . Ensure that you accurately measure the position of the hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 2 positions and this should then give you two points to mark the hole with on the underside of the roof . <p> How to measure the ceiling hole to work out where to cut the hole in the top of the roof <p> In the image above , you will have to use your imagination slightly to picture looking down on the hole in your ceiling without the roof being there . Obviously in a real world situation the above process is not an easy one as you will only have a few inches of depth in the joist to peer in and find a suitable edge to measure from . <p> In most cases it will be a lot easier to cut your hole from on top the roof so now you will need to drill four holes at north , south , east and west positions , through the roof from the underside so that you can then transfer the exact position from the underside to the top of the roof . <p> After you have drawn the outline of your template on the underside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the holes are on the inside of the shape and butt right up to the line you have drawn <p> Clear as much debris from the area on top the roof as much as possible and then using the template and a decent permanent marker , draw around the template ensuring that all four holes are within the confines of your line . <p> Clear the top of the flat roof area from debris ready to cut hole <p> Using a jigsaw you can now cut your hole . As outlined above , take your time , do n't rush and ensure that you cut around the inside of your line keeping as close to the line as possible . Also do not push the saw , let the saw do the work for you . <p> Making a Hole in a Pitched Roof <p> Although slightly easier and less hassle than cutting a hole in a flat roof as essentially all you need to do is remove some tiles you will still have to make sure that all the pipework lines up if you are using rigid pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can obviously bend them to fit . <p> As there are so many different types of tunnel and each will have its own specific setup it 's difficult for us to suggest a one-size-fits-all approach to marking out the area on a pitched roof where your roof dome needs to go other than if you have straight pipework the dome will need to go directly above the ceiling hole whereas if you have bends then it wo n't <p> One trick here is that you can assemble all the pipework in the loft area and position it over the ceiling manifold and this should then give you an indication on the pitch of the roof where you will need to remove your tiles . <p> With your pipework in place , use a marker pen to roughly mark around the position on the inside of the roof where the dome will go on the outside . You can then use a piece of wire or similar object to poke through under the tiles so that you can then see it when you are outside , giving you the area that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you poke the wire out as close to what will be the centre of your tubing . <p> Before you climb onto the roof , measure the width and height of tubing as this will give you an idea of how many tiles you will need to remove . <p> Before you start , use a tape measure to mark out the area of tiles that need to be removed . Use your marker as the centre point and measure out left and right and also up and down . <p> Using the access methods outlined above , climb onto your roof and locate the marker you used . The chances are that your tiles have been nailed in place so you will need to use a slate ripper to break any nails off so that you can then remove the slate . <p> Slate ripper <p> Remove your tiles one at a time taking care not to drop any or fall off the roof yourself . After you have removed a few tiles you can then pass them through the gap that you have created . Use a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that you have a layer of felt under your tiles . If so you can make a small hole in this to pass the tiles through as you will need to cut out a section later . Just make sure you make any holes as small as possible and right in the centre of what will be the dome or window . Remove as many tiles as required so that your roof dome flashing fits snuggly into the gap . <p> NOTE : A handy tip is to remember that when it comes to anything to do with roofs and joints is that you always work up from the bottom first so that any water flows over and away from joints and not against them . <p> Check the Positioning of the Roof Dome or Frame <p> At this point it is a good idea get the roof dome frame/flashing or window up onto the roof and sit it in position to make sure everything lines up . <p> Also check to see where the roof trusses are in relation to the edges of the frame/flashing or window as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points for the flashing or window frame should be provided all around the edge to account for the various situations in which they will be installed . <p> If possible , adjust the position of the dome flashing or window so that its edges fall in the solid centre of any of the tiles above and not any of the joints between the tiles . <p> With your position settled on , use a pencil to mark the edges of the frame on any surrounding battens so that you can find the exact position again . Put the frame to one side for now in a safe position . <p> Position roof dome or window on roof and mark battens for later <p> Installing Timber Bracing <p> The dome in the roof or window , as mentioned , will require timber bracing to hold it in place and care must be taken not to compromise the integrity of the roof . Do not remove any structural timbers in the roof ( such as joists or trusses ) unless instructed to by an architect or building surveyor . <p> What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dome or window to sit on that you can then secure it to . <p> You should have two parallel trusses that run either side of your sun tunnel so you will need to add a noggin above and below your dome or window between these two trusses . This is best done from within your loft area as you can position the timbers correctly so that they run below the dome or window and support the weight . Screw in from either side of the truss to secure the noggins <p> Add noggins between joists to support roof window or dome from underneath <p> To add support above the trusses that will support the actual frame of the window , flashing or dome housing you should be able to make use of the roof battens that are already there . In most situations the batten at the top can be used to support the top of the window or dome and you should then only need to adjust the position of the bottom batten . Start by cutting away the section of batten that covers what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw or battery powered reciprocating saw . Be careful not to damage any felt if it is present . <p> Next , refer to the manufacturers instructions for the position of the bottom support batten . In most cases it will say to measure a set distance up from the top of the bottom row of tiles , normally around 100 - 200mm depending on what you are installing . Mark this position in two places , just above the trusses if you can feel where they are . <p> Now , cut a section of batten the same size of your existing batten ( usually 1x1/2 inch ) and position it horizontally across the trusses , making sure it lines up with each mark and then fix it in place by screwing down into each truss . <p> If you are unlucky enough to not have a top batten to work with then you will need to repeat the above to add a top batten . <p> To complete your frame you will now need to add in side supporting battens . Measure vertically between the horizontal battens on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit tightly . <p> Before screwing them into position , take you frame , dome housing or flashing and place it over the gap once more and adjust the side battens so all edges are supported . Remove the frame and screw the side supports top and bottom or from the sides . <p> Cut out the Felt to Access Loft <p> It 's now time to cut out your felt or membrane if it is present so that you can then see down into your loft space . <p> Using a sharp knife such as a Stanley or hobby knife , cut diagonally from corner to corner and then peel the felt outwards and over your external frame . Nail it to the frame for now to keep it out of your way . <p> Installing the Flashing , Dome Housing or Window <p> The part of the sun tunnel that is built into your roof is the flashing kit which protects the opening against rainwater penetration . The flashing may be a separate section , part of the dome housing or part of the window . <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing before you install it ( if you are using flexible tubing ) . If this is the case , follow the instructions on how to do this . Normally , clips will be present on the tube , that clip into a frame or housing . <p> Place the flashing into position as stated in the instructions and secure it to your frame using any fixings provided . <p> When the flashing kit is in place and secured the sun dome and any required housing can also be fitted . <p> Refit Your Tiles <p> With the flashing and any housing fitted , you will now have to refit your tiles so that they cover any open sections of felt or membrane and cover over any areas of flashing or frame . <p> Firstly , have a look at the instructions and find out how much of a gap the manufacturer states that you should leave around the window or dome . In most cases it should be around 30 - 50mm but this may again depend on make and model . <p> Starting with the bottom , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the window or dome housing and then deduct the amount stated in the instructions for the gap . <p> Measure the size of each tile that needs replacing around the window <p> Now , take one of the tiles you previously removed and measure and mark it . Do this top and bottom and then draw a line down to give you a line to cut along . Using an angle grinder and stone disc , cut along the line to create your tile . <p> 6 inch angle grinder with stone cutting disc <p> When using the grinder , make sure you have goggle and gloves on that the tile is clamped securely and can not move . Do n't try and do this in situ on the roof . <p> Take the tile back up to the roof and fit it to make sure it is the right size . Now repeat this all the way around for any other tiles that are needed , fixing and nailing each of them in place as you go , laying the bottom ones first and working your way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top - your kit may include a support bar that will need fixing that will take the weight of the bottom of the tiles . If so , fix this in place following the instructions and also fix any foam supports that may be included . <p> Securing the Tubing <p> With the ceiling manifold and dome , flashing housing or window in place now is the time to install the tubing . Depending on whether you are using rigid pipes or flexible pipes and who manufactured the kit will depend on how the tube is secured to the roof and ceiling and even how sections of tubing are fixed together . <p> With most kits a clip system is used to secure tubing to the roof section as this will effectively be hanging on the roof so it needs fixing correctly . <p> In either case , follow the instructions for fitting your pipework together which in most cases will state , start at the top by fixing the tube and then work your way down adding sections of pipe until you reach the ceiling manifold , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using rigid tubes , you will need to ensure that the manufacturer provides you with exactly the right length to reach from roof to ceiling . If not you will need to trim it up and this is not an easy job ! <p> If you are using flexible tubing this is slightly easier - Extend your tube out and then push it down through the ceiling manifold . Ensure that you pull it tight but be careful not to pull too tight and tear it . Once reasonably taught , cut off any excess . <p> Within the kit there should be a clip or series of clips that can be inserted to hold the tubing in place within the manifold . With clip or clips in place , carefully slacken a small area at a time and pull the tubing down to remove as many creases as possible . <p> Fold any excess tube back up into the tubing and tape it round using only the reflective tape that should be provided with the kit . <p> The final task here is to now tape all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the tape that should be provided . This will prevent and dust or insects from getting into your loft area . <p> Fix Diffuser to Ceiling Manifold <p> With all the other items covered , you can now complete your installation by inserting your diffuser in to your ceiling manifold . <p> The diffuser splits the light into segments which make it easier to manage in the room and avoids shafts of sunlight hitting one spot . <p> When this is in place , then you 're all done ! Top job ! <p> As always with work that creates debris , dust and the use of sharp components DIY Doctor recommends the use of gloves , dust masks and eye protection . <p> Now that you have mastered this how to guide to installing a sun tunnel you can now use some of the principles outlined above to install a Velux window . 772 @qwx410772 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775 @qwx410775 
@@41625071 @1625071/ <h> Using a Hacksaw <p> There are a number of ways to cut copper pipe and the least recommended of these is to cut with a hacksaw . Granted it is the cheapest of the tools we can offer but when a copper pipe is cut with a hacksaw there is a lot of movement in the pipe . <p> It does not matter how strong you are , you will not be able to hold the pipe completely still while you cut . This is not a disaster if you are cutting a new piece of pipe for a new system . If the pipe is already part of a system , be it a hot or cold water pipe , or a central heating pipe , as it moves while being cut it will put pressure on the nearest joint allowing the possibility of that joint to fail . <p> Junior hacksaw <p> The second reason for not using a hacksaw is because however fine the blades teeth are it will leave burrs on the cut end of the pipe . These burrs will stop the fittings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be filed smooth . When you are in a tight corner of a room , with no room to move , never mind use a hacksaw and file , this is not a great way to do any kind of plumbing . <p> The answer ? Wonderful tools called pipe cutters and pipe slices . Both use a hardened wheel to cut into the pipe rather than a toothed blade . <h> Using a Pipe Cutter <p> A pipe cutter , shown below , is placed over the pipe and the handle , or knob , at the top is turned clockwise until it closes down onto the copper . The cutter is then turned fully around the circumference of the pipe where it will score the pipe cutting into it slightly . <p> The knob is then tightened a touch more and the cutter turned round the pipe again . The cutting wheel goes in a little deeper and the operation is repeated until the pipe simply drops in half . <p> The cut end is left clean and burr free and the minimum effort has been used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut pipes from 8mm to 38mm . <p> Pipe cutter <h> Using a Pipe Slice <p> Even easier , and absolutely wonderful for tight spaces is a pipe slice , shown below . The pipe slice operates on exactly the same principle as the pipe cutter but the blade , or cutting wheel is spring loaded . <p> The pipe slice is pushed onto the pipe in the correct place and is simply turned . As you turn , the wheel cuts into the pipe and the spring applies just enough pressure to push it in a tiny bit more . Keep turning , the slice keeps cutting and seconds later the operation is complete . <p> Once again the end of the pipe is neatly cut with no need for files or wire wool . The only downside to a pipe slice is the fact that you need a different pipe slice for every diameter of pipe you need to cut but , at home , the average DIY enthusiast will only ever want to cut either 15mm or 22mm pipes and these little beauties are not expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and buy the tools if you want to . 771 @qwx410771 774 @qwx410774 773 @qwx410773 775
