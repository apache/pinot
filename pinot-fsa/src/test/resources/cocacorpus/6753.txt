You will engage Australia 's protection obligations if you are found to be a refugee or meet complementary protection grounds . <h> The meaning of refugee <p> To be a refugee in Australia , an asylum seeker must be assessed as meeting certain legal criteria . The meaning of a ' refugee ' in the Migration Act 1958 ( the Act ) is a person in Australia who is : <p> outside their country of nationality or former habitual residence ( their home country ) and <p> owing to a ' well-founded fear of persecution ' , is unable or unwilling to return to their home country or to seek the protection of that country . <p> This definition is forward-looking . Even if a person has suffered persecution in the past , they are not a refugee by the meaning in the Act unless they have a well-founded fear of persecution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home country now , if they were to return . However , past events could establish a real chance of persecution if the person were to return . <p> A person might become a refugee after arriving in Australia . This could occur if there is a change of circumstances in their home country or a change in personal circumstances after they left that gives them a well-founded fear of persecution if they were to return . <h> Well-founded fear of persecution <p> The Act states that a person has a well-founded fear of persecution if : <p> they fear persecution for at least one of five reasons specified in the Act <p> there is a real chance that , if the person returns to their home country , they would be persecuted for one or more of those reasons <p> the real chance of persecution relates to all areas of their home country <p> at least one of the five reasons must be the essential and significant reason for the persecution <p> the persecution involves both ' serious harm ' to the person and ' systematic and discriminatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-founded fear of persecution , a person must fear serious harm because of their : <p> race <p> religion <p> nationality <p> membership of a particular social group , or <p> political opinion . <p> A person who leaves their home country for reasons of war , famine or because they are seeking better economic opportunities might not be a refugee according to the definition in the Act . They must have a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the above reasons to be a refugee and must meet other requirements . <h> Particular social group <p> There are two types of particular social groups described in the Act . One provides criteria to be met if a person claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution because they are a member of a particular social group that consists of their family . The other type provides that a person will be a member of a particular social group if : <p> each member of the group shares a characteristic <p> the person shares , or is perceived as sharing , the characteristic <p> any of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be changed ) <p> the characteristic is so fundamental to a person 's identity or conscience , they should not be forced to renounce it ( go against it ) ; or <p> the characteristic distinguishes the group from the rest of society <p> and <p> the characteristic is not a fear of persecution . <h> Serious harm <p> To have a well-founded fear of persecution , the persecution feared must involve serious harm to the person . Serious harm includes , but is not limited to : <p> a threat to the person 's life or liberty <p> significant physical harassment of the person <p> significant physical i 'll treatment of the person <p> significant economic hardship that threatens the person 's capacity to subsist ( ability to survive ) <p> denial of access to basic services , where the denial threatens the person 's capacity to subsist ( ability to survive ) <p> denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind , where the denial threatens the person 's capacity to subsist ( ability to survive ) . <h> Systematic and discriminatory conduct <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also involve systematic and discriminatory conduct . <p> Systematic means the harm is not random or generalised , but is targeted against the person . <p> Discriminatory means the conduct of the persecutor affects the person or members of a group in a way that singles that person or a group out from the rest of the community . <p> This means that if the serious harm feared by the person is not directed at them or a group to which they belong , for one of the five reasons above , the person does not have a well-founded fear of persecution and will not be a refugee . <h> Real chance of persecution <p> For the fear of persecution to be well founded , there must be a ' real chance ' that the persecution would happen in the reasonably foreseeable future if the person was to return to their home country . Real chance means that the fear of persecution is not remote or far-fetched . <p> If there is a place in their home country where the person can live without a well-founded fear of persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must be able to safely and legally access that place . <h> Seeking protection from authorities in their home country <p> If the government or other parties that control all or a large part of the person 's home country is willing and able to offer effective protection to the person , they might not meet the definition of refugee . However , the person must be able to access the protection and the protection must be of a durable nature ( provided on an ongoing basis ) . If the protection is able to be provided by the government , the protection must also include an appropriate criminal law , a reasonably effective police force and an impartial judicial system . If this protection is able to be provided , the person does not have a well-founded fear of persecution and will not be a refugee . <h> A right to enter and reside in another country <p> If a person has a right to enter and reside in another country in which they do not fear persecution or significant harm , they must take all possible steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might not be a refugee . <h> Modifying behaviours <p> According to the Act , a person does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if they can take reasonable steps to modify their behaviour so as to avoid a real chance of persecution their home country . However , this would not be the case if such a change would : <p> conflict with a characteristic that is fundamental to the person 's identity or conscience <p> require the person to conceal or hide a characteristic that is innate or immutable ( one that they could not change ) , or <p> require the person to : <p> change their religious beliefs , including by renouncing a religious conversion , or conceal their true religious beliefs , or cease to be involved in the practice of their faith <p> conceal their true race , ethnicity , nationality or country of origin <p> change their political beliefs or conceal their true political beliefs <p> conceal a physical , psychological or intellectual disability <p> enter into or remain in a marriage to which that person is opposed , or accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A person who has been assessed to be a refugee by the meaning in the Act can only be granted a protection visa if they also meet other requirements , such as health , security and character checks . <p> A person is not considered a refugee , even if they meet all the other criteria , if there are serious reasons for considering that they have : <p> committed a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity <p> committed a serious , non-political crime before they entered Australia , or <p> been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations . <p> In addition , a refugee will not be granted a protection visa if they are considered , on reasonable grounds , to : <p> be a danger to Australia 's security , or <p> having been convicted of a particularly serious crime , are a danger to the Australian community . <p> If a person is assessed to be a refugee but does not meet other criteria for the grant of a protection visa , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would breach Australia 's protection obligations . Other options will be considered to resolve the person 's status . <h> Complementary protection <p> Complementary protection is protection for those who are not refugees according to the Act , but who can not return to their home country because they will suffer certain types of harm which engage Australia 's other protection obligations . These obligations come from the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( CAT ) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) . <p> A person can be granted a protection visa on the basis of complementary protection if there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk the person will suffer ' significant harm ' if they were removed from Australia to their home country . <h> Significant harm <p> Significant harm is different to serious harm .

@@71318187 @18187/ 83111 @qwx703111 <h> Adoption of children from outside Australia <h> Overseas adoption in Australia <p> There are two ways that Australian citizens , holders of an Australian permanent visa or eligible New Zealand citizens can take to adopt a child from overseas . They are : <p> Intercountry adoptions - these include adoptions supported by Australian state and territory central authorities under either the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect to Intercountry Adoption ( Hague Convention ) or through a bilateral arrangement <h> Intercountry Adoption Australia <p> Intercountry Adoption Australia has been established to help parents living in Australia navigate the intercountry adoption process . Intercountry Adoption Australia brings together information in one central place through a national website and a free telephone information line . <p> Intercountry adoption refers to overseas adoptions supported by Australian state and territory central authorities . Through this process , Australian citizens or permanent visa holders work with their Australian state and territory central authority which will assess the suitability of potential parents and work with various countries to progress and finalise adoption decisions and provide ongoing support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to contact Intercountry Adoption Australia who will talk you through the process and put you in contact with your state or territory central authority . <p> The state or territory central authorities provide support and education to prospective adoptive parents . They provide advice and assistance about the procedural aspects of the intercountry adoption application programs , conduct adoption assessments on a family 's suitability to adopt , decide adoption applications and provide post-adoption support . You should seek advice from your state and territory adoption authority before starting any adoption process to adopt a child from outside Australia.More Information : Intercountry Adoption AustraliaAustralian state and territory central authorities <h> Intercountry adoption programmes in place <p> Australia has intercountry adoption programmes with a number of countries that are conducted under either : <p> the ' Hague Convention ' - between Australia and another country which has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption ( the Hague Convention ) or between 2 other countries ( excluding Australia ) where an adoption occurs between them <p> ' bilateral ' adoption arrangements - made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guardianship <p> When an Australian living overseas adopts a child from the country where he or she is living or a third country , it is called expatriate adoption . The adoption occurs through the country 's domestic processes and is finalised in that country . <p> The Australian Government 's involvement in expatriate adoptions is limited to determining whether or not the child meets immigration requirements in order to enter and remain in Australia . <p> If the child meets immigration requirements and is granted a visa , the child will be under the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection once the child arrives in Australia . This guardianship arrangement is in accordance with the Immigration ( Guardianship of Children ) Act 1946 ( the IGOC Act ) . <h> I have adopted a child privately from overseas and want to bring my family to Australia <p> We assess and decide applications for visas and citizenship in accordance with Australian migration and citizenship law . This includes assessing visa and citizenship applications for your child to enter or remain in Australia . <p> The adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of usual residence and must be finalised in that country . Expatriate adoptions are not managed by Australian state and territory central adoption authorities and might not be consistent with the principles of the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption . <p> We are not able to grant a visa to a child who does not meet the requirements set out in the Migration Regulations 1994 , even if an adoption has already occurred and is lawful in the country overseas . The adoptive parents might have established a legal parent-child relationship in the country overseas and if a visa is not granted , the child wo n't be able to enter and reside permanently in Australia . <p> As there are risks for both the child and the adoptive parents in this process , before you proceed with an expatriate adoption , it is recommended that you seek independent legal advice both in Australia and in the child 's country of usual residence . <p> Australian Commonwealth , state and territory central authorities are not responsible for expatriate adoptions , and do not assess or approve applications for such adoptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection . We provide this information page , which you can print off and submit to the authorities in the country where you are adopting . <p> If you have adopted your child outside Australia without the involvement of the state or territory central authority and your child is applying from outside Australia , further information is available on the subclass 102 Adoption visa . <p> If you adopted your child outside Australia without the involvement of the state or territory central authority and your child is now in Australia , further information is available on the subclass 802 Adoption visa . <h> Immigration requirements for expatriate adoptions <p> Children adopted by expatriate Australians are subject to additional criteria that must be met before an Adoption visa can be granted , including ( among other things ) : <p> at least one of the adoptive parents must have been a resident outside of Australia for at least 12 months at the time of visa application <p> the laws relating to adoption for the country in which the child is usually a resident have been complied with <p> adoptive parents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the child to be removed from that country <p> adoptive parents have lawfully acquired full and permanent parental rights by the child 's adoption . This means that the adoption order must sever the legal relationship between the child and his/her biological parents <p> the adoptive parents ' residence outside of Australia was not contrived to deliberately bypass any requirements concerning the entry of adopted children into Australia . <p> Note : Full and permanent adoption does not exist in the laws of some countries . <p> Note : From 14 December 2015 , we are unable to accept Adoption visa applications for children who have been adopted in Pakistan . This country is specified in a legislative instrument . <p> If you intend to adopt , or have adopted , a child from Pakistan , you will be unable to lodge a valid application for an Adoption visa for the child with us . <p> For information about the visa requirements for adopted children to enter Australia refer to visa information on the Department 's website . <h> Guardianship overview for expatriate adoptions <p> Adoptions from outside Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different processes for adoptions to be finalised and recognised , depending on : <p> the country from which the child is adopted <p> the state or territory in which the adoptive family lives <p> the type of adoption overseas . <p> Where an adoption is not automatically recognised under Australian law , the Immigration ( Guardianship of Children ) Act 1946 ( the IGOC Act ) provides guardianship arrangements for the adoptive child . <p> You will be advised whether your adopted child falls within these guardianship provisions when a decision is made on the adoption visa . Generally , we will notify the relevant state or territory central authority ( where you usually reside or intend to reside ) when a child on an Adoption visa is likely to enter Australia under the IGOC Act . <h> Adopted children who are under the guardianship of the Minister <p> The Minister is generally the legal guardian of children whose adoptions are yet to be finalised in Australia or are not recognised automatically under Australian law when they enter Australia . <p> This is because the prospective adoptive parents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IGOC Act either because the child was : <p> adopted through a country 's domestic processes without the involvement of an Australian state or territory central authority for intercountry adoption , or <p> adopted through an intercountry adoption programme that requires the adoption to be completed after the child arrives in Australia . <p> The Minister can delegate his powers and functions as guardian to certain officers in the relevant central authority in the state or territory where the child lives . <h> Rights and responsibilities of the Minister as guardian <p> Under the IGOC Act , the Minister has delegated some of his powers and functions as guardian to particular officers in the state and territory central authorities . These officers are known as delegated guardians and have ' parental ' responsibility for the child and can make decisions where a guardian 's approval or consent is needed . In most circumstances , delegated guardians will make decisions in close consultation with the child 's carers - usually the prospective adoptive parents . <p> To ensure that the relevant state or territory central authority is able to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents should make initial contact when the child arrives in Australia , and also inform the delegated guardian of any changes in residential , phone and email addresses , until such time as the adoption is formalised in Australia . <h> When guardianship of the Minister ceases <p> The Minister 's delegate will remain the guardian of the child until the provisions of the IGOC Act cease to apply . Generally , this will be when the child meets one of the following : <p> becomes an Australian citizen <p> turns 18 years of age <p> leaves Australia permanently <p> has an order made under s11 of the IGOC Act which removes them from the Minister 's guardianship . <h> Citizenship for adopted children <p> If the adoption process is completed in Australia under Australian law , the child automatically acquires Australian citizenship at the time of the adoption if both of the following apply : <p> the child is in Australia and holds an Australian permanent visa <p> at least one of the adoptive parents is an Australian citizen . <p> Children adopted in Australia do not apply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of Australian citizenship . There is a fee for this type of application . <h> Citizenship when adoption is finalised outside Australia <p> A child adopted outside Australia by an Australian citizen under the Hague Convention or bilateral arrangement might be eligible to become an Australian citizen immediately on completion of the adoption outside of Australia if an Adoption Compliance Certificate has been issued and the adoption is recognised under Australian law . <p> An Adoption Compliance Certificate is certification that a full and permanent adoption has occurred under the Hague Convention or a bilateral agreement . <p> A child adopted outside Australia by an Australian citizen under arrangements other than a full Hague Convention adoption might be eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by conferral . The child must hold a visa that permits them to reside permanently in Australia and have travelled to Australia on that visa prior to applying for citizenship . Applications can be lodged outside Australia or after the child is in Australia .

Importers are required , amongst other things , to ensure that imported goods are correctly labelled . For example , imported goods that require a trade description must be marked with the name of the country in which the goods were made or produced , and where specified , a true description of the goods . <p> Further information about trade description goods and ownership of trade marks and copyright can be found under the headings Commerce Trade Descriptions and Intellectual Property Rights on this page . <h> Import entry costs <h> Valuation <p> While there are several methods of valuing goods for customs purposes , the method most applied ( transaction value ) is based on the price actually paid ( or payable ) for the imported goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the transaction value is that there is no relationship between the buyer and seller which can influence the price . <p> Valuation of imported goods can be complex and importers are urged to seek advice from a customs broker or to contact us . <h> Information on Valuation Advice <p> Advance rulings are formal advices on how we will apply certain laws to goods for importation .

Our recent creation of the Investigations Division will allow a stronger focus and approach to border crime , whether that crime is related to attempts to circumvent physical border controls or to rort our visa system . <h> Cooperation between government agencies <p> The review identified opportunities for us to work more closely with other government agencies , such as the Australian Taxation Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman . <p> Greater information sharing and data matching between government agencies will make it easier to detect non-compliance in the 457 programme , and allow for a more targeted and effective approach to sponsor monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxation Office to ensure that 457 visa holders are working in their approved roles , and are not being underpaid . <h> Information for 457 visa holders and sponsors <p> The review found that overseas workers are more likely to come forward with any concerns about their treatment when they are fully informed of their rights in Australia . <p> To help ensure 457 visa holders are fully informed of their rights , we will also consider ways to make information on 457 visa holders rights and obligations more readily available to both visa holders and sponsors , particularly through its online presence . Sponsors will also be specifically targeted through additional educational activities . <h> Disclosing information on sanctions activity <p> The review found that we could do more to deter employers from improper practices by increasing transparency and accountability . We will therefore be proactive in releasing information on employers sanctioned and prosecuted for exploiting overseas workers . The publication of prosecutions will deter employers from breaching their sponsorship obligations . <h> Payments for a migration outcome <p> The review found that some 457 visa holders had paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia , and that this practice has undermined the integrity of the 457 programme . The government will therefore introduce a new penalty making it unlawful for sponsors to receive payment in return for sponsoring a 457 worker . <h> Training contribution by sponsors <p> The review identified opportunities to introduce a less complex training contribution scheme that could provide the desired training outcomes while being easer to monitor . <p> Subject to further consultation , the government proposes to replace the current complex ' training benchmarks ' provisions . <p> The current provisions require employers sponsoring a 457 worker to ensure that at least one per cent of their business ' payroll is spent on the training of Australians , or two per cent is contributed to an industry training fund . This current system is complex , costly , and open to misuse . The government is exploring options for implementation of this recommendation . <p> The government will work with key stakeholders to implement a more transparent and effective system that directly links the ability to employ a 457 visa holder with increased training opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In examining the integrity of the 457 programme , the review also identified opportunities to enhance other aspects of the programme . <h> Key measures <p> The key measures are described below . <h> Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration <p> The report recommended that a tripartite Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration ( MACSM ) be established to advise the government on skilled migration issues . <p> The government supports this recommendation and will re-establish the MACSM with members drawn from peak bodies , industry and unions and revised terms of reference . <p> To support the MACSM , a dedicated labour market analysis resource comprising officers from relevant Australian Government agencies will also be established . This group will provide advice on the composition of the Consolidated Sponsored Occupation List , including identifying any occupations that may be in oversupply in the labour market . <p> The MACSM will also advise on opportunities for skilled migration to enhance productivity , support economic growth , and better align the 457 programme with domestic training and education policies . <h> Market salary rates <p> The review found that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the threshold above which the market salary rate is not assessed , and argued that any 457 visa holder earning in excess of Australian Dollar ( AUD ) $180,000 is adequately equipped to negotiate their own terms and conditions of employment without the need for further government involvement . <p> We will therefore amend the threshold from AUD $250,000 to its pre-July 2013 level of AUD $180,000 . Market rates will continue to be assessed below this threshold . <h> Review of the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold <p> While noting the importance the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold ( TSMIT ) has for ensuring 457 visa holders are able to support themselves , the review noted concerns raised by some stakeholders that the TSMIT creates a barrier for businesses with genuine skill needs . <p> The TSMIT should not be confused with the ' market rate ' requirement , which requires that 457 visa holders be paid at the equivalent wage to an Australian worker in the same occupation and locality . <p> As the review was unable to fully examine this issue specifically , the government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in regional Australia . While this review is undertaken , the TSMIT will remain at its current level ( AUD $53,900 ) . <p> In the review of TSMIT , consideration was given to a range of issues including whether the TSMIT is set at an appropriate level and if the TSMIT should apply to the entire programme or set at a variable level based on factors such as locality . The review also examined the role of TSMIT in ensuring integrity and priority for Australians in the workforce and appropriate indicators to link any increases to the TSMIT . Further information is available at : Review of the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold ( TSMIT ) . <h> English language requirements <p> The review found that while a minimum level of English is necessary and that this requirement should be maintained . <p> To add flexibility and ensure programme integrity is maintained , the English language requirements will be amended to allow applicants to provide an overall score with minimum scores for each test components ( reading , writing , speaking and listening ) . <p> Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English test 's four components ( reading , writing , speaking and listening ) , applicants will have to achieve an average test score of 5 across the components ( with no less than 4.5 in any of the components ) . <p> This change does not represent a consequential lowering of the current English language requirement . <h> Sponsorship <p> The review noted concerns on the part of stakeholders with the July 2013 introduction of a 12 month limitation on the sponsorship approval period for start-up businesses , arguing that this is an insufficient period of time for the business to become viable . <p> We will extend the sponsorship approval period for start-up businesses to 18 months . This will provide them with sufficient time to establish their businesses on a sustainable footing , increasing the attractiveness of Australia as a destination for foreign investment . <p> The sponsorship approval period for other businesses will also be extended from three to five years to simplify processes for sponsorship renewal . <h> Streamlined processing model <p> The review proposed a streamlined model for processing sponsorship , nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would allow for a more targeted and transparent approach to managing risk and compliance by focusing on those applications posing a higher risk , and rewarding low-risk sponsors with a history of compliance .

For example , students applying under the Graduate Work stream of the subclass 485 visa may complete a Diploma in Finance and then a Diploma in Accounting where two units in the last qualification have been granted as credit from the earlier qualification . <p> Where qualifications overlap , periods of study can not be counted more than once . <p> If a student completes more than one qualification , but uses only the most recent qualification to meet the Australian study requirement , then any credit received in the most recent qualification from the previous qualification(s) will count towards meeting the Australian study requirement . <p> The actual period of study within the previous qualification(s) on which the credits were based may also be used to meet the 16 month requirement . <h> Study outside Australia <p> If a student undertook some study overseas but nevertheless completed at least two academic years of study in no less than 16 months in Australia in a CRICOS registered course , they can still meet the Australian study requirement . Example : An applicant who undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study pattern mentioned below will have completed two academic years study in Australia : <p> semester 1 outside Australia <p> semester 2 in Australia <p> semester 3 in Australia <p> semester 4 in Australia <p> semester 5 outside Australia <p> semester 6 in Australia . <p> The pattern of study does not matter as long as the Australian study requirement is met . <h> Completion date <p> Subclass 485 visa applications must be lodged within six months of the date of course completion . <p> The date of course completion is the first date on which the educational institution publicly notifies the student that they have met the requirements for the award of their degree , diploma or trade qualification . This notification can occur by : <p> letter <p> publication in a newspaper <p> publication on the internet <p> email <p> bulletin board at the tertiary institution . <p> This date should not be confused with the date of conferral of award .

The eligible qualifications differ depending on which stream of the subclass 485 visa the applicant selects . <p> For the purposes of applying for a subclass 485 visa under the Post-Study Work stream , only study that results in the conferral of an eligible degree level qualification will be considered . An eligible degree level qualification is a : <p> Bachelor degree <p> Bachelor ( honours ) degree <p> Masters by coursework degree <p> Masters ( extended ) degree <p> Masters by research degree <p> Doctoral degree . <p> Study resulting in a diploma level qualification or trade qualification will not be considered . <p> As an example a student may complete a one year Bachelor degree followed by a one year Masters degree and meet the Australian study requirement under the Post-Study Work stream , provided the other components of the requirement are satisfied . <h> Study must be at a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qualifications Framework ( AQF ) Level 7 or above ( Bachelor degree level or above ) , which leads to the conferral of an eligible degree level qualification , may be considered towards meeting the Australian study requirement . An eligible degree level qualification is a Bachelor degree , Masters by coursework degree , Masters ( extended ) degree , Masters by research degree or Doctoral degree . <p> This means that degree level courses which are packaged with a Graduate Certificate or Graduate Diploma course may be considered , provided they ultimately complete an eligible qualification . <p> Example : Students who complete a Graduate Diploma in Educational Studies which articulates ( or leads ) into a Master of Education are able to use both the study at the Graduate Diploma and at the Masters level towards meeting this requirement . <p> Example : Students who complete a Bachelor of Arts and then a Graduate Diploma in Asia-Pacific Studies will only have study undertaken at the Bachelor degree level considered , as the Graduate Diploma did not contribute towards the conferral of an eligible degree level qualification . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses used to satisfy the Australian study requirement must have been undertaken at an eligible Australian university or any other education provider accredited to offer degree level programs . <h> Applying under the Graduate Work stream <p> The following provides information about the Australian study requirement specific to subclass 485 visa applicants under the Graduate Work stream . <h> Eligible qualifications <p> To meet the Australian study requirement , the course/courses must have resulted in an eligible qualification . The eligible qualifications differ depending on which stream of the subclass 485 visa the applicant selects . <p> For the purposes of applying for a subclass 485 under the Graduate Work stream , the course/courses must have resulted in a degree , diploma or trade qualification . For example , a student may complete two consecutive Diploma level courses and satisfy the Australian study requirement under the Graduate Work stream , provided the other components of the requirement are satisfied . <h> Qualifications must be closely related to nominated occupation <p> The qualification(s) completed must be closely related to the student 's nominated skilled occupation . This means the subject matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the level achieved in the nominated skilled occupation . Example : Acceptable combinations of study and nominated occupations include : <p> an applicant who nominates ' Physiotherapist ' as their skilled occupation and completes a degree in physiotherapy in Australia <p> an applicant who nominates ' Air-conditioning and Mechanical Services Plumber ' as their skilled occupation who has completed a Certificate III in Plumbing and a Diploma of Plumbing and Services in Australia <p> Example : A combination of study and nominated occupation that would not be acceptable : <p> An applicant 's nominated occupation is Registered Nurse but they satisfied the Australian study requirement on the basis of having completed a Bachelor of Commerce . <p> 83113 @qwx703113 83109 @qwx703109

This can result in demands for unpaid duty and penalties where the processed refund application contains false or misleading statements . <p> There are other circumstances in which you might also be eligible for a refund of duty and/or indirect taxes .

We expect employers to take reasonable steps to make sure they are not employing , referring or contracting illegal workers . <p> This guide sets out a range of steps employers can take to make sure they are complying with their obligations . <p> We are focussed on responding to those employers that wilfully take part in illegal work , not penalising employers who act in good faith . <p> We expect employers to check that all non-citizens working for them are allowed to work . This includes : <p> paid and unpaid work <p> if they are sourced directly or via a contractor , labour hire or referral company <p> alternative arrangements that are common in the construction , taxi , hospitality , cleaning and sex industries . <h> Definition of an illegal worker <p> An illegal worker is a non-citizen who is working without a valid visa or working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Australia on a visa has permission to work . <h> Definition of a legal worker <p> Australian citizens , New Zealand citizens and Australian permanent residents are legal workers and have unlimited permission to work in Australia . <p> Some Australian visas have work limitations that could include not being able to work at all or only being able to work with a certain employer or a specific number of hours . <p> An Australian visa holder who is not in breach of their visa conditions is also a legal worker . <h> Australian citizens , permanent resident and New Zealand citizens <p> An employer who is confident that their worker is an Australian citizen , permanent resident or New Zealand citizen would not need to conduct any checks on that worker if : <p> the person has worked in Australia for five or more years ( and has no reason to believe this person is a foreign national ) <p> the person states that they were born in Australia and lived in Australia until at least 10 years old ( and has no reason to believe this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary and further education was in Australia ( and has no reason to believe this person is a foreign national ) <p> the employer has personal knowledge that the person has lived in Australia for ten years or more ( and has no reason to believe this person is a foreign national ) . <h> Proof of citizenship or permanent resident status <p> A single check confirming citizenship or permanent resident status at the time of employment is all that is required . <p> To confirm Australian or New Zealand citizenship an employer can sight : <p> Australian or New Zealand passport <p> Australian birth certificate and a form of photo identification <p> evidence of Australian citizenship and form of photo identification <p> certificate of Status for New Zealand citizens in Australia and a form of photo identification . <p> To confirm permanent resident status , an employer can sight : <p> certificate of permanent resident status and a form of photo identification <h> Visa Entitlement Verification Online ( VEVO ) <p> VEVO is a free online government service and is the preferred method of checking if non-citizens have work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidence that reasonable steps have been taken by an employer to check that a non-citizen is allowed to work . <p> Employers can register as a VEVO Organisation and see the following information for non-citizens : <p> the type of visa the person holds <p> when the visa was granted and when it will expire <p> if the person has unlimited right to work , no work right or work restrictions . <p> The employer must check VEVO themselves , or have received a VEVO email response . Viewing a copy of VEVO results conducted by a third party or a printed copy held by a non-citizen is not sufficient as these could be forged or be out of date . <p> VEVO maintains records of all checks including when the check was conducted , the result , who conducted the check and who it was conducted on . <p> VEVO does not confirm a person 's identity . Employers need to confirm identity by sighting identification documents and make sure these match the VEVO details . <h> VEVO email <p> Employers can ask the non-citizen to send their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A non-citizen can do this when they access VEVO as a visa holder , using one of the following reference types and their date of birth , passport number and country : <p> visa transaction reference number <p> visa grant number <p> visa evidence number <p> password . <p> We inform visa holders of the conditions associated with their visa , including any work limitations or if they have no work rights . If an Australian employer accepts a VEVO email from a visa holder and there are no work restrictions associated with their visa , the employer can be confident that person is a legal worker . <h> VEVO error messages <p> There are many reasons why an error message might appear but the message will explain what options are available . <p> If VEVO returns a result that a person 's visa details could not be found , this could mean : <p> that wrong details have been entered . For example : i.e an O ' has been entered instead of a zero 0 ' , date of birth entered in reverse order or passport details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digits instead of 9 digits ) <p> If VEVO is unavailable , an employer should record the non-citizen 's passport and/or visa details so they can check the visa details when VEVO is available . An employer should also record the date and time that VEVO was unavailable . Keeping records such as these are considered reasonable to show an employer taking steps to check visa details . <h> Using a contractor or labour supplier <p> Employers can still be held responsible for hiring illegal workers even if they use a contractor or labour supplier to source their workers . However , employers can avoid being penalised by adding a clause to their contract or by specifying in writing ( an exchange of letters ) that the supply of labour includes only legal workers . <p> Employers might want to seek independent legal advice in relation to use of the sample wording and clauses to ensure compliance with the Migration Act 1958 and other relevant law , as amended from time to time . <h> How often employers should check visa details <p> Checks should be conducted before a non-citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-citizen 's circumstances change . <p> If a non-citizen is a bridging visa holder and VEVO does not show a visa expiry date , it is good business practice to check every three months that the non-citizen still has permission to work . <h> Alternative employment arrangements <p> Individuals and companies are responsible for employing legal workers even if they are sourced from a referral agent or labour supplier . <p> This includes alternative employment arrangements such as bailment , contracting and subcontracting that are common in the taxi , construction , hospitality , cleaning and sex industries . <p> Employers should take the steps outlined in this Guide for Employers to find out how to avoid penalties . <h> Employment in a domestic setting <p> Householders who engage independent contractors in a domestic setting are not subject to penalties for employing illegal workers because of the short-term basis of the relationship ( unlike employment ) and the limited capacity of householders to check visa details using VEVO . <p> This is limited to householders only and not to organisations that provide services to householders . For example , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that engagement performs a service in a domestic setting , we will hold the company responsible not the householder . <h> Penalties for employing illegal workers <p> The penalties for employing illegal workers are shown in the table below . <p> An example of an individual would be a sole trader ; a body corporate would be a company . <h> Privacy considerations <p> The Australian Information Commissioner provides the following advice for employers who are seeking to understand how their obligations in relation to employing legal workers interact with their obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 . <p> Where an employer decides , taking a risk-based approach , to keep a copy of a document sighted , they should collect the minimum amount of personal information . <p> Australian employers should be aware of their obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 ( the Privacy Act ) .

@@71318298 @18298/ 83111 @qwx703111 <h> Fact sheet " Abolition of the ' White Australia ' Policy <p> The ' White Australia ' policy describes Australia 's approach to immigration from federation until the latter part of the 20th century , which favoured applicants from certain countries . <p> The abolition of the policy took place over a period of 25 years . <p> Following the election of a coalition of the Liberal and Country parties in 1949 , Immigration Minister Harold Holt allowed 800 non-European refugees to remain in Australia and Japanese war brides to enter Australia . <p> Over subsequent years Australian governments gradually dismantled the policy with the final vestiges being removed in 1973 by the new Labor government . <h> The history <p> The origins of the ' White Australia ' policy can be traced to the 1850s . White miners ' resentment towards industrious Chinese diggers culminated in violence on the Buckland River in Victoria , and at Lambing Flat ( now Young ) in New South Wales . The governments of these two colonies introduced restrictions on Chinese immigration . <p> Later , it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific ( known as ' Kanakas ' ) in northern Queensland . Factory workers in the south became vehemently opposed to all forms of immigration which might threaten their jobs ; particularly by non-white people who they thought would accept a lower standard of living and work for lower wages . <p> Some influential Queenslanders felt that the colony would be excluded from the forthcoming Federation if the ' Kanaka ' trade did not cease . Leading NSW and Victorian politicians warned there would be no place for ' Asiatics ' or ' coloureds ' in the Australia of the future . <p> In 1901 , the new federal government passed an Act ending the employment of Pacific Islanders . The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 received royal assent on 23 December 1901 . It was described as an Act ' to place certain restrictions on immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of prohibited immigrants ' . <p> The Act prohibited from immigration those considered to be insane , anyone likely to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or charitable institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or contagious disease ' of a loathsome or dangerous character ' . <p> The Act also prohibited prostitutes , criminals and anyone under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour within Australia ( with some limited exceptions ) . <p> Other restrictions included a dictation test which was used to exclude certain applicants by requiring them to pass a written test . Often tests were conducted in a language the applicant was not familiar with and had been nominated by an immigration officer . <p> With these severe measures the implementation of the ' White Australia ' policy was warmly applauded in most sections of the community . <p> In 1919 the Prime Minister , William Morris Hughes , hailed it as ' the greatest thing we have achieved ' . <h> Second World War <p> After the outbreak of hostilities with Japan , Prime Minister John Curtin reinforced the philosophy of the ' White Australia ' policy , saying ' This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , many non-white refugees entered Australia . Most left voluntarily at the end of the war , but many had married Australians and wanted to stay . Arthur Calwell , the first immigration minister , sought to deport them , arousing much protest . <p> Minister Holt 's decision in 1949 to allow 800 non-European refugees to stay , and Japanese war brides to be admitted , was the first step towards a non-discriminatory immigration policy . <h> The next major step <p> The next major step was in 1957 when non-Europeans with 15 years residence in Australia were allowed to become Australian citizens . <p> The revised Migration Act 1958 introduced a simpler system of entry permits and abolished the controversial dictation test . <p> The revised Act avoided references to questions of race . Indeed , it was in this context that the Minister for Immigration , Sir Alexander Downer , stated that ' distinguished and highly qualified Asians ' might immigrate . <p> After a review of the non-European policy in March 1966 , Immigration Minister Hubert Opperman announced applications for migration would be accepted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their ability to integrate readily and their possession of qualifications positively useful to Australia . <p> At the same time , the government decided a number of ' temporary resident ' non-Europeans , who were not required to leave Australia , could become permanent residents and citizens after five years ( the same as for Europeans ) . <p> The government also eased restrictions on immigration of non-Europeans . The criterion of ' distinguished and highly qualified ' was replaced by the criterion of ' well qualified ' non-Europeans , and the number of non-Europeans allowed to immigrate would be ' somewhat greater than previously ' . <h> A watershed <p> The March 1966 announcement was the watershed in abolishing the ' White Australia ' policy , and non-European migration began to increase . Yearly non-European settler arrivals rose from 746 in 1966 to 2,696 in 1971 , while yearly part-European settler arrivals rose from 1498 to 6054 . <p> In 1973 the Whitlam Labor government took three further steps in the gradual process to remove race as a factor in Australia 's immigration policies . <p> These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , be eligible to obtain citizenship after three years of permanent residence <p> issue policy instructions to overseas posts to totally disregard race as a factor in the selection of migrants <p> ratify all international agreements relating to immigration and race . <p> Because the Whitlam government reduced the overall immigration intake the reform steps that it took had very little impact on the number of migrants from non-European countries . <p> An increase in the number and percentage of migrants from non-European countries did not take place until after the Fraser government came into office in 1975 . <h> Continuing the trend <p> In 1978 the government commissioned a comprehensive review of immigration in Australia . Far-reaching new policies and programs were adopted as a framework for Australia 's population development . <p> They included three-year rolling programs to replace the annual immigration targets of the past , a renewed commitment to apply immigration policy without racial discrimination , a more consistent and structured approach to migrant selection and an emphasis on attracting people who would represent a positive gain to Australia . <h> The present <p> Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to migrate to Australia , regardless of their ethnicity , culture , religion or language , provided that they meet the criteria set out in law.See : Fact Sheet " Migration Program Planning Levels <p> At the time of the 2011 Census of Population and Housing ( August 2011 ) , the resident population of Australia was 21.5 million people .

@@71318313 @18313/ 83111 @qwx703111 <h> Fact Sheet " More than 65 Years of Post-war Migration <p> The Department has facilitated the permanent migration of more than seven million people since its establishment in 1945 . The contribution of migrants to Australian society , culture and prosperity has been an important factor in shaping our nation . <p> A large-scale program of migration to Australia began at the end of World War II when millions of people in Europe were displaced from their homelands . During this time in Australia , there was a desperate shortage of labour and a growing belief that substantial population growth was essential for the country 's future . <p> These and other factors led to the creation of a federal immigration portfolio in 1945 . <p> By 1947 , a post-war immigration boom was under way , with a large and growing number of arrivals including those on government-assisted passage . <p> We reached agreements with the United Kingdom , some European countries and the International Refugee Organisation ( IRO ) to encourage migrants , including displaced persons from war-torn Europe , to come to Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One million more migrants arrived in each of the following four decades . Today , approximately one in four of Australia 's population of more than 22 million people was born overseas . New Zealand and the United Kingdom are the largest source countries for migrants , however , migration from other regions " notably Asia " has increased significantly . <h> Early migration waves <p> The date of the first human occupation in Australia remains unknown but evidence exists that humans have been on the continent for at least 40 000 years . Consequently , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are regarded as the indigenous people of Australia . <p> Transported criminals were the basis of the first migration from Europe . Starting in 1788 , some 160 000 convicts were shipped to the Australian colonies . From the early 1790s , free immigrants also began coming to Australia . <p> The rapid growth of the wool industry in the 1820s created enormous demands for labour and sparked an increase in the migration of free people from the United Kingdom . The social upheavals of industrialisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread poverty and unemployment . <p> During the Gold Rush era of 1851 to 1860 , early migration peaked with around 50 000 people arriving each year . Throughout this period , Chinese immigrants were the largest non-British group . <p> The migration program has reflected economic or social conditions in Australia and elsewhere . For example : <p> during the 1840s a large number of Irish immigrants came to Australia to escape famine in their homeland . <p> from the 1860s to the late nineteenth century , labourers from Melanesia were recruited to work on Queensland plantations . <p> from the 1860s to the 1920s concerns about population imbalance resulted in deliberate efforts to attract women to Australia . <p> during the second half of the nineteenth century , Afghani , Pakistani and Turkish camel handlers played an important part in opening up the continent 's interior , facilitating the construction of telegraph and railway lines . <p> Japanese divers were instrumental in the pearling industry in the late nineteenth century . <p> The two world wars also influenced Australia 's migration program . The resettling of ex-servicemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . <h> Post-war developments <p> The most ambitious phase of Australia 's migration program followed the end of World War II . Australia negotiated agreements with other governments and international organisations to help achieve high migration targets . <p> The agreements , which are no longer in force , included : <p> a system of free or assisted passages for United Kingdom residents <p> an assisted passage scheme for British Empire and United States ex-servicemen , later extended to ex-servicemen or resistance fighters from The Netherlands , Norway , France , Belgium and Denmark <p> an agreement with the IRO to settle at least 12 000 displaced people a year from camps in Europe <p> formal migration agreements , often involving the grant of assisted passage , with the United Kingdom , Malta , The Netherlands , Italy , West Germany , Turkey and Yugoslavia <p> Economic and political events and circumstances around the world subsequently influenced the size and source countries of the Australian program . At various times in the 1950s and 1960s , the Netherlands , Germany , Italy , Greece , Turkey and Yugoslavia were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intakes of : <p> Hungarian and Czech refugees following unrest in those countries in 1956 and 1968 respectively <p> Chileans following the overthrow of the Allende Government in 1973 <p> Indochinese after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 <p> Polish after martial law was declared in December 1981 . <p> Today the migration program is global , using one set of criteria for applicants anywhere in the world , with migrants originating from more than 185 countries . <h> The impact of immigration <p> The post-war immigration program has benefited Australian life in many ways . <h> Economic <p> Immigration is an important contributor to Australia 's economy . It affects the demand side of Australia 's economy through : <p> migrants ' own spending ( food , housing and leisure activities ) <p> business expansion ( investment to produce extra goods and services ) <p> expansion of government services ( health , education and welfare ) <p> increased travel and tourism in Australia , including by overseas friends and families of immigrants . <p> It also affects the supply side of the economy through : <p> labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed by migrants <p> migrant contributions to technology <p> increased access to and knowledge of international business markets . <p> Like all Australians , migrants pay taxes to , and receive benefits and goods and services from the government . Research shows that overall , migrants contribute more in taxes than they consume in benefits and government goods and services . <h> Population composition <p> Migration has had a very significant effect on Australia 's population . At the end of World War II , Australia 's population was over seven million , with around 90 per cent born in Australia . <p> The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated resident population ( ERP ) at June 2011 was 22.32 million people . <p> Of these people , more than one quarter were born overseas ( 6.03 million ) . This continues the historical trend of a high proportion of overseas-born among Australia 's population . People born in the United Kingdom were the largest group of overseas-born residents ( 1.18 million people at 30 June 2011 ) , followed by those born in New Zealand ( 564 920 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Vietnam ( 212 070 ) . <h> Population growth <p> Natural increase has been the main source of population growth over the past hundred years , contributing two-thirds of the increase in population between 1901 and 2001 . Immigration has also been a significant contributor to Australia 's population growth . Since September 2005 , net overseas migration has overtaken natural increase as the main component of population growth . <p> Immigration 's contribution to population growth is likely to increase during the next 30 years as the aging of Australia 's population leads to deaths catching up with births . 83113 @qwx703113 83109 @qwx703109

The first recommendation is that the current licensing regime be retained for customs brokers , depots and warehouses , as no suggested model would be more efficient in meeting the objectives for border management than the existing one . The remaining 14 recommendations are intended to strengthen integrity and streamline processes underpinning the licensing regime for the Department , industry and other government agencies that also license customs brokers , depots and warehouses ( for example , the Australian Taxation Office ) . <p> The Department will continue to work with stakeholders during the implementation of the recommendations . <h> Customs licensing review updates <h> January 2017 <p> Consultation completed on review of all customs licensing arrangements . <p> We hosted a final review workshop on Friday 20 January 2017 . <p> Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues where submissions differed . <p> Three issues were discussed in depth , including : <p> the role of the National Customs Brokers Licensing Advisory Committee <p> whether one license should cover multiple establishments <p> whether to introduce a provisional ' licence for Customs Brokers . <p> We now better understand the reasons for the submitted ideas on these issues and have a clearer way forward to develop recommendations for the Comptroller-General of Customs . <p> The final report and recommendations will be submitted to the Comptroller-General of Customs by 31 March 2017 . <p> We acknowledge the contribution of industry representatives who contributed to the review , especially those who provided feedback on the Issues Paper and who came in person to the workshop on Friday 20 January 2017 . <h> December 2016 <p> The Review of Customs Licensing Regimes Issues Paper ( 260KB PDF ) summarises the key themes raised in the 37 submissions received as part of the Review into licensing regimes under the Customs Act 1901 ( the Review ) .

It is recognised that , for various reasons , couples may sometimes have to live apart . Provided the separation is temporary and the couple had , at some point since commencement of the relationship lived together , their relationship might still satisfy the requirements of a de facto relationship . <p> For this reason , the one year relationship criterion does not require the couple to have physically lived together for the entire 12 months , but rather to have been in a de facto relationship for that period . <p> Partners who are currently not living together may be required to provide additional evidence that they are not living separately and apart on a permanent basis in order to satisfy the requirements of a de facto relationship . <h> What evidence is considered ? <p> When submitting evidence of a de facto relationship , applicants must be able to demonstrate that their relationship has existed for at least one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not limited to : <p> The history of the relationship through a signed statement regarding : <p> how , when and where the couple first met <p> how the relationship developed <p> the couple 's domestic arrangements , that is , how they support each other financially , physically and emotionally and when this level of commitment began <p> any periods of separation , when and why the separation occurred , for how long and how the couple maintained their relationship during the period of separation <p> the couple 's future plans . <p> Financial aspects of the relationship , such as : <p> joint ownership of the house or joint names on a lease <p> correspondence addressed to the couple at the same address <p> details of financial commitments including bank statements , and any joint liabilities . <p> The nature of the household , such as : <p> any joint responsibility for the care and support of any children <p> the couple 's living arrangements including sharing responsibilities within the home . <p> Social context , such as : <p> evidence that the couple is generally accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> evidence of common friends <p> assessments by the couple 's friends and family of the relationship <p> joint travel or joint participation in sporting , social or cultural activities . <p> The couple 's commitment to each other , such as : <p> the duration of the relationship including knowledge of each other <p> intention to have a long term relationship , for example , through terms of their wills <p> correspondence and telephone accounts to show that the couple maintained contact during any periods of separation . <h> Exemptions from the one year relationship requirement <p> The one-year relationship requirement does not apply if the applicant can establish that : <p> there are compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa , for example , there is a child of the relationship <p> the relationship is registered under a law of a state or territory prescribed in the Acts Interpretation ( Registered Relationships ) Regulations 2008 as a kind of relationship prescribed in those regulations <p> their partner is , or was the holder of a permanent humanitarian visa and , before the humanitarian visa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicant that was declared to the Department at the time <p> their partner is an applicant for a permanent humanitarian visa . <h> Commonly asked questions <h> I have been in a de facto relationship for 11 months .

However , your application is likely to be refused unless : <p> there are compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa , for example , there is a child of the relationship or the laws in your home country prevent you living with your partner <p> your relationship is registered under a law of a state or territory prescribed in the Acts Interpretation ( Registered Relationships ) Regulations 2008 as a kind of relationship prescribed in those regulations <p> your partner is , or was the holder of a permanent humanitarian visa and , before the humanitarian visa was granted , was in a de facto relationship with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your partner is an applicant for a permanent humanitarian visa . <h> My partner and I met when we were travelling around the world and realise now that we want to remain together .

This may be the case if , for example , during your travel , you shared accommodation but you each paid your own expenses , were not committed to a mutually exclusive relationship and made no long-term plans for your future until recently . <p> To be considered a de facto couple for migration purposes , you must not be related by family and be able to demonstrate that : <p> you have a mutual commitment to a shared life to the exclusion of all others <p> your relationship is genuine and continuing <p> you live together or do not live separately and apart on a permanent basis . <p> The factors that might be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a de facto relationship include the history of the relationship , social and financial aspects of the relationship , the nature of the household and your commitment to each other .

Will I be eligible to sponsor my partner on a partner visa to Australia ? <p> Despite not living together for one year , your partner may still be eligible for a partner visa .

My partner has a child from a previous relationship who will be migrating to Australia with my partner .

@@71318370 @18370/ 83111 @qwx703111 <h> Deferral Of GST <h> all parts of this guide <h> Overview <p> The Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) operates a scheme that provides for the deferral of GST on imported goods . The Deferred GST Scheme covers GST only ; it does not impact upon customs duty , which must still be paid at the time of importation . <p> Deferral of GST on imported goods extends to all importations that are entered for home consumption ( " home consumption " means that the goods enter into the commerce of Australia ) , either at the time of importation or from a Licensed Warehouse . The scheme also covers amended import declarations where GST is payable . Goods in the following categories are excluded from the scheme : <p> Goods imported under the TRADEX scheme that are diverted into home consumption ; <p> Importers approved as GST deferrers must electronically communicate to the Department . <p> When goods are entered for home consumption , the owner is required to quote the owner 's Australian Business Number ( ABN ) to the Department . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported goods will be released after any customs duty or other charges are paid . The Department records the GST liability of each importation as it is finalised . <p> The Department advises the ATO electronically of the aggregated liability for each owner as determined by the Integrated Cargo System ( ICS ) . <p> The ATO includes the total amount of GST that was deferred during the previous month on the owners next Business Activity Statement ( BAS ) . The ATO then issues the BAS to the owner via the internet . <p> The BAS is due to be lodged and paid by the 21st day following the month in which the GST was deferred . If all the importations for the period are creditable importations , an input tax credit can be claimed in the BAS , which will effectively offset the deferred GST liability . <p> Owners must be registered for GST and must apply to the ATO for approval to participate in the Deferred GST Scheme . Owners not admitted to the scheme will be required to pay duty and GST at the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Customs Act 1901 . <p> Owners must lodge Business Activity Statements monthly <p> Owners who elect to or are required to lodge their Business Activity Statements ( BAS ) monthly may apply to participate in the Deferred GST Scheme . <p> Owners may apply to participate in the Deferred GST Scheme if they lodge their BAS via the internet-based , e-commerce system operated by the ATO . Owners can deal electronically with the Department either directly , or through a licensed customs broker . <p> The ICS does not allow deferral on entries that are lodged manually . Payments of GST on SAC declarations and debit notes can not be deferred . It is a condition of the Deferred GST Scheme that owners must deal with the Department electronically . This condition is contained in regulation 33-15.06 of A New Tax System ( Goods and Services Tax ) Regulations 1999 and it is also stated in Australian Customs Notice ( ACN ) 2000/14 . Owners must either use the services of a licensed customs broker or arrange to obtain a digital certificate and communicate to the Department electronically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make arrangements for connection , contact us here . <p> As a general principle , owners wishing to participate in the Deferred GST Scheme must not have any outstanding debt or returns with the ATO . <p> Owners may be removed from the Deferred GST Scheme if they : <p> fail to lodge their Business Activity Statements by the due date ; <p> fail to pay their ATO obligations by the due date ; <p> are subject to administrative penalties under any Act administered by the Commissioner ; or <p> no longer meet the eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis . <p> Owners who have been removed from the deferral scheme may be readmitted if : <p> they satisfy the rules for admission to the deferral scheme ; and <p> they obtain a bank guarantee in respect of any future liability for GST on imported goods . <p> An application form for approval to defer GST on imported goods is available on the Australian Taxation Office website . Owners can apply to participate on-line at www.ato.gov.au . <h> How does the Integrated Cargo System handle the deferral of GST ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ICS automatically defers ALL GST payable on an import declaration . The ICS calculates the amount of GST to be deferred and this appears on the duty , taxes and charges screen for the import declaration in the ICS . The deferred GST amount ( where applicable ) appears on the import declaration advice . <p> You are not able to elect to defer GST on specific import declarations . If you are approved to defer , then GST is deferred on all lines for every import declaration . Customs Duty is not deferred ; it is payable prior to the goods being delivered into home consumption . <p> The total amount of GST that has been deferred for an ABN is aggregated by the Department and passed to the ATO . <h> Which entries are captured in the deferred GST amount passed to the ATO ? <p> The Department informs the ATO about all amounts of GST deferred on : <p> Import declarations for home consumption that were finalised* during the month . <p> Amended import declarations ( these correct errors on earlier import declarations for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that GST was deferred on the original declaration ) . <p> Please note that , where an amended import declaration reduces the amount of GST deferred , this deferral reduction will be reflected in your BAS only if the amendment was to a declaration that was finalised* in that same month . * Import declarations are finalised when the Department releases the goods . Note that this may be different from the date that funds were debited against the owner 's bank account for duty and/or other charges . <h> Do I have to be connected to the Department 's Electronic Funds Transfer ( EFT ) system to participate in the Deferred GST Scheme ? <p> No . As long as goods are entered for home consumption using the ICS you can participate in the Deferred GST Scheme . Many owners are connected to the Department 's EFT system to make importing a more seamless process . ( In fact , 97% of electronic import declarations are paid using the EFT facility ) . However , if goods are entered electronically but paid by cash or cheque , then deferral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not included in the Deferred GST Scheme ; it only applies to GST . Owners can quote for WET or LCT at the time of importation if they are registered for GST and meet the grounds for quoting . <h> Quoting for LCT <p> From 1 July 2008 the rate of LCT increased from 25 per cent to 33 per cent for cars valued over the LCT threshold ( $57,180 for the 2008-09 year ) . The legislation to increase the rate of LCT also makes available some new concessions including an exemption from LCT for certain fuel efficient luxury cars . More information can be found at ACN 2009/41 . <p> An exemption code " FEV " is available in ICS to enable importers of fuel efficient luxury cars with a value below the FEV threshold to claim the luxury car tax exemption when an import declaration is lodged . <p> Further information regarding Fuel Efficient Luxury Cars is available on the ATO website or by contacting the ATO on 13 28 66 . <h> How does GST deferral work for companies that have a branch/division structure with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch has an ABN and GST branch number . Each importing branch that wants to be on the Deferred GST Scheme must apply for GST deferral and be approved for GST deferral individually . The importing branch then uses its ABN plus GST branch number on the import declaration . <h> How does GST deferral work for GST Groups ? <p> It is not necessary for all members of a Group to apply for admission to the deferral scheme . If a Group member wishes to defer they must apply to defer and the Group representative must also apply . In others words , if a member is in the Deferred GST Scheme then the Group representative must also be in . <p> If another Group member does not want to defer , they pay GST at point of lodging import declarations . The Group representative can claim an input tax credit for the GST paid at importation . <p> Once admitted to the Deferred GST Scheme , each Group member should use its own ABN on each import declaration . The Department advises the ATO of the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATO consolidates these amounts into one total and inserts it as a liability on the BAS for the representative member . This liability may be offset against the input tax credits available to the Group members for any creditable importations ( or creditable acquisitions ) they have made . <h> How can an importer obtain transaction details to reconcile with the aggregate figure included on their BAS by the ATO ? <p> The GST Deferral Report is available on a self-serve basis through the Integrated Cargo System ( ICS ) . The GST Deferral Report contains a breakdown of the GST Deferred amount required for the Australian Taxation Office Business Activity Statement . These reports can be obtained by the importer ( or customs broker that acts on behalf of the importer ) on a self-serve basis through the ICS . Email requests for these reports will no longerbe processed by the Department . <p> Importers can either obtain the reports by : <p> 1 ) Accessing the Integrated Cargo System ( ICS ) ; or <p> 2 ) Requesting the report directly from their customs broker . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To access the ICS a digital certificate is required . <p> Importers can purchase two types of Australian Business Number " Digital Signature Certificates ( ABN - DSCs ) ; Authorised Officer ( AO ) ABN-DSCs and Standard ABN-DSC . The number of certificates you purchase will depend on how many people require them within your organisation . An Authorised Officer ( AO ) ABN-DSC has the authority to request certificates to be issued to other members of an organisation . When purchasing a digital certificate at least one AO must be appointed . An AO ABN-DSC can be purchased for $187.00 ( Inc .

A standard ABN-DSC can be purchased for $93.50 ( Inc .

A carnet is an international ' passport for goods ' under which the payment of duties and taxes is guaranteed by an overseas issuing body . These bodies are typically : <p> automobile associations that are members of the Federations Internationale d'Automobile ( FIA ) or the Alliance International de Tourism ( AIT ) ( for private motor vehicles under Carnet de Passages en Douane ( CPD ) carnets <p> chambers of commerce that are members of the World Chambers Federation ( WCF ) ( for general goods under Admission Temporaire/ Temporary Admission ( ATA ) carnets ) . <p> The carnet must also be produced to us when exporting the goods .

A risk based revenue threshold applies to the security or undertaking that might be required . For more information , see Australian Customs Cargo Advice 2012/01 . <p> Goods subject to security that are above the revenue threshold amount will require a documentary security application .

An extension or a replacement carnet is not valid until it has been endorsed by us at a Client Services counter . <h> Non-compliance with conditions of temporary import <p> If the conditions of the temporary importation are not complied with , for example if the goods are not exported within the approved timeframes or are to remain in Australia permanently , then the total amount of the duty and taxes that would have been payable at the time of importation must be paid . <p> If your security is held by us as cash , then this amount will be used to pay your debt .

Is masters in international business closely related to masters in accounting . Does that mean that qualification must be from the same area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The critical factor in determining whether a qualification is closely related to the nominated skilled occupation is whether the skill set underpinning the qualification is directly transferable to the nominated occupation , in terms of both subject matter and the level of qualification at which those skills were obtained . <p> Hi Pravin - If you are interested in submitting an EOI for a points based visa , you will need a completed positive skills assessment for your nominated occupation . If you do not have your positive skills assessment yet you can still start the process in SkillSelect ( from 1 July ) . When you get your skills assessment , log into SkillSelect and update your profile to complete your EOI for the points based skilled migration visas . You will not be eligible for an invitation until you have a complete EOI . <p> 1 .

If you lodge a visa application then your EOI will continue to be suspended until a final decision is made on your visa application . <p> As the 190 visa is state/territory nominated , states or territories may require that you agree to additional obligations that relate to their nomination , but no visa condition applies which requires the visa holder work in a particular occupation <p> SkillSelect visa applications will continue to be processed in accordance with any priority processing direction in place at that time . <p> My question is similar to the one already asked but I guess it has n't been replied to . Could you please advise whether skills assessments from the VETASSESS particularly , for the nominated occupation of a Marketing Specialist under the ASCO system received in the year 2008 are still valid for lodgment with the DIAC or does one need to get a new assessment done with the ANZSCO in place ? <p> If one gets an invitation through Skill Select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And one has also applied for a 885 visa , which is being processed . My question is--- can one continue to work on 457 visa while awaiting the outcome of 885 visa ? <p> Firstly , I will clarify that you do not receive invitations for the subclass 457 visa program . SkillSelect allows you to express interest in a 457 visa , which allows your EOI to be viewed by employers who may contact you to discuss employment and sponsorship opportunities . <p> Yes , you can continue working on a 457 visa whilst you have an 885 visa application being processed . <p> The subclass 886 and 487 visas remain open to new applications until 1 January 2013 . If you are eligible for this visa you can lodge a visa application directly . Subclass 475 and 176 visas will close to new applications on 1 July 2012 . Therefore , if you were seeking to apply for a 475 or 176 visa and unable to lodge a visa application before 1 July 2012 then you would have to submit an EOI for a 489 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am currently on visa sub class 485 . I have scored 7 and above in each of the IELTS module and I am currently working in Accounts receivable . It has been six months since I started my Accounting job and will complete my 1 year of job on the second week of December . However , I will turn 25 in January 2013 . So far i have only met these criteria for applying for the PR visa class 885 . <p> I was wondering If I could apply for the skill select on the 1st July 2012 . Likewise , I would like to know how long does it take to get an invitation from the DIAC to apply for PR and the tenure of the invitation . <p> As you may be aware , invitations will be issued for the independent and family sponsored skilled visas to the highest ranking EOIs . The issuing of invitations will be a competitive process based on a number of factors , such as the number of EOIs in SkillSelect , where those EOIs are ranked compared to yours and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 days . <p> After each invitation round , we will publish on our website the lowest scoring EOI that received an invitation for each occupation group ( at a four-digit level ANZSCO code ) , this will give you an indication of your potential for receiving an invitation . <p> For the state or territory nominated and business innovation and investment visas , an invitation will be issued to you automatically when the state or territory nominates you through SkillSelect . <p> Remember you can also express interest in our employer sponsored visas , this will allow your EOI to be viewed by employers who may contact you to discuss employment and sponsorship opportunities . <p> Hi Miranda , Thanks for great post , My brother got TRA ( trade recognition australia which we do before lodging visa application ) 6 years ago , is that still valide.will that TRA helpful in the Skillselect Process , Pl suggest me thanks <p> Yes you can use this positive skills assessment when you submit your EOI as long as it relates to your nominated occupation . The validity of skills assessment results will not have an expiration time under SkillSelect.

As an approved sponsor , there is no limit to the number of eligible skilled positions you can nominate . <h> Who can become a sponsor <p> Australian businesses must also demonstrate their commitment to employing local labour as well as non-discriminatory recruitment practices . <p> There are two ways you can become an approved sponsor : <p> Option 1 : Apply to be a standard business sponsor <p> Option 2 : Negotiate a labour agreement . <h> Option 1 : Apply to be a standard business sponsor <p> The standard business sponsorship arrangement is the most common way to sponsor a skilled worker using the subclass 457 visa program . You must lodge an application to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one standard business sponsorship approved at any given time ( that is , one sponsorship approval per legal entity ) which is usually valid for five years . You can apply to extend your sponsorship at any time during this five-year period by lodging a variation application . <p> The requirements for approval as a standard business sponsor differ for businesses that are outside and in Australia . <p> Business in Australia <p> You must attest , in writing , that you have a strong record of , or a demonstrated commitment to employing local labour . You must also declare that you will not engage in discriminatory recruitment practices . <p> Make the attestation and the declaration about your workplace record in your sponsorship application form . <p> You must also meet training requirements . This means you must either : <p> meet the training benchmarks if you have traded in Australia for 12 months or more <p> have an auditable plan to meet the training benchmarks if you have been trading in Australia for less than 12 months . <p> Business outside Australia <p> You must be seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or help establish , a business operation in Australia <p> fulfil obligations for a contract in Australia . <p> If your business does not yet have an operating base in Australia , you are not required to satisfy the training requirement . <h> Option 2 : Negotiate a labour agreement <p> A labour agreement is a formal arrangement negotiated between an Australian employer and the Australian Government . You might be able to enter into a labour agreement if you are in one of the following situations : <p> A labour agreement comes into effect when it has been signed by all parties involved in the negotiations . A labour agreement is typically valid for three years . <p> How to propose a labour agreement <p> You need , among other things , to : <p> identify the relevant skills shortage in the business and why these vacancies can not be filled by Australian workers ( you need to show you have tried to recruit in Australia ) <p> specify the number of skilled workers needed from outside Australia <p> specify the skill and English language requirements that relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided they are specialised and in demand <p> include copies of correspondence showing that relevant stakeholders have been consulted . <p> You might be able to use a template labour agreement if there is one for your industry or your worker 's occupation . A template labour agreement is a set of standard parameters for similar employers : it does not guarantee an agreement will be approved . <p> If the template does not suit your needs , you- might be able to negotiate an individual agreement . <p> Labour agreements include a requirement to provide training to Australian employees . <p> When you have a labour agreement in place , you are an approved sponsor for the term of operation of the agreement . You can then nominate skilled workers from outside Australia under the terms of the labour agreement . <p> You will also need to meet your sponsorship obligations and any other terms and conditions specified in the agreement. - If you breach the terms and conditions of your agreement , we could suspend or terminate it. - - - - - <h> A lawfully operating business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a standard business sponsor . This applies to businesses both in and outside Australia . <p> To demonstrate this you must show both of the following : <p> your business is legally established <p> your business is actually operating . <p> A business that exists only on paper can not satisfy this sponsorship requirement . <p> If you do not operate in Australia , you must be able to show that you need a skilled worker to : <p> come to Australia to establish , or help establish , a business operation with connections with a business located outside Australia <p> fulfil , or help in fulfil , a contractual obligation . <p> If your business is new , you can still satisfy this requirement if you can provide evidence that your business is in fact operating , even if this has been for only a short period of time . <p> Examples of the documents you can use to show that your business is legally established and operating are in the Document checklist . <p> If you operate a business under a trust arrangement you must provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you complete the application form. - The application should be made using the name of the Trustee as it appears in the Trust Deed . <p> Details of the principals of your business such as Owners , Partners , Directors and major Shareholders should be provided when you complete the application form . - <h> Training requirements <p> You must show that you have contributed to the training of Australian workers by providing evidence of meeting the training benchmarks . These benchmarks were introduced to ensure that the employment of workers from outside Australia is not seen as an alternative to training Australian workers . <p> To be approved as a standard business sponsor , you must either : <p> meet the training benchmarks if you have traded in Australia for 12 months or more <p> have an auditable plan to meet the training benchmarks if you have been trading in Australia for less than 12 months . <p> If you negotiate a labour agreement , your business will have to meet a similar training requirement as part of the agreement . <h> Training benchmarks <p> If your business has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must show you have contributed to the training of Australians . <p> You show this by meeting one of two benchmarks .

This includes paying- overseas workers the ' market salary rate ' . <p> This requirement is designed to protect skilled overseas workers from exploitation .

GDP per capita in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) terms is just over one-sixth of Australia 's . <p> These economic factors have contributed to the Philippines having one of the world 's largest diasporas , with an estimated 12 million Filipinos living overseas .

Global Irregular Maritime Migration : Current and Future Challenges ( April 2014 ) ( 859KB PDF ) Authors : Ms Marie McAuliffe and Ms Victoria Mence With changes in global migration occurring at a more rapid pace than perhaps ever before , it is essential to view global irregular maritime migration as part of bigger dynamic forces rather than a narrow , discrete phenomenon .

The same approach will also be used to allocate an immigration risk rating to each country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education provider and country of citizenship would be used to guide the level of financial capacity and English language proficiency related documentation that the student would need to provide with their student visa application . <p> Through this model , all education providers across all education sectors will have access to the benefits associated with streamlined evidentiary requirements ' for at least some countries . <h> Meaning of streamlined evidentiary requirements ' <p> Where streamlined evidentiary requirements apply , the student visa applicant will generally be able to satisfy the Department of their financial capacity and English language proficiency by declaration . <p> This is similar to existing streamlined visa processing and Assessment Level ( AL ) 1 arrangements . The Department would however retain the discretion to seek additional information about the student 's financial capacity and English language proficiency where appropriate . <p> All students , regardless of the financial capacity and English language proficiency documentation that may be required , will continue to have to meet all other core visa criteria , such as the Genuine Temporary Entrant requirement and health and character criteria . <h> Eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students would have streamlined evidentiary requirements under the SSVF : <p> All students enrolled at education providers with the lowest immigration risk ratings ( similar to the current AL1 ) <p> All students from countries with the lowest immigration risk ratings ( similar to the current AL1 ) <p> Students enrolled at education providers with medium immigration risk ratings ( similar to the current AL2 ) , provided that the student 's country of citizenship has a low or medium immigration risk rating ( equivalent to the current AL1 or AL2 ) . <h> Calculating immigration risk ratings for the SSVF <p> The methodology used to determine immigration risk under the SSVF will be similar to the methodology used in the existing streamlined visa processing arrangements and the AL framework . The methodology currently takes into account statistical data on visa refusal rates ( fraud and non-fraud related ) , rates of students overstaying their visa and visa cancellation rates . <p> In line with recommendation 5 of the Future directions for streamlined visa processing report , further consultation is occurring with a working group of members from the Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Non-publication of immigration risk ratings of education providers and countries <p> Due to commercial sensitivities , it is intended the immigration risk ratings of education providers and countries will not be published but will instead feed into an online tool that will guide students about their likely English language proficiency and financial capacity evidentiary requirements . <h> Updates to immigration risk ratings <p> Immigration risk ratings are intended to be updated every six months based on immigration risk outcomes from the previous 12-month period . <h> Accessing education provider immigration risk data <p> To assist in implementation of the SSVF , the Department proposes to send all education providers details about their current immigration risk rating in approximately October 2015 . <p> Following implementation , the Department intends that education providers will be able to access their immigration risk rating on a regular basis through an online reporting tool . <h> Opting-in ' to the SSVF <p> Education providers will not be required to formally opt-in ' as the SSVF will apply to all education providers . <h> Obligations for education providers under the SSVF <p> There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct result of the SSVF . While an education provider may choose to put in place strategies in order to obtain or maintain a lower immigration risk rating , there will no obligation or requirement for education providers to do this . <h> Nominating educational business partners under the SSVF <p> Education providers will not be required to formally nominate educational business partners under the SSVF and will be able to package with other education providers with whom they have a commercial arrangement . <h> Immigration risk ratings applied to smaller education providers <p> It is intended that education providers that enrol small numbers of international students will be allocated a default risk rating of two ' , with some possible exceptions . Further details will be provided closer to implementation . <h> Commencement date for the new SSVF <p> Subject to the regulatory change process , it is expected that the SSVF will be implemented in mid-2016 . <h> Current streamlined visa processing arrangements <p> The current streamlined visa processing policy guidelines are due to expire at the end of June 2016 .

These frameworks primarily determine the level of evidence of financial capacity , English language proficiency and academic background that the student needs to provide with their student visa application . <p> Under the AL framework , there are three assessment levels with AL1 representing the lowest immigration risk and AL3 the highest . The higher the AL , the greater the amount of evidence an applicant is required to demonstrate to support their claims for the grant of a student visa . <p> Under SVP , eligible student visa applicants - that is , students whose main course of study is an Advanced Diploma , Bachelor degree , Masters , Doctoral degree or eligible exchange programme at a participating SVP education provider - are not assigned an AL . If a student is eligible for SVP , they will generally have requirements for financial capacity , English language proficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply under the current AL1 , regardless of their country of origin . <h> Applying for a student visa under the SSVF <p> Under the SSVF , the combined immigration risk outcomes of the student 's education provider and country of citizenship will be used to guide the level of documentation relating to financial capacity and English language proficiency that the student would need to provide with their student visa application . <p> Additionally , students would no longer apply for a specific student visa subclass applicable to their level of study for example , subclass 573 for Higher Education . Rather , it is intended that there will be only one student visa subclass for which all prospective students will apply . <h> Financial and English language documentary requirements when applying for a student visa under the SSVF <p> It is intended that students will be able to identify what documents they will be required to provide with their visa application by entering their intended education provider and country of citizenship into an online tool . <p> The level of documentary evidence required in relation to financial and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prospective student 's education provider and country of citizenship . <p> Generally , students enrolled at an education provider with the lowest immigration risk outcomes will have lower evidentiary requirements , regardless of their nationality .

The first VAC is a processing fee and is not refunded if the application is unsuccessful . <h> Second VAC <p> A second VAC is required for each individual applicant included in the application . Payment of the second VAC is not required until just before the grant of a visa.Note : Processing times for contributory parent category visas can vary so it is important that applicants ensure they have available funds for the second VAC at all times in the application process as payment may be required at an earlier date than was originally anticipated at the time of visa lodgement . <p> The second VAC for the contributory parent category is considerably higher than for the parent visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme year which results in faster processing time of approximately 2-4 years . <p> The second VAC is only refunded in limited circumstances .

The cost of the fabric provided is considered a production assist cost and must be included in the customs value of the goods .
