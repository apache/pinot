If you file separately , you generally can not take tax credits , such as the child and dependent care credit , and you ca n't claim the standard deduction unless your spouse does the same . If you live in a community property state , you may have to claim some of your spouse 's income and deductions , even when you file separately . <h> Marriage Tax or Marriage Penalty <p> You may have heard of the " marriage tax " or the " marriage penalty . " There is no specific tax for married people . The so-called marriage penalty is the higher total tax some taxpayers may pay due to provisions in the tax code . <p> For example , you can use $3,000 of capital losses to offset ordinary income , such as wages , every year . A single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a married couple together can only deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income .

Make sure you really owe the money <p> If you owe a lot more tax than you expected , find out why . <p> Read your completed return carefully , and look for errors . Its easy to add the same income twice or to forget an important deduction . <p> If your tax return does n't  show a deduction or credit you thought you qualified for , make sure you answered all the questions correctly . <p> One missed question or checkbox can cause you to miss out on tax benefits you may be entitled to . <p> Another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years return to your tax return from last year .

Call or write to the IRS for clarification . <h> 2 . Minimize penalties and interest <p> Large tax bills are worse if you have to- pay penalties and interest on top of the original amount owed . Luckily , you can minimize these extra charges- in three ways : <p> Exceptions to underpayment of tax penalties <p> If you underpaid your taxes this year , but owed considerably less last year , you typically do n't  pay a- penalty for underpayment of tax if you withheld at least as much as you owed last year .

@@12200407 @800407/ <h> 7 Best Tax Deductions , Exemptions , and Credits for Families <p> While your children are young you have plenty of expenses . Fortunately , some of those expenses can directly or indirectly turn into deductions , exemptions or credits that may mean big savings on your tax bill . <p> Take a look at the following tax benefits to see which ones could be beneficial for you . <h> 1 . Dependency exemptions . <p> You ca n't take a deduction for money you spend on food , clothing , shelter and other basic necessities for your children , but the dependency exemption lowers your taxes in much the same way as a deduction would . <p> Typically , you can claim an exemption for each child or relative who meets a certain set of tests who you claim as a dependent . In 2015 , you can likely reduce your taxable income by $4,000 for each of your dependents . <p> If you welcomed a new baby into your family this year , remember that you can claim the dependency exemption . It does n't  matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 you can still take the exemption for the entire year . <h> 2 . Child and dependent care tax credit . <p> If you paid someone to take care of your child or another eligible dependent while you worked or looked for work , you may qualify for a credit of up to 35 percent of the first $3,000 you paid the provider for one child . For two or more children , the credit may be as much as 35 percent of up to $6,000 in expenses " that 's a maximum credit of $2,100 . <p> The amount of your credit goes down as your income goes up . If your adjusted gross income is over $15,000 , the percentage used to calculate the credit is reduced . If your adjusted gross income is over $43,000 , the percentage is 20 percent of expenses . <p> You can take this credit until your child reaches age 13 . You can also take the credit for children over 13 and other qualifying dependents who are physically or mentally incapable of caring for themselves . They must live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking a credit , you may be able to use dependent care benefits offered by your employer . These benefits may include contributions paid by your employer to you or directly to the care provider . . You do n't have to pay Social Security or income tax on this money , which makes for better tax savings than the child and dependent care credit . <h> 3 . Child tax credit . <p> Thanks to a permanent extension , you may qualify for a $1,000 child tax credit for 2015 and beyond . The credit is good until the year your qualified dependent turns 17 . <p> It starts to phase out when income rises past $75,000 ( $110,000 if filing jointly ) . For taxpayers in lower tax brackets , the credit is refundable , which means they may get a refund even if the credit exceeds their income tax liability for the year . <h> 4 . Earned income credit ( EIC or EITC ) . <p> The earned income credit helps moderate-to-lower income working families make ends meet . It can mean a significant amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , if you have three or more qualifying children , you could qualify for a maximum credit in 2015 of $6,242 . This is a refundable credit , meaning you can get money back even if you had little or no income tax withheld . <p> To qualify for the earned income credit as a single , head of household , or widowed filer , you must have adjusted gross income of less than $39,131 if you have one child , $44,454 if you have two children , or $47,747 if you have three or more children . <p> If you are married filing jointly , you may qualify if you have adjusted gross income of less than $44,651 if you have one child , $49,974 if you have two children , or $53,267 if you have three or more children . <h> 5 . Adoption credit . <p> If you adopted or paid adoption expenses in 2015 , the adoption credit can be a financial lifesaver . The credit refunds qualified adoption expenses dollar for dollar , up to $13,400 in 2015 . <p> If your modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit is reduced . If its $241,010 or more , you wo n't qualify for this credit . <h> 6 . Head of Household or Qualifying Widow(er) filing status . <p> It 's not a deduction or credit , but it can save you money . If you 're single , you would normally use the Single filing status . <p> If you have a child , however , and you pay more than half the cost of maintaining a home for that qualifying child , you may be able to file as Head of Household . This is true even if the childs other parent claims the dependency exemption . <p> If your spouse died in 2013 or 2014 and you have a dependent child or stepchild living with you , you may be able to file as a Qualifying Widow(er) . ( If your spouse died in 2015 , you generally file a joint return with him or her for the year . ) You should pay less tax by using either of these filing statuses than by filing as Single . <h> 7 . Education tax credits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older , especially when they go to college . <p> Education tax credits can help significantly , however . The American Opportunity Credit , which expanded and renamed the already-existing Hope Scholarship Credit , can be claimed for up to the first $2,000 you spend on tuition , fees , books , supplies and equipment for yourself , your spouse and your dependent children . <p> If you qualify , it also gives you 25 percent of the next $2,000 back as a credit . That means you could receive a total credit of up to $2,500 per eligible student . You can now use the American Opportunity Credit for all four years of a child 's undergraduate studies . <p> The American Opportunity Credit amount you can claim is reduced when your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $80,000 ( $160,000 if you file jointly ) , and disappears when your modified adjusted gross income is over $90,000 ( $180,000 for joint filers ) . <p> If you do n't qualify for the American Opportunity Tax Credit , you may be able to take the Lifetime Learning Credit . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain related expenses up to $10,000 . <p> No matter how many students are on your return , the most you can take under the Lifetime Learning Credit is $2,000 . The maximum Lifetime Learning Credit you can claim is reduced when your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $54,000 ( $108,000 if you file jointly ) , and disappears when your modified adjusted gross income is over $64,000 ( $128,000 for joint filers ) . <p> You ca n't use the same expenses for more than one education tax benefit and you can not claim both credits for the same student in the same year . You can only claim the American Opportunity Credit for up to four tax years for the same student 's expenses . @qwx180326 @qwx180320 @qwx180325

He we will have to report the money to the IRS , BUT will pay nothing since it is under the 5 million . Is this correct ? <p> Any amount over $14,000 that your father gives you will need to be reported to the IRS through a Gift Tax return and will go toward his Lifetime Exemption amount which is $5.45 million ( current figure for 2016 ) . As long as your father has not given over $5.45 million total in his lifetime , he will not have to pay taxes on the amount until that point . <p> Anyone can gift an individual up to $14,000 in one year without having to file a Gift Tax return or pay taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give $14,000 to a friend , you can do that and neither of you will have to pay taxes . If someone borrows money from you interest free with the intent to repay you later , that is considered an interest free loan and is not subject to taxes either . If you charge interest , then you would have to pay income taxes on the interest earned . <p> Hi Mike ! If your mother gifts you $60k , you will not have to pay any taxes on the amount . However , she will need to file a Gift Tax return when she files her taxes and that $60k will go toward her Lifetime Exemption amount . She will not have to pay taxes on it until she gifts over $5.45 million . Let us know if you have any other questions ! <p> Hi Catherine !

Thank you ! <p> This is certainly an interesting scenario . And , in this case , while we cant speak for the IRS , we are fairly confident they will frown upon this type of situation . More than likely , as they review where the money went and discover it ultimately landed with your brother , they will go back to your parents and require them to complete a Gift Tax Return .

While we cant cover all possible situations with one answer , generally money any received through a GoFundMe account is not taxable .

The funds would be used towards our personal debt . Would we have to pay a gift tax ? <p> This sounds like an interesting situation and definitely one we would need to know a few more details about before being able to give a confident answer . However , any money earned through a website is typically considered taxable income and not a gift .

If so , do I have to transfer to their account three separate checks , or is one check for the total amount OK ? <p> You are able to give up to $14,000 to any one individual in one year without being subject to tax .

For example , one source of some of the money told him that he could use it to buy pizza if he wanted . <p> Generally , a scholarship is tax free if you are a student pursuing a degree at an eligible educational institution and meets these requirements : amount received does n't  exceed your qualified education expenses ; it is n't earmarked for other purposes like room , board or pizza and does n't  require that it ca n't be used for qualified education expenses ; and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to receive the scholarship .

For example , if your mom bought the property for $100,000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is $100,000 . If later you end up selling the home for $300,000 , you then have a taxable gain of $200,000 and will have to pay capital gains tax on that amount . <p> I have read that parents should not put children on the title but should leave it to them in their will . Then the house passes to the child at the current market rate as the new " basis " which is more beneficial when selling the house one day . <p> You 're right . Making the decision to not add your child to the title is often times the better route to go for the children . The higher the basis when the house exchanges hands , the better off the children will be when they go to sell the property later on down the road . <p> You will not be liable for any taxes on the monetary gift . However , your parents may be responsible for a gift tax being that your suggested amount exceeds the annual exclusion amount of $14,000 for tax year 2016 . Your parents will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure they are in compliance with those rules and guidelines . <p> my dad sold his condo and wants to give me half of the proceeds to help me pay some of my bills . The other half of the proceeds is going to help him buy a house with himself and my brother for them to share . Do I have to pay taxes on that money ? <p> You will not have to pay a gift tax on the amount your dad gives you . However , its important for your dads gift to not exceed the annual exclusion amount of $14,000 for tax year 2016 if he wants to avoid being subject to a gift tax on the amount he gives you . <p> My dad paid cash for an auction house for my family . He put the house under my husband and my name . We plan on taking out a mortgage to repay him the cash he put down . But , now the house is in our names and shows that it was paid with cash by us and we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen when we do taxes ? Do we have to pay any kind of extra fees ? Feeling very confused ? ? <p> In this case , your dad would likely need to file a gift tax return if the house value is more than $14,000 . And being that you already technically own the home , you may not be able to take out a traditional mortgage . Using a home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) is an option to pay back your father and the interest on the HELOC will be tax deductible similar to a mortgage . There will not be any other fees or taxes related to this item on your tax return . However , we would suggest consulting with your loan provider first before making any decisions to discuss your options and determine the best fit for your situation . <p> You are not liable for any tax on the gift , however your mom will want to make sure she files a gift tax return when she files next tax season . She is responsible for the taxes associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion , she will not have to pay any tax until she has given over $5.43 million* . <p> my son incurred 125000 in bail and legal fees , my parents gave the money to me to dispurse to him <p> my parents file joint taxes and paid taxes on this money . I file joint taxes with my wife and our combined income is about 85000. my son ( with legal problems / 19 going on twenty and living at home no going to college yet ) and daughter ( senior in highschool ) are dependents . 56000 could be claimed as a gift <p> can i receive $14000 from more than 1 family member without having to pay taxes . I am in the process of buying a house and my dad was going to give me $14000 and my brother $14000 for the down payment . Would I have pay taxes since it is coming from 2 different family members ? <p> You would not have to pay any taxes whatsoever on any gift received . The only people who would have to worry about taxes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have to pay or file a gift tax return because they are allowed to give up to $14,000 per person per year in 2015 . The number of family members giving you a gift has no importance whatsoever . <p> What , if any , taxes are to be paid on money given to workers from the owner each week during the year and for year after year . Personal checks are written for $300-$3,000 a week to some of the more than a dozen females . Much is supposedly for needs like a new motorcycle for the husband of one , new TV for others and some just go on vacations and buy jewelry . Not related with any of them and prefers to use them for groping . It is hard for me to believe these minimum wage girls are buying new cars , dressing nice , I phones etc. when they make min. on 35 40 hours a week . Loophole or a week IRS ? <p> My Parents live in israel and i live in nyc they want to transfer me money as a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " report " my self so i do n't  have problem later on i need to point out i 'm currently on green card but already in process to become citizen thank you in advance <p> That is correct Mary , but that is the limit per year per person . You also get a lifetime exemption of $5.43 million in case you happen to go over that $14,000 threshold . If you do go over the $14,000 , you must file a gift tax return . The likelihood of you paying any gift tax though is slim because of the lifetime exemption . <p> My Grandmother , whom is still alive , set up paperwork to where my MOM receives the profit from the sale of her condo- which sold two years ago , and was 180,000 . The tax preparer had to consult a supervisor , etc , and they said they do n't  think that the gift means that Mom owes taxes on it- but they said something about the " five year " period of time , which DID pass- being the reason that the inheritance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is n't an " audit " but is asking for proof of this or that- but does n't  say anything about the inheritance- but asks for other proofs such as the " circuit breaker " Senior credit proof .

@@12200459 @800459/ <p> No matter how large the transaction , or how much money you received as a result of the sale , you wait until you file your income tax return to report the sale to the IRS . <p> However , that does n't mean you do n't need to do anything until next year . In fact , it could be an expensive mistake if you wait until you prepare your tax return to plan for any tax on capital gains . <p> It 's very important when you sell an asset to determine if you need to make estimated tax payments or otherwise plan for the tax consequences of the sale . <h> Why worry about estimated tax payments ? <p> The IRS may require you to make quarterly estimated tax payments if you have substantial income , such as that from the sale of an asset , not subject to withholding . <p> For tax year 2015 , you may need to make quarterly payments if you owe more than $1,000 when you prepare your tax return , and your withholding and refundable credits are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your tax for the previous year . <p> If you do n't make estimated tax payments , you could face penalties and interest charges on the amount of tax you should have paid during the year . <h> Will you pay additional taxes as a result of capital gains ? <p> The first thing you need to know is if your tax bill will go up as a result of the sale . If you did n't have a substantial gain , the sale may not affect your taxes much . <p> For example , if you sold an asset , no matter how valuable it was , for less or little more than you paid for it , there 's little to worry about . <p> Perhaps the easiest way to find out if you owe more money as a result of selling an asset is to run next year 's tax numbers using TaxAct 's tax calculator . <p> Answer all the questions based on your expectations for the entire year . It 's alright to estimate . As you work , you 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in the upper right corner of your screen . <h> How else can I estimate the tax on a capital asset ? <p> Another way to quickly determine how much tax you 'll pay on a sale is to estimate the gain based on your tax rate . <p> If you sell a capital asset you owned for one year or less , you will pay tax at your ordinary income tax rate . <p> For example , say you sold stock at a profit of $10,000 . You held the stock for six months . If your federal income tax rate is 25 percent , you 'll owe about $2,500 in tax on your short-term capital gain . <p> If you had the same $10,000 profit , but you held the asset for more than one year , the tax rate is lower . <p> If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket , for example , your tax rate on long-term capital gains is only 15 percent . You only owe $1,500 in capital gains tax . <p> In that case , the entire gain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is now in a higher bracket . <p> Consider an example where a taxpayer is in the 15 percent marginal tax bracket before any capital gains . The taxpayer then sells a parcel of land that is considered to be a capital asset at a significantly greater value than the taxpayer 's basis in the land . The taxpayer will have to recognize a capital gain from the sale of the land . <p> If the capital gain is $50,000 , this amount may push the taxpayer into the 25 percent marginal tax bracket . In this instance , the taxpayer would pay 0 percent of capital gains tax on the amount of capital gain that fit into the 15 percent marginal tax bracket . <p> The remaining portion of the capital gain that pushes the taxpayer into the 25 marginal tax bracket is then subject to a 15 percent capital gains tax . <h> When to make estimated tax payments <p> You should generally pay the capital gains tax you expect to owe before the due date for payments that apply to the quarter of the sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter , June 15 for second quarter , September 15 for third quarter and January 15 of the following year for the fourth quarter . When a due date falls on a weekend or holiday , your quarterly payment is due the following business day . <p> Even if you are not required to make estimated tax payments , you may want to pay the capital gains tax shortly after the salewhile you still have the profit in hand . <h> Making quarterly estimated tax payments <p> You can use TaxAct to determine your quarterly payments and print out a quarterly payment voucher . You 'll need to print the voucher , attach a check or money order and mail it to the IRS before the due date . <p> Another option is to use Electronic Funds Withdraw ( EFW ) to have a payment deducted from your bank account automatically . You can set this up using TaxAct software . <p> The IRS also has a phone system and Internet site that accepts payments by credit or debit card . Unfortunately , there is an additional convenience fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated taxes and other payments regularly , it 's worth the time required to set up an account with the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System ( EFTPS ) , which is a service provided for free by the U.S. Department of Treasury . If you wish to use EFTPS , its always best to plan ahead . <h> Alternatives to making estimated tax payments <p> Instead of making estimated tax payments , you may choose to increase your income tax withholding to cover the additional tax . <p> Another strategy is to plan other tax events to counteract the effect of the capital gains tax . <p> For example , you may want to sell an asset that has gone down in value , make a business investment or contribute to charity during the same year as the sale . Losses on investments are first used to offset capital gains , which means the less tax you 'll pay on the capital gain . <p> However , it 's important to note , losses can only be deducted against capital gains of the same nature . For example , short-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Additionally , you can only deduct up to $3000 of net long-term capital losses in a given tax year . Any excess net long-term capital losses can be carried forward until there is sufficient capital gain income or the $3000 net long-term capital loss limitation is exhausted . <p> If you 've sold an asset recently , did you plan for the tax consequences before you made the sale ? @qwx180326 @qwx180320 @qwx180325

@@12200463 @800463/ <h> Investments and Taxes <h> Share This <p> Many of your returns from investments are treated favorably under the tax law . For example , if you sell a long-term capital asset , such as stock , you may pay less than half as much tax on any gain as you would pay on the same amount of wages . Not only is the capital gain not subject to payroll taxes , but it is taxed at a lower rate than you pay on ordinary income . <p> To take advantage of the tax benefits for certain investments , you need to understand a few rules . <h> Length of Time You Hold an Asset <p> The length of time you hold an asset can make a big difference in how much tax you pay on any gain . If you own a stock for 11 months , for example , you pay ordinary income tax rates on the gain - 25% for many taxpayers . <p> If you hold that stock a little longer - over the one-year mark - you pay the capital gains rate of 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains tax rate may be 20% , 15% , or even 0% . High-income taxpayers are subject to an additional 3.8% capital gains tax . ) <h> Wash Sale <p> Wash sale rules are another case where you need to know the rules - before you sell stocks and buy them back again . In most cases , if you sell capital assets at a loss , you can deduct that loss against other capital gains or , to a limited extent , against ordinary income . If you buy the same stock back within 30 days before or after the sale , you ca n't take the loss this year . Instead , the loss increases your basis in the new stock . <p> Knowing the rules can help you make better investment decisions . <p> For example , say you are comparing an investment that pays dividends to a deposit account that pays interest . If they pay the same rate , it seems like a toss-up - until you consider that qualified dividends on stock you have owned over 60 days are taxed at 15% , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Interest is taxed at ordinary income tax rates . That makes the dividend paying investment with a comparable return a better deal after you consider taxes . <h> Real Estate Rental Property <p> One investment that has traditionally provided tax benefits is real estate rental property . If you invest in real estate and rent it out , or you convert a former residence to rental property , you probably have many expenses you can deduct against the rental income on your tax return . You can deduct mortgage interest , property taxes , repairs and maintenance , for instance . <p> You can also deduct depreciation expense to account for loss of value of the building ( but not the land ) over time . Because depreciation does n't represent a cash outlay on your part , the depreciation deduction means you could have a tax loss on your real estate rental , even if you do not have a negative cash flow . <p> If you actively participate in the management of the property , you may be able to use a loss of up to $25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as wages . Be sure to file jointly if you live with your spouse , otherwise you ca n't take this deduction . If you lived apart from your spouse the entire year , you may be able to use a loss of up to $12,500 . <h> Employee Stock Options <p> If your employer offers employee stock options , you may benefit from special tax treatment of these options if you meet the qualifications . <p> If you meet the qualifications , you do n't pay tax until you actually sell the stock , not when you receive or exercise the option . In addition , you effectively convert a benefit from your employer from ordinary income to a capital gain - so you can use the lower capital gains tax rates . <p> The holding periods are different for statutory stock options than for most capital assets . To use the preferential capital gains tax rates , you must wait two years from the option grant date , or one year from the exercise date , to sell the stock . Otherwise , part or all of your gain is taxed as ordinary income .

The entry of days is only used for the calculation of the Vacation Home Limitation Worksheet , if it is necessary , or the determination that there was only minimal rental use . <p> The following information is from IRS Publication 527 , starting on page 17 : <p> Personal Use of Dwelling Unit ( Including Vacation Home ) <p> If you have any personal use of a dwelling unit ( including a vacation home ) that you rent , you must divide your expenses between rental use and personal use . In general , your rental expenses will be no more than your total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the total number of days the dwelling unit is used and the numerator of which is the total number of days actually rented at a fair rental price . Only your rental expenses may deducted on Schedule E ( Form 1040 ) . Some of your personal expenses may be deductible on Schedule A ( Form 1040 ) if you itemize your deductions . <p> You must also determine if the dwelling unit is considered a home . The amount of rental expenses that you can deduct may be limited if the dwelling unit is considered a home . Whether a dwelling unit is considered a home depends on how many days during the year are considered to be days of personal use . There is a special rule if you used the dwelling unit as a home and you rented it for less than 15 days during the year . <p> Dwelling unit . A dwelling unit includes a house , apartment , condominium , mobile home , boat , vacation home , or similar property . It also includes all structures or other property belonging to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as sleeping space , a toilet , and cooking facilities . <p> A dwelling unit does not include property ( or part of the property ) used solely as a hotel , motel , inn , or similar establishment . Property is used solely as a hotel , motel , inn , or similar establishment if it is regularly available for occupancy by paying customers and is not used by an owner as a home during the year . <p> Dwelling Unit Used as Home <p> If you use a dwelling unit for both rental and personal purposes , the tax treatment of the rental expenses you figured earlier under Dividing Expenses and rental income depends on whether you are considered to be using the dwelling unit as a home . <p> You use a dwelling unit as a home during the tax year if you use it for personal purposes more than the greater of : <p> 14 days , or <p> 10% of the total days it is rented to others at a fair rental price . <p> If a dwelling unit is used for personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental price , do not count that day as a day of rental use in applying ( 2 ) above . Instead , count it as a day of personal use in applying both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above . <p> What is a day of personal use ? A day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that the unit is used by any of the following persons . <p> You or any other person who owns an interest in it , unless you rent it to another owner as his or her main home under a shared equity financing agreement ( defined later ) . However , see Days used as a main home before or after renting , later . <p> A member of your family or a member of the family of any other person who owns an interest in it , unless the family member uses the dwelling unit as his or her main home and pays a fair rental price . Family includes only your spouse , brothers and sisters , half-brothers and half-sisters , ancestors ( parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , grandchildren , etc . ) . <p> Anyone under an arrangement that let 's you use some other dwelling unit . <p> Anyone at less than a fair rental price . <p> Main home . If the other person or member of the family in ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) above has more than one home , his or her main home is ordinarily the one he or she lived in most of the time . <p> Days used for repairs and maintenance . Any day that you spend working substantially full time repairing and maintaining ( not improving ) your property is not counted as a day of personal use . Do not count such a day as a day of personal use even if family members use the property for recreational purposes on the same day . <p> Minimal rental use . If you use the dwelling unit as a home and you rent it less than 15 days during the year , that period is not treated as rental activity . See Used as a home but rented less than 15 days , later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renting a dwelling unit that is considered a home is not a passive activity . Instead , if your rental expenses are more than your rental income , some or all of the excess expenses can not be used to offset income from other sources . The excess expenses that can not be used to offset income from other sources are carried forward to the next year and treated as rental expenses for the same property . Any expenses carried forward to the next year will be subject to any limits that apply for that year . This limitation will apply to expenses carried forward to another year even if you do not use the property as your home for that subsequent year . <p> To figure your deductible rental expenses for this year and any carryover to next year , use Worksheet 5-1 . <p> Reporting Income and Deductions <p> Property not used for personal purposes . If you do not use a dwelling unit for personal purposes , see chapter 3 for how to report your rental income and expenses . <p> Property used personal purposes .

It is used much like a credit card . A line of credit is considered a short-term fix , and interest and fees can be high . Thus , they are best utilized in cases of temporary cash flow issues , not for capital improvements , expansion , or business acquisition . <p> Alternative financing. - Non-bank lending products include merchant cash advances that are repaid as a percentage of daily credit card receipts . These generally are short-term loans at very high interest rates , as much as 30 to 40 percent .

If you are still in the process of going through a divorce , then you are still considered married .

You can not deduct the costs of getting married or divorced . You can , however , deduct any legal fees you paid for tax advice related to divorce and any legal fees you paid to receive alimony . <p> Know the rules about alimony and child support .

You must include your former spouse 's Social Security number on your tax return in order to claim the deduction . <p> Save time and money now and next year . If your name has changed , remember the names on your tax return must match the names the Social Security Administration has on file . If the information does not match , the IRS will likely reject your return . <p> Just because your marriage status changes does n't mean you ca n't do your own taxes .

Burt had $7,000 in total qualified expenses . His parents claimed an American Opportunity Credit based on $4,000 of qualified expenses .

Both distributions need to be totaled before being compared to Burtha 's AQEE . <p> TaxAct automatically totals distributions entered in the return . If the student was the beneficiary of any distribution not entered in the return , TaxAct will prompt you to enter this amount after you have entered your 1099-Q information . <p> Since the calculation of taxable earnings is made separately for QTP and ESA distributions , the distributions for each type of program must be totaled separately .

The calculation is made separately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by total distributions . <p> The ratio determined in Step 1 is multiplied by total distributed earnings .

This is the amount that must be included in income . <p> On whose return is the income included ? <p> The recipient listed on the 1099-Q enters the form in his or her return and therefore should report any taxable income . The beneficiary is listed as the recipient of a QTP distribution when the distribution is made ( 1 ) directly to the beneficiary , or ( 2 ) to an eligible school for the benefit of the beneficiary .

Typically , you 're only responsible to pay tax on the gain . <p> A- gain- is the dollar amount you made on the sale . This is calculated by taking the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset . <p> For example , if you bought one ounce of gold years ago at $300 , and you sell it at $1,200 , you have a gain of $900 ( $1,200 " $300 = $900 ) . <h> What 's a tax basis ? <p> The amount you originally paid for an asset is generally your tax basis . <p> However , in some cases it 's more complicated . <p> If you take depreciation deductions for the asset , your tax basis is reduced by the deductions . A lower tax basis means a higher taxable gain when you sell . <p> On the flip side , if you make improvements to the asset , the amount you spend increases your tax basis . <p> For example , if you have a rental house and add a deck to it , the amount you spend on the deck increases your tax basis . <p> Your tax basis adjusted for depreciation deductions , improvements and any other adjustments is called your- adjusted basis . <p> This is the amount you use to determine if you have a capital gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital asset ? <p> Most personal items you own , such as a car , investments or real estate , are capital assets . <p> If you own a business , all business assets are not considered capital assets .

@@12200527 @800527/ <h> Pros and Cons of Refinancing Your Home <p> The decision to refinance your home can be a tough one . Not only can the process of refinancing seem like a lot of work , it 's often hard to know who to trust as some lender 's advertised offers sound too good to be true . But , if you find a- low mortgage rate , refinancing your home may be one deal that 's too good to pass up . <p> Here 's a few things to consider when determining if refinancing is a smart move for you . <h> Pro #1 : You may lower your current mortgage interest rate . <p> Typically , this is the main motivator behind refinancing . If you originally got your mortgage when interest rates were high , and you 've never refinanced , you may be paying more than you need to . Taking the time to apply for a new loan at a lower rate could save you hundreds of dollars a month . <p> For example , if you have a $200,000 loan and are paying 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly interest and principal payments are probably about $1,331 . If you refinanced at 3.8 percent , your monthly payment could be reduced to $932 . That 's a monthly savings of $399 ! <h> Pro #2 : You may be able to pay off other debts or get cash . <p> If your home is worth substantially more than the amount you owe , you may choose to take out a larger mortgage when you refinance . The cash you get back could be used to pay off car loans , credit cards or any other debt you may have . In some instances , this can be a good strategy if the debt you 're trying to pay off has high interest rates . <p> However , be careful not to overdo it or to habitually refinance your home every time the credit card balances get too high . It 's hard to pay off your house if you keep borrowing money from your equity . <h> Pro #3 : Refinance an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate loan . <p> An adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) often comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loan . But over the life of the loan , the interest rate " and your mortgage payment " can increase significantly . <p> When interest rates are low , refinancing your ARM for a fixed-rate mortgage may make sense " and it means your interest rates and payments are constant " even if interest rates skyrocket down the road . Knowing what your mortgage payment will be every month can help with budgeting and money management . <h> Con #1 : Refinancing can be expensive . <p> Before you get started , make sure you know how much it will cost to refinance . Generally , refinancing costs between 3 and 6 percent of the loan 's principal . Therefore , it 's important not to be tempted to spend too much money refinancing if you know you wo n't live in the home long enough to recoup the costs . <p> Ask yourself these questions before moving forward : how long do I plan to live in this house ? How much money will I save by refinancing ? The answers to these questions will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Refinancing is n't always easy . <p> Many people find it very time-consuming to refinance . Expect to spend hours , or even days , gathering information and paperwork for your loan application . <p> Additionally , if something has changed in your financial life , such as your career or the amount of debt you carry , you may not be able to get a loan at the rate you expected . <h> Con #3 : You may not be able to deduct your entire mortgage interest expense after refinancing . <p> If you refinance your home for the same amount you already owed on your mortgage , you can keep taking a mortgage interest deduction as always . The same applies if you take out a slightly larger loan to pay off some bills . As long as you itemize deductions on your tax return , you generally can deduct your total mortgage interest expense . <p> However , your deduction may be limited if you refinance and get a substantial amount of cash back .

If you are married or claim dependents on your return , you get additional exemptions and a bigger deduction from income . For 2013 , you are allowed to deduct $3,900 for each exemption claimed on your federal return . <p> There are two types of exemptions : personal exemptions and dependent exemptions . We 'll explain the two types of exemptions and also answer some questions you might have . <p> Personal Exemptions <p> You can generally claim one exemption for yourself . If you are married and file a joint return , you can also claim one exemption for your spouse . In certain situations , you may be allowed to claim your spouse 's exemption on a separate return . <p> Can I claim my spouse as a dependent ? <p> You can not claim your spouse as a dependent .

The rule applies even if the other person does not actually claim you . <p> Dependent Exemptions <p> You can claim one exemption for each person claimed as a dependent on your return but several tests must be met in order to claim someone as a dependent . If you are not sure whether you can claim someone as a dependent , use the interactive Dependent Quiz in TaxAct 's Federal Q&amp;A to guide you through the IRS rules . <p> Does my dependent have to file a return ? <p> A separate return must be filed for a dependent if filing requirements are met .

Several other factors must also be taken into account , such as age , filing status and any special taxes that may apply . <p> Can I enter my dependent 's income on my return ? <p> You generally can not include your dependent 's income on your return . An exception to this rule allows you to include the dependent 's investment income on your return in certain situations . Investment income for this exception includes interest , dividends and capital gain distributions . <p> Claiming Exemptions on Your Return <p> With TaxAct , your exemptions are calculated automatically as you complete your return .

According to a recent ORC International Survey conducted for TaxAct , 45 percent of American taxpayers plan to invest their tax refund in a general savings or retirement/investment account . Similarly , about half of millennials plan to do the same . The survey also revealed that a quarter of working American taxpayers will adjust their withholdings based on this year 's refund . <p> " It 's great that Americans are applying their refund to savings , but by not taking a close look at their withholdings throughout the year , many of them are giving the government an interest-free loan , " said Sanjay Baskaran , president of TaxAct .

" These scams can end up costing taxpayers more in penalties , back taxes and interest than they saved in the first place . " <p> The IRS continues to address those using abusive shelters through audits , litigation , published guidance and legislation . <p> Tax law generally allows businesses to create " captive " insurance companies to protect against certain risks .

For example , coverages may insure implausible risks , fail to match genuine business needs or duplicate the taxpayer 's commercial coverages . Premium amounts may be unsupported by underwriting or actuarial analysis , may be geared to a desired deduction amount or may be significantly higher than premiums for comparable commercial coverage . <p> Policies may contain vague , ambiguous or deceptive terms and otherwise fail to meet industry or regulatory standards .

@@12200688 @800688/ <h> How a Summer Job Affects Your Taxes <p> A summer job is a great way to add some extra money- to your bank account . Whether you 're a cash-strapped college student , a teacher trying to stay- busy during the summer months or simply have some extra time on your hands , racking up those part time hours can really pay-off . <p> However , before you go out and celebrate with all the money you 've made , its important to understand your obligations to Uncle Sam . If your only income for the year is from part-time , summer work , there 's a good chance you may not- owe too much in taxes . But , if you earned income throughout the rest of the year , you 'll want to make sure you 're prepared come tax filing season . <p> To help you get prepared , there are- three types of tax you 'll want to pay most attention to : <p> Social Security and Medicare tax ( often called FICA ) <p> Federal Income tax <p> State Income tax <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Social Security and Medicare tax <p> Your employer will automatically deduct Social Security and Medicare taxes from each of your- paychecks . The Federal Insurance Contributions Act , or better known as FICA , is a federal law that requires employers to withhold these two taxes from your wages each pay period . <p> But , on a good note , your employer also kicks in half for your Social Security and Medicare tax payments . <p> If you are self-employed , meaning you work as an independent contractor or for- your own business , you will need to set aside money to pay your taxes. - That money should include Social Security and Medicare tax , which is lumped together and called " self-employment tax . " - Self-employment tax- for 2016 is 15.3%- on the first $118,500 of net income and then 2.9% on the net income that is in excess of $118,500 . <p> Be sure to keep track of all your expenses because- you can deduct them from income before paying Self-Employment tax . <p> While the average- taxpayer is subject to Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule . For example , if you 're under age 18 and perform household work , such as babysitting or yard work , you do n't  have to pay Self-Employment tax . The same goes for newspaper carriers , distributors and vendors . <p> And , if Mom and Dad hire you to work in- their business , there 's a good chance you may not have to pay Social Security and Medicare tax , either . However , to meet this exception , you must be under age 18 , and your parents ' business must be a sole proprietorship or partnership , not a corporation . <h> Federal Income tax <p> Another important tax to be aware of is the Federal Income tax . This tax is levied by the IRS and based on your taxable annual- income . However , in some cases , this tax does not apply to everyone . <p> If you 're a single student being claimed as a dependent on your parents tax return , you can generally earn up to $6,300 ( in 2016 ) before you owe federal income tax . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next $9,275 you earn . After you pass the $15,475- mark ( $6,300 + $9,075 ) , the rates are higher . <h> State Income tax <p> Unless you live in one of the seven states that do n't  have income tax , you 'll have to pay- state income tax- too . <p> State income tax varies in respect to tax rates , how they- are applied , the types of income that is taxable and what- deductions and credits are allowed . However , it is usually less than Federal Income tax . <p> If you are only working during the summer , you may qualify for a tax exemption , meaning- your employer will not withhold income tax- from your paycheck . This only applies if you made less than $6,300 . And , keep in mind , - an exemption- does not extend to- Social Security and Medicare taxes . <p> In order to qualify for a tax exemption , you must meet specific criteria . To claim exempt , you must have received a refund of all income tax withheld from your paycheck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the current year . If you meet both of those criteria , you can- mark " EXEMPT " on line 7 of Form W-4 . Typically your employer will ask you to complete Form W-4 when you start working . This form is used to notify your employer how much tax they should withhold from your pay . <p> If there 's any chance you may earn more than $6,300 during the year , you will- then owe income tax . In that case , its better to have income tax withheld from each paycheck . It 's a lot easier to have money withheld now than to come up with it next year when filing your tax return . <h> Do I- need to file an income tax return ? <p> If you do n't  make more than $6,300 as an employee , you generally do n't  have to file a tax return . However , if you had income tax withheld from your paychecks , you 'll want to- file- return- in order to get that money back . <p> If you run your own business and make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tax return and- pay self-employment tax , unless you qualify for one of the exceptions . @qwx180326 @qwx180320 @qwx180325 <p> Yes , there is no age limit as long as they have earned income .

@@12200707 @800707/ <p> WASHINGTON The Internal Revenue Service and partners from the states and tax industry today reminded taxpayers that the nation 's 2017 individual income tax filing season opens Jan. 23 . <p> The IRS expects more than 153 million tax returns to be filed this year and taxpayers have until Tuesday , April 18 , 2017 , to file their 2016 tax returns and pay any tax due . The deadline is extended because the Emancipation Day , a holiday in Washington , D.C. , will be observed on Monday , April 17 , pushing the nation 's filing deadline to April 18 . <p> " There are a number of important changes this year involving refunds and tax law changes that we encourage people to keep in mind , " said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen . " We encourage taxpayers to plan ahead and take a few minutes to review these changes . As we enter the filing season , taxpayers should know that the dedicated workforce of the IRS and the nation 's tax community stand ready to help . " <p> Taxpayers that are e-filing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will hold the return and transmit it to the IRS when the systems open . The IRS also reminds taxpayers that they do n't have to wait until Jan. 23 to contact their tax professional . <p> In 2016 , the IRS issued 111 million individual tax refunds and expects more than 70 percent of taxpayers to receive a refund in 2017 . Also , the IRS reminds taxpayers that a new law requires the IRS to hold refunds claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) and the Additional Child Tax Credit ( ACTC ) until Feb. 15 . " We encourage taxpayers to file as they normally would , including returns claiming the EITC or ACTC " Koskinen said . " The IRS and the nation 's tax community are committed to making this another smooth filing season . " <p> e-File and Free File <p> More than four out of five returns are expected to be filed electronically , with a similar proportion of refunds issued through direct deposit . The IRS encourages taxpayers to plan ahead and take advantage of the online resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refunds remains the fastest and safest way to file an accurate income tax return and receive a refund . The IRS anticipates issuing more than nine out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days from the time returns are received . <p> The IRS Free File program , available at IRS.gov , opens Friday , Jan. 13 . Commercial partners of the IRS offer free brand-name software to about 100 million individuals and families with incomes of $64,000 or less . Seventy percent of the nation 's taxpayers are eligible for IRS Free File . <p> All taxpayers regardless of income will again have access to free online fillable forms , which provide electronic versions of IRS paper forms to complete and file . This option is available through IRS.gov and is free . <p> Protecting Taxpayers from ID-Theft-Related Refund Fraud <p> The IRS continues to work with state tax authorities and the tax industry to address tax-related identity theft and refund fraud . As part of the Security Summit , the IRS made significant inroads against fraudulent returns in 2016 . While working to stop the issuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate refunds as quickly as possible in 2017 . Thus far , Summit efforts have led to a 50 percent decline in the number of new reports of stolen identities on federal tax returns . Late last year , Summit leaders detailed new and expanded safeguards for taxpayers in the upcoming 2017 tax season . The 2017 focus revolves around " trusted customer " features that will help ensure the authenticity of the taxpayer and the tax return - before , during and after a tax return is filed . The additional protections will build on the 2016 successes that prevented fraudulent returns and protected tax refunds . <p> Health Care Basics <p> Again this year , meeting the tax obligation of the Affordable Care Act for the vast majority of taxpayers will simply mean checking a box to verify everyone on their return has health coverage . For others , IRS.gov/aca features useful information , tips and interactive online tools to help taxpayers with the premium tax credit , the individual shared responsibility requirement and other tax-related provisions of the ACA . <p> More than 90 percent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This software generally includes tax law help along with reminders and prompts about tax breaks and responsibilities . <p> The IRS urges all taxpayers to make sure they have all their year-end statements in hand before they file their return . This includes Forms W-2 from employers , Forms 1099 from banks and other payers , and for those claiming the premium tax credit , Form 1095-A from the Marketplace . Doing so will help avoid refund delays and the need to file an amended return later . <p> Delayed Refunds <p> The IRS expects to issue more than nine out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days . However , the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes ( PATH ) Act mandates the IRS hold refunds on tax returns claiming the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit ( ACTC ) until mid-February . The change helps ensure that taxpayers get the refund they are owed by giving the IRS more time to help detect and prevent tax fraud . <p> The IRS will begin releasing EITC and ACTC refunds starting Feb. 15 , but cautions taxpayers that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on debit cards until the week of Feb. 27 . The IRS wants taxpayers to know it will take additional time for their refunds to be processed and for financial institutions to accept and deposit the refunds to bank accounts . The IRS reminds taxpayers many financial institutions do not process payments on weekends or holidays , which can affect when refunds reach taxpayers . For EITC and ACTC filers , the three-day holiday weekend involving President 's Day may affect their refund timing . <p> Where 's My Refund ? on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go phone app will be updated with projected deposit dates for early EITC and ACTC refund filers a few days after Feb. 15 . Taxpayers will not see a refund date on Where 's My Refund ? or through their software packages until then . The IRS , tax preparers and tax software will not have additional information on refund dates , so Where 's My Refund ? remains the best way to check the status of a refund . <p> Expired Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers ( ITIN ) <p> The PATH Act requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITIN not used on a tax return at least once in the past three years and any ITIN with middle digits of either 78 or 79 ( 9NN-78-NNNN or 9NN-79-NNNN ) must be renewed before a return can be processed . Anyone filing a tax return with an expired ITIN could experience return processing and refund delay as well as denial of some tax benefits until the ITIN is renewed . <p> An ITIN renewal application could take as long as 11 weeks to process during tax filing season . ITINs are used by people who have tax-filing or payment obligations under U.S. law but are not eligible for a Social Security number . <p> Help for Taxpayers <p> The IRS reminds taxpayers they have a variety of options to get help filing and preparing their tax return on IRS.gov . Volunteer Income Tax Assistance ( VITA ) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly ( TCE ) offer free tax help to people who qualify .

If you work in your home , you may be able to take an employee expenses deduction or a business deduction for a home office . <p> You can only take a deduction for a home office if you use an area in your home regularly and exclusively for business . It must be your principal place of business or a place you meet with clients , or it can be used in connection with your business if it is a separate structure not attached to your personal residence , such as a shop . <p> With the simplified option launched in 2013 , you can deduct $5 per square foot ( up to 300 square feet and with a $1,500 limit ) . This option greatly reduces time spent on paperwork and tracking expenses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home office must also be for your employer 's convenience - not yours . <p> If you can deduct expenses for a home office , you can deduct a proportionate amount of all indirect expenses for your home , including mortgage interest , real estate taxes , rent , utilities , and so on . <p> If you are using the simplified method of reporting the deduction , you list these deductions on Schedule A , but you do not need to allocate them to business or personal use . Unlike the regular reporting method , the simplified option does not allow you to depreciate the portion of your home used to conduct your business . <h> Employee Expenses <p> If you are an employee , you may also be able to deduct unreimbursed travel and transportation costs , supplies , uniforms , and other expenses . Employee expenses must be significant before they actually lower your tax bill . You can only deduct your employee expenses to the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income , and only if you itemize your deductions . <h> Self-Employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ordinary and necessary expenses for your trade or business . Some expenses , such as the cost of inventory or business equipment , may not be deductible in full in the year you pay them .

TaxAct also calculates depreciation or first-year expensing for business assets you acquire . <p> If you pay people in the course of your business , it 's important to correctly determine if they are independent contractors , or if they are really employees . <p> The IRS uses common law rules to determine if a worker is an employee or an independent contractor . Revenue Ruling 87-41 contains 20 of these rules you should take into consideration . <p> According to these rules , a person is likely to be an independent contractor if he or she requires little training , and has latitude over how the job is completed . An independent contractor is less likely to have a temporary relationship , to provide tools and supplies , and to work for more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee if he or she is an integral part of the business and works only for one company . If an employee has travel or other expenses , the employer is more likely to reimburse them . Employees generally have set work hours and work on the employer 's premises . <p> It 's easier to write a check to independent contractors , rather than dealing with the paperwork that comes with hiring employees . However , it 's important to classify employees or contractors correctly , to avoid reclassification by the IRS . If the IRS reclassifies a worker at some later date , you will be liable for back payroll taxes , plus penalties and interest . <h> Travel Expenses <p> If you travel for your business or as an employee , you can generally take a deduction for your travel expenses . Your trip must be for longer than a day - even a long day . Your duties must require you to be away from home long enough for you to need rest , generally meaning overnight . <p> Besides airplane or bus tickets , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you took to the airport or from the airport to your hotel . You can also deduct any costs for getting your business materials , e.g. , exhibit booth or conference materials , to your destination , and your actual car or truck expenses or the standard mileage rate , in most cases . <p> You can also deduct the cost of meals and lodging while you travel , although you generally can only deduct 50% of the cost of your meals . <p> Miscellaneous expenses while traveling add up .

Yes , it saves you money , but only if you spend your money on things that you were going to buy anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example that your favorite shampoo is on sale for 60% off , pick 5 or so and you 're set for a few months to a year ( depending on how much hair you have ) , and you just saved yourself money , but say you see a type of juice for sale for 70% off , but you do n't  drink juice . Well , in that case you just wasted money . <p> Just because something is on sale does n't  mean that it 's a smart investment . <p> Less time in the stores . OK , so this is not as clear so I 'll explain . Initially you spend a ton of time starting your stockpile , but once you have all the basics , you do n't  need to make last minute trips thus cutting down on your shopping time . <p> You are prepared for emergencies .

If you 're single , you can make things last a lot longer than if you have a family . <p> I see people get carried away all the time . They buy way more than they will ever use and eventually get sick of making the same thing . <p> Stockpilling food is an art and a science , and finding the balance is key . <h> How to get started ? <p> Figure out how long you need your stockpile to last .

This is very important . I recommend $5-$20 per week for stockpiling ( more , if you can afford it ) . Do n't  go over this budgeted amount . If you do , your savings will go up in smoke . <p> If you do n't  use all of your " stockpile allowance " in one week , carry it over to the next week .

But when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the ACA 's constitutionality last year , it gave states the right to opt out of Medicaid expansion . That means eight million people who could have been covered could be left stranded without coverage . <p> Medicaid is n't the only avenue available to low-income Americans seeking to get covered through the ACA . Some low-income households will be able to buy subsidized commercial insurance policies through the new health insurance marketplaces . <h> Here 's a look at how the ACA will affect low income Americans . <h> Subsidized Coverage Offered in Marketplaces <p> For many Americans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be reduced by federal subsidies . <p> Eligibility and amounts are based on the cost of marketplace premiums and your household size and income . In 2014 , the subsidies are available for individuals with annual income between $11,490 and $45,960 ; for a family of four , they cover households with incomes ranging $23,550 to $94,200 . <p> The definition of income used here is modified adjusted gross income ( MAGI ) , which includes wages , salary , foreign income , interest , dividends and Social Security benefits . <p> One type of subsidy , the advanced premium tax credits , will be applied upfront as an adjustment to premium costs and paid directly to the insurance company . If you elect to receive a lesser credit or no credit at all , you can claim the refundable credit on your 2014 tax return ( due April 2015 ) . <p> Plans with the higher premiums will have lower out-of-pocket costs . Bronze plans , on average , will cover 60 percent of enrollee costs , with the rest covered by deductibles and coinsurance . Gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectively . <p> If you do n't think you 'll be in a position to cover high out-of-pocket costs in the event of a health emergency , your goal should be to get the most coverage that you can afford . <p> The HealthcareACT.com subsidy calculator can give you an idea of your premium tax credit eligibility . And the Financial Samurai blog offers a series of helpful charts showing insurance premium costs for various household sizes and incomes for Silver plans . <p> For example , a family of four with income of $50,000 receiving the premium tax credit would pay an annual premium of $3,365 ; an individual making $25,000 with the credit would pay $1,729 annually . <p> Some low-income people will qualify for additional cost-sharing subsidies . The ACA reduces deductibles , copayments , coinsurance and total out-of-pocket spending for people with income below 250 percent of the federal poverty level ( FPL ) . <p> The reductions will help people who expect a high amount of spending to bump up to a higher-priced metal tier . Click here for details on this extra help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACA , Medicaid served only children , parents , pregnant women , people with disabilities and seniors ; starting in 2014 , it 's available to any adult with income below the law 's threshold . <p> The law also creates a national definition for the income qualifications for Medicaid in states that accept the ACA expansion of the program ; prior to the law 's passage , definitions were set by states , and they could vary quite a bit . <p> Twenty-six states are moving ahead with Medicaid expansion next year . To find out what 's going on in your state , check this status report , which is updated regularly by the Kaiser Family Foundation . <p> In states that accepted the expansion , Medicaid will cover adults with income up to 133 percent of the FPL . The 2014 definitions wo n't be announced until early next year , but this year that translated into $15,282 for an individual . <p> In states that are n't expanding Medicaid , many low-income uninsured adults will be uncovered . <p> However , low-income adults with incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for subsidies to help purchase private policies through the health insurance marketplaces . <p> But people with incomes below that level are n't eligible for the subsidies . That creates a perverse outcome : in some states , people will be denied access to health insurance because their income is too low . <h> Enrollment Help <p> Does all this sound complicated ? <p> That 's because it is and the problems have been amplified by the technical trouble surrounding the launch of the federal health insurance marketplace Healthcare.gov . <p> In-person assistance will be available from health centers around the country that have been awarded grants by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to hire and train " navigators .

For stocks and other securities , look for your brokerage statement . <p> If you purchased stocks on or after January 1 , 2011 , your brokerage keeps track of the stock basis for you . For mutual funds and similar investments , they keep track of your purchases on or after January 1 , 2012 . <p> If you purchased securities before these dates , look for your brokerage statements for the year you purchased the stock . You may also be able to find information online , or you can call your broker . <h> Does cost basis include sales tax and shipping ? <p> Sales tax and shipping are considered to be part of the cost of an item . <h> What if I inherited an asset ? <p> When you inherit something , whether its a car , real estate , or a mutual fund , your basis is generally the value of the property on the date of the persons death . If its gone up in value since that date and you sell it , you may have a gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use an alternate date , your cost basis is the fair market value on that alternate date . Ask the personal representative if you 're not sure . <p> Special rules may apply to inherited farmland or a closely held business , or if the person died in 2010 . <h> I had a trade-in when I bought this car . What 's my basis ? <p> If you trade in a car or truck , your basis in the new vehicle is your basis in the old one , plus the amount you paid with the trade in . <p> For example , let 's say you have a car with a basis of $2,000 . You trade it in for a new car , and you pay $20,000 cash . The basis in your new car is $22,000 ( $2,000 + 20,000 = $22,000 ) . <h> I sold mutual fund shares last year . Do I need to adjust my basis ? <p> When you own mutual funds , you may pay tax on reinvested dividends and capital gains while you hold the funds . You do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sell the mutual fund shares . <p> Be sure you increase your mutual fund shares basis by the amount of any dividends and gains on which youve paid tax . <h> What are some other reasons I may need to adjust my cost basis ? <p> If the stock splits , and you sell less than 100% of your shares of a stock , you 'll need to adjust your cost basis for the split so you can correctly calculate your cost basis . The same is true if the stock has a reverse split . <p> To adjust your cost basis for depreciation , look at your tax returns , starting with the year you purchased an asset . Add together all the depreciation taken for the asset , and reduce your basis by that amount . <h> I only sold some of my stock in a company , which I bought at different times and at different prices .

This may not be the best tax result for you . <p> If you 'd rather sell other stocks from a particular company , you must tell your broker ahead of time . You must also get a confirmation from your broker saying which stocks you sold . <p> Do you keep receipts for major purchases in a folder or other designated place ? @qwx180326 @qwx180325
