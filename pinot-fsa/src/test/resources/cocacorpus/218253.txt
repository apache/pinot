The billing codes are for claims with date of admission on or after August 1 , 2003 . Check out the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) 2017 rates effective October 1 , 2016 . <p> SNF/PPS Billing Tips <p> The bill types that are valid for a Skilled Nursing Facility ( SNF ) provider are 211 , 212 , 213 , and 214 . Bill type 211 is for a complete bill and the patient status in block 17 of the UB-04 indicates the patient has been discharged . Bill type 212 is for the initial claim only and the patient status in block 17 of the UB-04 must indicate the patient has not been discharged . Bill type 213 is an interim bill and the patient status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been discharged . Bill type 214 is the final bill and the patient status in block 17 of the UB-04 must indicate the patient has been discharged . <p> SNF/PPS assessment indicators in block 44 and assessment dates in block 45 are calculated by the admit date noted in block block 12 UB-04 claim form and is always the first day of the inpatient stay . Please note that if the patient is discharged from the facility and readmitted later than the assessment dates and indicators will start over with an initial assessment . For example : 01,11 , and 05 . The next assessment would then be the 14-day assessment and so on until discharge . <p> All SNF/PPS claims must have a value of " 70 " in block block 35/36 of the UB-04 claim form with an occurrence span date , unless there is no qualifying stay .

A copy of the OHI 's payment determination and a copy of the itemized bill must be sent with your TRICARE claim .

You can make sure this data is current by contacting your nearest military personnel office or DEERS ( address corrections ONLY ) at 1-800-538-9552 . <p> 8 . Accident claims include DD Form 2527 . Were you hurt in an accident where someone else may be leg ally responsible ? If so , they or their insurance may have to pay s ome or all of t he medical bills .

You 'll have to complete and atta ch a DD Form 2527 to all claims submitted before your claim can be processed . <p> 9 . Keep copies of everything you send to claims processors .
