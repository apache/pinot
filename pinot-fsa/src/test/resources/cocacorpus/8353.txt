They are some of the most dramatic tools that the universe uses to get us to pay attention to areas in our life that need to change . They uproot us , surprise us , and get us moving . They shake us out of our feelings of compliancy so that we can move from one level of maturity to another , to a higher plane , and they work very rapidly . Eclipses want us to change , and change we do ! <p> Each year , you might want to pay special attention to the number and sign of the eclipses that are due to arrive and in what houses and degree they fall . Usually we have four eclipses in one year . In 2011 we had six , and there was one additional eclipse just ten days prior to the start of that year , so in effect , we had seven eclipses within a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they demand so many adjustments in a very tiny time period . <p> As you scroll down you will see specific points that you can keep in mind when dealing with eclipses . I have developed this list by watching them closely each year and keeping notes of what happened to people I know . I love social media , especially Twitter , because we can all share our experiences , and my research can widen . Social media is public , so we can all learn from one another . If you would like to share your experiences , you are welcome to come by and add your comments . I am on Twitter almost every day . <h> First , Some Basic Information <p> ( If you feel you know the basics , skip down to the next section . Here I will speak about families of eclipses . ) <p> Eclipses always arrive in pairs , coinciding with new moon and full moons , as solar and lunar eclipses , respectively . They appear in a family of signs that are joined on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of signs that are found exactly opposite each other ( six months apart ) on the horoscope wheel . <p> For example , back in 2015 we had eclipses in the Pisces-Virgo family of signs . They included a solar new moon eclipse on March 20 , 2015 in Pisces at 29 degrees , and later , a solar eclipse September 12 in Virgo at 20 degrees arrived . Two eclipses in the Aries-Libra family dotted the year too , with a lunar eclipse in Libra on April 4 , at 14 degrees , and lunar eclipse full moon September 27 Aries 5 degrees . As you see we have two families of eclipses going on during the same year , and sometimes that happens . <p> In 2016 the same thing happened . Three eclipses in the Pisces-Virgo family of signs , including solar eclipses on March 8 in Pisces at 19 degrees , a solar new moon eclipse on September 1 at Virgo 9 degrees , and a lunar eclipse September 16 in Pisces . Earlier in the year we have lunar full moon eclipse in Libra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one will finally concludes two years of Libra-Aries family of eclipses . <p> By March 23 , 2016 , the total number of eclipses that occurred in the Libra-Aries family will be six . The Pisces-Virgo family will finish in February 26 , 2017 with a total number of six eclipses as well , and in either case , that is enough to cause a transformation . <p> If you have planets that correspond to the mathematical degree of the eclipse in you natal chart , you will note the news of the eclipse in a dramatic way . You will see an eclipse works retrograde , starting with a high mathematical degree and working backward to early degrees . Most people do not feel every eclipse in a family of signs , only the ones touching planets , the Sun , moon , or ascendant in the natal chart .

This is what we typically think of when we use the word " eclipse , " with the moon covering the Sun . <p> A lunar eclipse occurs when the earth stands between the moon and the Sun , cutting off the light of the Sun from the moon . The moon has no light of her own , as she simply reflects the light of the Sun . Here the moon basically disappears . A lunar eclipse is always a full moon and usually marks endings or culmination points . <p> Any eclipse is a significant event in the heavens . In truth , a solar eclipse is really a new moon on steroids and a lunar eclipse is a full moon on steroids they have the strength of three new moons or full moons . <p> I have a lot of tips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed below . I start with the most interesting points to consider , but keep reading I would like you to know them all . <p> Let 's review the points to keep in mind about eclipses so that you can cope with any unexpected changes they may bring . <h> UNDERSTANDING AND COPING WITH ECLIPSES <h> 1 . Eclipses bring news of lifes big events . <p> An eclipse can bring news of a birth of a baby , an engagement or marriage , a promotion or career breakthrough , important travel , the signing of a vital business contract , or the start of ones own business . An eclipse can bring the sale or purchase of a house , a move to a new home across the country , the acquisition ( or loss ) of a family pet , surgery , or an important health development . It might bring a college graduation , or the eclipse may mark the start of your course of study . Eclipses sometimes bring on a divorce , a newly published book you get the idea . Monumental events , meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place at an eclipse they are dates we usually long remember . <p> No matter what occurs , it will become evident that the universe is intent on moving you forward . Eclipses often mark a major turning point . <p> If nothing happens to you , it may be happening to friends and family around you , depending on the precise degrees of the planets in your chart . ( More about that much later. ) <h> 2 . With all eclipses , something ends and something else begins . <p> During an eclipse period , it is as though you will walk over a rickety old bridge . As you walk across this bridge , over a very deep , rugged , treacherous ravine , you may be a little nervous . Once you make it to the other side , the bridge will collapse and you will see the pieces fall far into the deep , perhaps making you jittery . The bridge snaps just as you get to safe ground , but you realize , first , that you could have been on that bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more importantly , you will never again be able to walk back over to the other side . Once we go through an eclipse , we can never go back to the former situation again , for the universe wants us to make progress , not go back to good old days . That option is taken away , forever . The only way with an eclipse is forward . If you find later you do n't  like where you wind up , you can always have the option to make changes up ahead , but again , they must be future choices , not ones that bring you back to the past . <p> The changes could happen instantly , but they also can occur over a period of months with each successive eclipse . Still , the news of those changes often comes as a shock . <p> Solar eclipses tend to create new beginnings and bright new opportunities . Usually , they are exciting , are often very positive , and bring news out of the blue . We always need to see the kind of conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets to judge if the eclipse is completely friendly or not . Your own natal chart will matter too I can not see your natal chart from where I sit , so after you pass the eclipse , write a note on your calendar about what happened . <p> Lunar eclipses are more emotional , for they bring on final endings . They often make us aware of the passage of time , and make us sentimental . A full moon lunar eclipse is almost always an emotional time . Memories and dreams come up to the surface , and sometimes we feel sentimental . <h> 3 . Each eclipse in a series is united in theme and is strung together like pearls on a necklace . <p> Each eclipse in one family of signs will advance the discussion that the eclipse first brings up to a higher , more sophisticated level , and keep doing so , as each eclipse of that family arises until the matter is resolved . By then , you have evolved too . It is as if the universe knows that we cant possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do at once , so each eclipse will bring another development , related in theme to the ones that came before , until the matter is finished over an 18 or 24 month period . As said , however , only eclipses that are mathematically significant to your natal chart will affect you not the ones that are too far away from touching planets in your chart . Those may have only a very mild effect , or none at all . This is why you need to have your horoscope chart . <p> I will always tell you the degrees and precise birthdays of the signs that will be affected by the eclipses . There are other ways you might be affected , and I will cover those instances later in this chapter . <h> 4 . Eclipses will bring a random event you do not expect , did n't  know about . It will be triggered by an event happening elsewhere , and that is completely outside your control , but at eclipse time bring vast changes will come straight to your doorstep . <p> I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you an example . Let 's say you are an agent for a top recording artist . You have been good to your client , working hard for him for years . When you took him on , no one else would even meet with him , but you saw talent in this person , and although he was completely unknown at the time , you built him into a superstar . His talent plus your hard work put him on top of the industry charts . <p> Another agent has now come in to poach your artist and has offered him an attractive contract , one you could never match . Your competitor feels that by getting this artist , he will be able to get more name artists . This artist is your main source of income , and you have always been loyal to one another . You felt you both were happy . <p> On the day of the eclipse , you receive an email in error . It is an email that you were not supposed to be copied on , but on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your artist has been having with the other agent . Until the eclipse , you had no idea these talks have been going on behind your back . You will have to talk with your talent quickly to try to dissuade him from leaving he is ready to sign the other agents offer . <p> Honestly , because this is an eclipse , your efforts might be futile , as once an eclipse comes by , the results tend to be final . Of course , you should make an attempt but make sure you make a dramatic move . In this instance , you will have to fight fire with fire ! <p> As you see , outside events or actions of others that you did not know anything about and that were outside of your control can create forces of change on a massive scale in your own life . As a result , you may reassess your assumptions , your business strategy , and the way you conduct business . Maybe you will feel that you had too many eggs in one basket by allowing this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . Maybe you will feel you were too trusting or did not remain competitive enough . You probably will have to draw up a quick plan to attract other talent to your stable eclipses often form a time of complete evaluation , for they have the power to change everything related to the area of your life that eclipse is emphasizing . <p> Sometimes its hard to believe that things that are happening in the outside world over which you have no knowledge or control would have the power to trigger conditions of such massive change at eclipse time , but that is precisely what can happen . It can be a big or small event that changes everything . In the latter case , it could be something as small as finding a torn ticket stub in your mates pocket while doing laundry that eventually reveals a secret affair . Indeed , often at eclipse time an important piece of information is given to you accidentally . Still , no matter how the information comes to you , it can set off a chain of events that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 5 . Eclipses speed your sense of time and change the timetables . <p> Eclipses bring events that you assumed were months or years away right up to your front door now . Let 's say that you planned to marry in two years , after you and your fiance saved up enough money for a down payment on a house . Now let 's say either you or your partner suddenly gets a big promotion that will require one of you to move to London , You would have to accept the offer immediately to take advantage of that new position . Suddenly your marriage plans will change in an instant and you and your fiance may quickly marry in your own country so that you can move to England to begin your new life together . Timetables change in a blink of an eye . <p> There is always a feeling of life moving very rapidly it is life on fast-forward , or great acceleration . Sometimes an event will make us sentimental at eclipse time , as we are very cognizant of the passage of time . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glaring ray of truth to the part of your life that is being touched , and truth will likely arrive in a startling way . <p> Eclipses are brilliant illuminators , revealing a truth about a condition that you never in a million years knew existed . Once you are given the information , the news can act as a catalyst to a major decision or action you will take . Most often we are shocked or surprised by the information that comes to us , for the eclipse is one of the most dramatic tools the universe uses to get you to sit up , pay attention , and take action . Eclipses are always your friends , for they are there to help to protect you . Always be grateful for truth . <p> Here is another way to think about the way eclipse work : Imagine that a puzzle piece fell out of the sky into your hands . This new piece offers information , and when added to the overall picture of your puzzle will change the complexion of the situation and bring you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , I understand ! " Now you have a full picture of the situation and can make a fuller , more realistic appraisal of what it means to you . You will also know what you must do next . This is the experience of an eclipse ! <h> 7 . An eclipse , especially a full moon lunar eclipse , will help you to see the true character of someone close brace yourself , you may not like what you see . <p> It is hard to see someones true colors , but if you are being shown this , be grateful . You might have been operating in the dark for much too long , putting yourself in jeopardy . Once you know , you can make appropriate plans . <h> 8 . Take any message you hear from an eclipse as non-negotiable and firm , so accept it , and then move on . <p> Realize that there is little or no chance of getting things reversed . Eclipses demand that we forward , not backward to the way things used to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you break up , do n't  plead for the other person to come back . <p> If you are truly heartbroken , the soonest you might be able to try again to get a reconciliation would be in precisely four months from the date of the eclipse ( forming a " trine " aspect to the eclipse ) . That would be your only option , but be aware that finding a permanent remedy to mend the problem is not likely . The eclipse wants you to have new experiences , so keep your eyes open for what is to come next . <h> 9 . Take notice of all news and signals you get near an eclipse , and take them seriously , even if news comes as subjective and ambiguous as gossip . <p> While sometimes news at eclipse time will be delivered in a dramatic and obvious way , at other times , the news will come in much more subtly , as a secret or as a piece of gossip . Nevertheless it will foretell dramatic changes to come . The fact that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and investigate do not ignore it , or by the time the next eclipse comes by in five and a half months from the date you hear this piece of information , the situation , may have grown bigger . Sometimes you are able to head off difficulties by paying attention to the signals you pick up at eclipse time . <h> 10 . Its vital you guard your health if an eclipse falls within five days of your birthday , or if the eclipse falls almost exactly opposite your birthday . <p> If your birthday , for instance , falls on February 1 , and the eclipse falls six months from your birthday , August 1 , it is still significant , as it will be 180 degrees away , and aimed directly at you , so to speak . <p> Also , note if the eclipse falls on or close to your rising sign degree or any planets in the first house , as that one will be felt strongly in terms of health , too . Eclipses will sometimes point out underlying weaknesses in health that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great again . <h> 11 . Eclipses almost always bring up all kinds of unexpected changes of direction , assuming your Sun , moon , or a planet is touched . <h> 12 . Occasionally , an important person to you will be " eclipsed out " of your life . <p> A solar eclipse generally points to a prominent male in your life , so often a man may leave . If you are to be affected , you may break up a relationship with a man , or see that your boss has quit and is leaving , as another example . Astrologers generally use the following pecking order when trying to determine which man it may be : father , husband , grandfather , prominent boss or business associate/client , or male friend . <p> Lunar eclipses are generally female . A female friend may say she 's moving away or getting married , and you may not see her as often in the future . Your relationship may likely change quite a bit . Or , you may have a falling out , you may never see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The usual order we use for a lunar eclipse is : mother , wife , grandmother , prominent female boss , client or business associate , or female friend . <p> This is generally the case most of the time , but occasionally these genders will swap out , and I am not sure why ! <h> 13 . Events brought on by an eclipse always have much more weight than events brought on by a normal new or full moon . <p> Even though eclipses coincide with new and full moons , they are much stronger than a regular new or full moon . You can think of eclipses as a new or full moon on steroids . They pack so much more energy and punch than a normal lunation of the Sun or moon . In fact , they feel like they are three new or full moons rolled into one . An eclipse may even bring on an event that seems " fated " in some way . <h> 14 . Try not to issue ultimatums or make big actions under an eclipse . <p> Bide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a time when less static will fill the air . Its best to respond to others messages , but not to initiate your own . Said another way , it is better to listen and respond than to issue announcements and ultimatums . Hold off on beginning new ventures at eclipse time . If you need to sign a contract , try to add several days beyond the date of the eclipse to sign when your judgment will become stronger and sharper . <p> Let 's say you get a great new apartment , and the only day you can move in is the first of the month , the same day of a total eclipse of the moon ( full moon ) . You did n't  choose that day to move your landlord did , or events just worked out that way . In this case , you are responding , so it is fine to act . <p> Now let 's say instead of that example , we have another instance . Let 's say you want to have a major talk with your sweetheart because you are unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well after the eclipse , not on the eclipse when you wont have such a highly charged atmosphere . <p> Having said that , eclipses tend to get truth to the surface very fast , like a geyser of water forcefully rising to the surface . You may not keep things inside , even though you planned to do so ! <p> The first example shows an action someone else is asking you to respond to ( if your landlord good , you can respond to any changes the landlord brings up ) , but the latter is an action you chose to take under the eclipse ( a talk with your sweetheart not such a good time to do so ) . The ancient astrologers always wrote that if you act under an eclipse , your plan would not work out quite the way you expected , and it will likely not be to your advantage . Of course , every eclipse is different , and some are friendly to your planets and some are not . That 's why its better to consider the ideas of others at eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own at that time . <p> A final word : If you are a manager or own your own business , do not hire anyone at eclipse time ! Give 10 days after the eclipse to add to your staff . <p> One other point : if you must act at eclipse time , make it a solar , new moon eclipse , for that one will open new doors and create new opportunities . If you know an astrologer , be sure the eclipse is friendly to the natal planets in your unique chart . <h> 15 . If an eclipse falls on your birthday , or within five days of your birthday , the year that follows that particular birthday will be a critical one for you . <p> You may experience a big change in lifestyle or massive change in one specific part of your life . The same is true if the eclipse falls on your rising sign the first house of your chart . Your old life may now fade into history as a new one shapes up . <h> 16 . Eclipses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , or earth ) as your birth sign are generally friendly and helpful . <p> Let me give you an example . If you are a Pisces ( water ) and there 's an eclipse in Scorpio ( water ) , generally it will be positive for you . Of course the closer the mathematical degrees of the eclipse match your Sun , the better and the more important the eclipse will be for you . <p> I do have to add the disclaimer that we always have to look at all the planets involved in your chart and see how they are aspected at birth , but generally , this rule will be true . Eclipses in the same element are often friendly to each other . <p> The fire signs are Aries , Leo , and Sagittarius . The earth signs are Taurus , Virgo , and Capricorn . The air signs are Gemini , Libra , and Aquarius . The water signs are Cancer , Scorpio , and Pisces . <h> 17 . At eclipse time , keep your schedule light and elastic . No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come in to demand immediate attention . <h> 18 . Leos tend to feel new moon solar eclipses strongly , because the Sun is their ruler . Said another way , the Sun rules Leo . <h> 19 . Cancers tend to feel full moons and lunar eclipses strongly , as the moon rules Cancer . <h> 20 . Once a family of signs is finished , it will not be back for seven or eight years . <p> For example , as soon as the Pisces-Virgo series of eclipses are done on February 26 , 2017 , that series will not be back until September 17 , 2024 . <p> While the family of signs will repeat sooner than that , in about seven or eight years , they will appear in different mathematical degrees than they did recently . However if you go back 19 years and look at the series of eclipses that arrived that year , you may be astounded to see that all of them will be nearly identical in the family of sign , mathematical degree and precise date it arrived . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have since changed position , so no year is ever a carbon copy of any other year . Still , by looking back 19 years , you may be able to come up with a theme that will teach you something . <p> The most dramatic example I can give you is one that affected me . My daughter , Diana , was to go to college for the first time on an eclipse that fell August 30 . It was the day her father was driving her to Boston College , and I was a little worried because there was an eclipse that day . I was hoping all would go well , that the drive there would be uneventful , and that Diana would like her dorm room . <p> I thought , well , I can look back 19 years . But wait , I thought , I cant because Diana was only 18 . How could the previous eclipse in the same sign and degree of 19 years ago possibly affect her , or me ? I did the math and realized , much to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , I had found out I was pregnant with her . The first eclipse , 19 years earlier , taught me to be a mother . I was now learning to be a mother again in a different way , by letting my little bird fly away independently . As I realized this , I got goose bumps all over . The universe runs on time and is a source of vast wisdom . I will never forget the moment I realized this ! <h> 22 . The four eclipses coming up each year will arrive in the same degree , sign , and precise day as those that came by nineteen years earlier . <p> As said , sometimes it is helpful to look back to those years to see what themes e emerged at that time so that you can predict what might come up for you now . Just take 19 years from the present and look up to see what happened at eclipse time ( from the table below ) . <h> 23 . You might ask , does an eclipse deliver its news on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is important , so be sure to read this ! <p> 1 ) A message brought to you by an eclipse is usually delivered on the day , or within a week of the actual date of the eclipse but not always . <p> 2 ) If nothing happens then think back to exactly one month earlier and one month later plus or minus five days . <p> So for example , your birthday falls on February 26 . An eclipse is coming February 26 , 2017 , or you were born on August 26 , exactly six months away . Watch January 26 ( one month earlier ) , plus or minus five days , and one month later , March 26 , plus or minus five days . <p> 3 ) If neither period delivers any news , then watch for the days when Mars or Saturn will move over the precise degrees of the eclipse , oppose it , or challenge it In that regard , I will let you know when that is due to happen in my column . <p> Let me give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an eclipse burns a burning hole in the sky say with a cigarette when it appears ( it does n't  , but only in the poetic sense here , for our purposes ) . Afterward , the sky forms a scab over the part of the sky that has been " pierced " and " hurts . " <p> Later , when Mars , the warrior planet , takes the same route as the eclipse did and reaches that scab , at the same mathematical degree and sign as the eclipse , something may happen . Being the rough and tumble guy that Mars is known to be , he will break that scab open and the news of the eclipse would be released . This may also happen if Mars is in the opposite sign of the eclipse but same degree . <p> Saturn , being a karmic planet , can do the same if he is close enough and is due to travel over the same path , same sign , and same degree . ( Its also possible for either of these planets to oppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't  have to watch for any of this I will tell you about that when or if it happens in my monthly column in Astrology Zone ? . I thought you might like to know how I calculate things for you ! <h> 24 . You may be feeling more emotional than usual under an eclipse , especially if the eclipse is lunar ( full moon ) . <p> Your judgment may be impaired , or pieces of information may be missing , so bargain for more time to think about your decision or next action . You may want to wait seven days before deciding , but that is not always possible . If someone comes to you with a proposal , consider it carefully . If after looking at it from all sides you like it , then proceed , but try to beg for just a little extra time . <h> 25 . Do not have an over-packed schedule at eclipse time . <p> Keep your schedule light because urgent things often come up at eclipse time that will need your immediate attention . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert help if necessary , or hire helpers in your own personal life if you need more hands on deck . <h> 26 . Do n't  be too quick to pronounce an eclipse " good " or " bad . " All eclipses have a second act . <p> An eclipse may bring news suddenly , but it takes weeks to understand its real meaning . If you should suffer under an eclipse , consider that perhaps that situation is being swept away so that the universe can provide you with something better . Be patient and keep an open mind . In the fluid situation it creates you can find ways to benefit . <p> Here is one example . Mary has worked at the same company 15 years and does her job well . Her raises have been so little as to be almost non-existent , but she was so loyal to her employer she would never think of leaving . Now comes the eclipse and she is downsized . Mary is terribly upset , worried about how she will pay her rent , and if you asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipse on her has been catastrophic . However , the universe , in its wisdom , knows Mary can parlay her experience and qualifications for a much more interesting and well-paying job . The universe clears her basket so it can provide her with something infinitely better . In two months , Mary found a wonderful new job , and she only then realized what a blessing in disguise the eclipse had brought her . <h> 27 . Eclipses can help you do things you never thought you could do ! <p> Eclipses can show you that you are capable of much more than you assumed . You may be offered a chance to write a book or to record an album , for example or head up an entire department of your company . Eclipses sometimes will suddenly open a door , and it would be one that was previously bolted shut and impossible to enter . <p> Here is a good analogy of an eclipse . You are riding a horse in unfamiliar , beautiful terrain . The horses trainer told you that you would have to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distracted by the lovely scenery , you completely forget about the fence until it looms suddenly , straight in front of you . It is so much bigger than the trainer let on this fence is huge . You certainly do n't  feel ready to jump , and you doubt you ever will . You can not imagine going over that fence and surviving ! This is a big stretch for you ! <p> Yet , it would be something you wish you could do , but in panic , you try to pull on the reins of the horse to try to stop him . However , the horse has been trained to jump , and before you know it , you are flying through the air over a fence you feel is scary high . Each second you are in the air you feel you are moving in slow motion , for as up , up you go and over the massive stone fence . ( Remember I had said earlier , eclipses play with your sense of time . ) The horse is doing the jump for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so are you but you feel very shaky and breathless , and you are counting your fingers and toes . You did it ! You feel proud ! That is often the experience of an eclipse . <h> Some Important , Basic , Fundamental Information on Eclipses <h> 28 . Not all eclipses in a family of signs will affect you . Some will , some wont . Math will make the difference . <p> The eclipses that will touch you are the ones that are mathematically significant to your natal Sun , moon , and planets . Those are the ones that touch the same degree ( or are close to it ) of your Sun , moon , or one or two planets in that part of the sky on the day you were born . <p> In each chapter ( and on my website ) , be sure to check the birthdates and degree of the eclipse that I will mention in association with each eclipse . It is true that eclipses in a family of signs that highlight your Sun sign will be vitally important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any one series ( family ) of signs in an 18-to-24-month period , but you may only feel two or three of those , not all six or eight . The other eclipses , in any series , may have only a mild effect , or none at all . <h> 29 . The eclipse does not have to fall in your sign or rising sign to affect you . <p> Let 's say you are an Aries , and there will be an eclipse in Gemini . Do n't  tune out , because that eclipse may cause you to sign a contract , take a sudden short trip , or hear news about your sister or brother . The point is , you do n't  have to just be a Gemini or the opposite sign of Sagittarius to feel it . <h> 30 . If your birthday is not listed , check to see if a coming eclipse falls on , or within five degrees , of one of your natal ( or progressed ) planets . <p> If you have your natal chart and you see that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit up , " that means that heavenly body will be expressing lots of news in your chart . Unless you know astrology , it is hard to tell you how that eclipse will affect you . You do n't  have to know astrology to learn . It would be wise for you to keep a little notebook of events that happen near each eclipse ( and the sign , date , and degree of each eclipse ) because in time you will see a pattern every time that planet , your Sun , or moon is visited by an eclipse . Even if nothing happens , write that down , too . If you ever see an astrologer , that information will prove very valuable . <p> If your Venus is well aspected in your natal chart ( that means friendly to one or more planets on the day you were born ) , then it means that the new eclipse will trigger that happy natal configuration , and the eclipse would likely prove to be positive . <p> If your Venus is afflicted at birth , meaning not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may have problems at the eclipse , for that sore point will be triggered occasionally . The difficult eclipse will unlock underlying feelings or factors swirling around you and help you come to terms with that configuration in your chart . <p> An eclipse will always provide you with information you need to know about it , and for that , reason even though you may say it is " difficult , " the eclipse will still be a force for good . You can and probably will address the topic forthrightly now . <h> 31 . If you know your rising sign , read for that sign as well . <p> Treat your rising sign just like you would your Sun sign . They are equal in importance . Furthermore , if you have a planet near your rising sign , note if the mathematical degrees of the planet and the eclipse are close . The closer the degrees ( within five degrees ) , the more likely you will feel something . <p> Your rising sign ( or ascendant ) can only be determined by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , city , and precise time , to the minute , of your birth . Once you know your rising sign , you must always read for your rising sign as well as your Sun sign . Your rising sign has the same significance as your Sun sign they are equal in importance in your chart . The rising sign partially explains why every one of the same sign is not alike you are a combination of both . The rising sign has another critical function , and without my getting too technical here , it gives further information of the timing of events in your chart . <p> As an aside , if you would like me to write a custom book about your chart , go to **34;0;TOOLONG and order the book with the yellow and purple cover for your natal chart . The book I write will be just for you it can not be sent to anyone else . Be sure to have all of your precise birth information ready when you order . It will cost $55.00 plus any applicable sales tax ( NY State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know your birth time , go to the government office ( not the hospital ) that saves this information , such as the Bureau of Vital Statistics or the Hall of Records in your state or country capital .

If it is $5 , it is the wrong record the Department of Motor Vehicles has a computer copy that deletes the time of birth . You need the original , handwritten birth certificate the nurse recorded . It is available if you ask for it . If you do n't  know your birth time and cant find out , I can still write a book about your natal chart I use sunrise as the default function but I can not tell you your rising sign .

Look to the house of both your solar chart and your rising sign chart where the eclipse will be to find out what areas of life will bring a major change in status . <p> This is a very important point to remember . As said above ( and bears repeating ) , you have two charts : your solar Sun-sign chart , and your rising sign , custom chart done by the day , month , year , time , and city of birth . Both charts are vital to have and to read ! Everyone , everywhere has two charts . <p> If you read one without the other , you will only have half the information you need . So if you are a Capricorn , read for the section on Capricorn , and if you know you have Taurus rising , read for Taurus too . <p> If you have a planet , or the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipse , pay attention to that planet , its placement in the chart , and the house that planet rules . ( I realize this may be way to complicated to comprehend , so just circle that planet and see what happens later . ) <p> What if the news of the two charts conflict ? Then the one with the more severe news will find comfort from the better aspected chart . There will be a mitigating , softening effect , so things may work out better than if you did n't  have the good news in the other chart . <p> The best way to learn astrology is simply to observe ! You are likely to see the area of life that the house rules will become important to you , as well as the area of the chart that the planet rules . You may not know enough astrology to figure these things out , but in time , you will . Taking notes on each eclipse is a good way to get acquainted with the movements of eclipses . <p> You do n't  have to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign and your Sun ( birthday ) sign , and I will take care of the rest for you . <p> Now you know all you need to know about how to deal with eclipses and win !

Let 's look closely at Mercury retrograde and what it means to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 <p> January 5 January 25 , 2016 in Aquarius , ends in earth-sign Capricorn <h> Does Mercury Really Move Backward ? <p> Mercury does n't  actually move backward . If you do a bit of stargazing , you will see that Mercury appears to move backward , just as the ancient astrologers perceived thousands of years ago . After a while in Mercurys case , a three-and-a-half-week period the planet will reverse itself and move " forward " again . <p> Because Mercury is the planet situated closest to the Sun , its orbit is much shorter than Earths . About three or four times a year , Mercury speeds past Earth , and that is when we experience a Mercury retrograde period . If you were in a car and another car passed you , you could tell it was going faster than you . But if it slowed down and you then passed it , it would appear that that car was actually going backward . Then when the other car speeds up and passes you again , it kicks up all of the dust in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train flying past , creating a powerful , turbulent gust of " wind " in its wake . The turbulence and disruption Mercury creates when it retrogrades can affect what we feel on Earth in our everyday lives . <p> In astrology , we always believe the following rule is true : " As above , so too below . " By that we mean there is a fractal relationship between the orbits in the heavens and human activity down here on Earth . This idea pervades all of astrology and is a very good concept to keep in mind . <h> Areas of Life Mercury Rules <p> Mercury rules all types of communication , including listening , speaking , learning , reading , editing , researching , negotiating , selling , and buying . Mercury also rules all formal contracts and agreements , as well as important documents such as book manuscripts or term papers , agreements , deeds , contracts , leases , wills , and so forth . <p> Included under this planets domain are all types of code , including computer codes , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet retrogrades , these areas tend to get scrambled or spin out of control . <p> Why does this happen ? When a planet retrogrades , astrologically it is in a resting or sleeping state . Therefore , while Mercury naps , the activities that it governs do n't  have the benefit of a well-functioning , wide-awake planet to supervise them . Expect a certain degree of pandemonium to ensue ! <p> Do n't  make any important moves when Mercury is retrograde . Nothing will be settled successfully for the future during these periods anyway you will find it nearly impossible to nail down a plan . During a retrograde period , it is hard to get decisions from others . Even if a decision is made , it will be subject to change , either just after Mercury turns to direct motion or much later . <p> Mercury retrograde periods would not be good times to do anything involving communications , such as launch a magazine , website , or an advertising or publicity campaign . <p> These phases are also considered poor times to launch any new endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries . <p> Similarly , a retrograde period is not a good time to sign any contracts or even to shake hands on any new agreements . Do not close on a house during this time nor sign a lease . Verbal agreements are considered the same as written ones . The environment will be quite fluid and changeable , no matter what you are told or what you think . <p> Its not that the people you are dealing with are necessarily duplicitous . Its just that nobody can fully predict what conditions will be like later . If you start a new job , it wont necessarily be the position you thought it was when you accepted it . If you are a manager , you will have difficulty choosing the right candidate for the job , so , if you can , hold off hiring anyone . If you buy a house , problems could crop up later that were completely unanticipated . <p> Of course , if you have an emergency , you must have surgery . At other times in life , we do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In those cases , such as having plastic surgery , it is best to avoid Mercury retrograde periods . These are periods where mistakes are more prone to happen than at other times , or when judgment is off . Your surgeon is under the same conditions as you , so I would suggest waiting . <p> I would also strongly suggest that you avoid plastic surgery when Venus retrogrades , because Venus rules beauty , and the whole purpose of the surgery is to improve your looks . <p> Mars rules the whole area of surgery , so you would ideally want Mars to be in the best possible form , too . It is said not to have an operation on the part of the body that the sign Mars is moving through rules . For example , if Mars happens to be in Capricorn , it would not be the best time for a knee operation because Capricorn rules the knees . It is said that Mars will increase pain and swelling . A full moon at the time of the surgery will increase bleeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me reiterate , if you have an emergency , do n't  worry about any of these rules have your surgery . I had to have very serious surgery , triggered by a new moon solar eclipse , on the wrong part of the body ( because Mars was in the sign ruling the part of the body that was being affected by the surgery ) . Admittedly , it was a tough surgery , but it was highly successful . If you need surgery , have it ! <h> Mars Will Retrograde <p> April 17 , 2016 to June 29 , 2016 in fire-sign Sagittarius June 26 to Aug 27 , 2018 in air-sign Aqua . ends earth-sign Capricorn September 9 to November 13 , 2020 in fire-sign Aries <p> October 30 , 2022 to January 12 , 2023 in air-sign Gemini December 6 , 2024 to Feb 23 , 2025 in air-sign Leo ends in water-sign Cancer <h> Venus Will Retrograde <p> March 4 to April 15 , 2017 in fire-sign Aries , ends in water-sign Pisces October 5 to November 16 , 2018 in water-sign Scorpio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 in air-sign Gemini <p> December 19 , 2021 to January 29 , 2022 in earth-sign Capricorn July 22 , 2023 to September 23 , 2023 in fire-sign Leo March 1 , 2025 to April 12 , 2025 in fire-sign Aries , ends in water-sign Pisces <h> What Other Specific Things Should You Watch Out For ? <p> Since Mercury rules the mail and the conveyance of information , be extra careful when sending important documents . If you send faxes , be sure to call the people at the other end to let them know your documents are waiting for them . Otherwise , they may never see it . If you work in an office and have to photocopy an important document , be sure to retrieve the original . Be equally careful about whom you send email to you do n't  want to send a private email to the wrong person or have a sensitive email forwarded to others . <p> Your client may suddenly change direction on a project you have been working on and give you new instructions , which may require you to discard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so during these periods keep summarizing what you think the other person has just told you . Go the extra mile you will be glad you did ! <p> Mercury retrograde periods are notorious for causing computers to crash and for machines , appliances , and other electronic devices to show signs of wear , requiring urgent repair . Backup your computer in advance of any Mercury retrograde period . If you had planned to install new software on your personal computer ( or , if you work in IT , on your network ) , wait until the retrograde period is over to do so . Weird things happen during these periods . For example , you may suddenly discover that you were sold a defective hard drive , even though it may never have given you problems in the past , at least not until you created that vital document and your whole system went down . <p> Mercury also rules trade and commerce , so do n't  buy or sell anything expensive during its retrograde phases . Often you will find that the item you want is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as a car , computer , or jewelry , for example , you may regret your purchase later . If you are buying or selling a house , expect problems , errors , delays , and setbacks to arise . The only times you can buy something expensive during a retrograde period are if you are returning something you already bought . <p> Computers , high tech items , appliances , automobiles , and other machines and electronics are highly susceptible to Mercury in a retrograde period . Mercury rules moving parts , so that can be one reason . Yet , other things happen . You buy an air conditioner and 30 days later discover it has gone on sale for much less than what you paid . Or you by an expensive smartphone during a retrograde only to drop it ( and crack its screen ) or lose it soon afterward . It really does pay to wait to buy electronics . <p> In years past , Mercury always seemed to retrograde during the holiday shopping season . For example , in 2011 , Mercury was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the black because everyone loves to shop on the Friday after Thanksgiving , November 25 ) until the end of the day on December 13 . <p> If you are driving any significant distance during a period where Mercury is retrograde , bring extra maps ( or make sure your GPS is up to date ) , make sure you have enough gas , and verify that you have the correct address and clear driving instructions . If your car is making strange sounds , have it inspected before you leave ; you do n't  want a problem to emerge when you are on the road . If you are flying , check with your airline to make sure your flight is going to take off on time . Have your luggage well marked so that it wo n't get lost or sent to the wrong airport , and bring your iPod and a good book to the airport , as there could be lots of delays . <p> Some people do not travel when Mercury is retrograde , and perhaps that might be wise if your trip is business-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former client you 've worked with in the past , traveling during the retrograde is fine . Sales people know that business is always most likely from former clients . If you are in sales , earmark all your former clients for special attention during these phases . <p> You can take a trip for pleasure during these periods . Actually , this could be a perfect time to go , for you get away from it all , and everyone back at the office will " feel " the retrograde they will miss your quick problem-solving ability and advice while you are away ! During a retrograde phase , you might want to travel to a place from your childhood that you loved but have n't seen in a long time . It could be lots of fun because going back to places you knew is favored . <p> Forgetfulness can be a problem during these phases . You are more likely to leave your airline ticket or passport on your desk rather than put it in your pocket ; leave your cell phone , sunglasses , or gloves in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your car or house . I always advise that you tape your business card on the back of your computer or smartphone case , and slip your card into your case holding your eyeglasses in case one of these treasures is lost . <p> I also suggest that if you buy a gift card for someone , you photocopy the cards serial number so that if you or your recipient loses the card , you can get it replaced quickly by the retailer . ( Of course , keep your receipt stapled to the photocopy . Some retailers can give you a gift receipt with the serial number on the receipt , so you do n't  have to go through the trouble of having the card photocopied . Even so , keep a copy in your records too , for your recipient may lose everything ! ) Tell your recipient that you are taking precautions , in case they do lose your gift and are too shy to tell you that they did ! Often there is a comedy of errors surrounding Mercury retrograde ! <p> While we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport and give your family members a copy , too . If you ever should lose your passport , you will have a copy to show the passport office , and it will make things much easier for you ! Do that today , while you are thinking of it ! <p> Romance tends to go haywire , too , during Mercury retrograde periods . Couples tend to create miscommunications that in turn can cause a domino effect of errors . Try not to jump to conclusions , and keep striving for clarity . Your sweetheart or spouse could also have a sudden change of mind . For example , if your boyfriend or girlfriend says , " I want to break up , " he or she could say later , " No , let 's not ! I did n't  really mean it ! " That 's because people are n't  always thinking straight during these phases . Mercury retrograde is notorious for creating confusion . <p> Keep in mind that Mercury retrogrades in three different signs of the zodiac during the year . If it retrogrades in your sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual . In this case , try to be even more vigilant and double-check proposals , ideas , creative efforts , and other plans to root out flaws or incorrect assumptions . Always go the extra mile to find errors during a retrograde . These periods demand a slow and deliberate approach . <p> When Mercury retrogrades , think of it as an instant signal that the wind is changing direction . Something is in flux up on the road ahead , but the problem is , everything looks the same and unchanging . What makes these periods so difficult is that you can not see yet that they are about to change , often radically . <p> Let 's say you take a new position while Mercury is retrograde . After you start , the company starts extreme cost-cutting procedures , and you suddenly discover you will lose some of the people who report to you . On top of that , your title changes not in a way you like . In this typical example , you had no idea these procedures were being planned , and had you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things like this happen all the time when Mercury is out of phase . Do not take a job when Mercury is retrograde , and do n't  start one during a retrograde , either . <h> A Key to the Solution to Any Mercury Retrograde Problem Lies in the Element Mercury is Found In : Fire , Earth , Air , or Water <p> Each year , Mercury will favor one element over another . In 2012 , Mercury will retrograde in fire signs , so that tells us we need to apply completely new , visionary , and innovative solutions to the problem that comes up . Fire signs are highly creative and also brave and pioneering do n't  be shy about suggesting a very unusual solution . Fire signs also think on a big , broad scale , so you should think that way when attacking the problem , too . <p> If Mercury retrogrades in an earth sign , be very practical about finding a solution , and strictly adhere to limits of time or budget . Money often plays a big part of both the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably do best by not suggesting a blue-sky idea , which would have worked with Mercury in a fire sign . <p> If Mercury retrogrades in an air sign , lots of discussion will need to take place , as air signs are highly communicative . Talk to a lot of people and poll their responses . Do a great deal of research , too . Air signs are analytical and modern you may hear of a solution that is so new , you may not even have known it was possible . Use the answer that seems best for you after going through this process , and make sure you are objective and not emotional in choosing your answer . <p> If Mercury retrogrades in a water sign , use your intuition . Research can be driven by the way questions are asked , so if your research says to go a certain way , but your intuition tells you to reject the research , follow your gut . Intellect can only get us so far ; often our emotional intelligence is more accurate . If Mercury retrogrades in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to that small voice within . <h> What If You Ca n't Put Off a Decision Until a Later Date ? <p> What if you cant wait a few weeks ? In that case , you may have to proceed anyway . Do so knowing that the conditions around the situation will probably change , so plan to be flexible . For example , if you are looking at a great apartment , you may have to sign the lease or risk losing it . However , before you do , ask lots of questions . <p> If you are buying a house , hire a top engineer to check it out , or get two engineers opinions . Be ready for something to come up . Do all you can to extend the process : Say your lawyer is out of town or in court . Say you will be in Paris during that time ! <p> My own daughter re-signed her lease during the retrograde ( she 's Aries , and as a typical Aries , Diana does n't  like to hear about rules ) . Four months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to move immediately . A year later , my little Aries bought a computer during the retrograde . ( " Its a Mac , what could possibly go wrong ? " ) Nothing went wrong , except her judgment . She later said she regrets not getting the more expensive model with a much bigger screen . She finally sold her new Mac laptop to a friend , bought a Mac desktop with the big screen she needed , and is happy now . <h> Are There Any Exceptions to the Rule : <p> " Do n't  Plan Big Actions During a Retrograde " ? Yes ! <p> Indeed , despite what I have just said , there are situations where you can move forward , gingerly , during Mercury retrograde . The main time you can is if you are going back to the past , either to correct something or do more with a person you know and admire . <p> If your editor gives you an assignment that was put on the back burner a year ago , and it has jumped to life again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are out of work and looking for a new job . Your old boss ( whom you enjoyed working with on a previous job ) invites you to join the company he is at now , as a member of the team . In this case , you will be going back to a former professional relationship that you actually started a long time ago , and this is simply an ongoing situation . In this case , you CAN take the job . <p> Readers ask , " Well , I started interviewing for a new job before the retrograde , but the offer for the new job was made after Mercury retrograde . Technically , I knew the interviewer for a few weeks before the retrograde , so ca n't I take the job ? " Actually no . In this case , you have had no real history with this interviewer or company . Sorry , this does not apply . However , if you are desperate and badly need to find a job , take it , but realize it will not be a long-term solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you do n't  like anything about that new job . That may be fine with you , for at least you will have income for a short time , which is better than no income at all . Also , it is said to be easier to find a new job after you have one , so in that sense , it may be helpful to take a short-term , stopgap job . <p> What if you gave a bid on a house you loved and wanted but that was rejected . Can you go back and put in a new bid on that same house during the retrograde , even months later ( assuming the house is not yet sold ) ? Yes . In this case , you have a history with the house , the people who live there , and your broker . This would actually be a good time to " redo " your bid and send it in again . When it comes to exceptions , if you have a history with the person or situation , you can proceed carefully during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Mercury Retrograde ? <p> It has been said by some astrologers that people who were born under Mercury retrograde are immune from much of the mayhem of this phase , but I do not agree that this is true . ( I was born while Mercury was in retrograde , and I always find these periods quite difficult , perhaps because I work in Mercury-ruled publishing ! ) <p> You can find out if you were born under these phases by checking your natal horoscope wheel . The planet Mercurys symbol will have a small " R " under it on the horoscope wheel . <p> People born under this phase are said to have philosophical and reflective natures that help them think through complex concepts quite creatively . Never worry about having a baby during one of these retrograde periods it is always a good time to have a child ! <h> Mercurys Impending Shadow Period <p> As Mercury approaches its " switch point " ( the day it actually turns retrograde ) , it will progress along a path that it will later retrace in the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period prior to Mercury retrograde is called the " impending shadow period . " If you initiate anything important during that shadow period that is , in the time before Mercury begins to retrograde you still may encounter problems . <p> If you have a choice whether to sign papers or initiate an action prior to Mercury retrograde or just after it is finished retrograding , there is no question that I suggest you wait and act afterward . Try to secure a little breathing space ( a few days or even better , two weeks ) from the date Mercury goes direct , for safety . It does n't  pay to rush to do things before Mercury retrogrades . Waiting is always the wiser option . <p> Here is another vital point to keep in mind : Mercury is more powerful on the onset and finish dates of its retrograde . I call them the " bookend " dates of the retrograde , and static and dust seem to fill the air more noticeably than any other time . <p> The presidential election date of 2000 ( when President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mercury was due to turn direct . This is a good example of the problems that can occur just as the planet is turning forward or backward . In that case , it was weeks until the winner of the election was chosen . <p> This point deserves reiteration : Always allow two days , minimum , after Mercury moves ahead to normal direct speed before you start initiating projects or making big purchases . The more time you can allow after this planet goes direct , the better . If you can wait two weeks , all the better . <h> Is Mercury Retrograde All Bad ? Not at All ! <p> Although these Mercury retrograde periods can be frustrating , they are often useful too , for they allow us to reassess , revisit , readdress , redo , and redesign our plans . Sometimes we rush along in life without fully considering our basic assumptions or actions . Mercury retrograde allows us to stop , look , listen , and redirect our energies more productively . Mercury also helps us find closure to certain situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during retrograde periods , and that can be one of the most positive and fun sides of this planets retrograde orbit . If you hear from an old friend or colleague during Mercury retrograde , I feel there is a potent reason for it . It seems to me that there is something that the two of you are meant to do or plan together . <p> We can all benefit from taking a closer look at situations with greater depth , which happens when Mercury retrogrades . Mercury retrograde periods are like walking through glue , so they do tend to make us slow down , which at times can be a blessing . <p> Here are some examples of ways Mercury retrograde can help you : <p> Perhaps you have been working on a project that seems to have gone down the wrong path . When Mercury retrogrades , it could become evident that the project needs to be altered slightly or redirected . Even if you did not get your way originally , if you argue your case persuasively , things might go your way now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo and behold , a better one comes your way in the meantime . <p> You refrain from buying a certain big-ticket item , and within a few weeks , the coveted item goes on sale and you will be glad you waited . <p> If a meeting is postponed or cancelled , you have more time to gather additional information that probably will come in quite handy . <p> If you are in sales , go back to old customers and clients . You may do better by asking for more business from people who have always trusted you than by trying to extend your reach into new sales territory . Former customers like being contacted , and under Mercury retrograde , you will have the time to do so . <p> Missing objects are likely to be found . That beautiful bracelet wasnt lost after all it was on your bookshelf , behind your favorite book ! <h> What Else Should You Do During Mercury Retrograde Periods ? <p> It would be a great time to reorganize your files or closets . Pack up clothes you have n't worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoes and decide which ones need repair , and while you are at it , decide which appliances need to be taken in for repair as well . Oddly , as busy as we are , during these phases we always seem to find more time to get things done . When you clean your closets , you will find treasures you thought you lost or had completely forgotten about , always a bonus of going through things you have not seen in a while . <p> Mercury rules anything that begins with " re " : redo , reassess , repair , repeat , redesign , or revisit . Its always human nature to want to hear that new opportunities are coming our way , but we really do need to focus on the quality of our work and improve it to the best it can be . Often this is a better use of our time than continually chasing the newest idea . Mercury retrograde allows you to be thorough and to perfect your performance . <p> Do n't  assume everything goes wrong during Mercury retrograde sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned down an assignment because the price the client was willing to pay was too low , this same client may come back after the retrograde ( after he sees many others turning down his offer ) and you get the project after all , at the right price . People reconsider their stance when Mercury is retrograde , and in some cases , conditions turn out to be more favorable to you than they might have been before . <p> As you can see , Mercury retrograde is not all bad you can count on it !

You are nearing the end of a long visit of Saturn , the planet that limits and contains , to your house of earned income . By December you will be free of Saturns Spartan methods , and getting generous compensation wont be as difficult to negotiate in the future . <p> Saturn has been showing you the value of money , but admittedly , he does have a tough love way of sending lessons .

You may want to read for my outlook for your rising sign , too , which may be better for your finances , in which case your Scorpio outlook would be softened . <p> As an aside , if you know your precise time of birth , you can order your custom natal chart with my full explanation of what your planets mean in 65 pages , with beautiful color illustrations in color .

This is a highly cooperative trend , and as a Scorpio , you usually like to take the reins and be in full control . During the coming six weeks that wont be possible , but you will find it to be a relief not to be expected to handle everything yourself , and that the weight on your shoulders will be shared by others .

In April and May , for you , dear Scorpio , two heads will be better than one . <p> Things are a bit complicated because Venus will go retrograde this month from March 4 to April 15 , and Venus governs your plans to marry and all serious business partnerships . ( Why ? You have Taurus , ruled by Venus , on the cusp of your solar seventh house of all contractual relationships , which include marriage . ) Venus retrograde is a weak Venus , so I would prefer that you not sign papers to create a partnership for your business or to get engaged this month or next . Actually , it will take Venus until May 18 to return to full power .

The recent eclipse of February 26 in Pisces 8 degrees last month lit your eighth house of other peoples money . A solar eclipse is always a new moon indeed , a new moon on steroids , much stronger than any typical new moon and so this solar event may have brought you news that a large sum of money is on the way to you . <p> Keep in mind that solar eclipses have a long sphere of influence , and can affect you for six months or longer , so if you have not received any news about money last month , watch the end of March , for in about twenty percent of the time , an eclipse will deliver its news one month to the day later , plus or minus five days . <p> That eclipse was favorable , but I will admit with Neptune hovering , you need to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign . Neptune can cloud clauses , or an important matter may not have been addressed at all , which can become eventually just as troublesome .

This full moon will help you finalize a financial agreement within five days of the date it appears , or you may be buying something expensive . You are likely to be sending out checks to play bills too . Full moons give us the energy and interest to meet deadlines and press forward on plans . <p> It is very possible you may be negotiating a salary this month and may finalize an agreed-upon amount , for your career will sparkle with news and opportunity .

While you will always have a chance to advance , Mars will make it easier for you to get noticed , which is half the battle . Mars will also give you confidence , which is the other half of the battle . Lay the groundwork for a job you hope to nab now , and then later , after the new moon , April 26 , be ready to move in and win it .

This is quite a combination for success when speaking with a VIP . The transiting moon will collaborate too , for the moon that day will be in Leo . <p> This month , you may have one career setback when Venus goes retrograde , March 4 to April 15 .

@@12610057 @1210057/ <h> Age of Aquarius <h> Share <h> Susan Millers astrological predictions for a new century . <p> April 19th , 2016 <p> On the morning of August 11 it was a sunny day in downtown Los Angeles . I was in town visiting from New York . Since I find news stations to provide interesting overviews of local culture , I switched on the television in my hotel room to catch up on what was going on in LA and the rest of the world , and what people were saying and thinking . The total eclipse of the Sun had occurred the previous evening , and the eclipses path of totality had been visible from much of Europe . The news broadcast showed footage of Europeans clogging highways to get to the best vantage point from which to see this last cosmic event of our century . Some close friends in London had traveled to France to view the eclipse and called to say it was simply spectacular . On this report , the male anchor bantered easily with his female co-anchor , cheerfully stating that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age of Aquarius . His cohort , however , seemed doubtful and dismissed her colleagues remark with a rather flip comment , " Oh , that . The Age of Aquarius happened decades ago in the 1960s . " <p> In truth , nobody knows for sure what the actual inception date of the Age of Aquarius happens to be . The way this pretty blonde news journalist delivered her quip made it obvious that she not only thought the Age of Aquarius began years ago but also that she thought it must be over by now . I sighed to myself . Most people remember the term " Age of Aquarius " from the 1960s musical Hair , but few people know precisely what it means . The onset of an age is difficult for astrologers to pinpoint exactly we will discuss why in a moment . We do know that an astrological age spans over two thousand years . Perhaps this news anchor should n't have been quite so blase about living though the dawning of a new age . Most human beings wont ever have the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special , and anyone alive at this moment in time is about to experience it . <p> When astrologers speak about the Age of Aquarius they are describing a phenomenon that refers to the earths movement backward ( or in " retrograde " motion ) into the sign of Aquarius . As you know , there are 11 other signs of the zodiac the earth will retrograde in each one . It will take the earth 25,868 years to visit all 12 signs . If you divide 25,868 by 12 signs , you will get roughly 2,100 years to a particular " age " . Thus , once the Age of Aquarius is upon us ( and many astrologers , myself included , feel we have reached this point ) it will stay the Age of Aquarius for two thousand years . The " precession of the zodiac " that underlies this principal was first discovered by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea ( c. 190 c. 120 BC ) . It is due to a slight wobble in the earths rotation . The precession of the zodiac is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the vernal equinox , which changes gradually over time . Rather than negate the dates of the Sun signs , this precession adds a unique tone of character to each of the signs . But classical astrologers do not feel the precession of the zodiac changes the inherent qualities of the signs . <p> The age before the Age of Aquarius was the Age of Pisces . Since the earth is moving in retrograde motion , we have just left the Age of Pisces , which marked the years 1-2000 AD . This time coincides with the age of Christ and Christianity . Pisces is considered the last sign of the zodiac , a compendium of all the signs that came before it , from Aries to Aquarius . Pisces is the sign known for universal love , compassion , self-sacrifice , altruism , creativity , intuition and deep spirituality . Pisces know the truth of the universe but cant quite say why they know it . It does n't  matter , for Pisces know that " truth " is always in flux . To Pisces , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true to the soul . Pisces is an introspective sign . This Piscean mindset has been the way humanity has approached the world since we evolved and has colored everything that we have encountered during that period . <p> Early Christians used the symbol of the fish ( symbol of Pisces ) as a secret symbol of their faith . The emphasis on washing of the feet as a ritual signifying purification of the spirit ties into Pisces symbolism as well , for Pisces rules the feet . Pisces " carry " the cares of others and often have sore feet . Christ spoke of his role as servant to his flock , which is also a very Pisces notion . Pisces says , " I believe , " whereas Aquarius , the age we are in now , says , " Prove it to me scientifically . " Christs mother Mary embodied all the qualities represented by the Pisces polarity of Virgo , namely , modesty , commitment to service , and acceptance of what must not be changed . In Pisces , there is a strong need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cloisters or spiritual pilgrimages . Aquarius puts emphasis on group activities and community , thus we have the Internet and the eye of the global village which we call television . Aquarius is a very social sign . Pisces is something of a " psychic sponge . " Pisces like people too , but need regular time to themselves to rinse away the everyday cares they have absorbed . <p> The Earth Has Seen Six Ages <p> Astrologers of the world community generally agree that mankind has experienced six separate " ages , " dating from the first appearance of humanity on earth . When each period starts and ends is slightly imprecise because of the huge time frame involved . ( Over 25 thousand years , and there is always a plus or minus tolerance to any mathematical curve . ) Also the ages overlap slightly because , in fact , some parts of the zodiac also overlap in the heavens . The signs of the zodiac are of unequal sizes , too , with some signs taking up more real estate in the heavens than others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total eclipse of the Sun that occurred in August 1999 was significant because it helped to get the world ready to launch into the main time of the Age of Aquarius . That eclipse occurred in the constellation of Leo , a sign that we call the " polarity " of Aquarius . This is because Leo exists at the opposite end of the spectrum from Aquarius , exactly 6 months away . That means the August eclipse was especially powerful and able to contrast , clarify and highlight classic Aquarius qualities . Not all eclipses are created equal . Some are more powerful than others and this one was considered to be very intense . In a way it was the mother of all solar eclipses . Because this eclipse also fell on a new moon , it pointed to the end of one way of life and a fresh beginning of this new era . <p> Every sign has a ruling planet and Uranus is the ruler of Aquarius . Appropriately enough , Uranus has been moving through its home base of Aquarius , a process that takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont be back to the constellation of Aquarius for 84 years . Neptune is a planet that dissolves or purifies all that it touches , by rinsing in its waters , gently and yet consistently . Neptune is also moving us into an Aquarius state of mind . Neptune wo n't leave Aquarius until 2012 , and when it does will not be back until 2175 ! All these elements point to the probability that the Age of Aquarius has been established . In case you are curious , the very first age mankind experienced was the Age of Leo , and ran from 10000 to 8000 BC . <p> The Onset Date : October 4 , 1957 <p> Many people think the Age of Aquarius began neatly at that August eclipse , or even more neatly , that it will begin on the dot at the first hour of the year 2000 . In fact , a good case could be made for its dawning a little earlier . Aquarius is a sign strongly linked to new inventions , flight , and large groups of people or nationalities . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new age of enlightenment was on October 4 , 1957 , when the Russians launched Sputnik , the worlds first artificial satellite , into orbit . The Americans lost little time in catching up , and on October 1 , 1958 , the United States announced the birth of National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) . Eleven days after that , NASA made its first test launch . Later , in May 1961 John F. Kennedy announced a commitment to the Apollo space program in a speech called " Urgent National Needs " ( when Jupiter was in Aquarius ) . Kennedy said : " I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth . No single space project in this period would offer a bigger contribution to mankind , or be more important for the long-range exploration of space ; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish . " On July 20 , 1969 , only eight years later , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Soviet-American space race was on , and our lives would never be the same . Many unmanned and manned launches took place after that . In April 1990 the United States launched the Hubble Telescope into space , and in subsequent years Hubble sent back the most detailed close-up images of the planets that mankind had ever seen . Hubble later informed us that there is one planet outside our solar system , ejected into deep space by its parent stars . Located in a star-forming region in the constellation of Taurus , scientists call the planet TMR-1C . TMR-1C seems to be sitting at the end of an unusual filament of light . It is estimated to be two to three times the mass of Jupiter , the largest planet in our solar system ! <p> The Age of Aquarius has barely begun and citizens of planet earth are witnessing exciting discoveries about the planets and stars , as well as enjoying new technology down here on earth . Hundreds of discoveries have come from just about every field , from medicine to biotechnology , fabrics , materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo-imaging , many as direct descendants from humanitys exploration into space . On an emotional level , landing on the moon rallied the earth into a kind of global citizenship . This is a quintessentially Aquarian idea , for Aquarius is the sign that that represents the platonic concept of the brotherhood of man . Humanity was touched by the news that one of us was able to leave our protective environment and achieve the near impossible : leave his footprints on another heavenly body , and return to tell the tale ! <p> The Qualities Of Aquarius Foretell Societys Future <p> As I mentioned earlier , the ancient astrologers thought of Aquarius as " the sign of all things that are newly invented " . This is why this sign and the Age of Aquarius is linked so strongly to technology . Aquarius is also an air sign and therefore highly communicative , bent on gathering information , which echoes what is coming toward us in the new millennium , too . Let 's quickly list other qualities of Aquarius to get an even better feeling for what the Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for independence and individualism , and while members of this sign can be somewhat idiosyncratic they are also very original and inventive . Aquarius is visionary and creative , but rebellious , too . Aquarius job is to challenge authority , tear down existing structures , and replace the outdated with something better . Thus , Aquarius can be capable of great extremes . This sign acts in rather sudden and unexpected ways , thanks to being ruled by Uranus , the planet of surprise . <p> This future-thinking sign can often be a study in contrast . On one hand , Aquarius can be quite intellectually and emotionally aloof at times . Aquarius needs distance , and marches to a different drummer . On the other hand , it is one of the most congenial , social and gregarious signs , and certainly one of the most humanitarian ( besides Pisces ) . Aquarius sees social wrongs and moves to right them , often through mobilizing groups into action . Unlike Pisces , a sign that works one-on-one , Aquarius likes to work in large groups , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for all and all for one , " rather than elitist . Since Aquarius is a fixed sign , they are quite solid when they make commitments . All these Aquarian qualities will influence us as we move more deeply into this new age . Although it began in 1957 , that was just a prelude of what is to come the curtain goes up on the Age of Aquarius now . <p> All The Ages Of Man <p> Every astrological age has a very different " face " on it and they are not similar to one another . For example , if we were entering the Age of Cancer , there would be a great social emphasis on family , housing , food and fertility . In fact , when Man experienced this period from 8000 to 6000 BC , dwellings were being developed and humanity put great emphasis on the family unit . Many examples of art and artifacts survived this era , and a dominant theme from that time depicts a female fertility goddess . This is the era when humanity learned to fish as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't  have space here to delve into the other ages , but I will quickly list them . Man has lived through the Age of Gemini ( 6000 to 4000 BC ) , when language was born and writing became highly developed . Next came the Age of Taurus ( 4000 BC to 2000 BC ) , when art and luxury fairly unknown until then came into existence . This age was followed by the Age of Aries ( 2000 BC to 1AD ) , a masculine , brawny sign , that was prevalent when the Greeks and Romans reigned . Also as mentioned earlier , before any of these periods was the Age of Leo . Leo is a creative sign , and this age is the one that left behind its ancient cave drawings . The spiritual and religious Age of Pisces followed the Greek and Roman Age of Aries , which brings us to the Age of Aquarius . <p> Every Sign Is Included In The Exciting Changes <p> Does all this mean people of the sign of Aquarius will be especially " at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be the case , for their natural inclinations will also be the prevailing thinking of the day . Gemini and Libra , the other two air signs , would also be able to capitalize on the prevailing changes quite well . But nobody will be left out of the information revolution under any circumstances . Changes in thinking , lifestyles , social mores , education , work , and even love and marriage will bring everyone new choices to consider . Each of us will be able to choose how we would like to express our unique personalities under these new conditions . If Aquarius is about anything , it is about customization this signs motto is " let you be you . " It is a very inclusive sign . <p> What Astrology Does <p> Let 's keep in mind that astrology is only a tool to get at deeper issues . The purpose of astrology is as a tool to help us live life productively and happily , and to teach us to interact more effectively with others . Astrology is not an end in itself but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an especially good way to stimulate your creative thinking . What will the new age bring ? Everyone is curious about the next thousand years so let 's a look at the forecast . <p> What 's Next In The New Millennium Specifically <p> Before I begin , let me tell you where I gleaned much of this information . I have been reading futurist books , scanning the Web site of http : //www.abcnews.com , reading Wired magazine , and other technological and future-oriented publications . None , however , matched the information I gathered from a recent article entitled " 21 Ideas For The 21st Century " from the American publication , Business Week ( August 30 , 1999 double issue ) . I felt the material reported in that issue was vital . I have encapsulated many of the more interesting parts here so that we could look at the information in a new way , through the filter of astrology . Business Week editors felt , as I do , that the future expands in non-linear fashion , so using the present in order to leap forward into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options some evil , some wonderful but it will be up to us to control technology and use new inventions wisely . This is certainly a something mankind is capable of doing ! <p> Computers , Computers <p> Computers are already ubiquitous and they will become an even greater part of our lives . No surprise there , but what will stun us is how computers will effect everything we do . Scientists are now predicting that the Internet will form a kind of " earths skin " , creating the kind of environment that was represented in the recent movie called The Truman Show . Computers will run millions of wireless electronic devices , working in concert with one another . These devices will go anywhere and record and measure anything from water level to traffic flow , pollution or conversations of people on the street . There will be cameras , microphones , gauges , sensors , EKGs and electroencephalographs watching each city and its citizens , our environment , our bodies , our actions and our reactions . This is n't going to happen as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheer proliferation of these devises . This environment will evolve naturally around us . <p> " Imagine our ecosystem , " write the editors of Business Week , " with a million intelligent software agents that are much more potent than the agents or bots we have now on the Net to help us search for things . Add the voices of digital pets , electronic companions and Internet caretakers , stretch out a sensory telemetric fabric what you have is an electronic skin . " This " skin " presupposes these new supercomputers have both feeling and self-awareness , just like we do ourselves . <p> Humans And Machines Will Be Symbiotic <p> Now and probably for several years to come there will be no central intelligence to manage this organically grown network of computers . Futurists at Ernst &amp; Young consulting suggest that there will be 10,000 telemetric devices for every human on the planet by 2010 . Although there is no central intelligence on the Internet now , scientists think that eventually a certain self-awareness will emerge once the Net is enhanced with sensuality . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human brain . A symbiosis of human and machine will evolve . <p> But while that may seem a little scary , it will also allow millions of users at their computers to work in concert with workers around the world . Experts think that by 2010 , discrete , small microprocessors could be strung together like pearls on a necklace . The terminals could be embedded in devices like cell phones , and palmcorders , for we will not need tools like the big , bulky laptop computers we have now . The Internet will begin to function as neurons do in the human brain . <p> In an experiment going on now , hundreds of computer users are collaborating to help track the possible existence of life on other planets by downloading software from a central research lab and " listening " to deep space . This is a process that would be too big and too expensive for any one university or facility to accomplish with the same thoroughness on its own , but with many computer volunteers switching to a certain frequency around the world over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person who might pick up intelligent life " out there " will be immortalized in the annals of history , and although that might not be enough compensation for some people , apparently it is enough for the hundreds of others who chose to help these scientists . <p> The comparison of a vast telemetric network to a kind of electronic " skin " is a good one , because skin not only senses things but also protects and regulates our bodily functions . In this case , the earths electronic skin will help protect and regulate our environment . In as little as ten years , trillions of telemetric systems will keep us continually in touch and " speaking " to one another more quickly than we can react or think right now . Ironically , if you look up the words " sensitive skin " in a book of astrological keywords , the sign of Aquarius comes up as the ruler . ( See The Rulership Book by Rex Bills , published by the American Federation of Astrologers in Tempe , AZ USA ) . As ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle the earth and be able to track neighborhood crime through digital photography , too . During the O.J. Simpson trial satellite digital photography of Los Angeles was examined by police to see if they could find out where Simpsons white Bronco van was on the night of the crime . Technology was not yet ready to provide answers like these , but could in years ahead . Right now in New York City , in an effort to ticket drivers who run red lights in certain " high risk " Manhattan intersections , cars ( and their license plates ) are automatically photographed as they slip through red lights . The photographs are used as evidence and have proven very effective in stopping speeding and running red lights . In the future , robot photographers will be more prevalent , simply because this kind of photography is an effective crime preventative . <p> Will Computers Gang Up And Pit Man Against Machine ? Possibly . <p> Can this electronic skin become a kind of nightmare ? Maybe . In early simulation experiments where software agents acted as communication nodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clans . Sometimes those clans acted out in mischievous or destructive ways . Clans could even work in ways that are at cross-purposes to one another . Yet Aquarius is a sign that is socially responsible , so we should not be overly concerned about some kind of social insurrection . As the director of Sony Corporations Digital Creatures Lab stated in theBusiness Week article , " We will carefully design the machines so that it will help human beings , not harm them . " Networks will have some of the resilience and self-healing qualities that the human body does , too . When a computer on the Internet sees danger , like an approaching hurricane , earthquake or troublesome pattern in the worlds financial markets , it will alert people on the Net and suggest solutions . <p> A New Internet <p> There is more evidence of advanced communications between computers and computer networks . NASAs Jet Propulsion Lab in California is about to unveil a version of the Internet that will link the moon , Mars , asteroids and comets to the earths expanding nervous system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication is quite expensive between earth and unmanned probes . But through InterPlaNet those costs would drop and citizens of planet earth will be engaged and informed more effectively . Aquarius is a communicative and objective sign , so it is not surprising that the Age of Aquarius will expand our understanding of what is a network and how far our " phone lines " can reach . With InterPlaNet , even ET could phone home and not worry about the bill ! <p> Quantum Computers <p> There are other interesting developments involving computers on the horizon . Computers we have today are quite linear in their logic , and rather plodding in their ability to search thorough large batches of data . Quantum computers , available in about 20 years , will be able to work with probability algorithms to find answers to complex problems quickly , rather than in the ( comparitively ) slow , step-by-step way they do now . Today , computers can only see a listing which contains a 1 or a 0 . However , a quantum computer can check all listings at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of switches to build complex probability models . Will this make it easier for hackers to get into a system ? Yes , that is one of the downsides of this type of system . Even so , the advantages of quantum computers far outweigh their drawbacks . Engineers will have to figure out ways to build enough barbed wire to keep those hackers out . <p> Using The Internet For Hardware Downloads Not Just Software ! <p> These days , the Internet provides us with an easy way to acquire software , but get this , in the future , we will be able to download hardware too ! Nanotechnology , the science of construction of technology smaller than a billionth of a meter , will make this a reality . In twenty years , you may be able to download a blueprint for a personal computer , cell phone , beeper , or even a semi conductor . You could then use these plans to create products out of molecules by yourself , or the products themselves could actually be so tiny and microscopic , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point matter will become software , too . This gives a whole new meaning to manufacturing and will have a huge impact on the economy , when not as many factories are needed . <p> Uranus And Product Customization <p> Uranus , the planet ruling Aquarius is considered " the great synthesizer " because it combines elements of what we already know to create something we 've never seen before . It does this by using intuition and wisdom . For that reason , Uranus is considered " the higher octave of Mercury " . Mercury is the planet of thinking , but Uranus is the planet of innovation . Uranus likes customization too , and customization is a key word for the next century as you already know . Even now you are able to buy jeans that have been custom made to your precise measurements , as recorded in your department stores computer . In the future , far more will be customized , from furniture to shoes to textbooks . Retailers will be able to keep less in stock and so have less money tied up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so printers who publish on the Internet can avoid spending money on ink and paper . This should be a real boon to the economy . Computers may widely replace telephone customer service representatives and be quite helpful , thanks to artificial intelligence . It may become hard to tell if one is on the phone with a human or not . This may inspire some people to be rude in an attempt to make the representative angry . If these attempts are successful , the customer will know if the " person " on the other end of the phone is man or machine ! Having been on hold all day today myself , I do n't  doubt people will be driven to distraction . <p> How About Implanting A Chip In Your Brain ? <p> By mid-century , humans will have the option to expand the capability of their minds by having silicon chips implanted in their brains . Do n't  laugh this is almost a sure thing ! Scientists speak of imbedding chips in the human body to build super-human athletic ability too . Even food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to " eat " your favorite foods over and over without gaining weight ! Virtual reality will be developed so smartly that it will be indistinguishable from actual reality . It will become less important to travel physically , whether for meetings , your college reunion , or for the pleasure of experiencing a new place , like the Great Wall of China or on a tour of the White House . You will have the choice between going to the real thing and taking a look at it " virtually " . If your presence is required in an actual place , holograms could make your attendance possible , making your companions feel like you 've just " beamed down " from the Star Ship Enterprise ! <p> Some scientists feel that eventually ( around 2099 ) only a small percentage of us will choose to " keep " our bodies , preferring instead to transfer our minds into circuit boards and attain immortality . Yes , that 's right . By 2050 people will have the option to leave our physical bodies permanently in order to convert ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can run forever . It is true that some of these developments mimic Sci-Fi movies to an eerie degree . Is leaving your body forever and imbedding yourself into a chip a tad too radical for your taste ? No problem , there are alternatives to consider . <p> The movie Strange Days came out a few years ago starring Ralph Fiennes . In this movie , the characters could experience the emotions of others by using a special headset that jacked in to tapes that recorded specific emotional situations that people had actually gone through . They could experience someone elses love affair , exhilaration , or even fear . Through this device the characters could go on " trips " and live the memories and actions of other people . When I saw the movie a few years ago , I thought it was an intriguing idea , but still pretty fantastic . That 's how much I knew . In the future , you will be able to document everything you feel , experience , think , say , hear , read , write or do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute of your life . A machine that tracks your nervous systems electrical activity would collect the data patterns that comprise your thoughts and emotions . A computer will automatically index your lifes experiences and make them into a searchable data file that becomes the story of your life . <p> If you think this is too far-fetched , check out the work of ET Laboratories PLC in England . These scientists call their special computer the " Soul Catcher . " To accomplish the data entry , you must wear a computer all over your body . Electrodes will even be embedded in your head under your hair , on your hands , legs and so forth . According to Business Week editors ( and this is a direct quote concerning the Soul Catcher ) : " Researchers can only wonder what it will be like to wake up one day and find yourself alive inside a machine . " <p> Does your spine tingle and are you shifting in your chair , uneasy at the thought of this ? Me too . Let 's look at other developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more . In 1997 , researchers at Carnegie Mellon University created what they call " Synthetic Interviews . " The first " interview " they have gotten ready to present is with Albert Einstein . In order to learn about Einsteins life and theories , you start ( what appears to be ) an interactive video interview with the great scientist . On the hard drive of the computer is a bank of 500 recorded interviews with Albert Einstein from which the computer draws a portion of one interview to answer your question . The operations to accomplish this are so transparent that you feel like you can actually have a conversation with Albert Einstein one-on-one . Software that digitizes your speech will help the computer understand your question and a powerful search engine will select ( and rank ) the results . The technology is n't quite complete yet , but artificial intelligence like this is advancing by leaps and bounds . Do n't  be surprised when AI shows up in your neighborhood in a few decades from now . If we are able to ask Albert Einstein questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same with you long after you 've passed on to a better place . <p> People Like Machines And Machines Like People <p> If people are destined to become more like machines , make no mistake , machines are rapidly becoming more like people . Aquarius is a sign known to turns things upside down and inside out . Just when you thought you knew what was coming , this sign throws you a curve a new brainstorm . Perhaps one of the most exciting kinds of computers to be developed to date is the supercomputer , a machine so intelligent that it will surpass the ability of the human brain . Problems beyond the ability of our most brilliant scientists will someday be tackled and solved by machines . This will empower humanity and give us a big edge as we try and meet our greatest challenges . This is very good news ! <p> While some scientists fear that the megacomputers they create could become hostile to their creators an actual Frankenstein monster other scientists believe that these computers can be programmed to respect human life . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus wo n't have any of the hidden agendas and political instincts that some humans possess . Robot technology will go much further . In only twenty-five years , farms and factories will replace human workers with these computerized workers , freeing up their human workers for more interesting tasks . Some factories and farms have already done this on a large scale . <p> Medicine : Regeneration Of Body Parts <p> Medicine will advance enormously . Eventually doctors will be able to grow body parts for people who are i 'll or who were born with birth defects . I can see you are distrustful of this possibility and I was too until I saw a report about this process recently on a top rated television news show . Scientists , using genetic engineering with pieces of DNA code , have been able to grow missing body parts ( they showed a nose ) in a petri dish . This technology is in its infancy , so stay tuned . Deaf people will be fitted with special computer chips in their heads so they can regain the ability to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive . Watch for this procedure to become more affordable ( and more frequent ) . On the other hand , scientists tell us that if we do n't  use all the parts we have on our body now , those parts may be reduced or eliminated during the course of evolution , much like an ostrichs wings . Use it or lose it will take on new meaning ! We had better start going to the gym too , because sitting at computers all day long is making us a global population of unfit people . <p> Soon it will be possible to treat diseases before they occur . Fine-tuned genetic testing will predict our predisposition to a particular disease and we can take steps to never get sick . On the down side , you may see insurance companies insisting a person be treated for a disease he or she does n't  have yet . This is already happening , in cases where people take an aspirin each day to prevent heart disease , for example . One can imagine taking pills for years on end in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ancient discipline of Homeopathic medicine will also keep developing and more of us will use certain herbs and alternative remedies for disease prevention , too . ( Pluto in Scorpio paved the way for this in the 1980s . ) <p> The social debates surrounding organ transplants will continue to heat up as we have greater access to genetic information . Who will get the new heart or liver , the 12-year-old girl with a learning disability or the 70-year-old nuclear physicist ? How society will answer these challenging questions will be anyones guess . Socially , plastic surgery will be so prevalent that if one chooses to " go natural " , one could find his or herself the butt of harsh jokes . The movie Gattica which starred Ethan Hawke and Uma Thuman , demonstrated that this emphasis on perfection could grow into something absurd . Can you imagine the talk at the office water cooler ? It might go something like this : " I have no idea why she never bothered to have her nose fixed/face lifted/thighs lyposuctioned ( whatever ) because she certainly has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Cruel ! <p> Going au natural ( no breast implants , no tummy tucks ! ) could be a reactionary outgrowth of the trend for seeking physical perfection through surgery , because Aquarius can take an extreme position on any side of an issue . On the other hand , Aquarius likes technology and feels it should be used , so people in the Age of Aquarius will want to tap into what 's new and available . There are some developments that might be downright humorous , though , such as a microwave oven that refuses to cook a fattening lunch or a refrigerator with a time lock that wont allow its door to open until dinner time . <p> The Cost Of Good Health To Society <p> Economics will continue to play a big part in health care . As we have seen by the end of this century , state of the art health care costs a pretty penny to provide , and those costs are not liable to go down . Insurance companies could get even more powerful , causing lawmakers to have to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care has triggered a torrent of controversy . One insurance company recently announced a patient would have to call the company for permission before calling an ambulance to be rushed to the hospital . Approval of the team care clerk ( a fancy word for a cost adjuster ) is required before the patient would have the go-ahead to proceed to the emergency room . If a patient goes without permission the insurance company wont pay . Many people feel the term " managed care " is simply a euphemism for " managed costs " a benefit to only the insurance company , regardless of the patients needs . Unfortunately that has been true in some cases in America . Not all change will be good , but hopefully , responsible leaders will turn those conditions around into something more reasonable and workable . <p> Time Changes <p> Aquarius also rules the concept of time , so how we treat time or think of time will change dramatically . With world travel so prevalent , we wo n't think of a " day " in the same terms . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia , a " day " is whatever 24-hour time span you designate it to be for billing purposes . This hotel receives guests from all over the world all day long . As we all work at different times , some of us will want to get a manicure at 2 AM or hit the gym at 3:30 AM . New York may be the city that never sleeps , but others are on the way even in the suburbs . <p> Cities Will Prosper <p> The 1950s-era promise of a suburban paradise has not been fulfilled . Traffic and suburban sprawl have left whole communities disillusioned by their low quality of life . Cities will again become attractive places for families to live , allowing for more economical usage of resources like land , electricity , gas and other utilities . Aquarius rules cities , not rural or suburban locations . <p> Working parents will find city life more attractive , because it allows for shorter commutes and more hours with their little ones at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and as senior citizens age , cities provide access to friendships , activities , home care and health care without the bother of driving . <p> Endangered Species <p> The list of species on the endangered list will continue to grow and this will become a more important global issue than it is today . As our rain forests become depleted , as certain species cease to exist , and as the hole in our ozone layer opens wider , it will become evident that humanity , as custodians of planet earth , must do something . Caring for planet earth will always be under the domain of Aquarius . Aquarius is the sign the ancient astrologers wisely believed was most sensitive and best qualified for improving life on the planet . So watch for great strides to be made in environmental protection during the Age of Aquarius . <p> Business <p> Going , Going , Gone The Middleman <p> Agents , distributors , and brokers middlemen are rapidly disappearing from many business models used today . Consumers can often go directly to the source of whatever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . The Internet is a very Aquarian concept as it exists today , because Aquarius believes that information should be free . Agents have traditionally granted access to the top echelon , but on the Internet there is no need for agents . Soon , the only agents that will exist are the robotic kind that go and seek out information for you can come back with the answer . On the Internet everyone has the most valuable resource access to everyone else . Those who ca n't or wont negotiate will need representatives of course , but the nature of the agent role will change . With the ease of email , an artist can just as easily get in touch with a long list of contacts himself or herself , at the touch of a keystroke . <p> The idea that talent is rare forms the basis of intellectual property rights . Scarce resources like paper , ink , or an editors time should be allocated carefully toward the author who could yield the greatest profit or do the greatest good . Photographers who used to get big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees from a great many clients . Will they come out ahead ? Some will , some wont , but bucking the trend will prove fruitless . Some artwork or music will be given away free and later earn the creator a profit in concert ticket sales or a big book contract another twist on the Aquarius idea of one for all and all for one . <p> Hedging Risk Will Allow Many To Follow Their Bliss <p> The editors at Business Week suggested in their article that the downside of business risk will be " hedged " with a kind of insurance that lowers how much you risk losing when you follow your biggest dreams . If we all were less fearful of taking a chance , the world would be so much richer for it . Imagine if people were able to write the books , compose the music or start the businesses that they always dreamed of ! This kind of insurance would encourage people to think big . An individual , family , group or even a country will be able to hedge their bets by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Teams Rule ! Down With Dictators ! <p> The form of leadership driving big corporations will change , too . Gone are the days when an ego-driven leader will rule the roost teams will be in charge . Progress will be a group effort born of shared knowledge and pooled expertise . After all , Aquarius is not like Leo or Aries , signs that like to rule Aquarius is the egalitarian sign of groups and encourages a democratic voice for one and all . Instead of a dictator at the helm of the corporate ship the model will be more akin to that of a beehive with bees working side by side . Leaders of the future must be democratic decision-makers . Employee-owned companies are a very Aquarian concept as well . <p> The Trend Toward Working At Home <p> The boom of telecommuting and working at home is only a fraction as large as it will eventually become . Aquarius is a highly technical sign . The average person will have to possess a solid working knowledge of computers or risk being left unable to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who know and those who do n't  know how to get these things done will represent the new " haves " and " have-nots " . This will widen the gap between rich and poor and give new meaning to the phrase " knowledge is power . " <p> More Nations On Earth <p> Experts feel it is very possible that there will be more nations in the world as time goes by . Regions of existing countries will break away and become independent nations . This is because self rule is very important to the sign of Aquarius . In 1950 there were 58 nations in the UN but now there are 158 . Can we see a world where New York City becomes a nation ? Maybe not , but what about Quebec ? Kosovo ? Palestine ? Northern Basque ? St. Kits and St. Nevis ? The Ogoni tribeland in Nigeria ? Northern Italy ? Will republican Australia secede from the commonwealth ? The Internet and a global economy , which were supposed to bring people together , will allow people to express their individuality too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individuality . <p> Marriage And Sex <p> Marriage will change , for the institution of marriage began in agricultural cultures where plenty of hands were needed to till the fields and gather the harvest . The infant mortality rate was high then and life expectancy was short , so women needed to bear as many children as possible so that their offspring could help with the farm work . The wife of the farmer was dependent on her husband for sustenance and protection . In our industrial society , women are educated and capable of making a living on their own . A woman is not normally dependent on her husband for food and shelter and will choose to marry based on love . She is far less likely than ever before to stay in an unhappy marriage . Men , too , do not require a wife or offspring in order to keep their businesses and homes operational . The rising divorce rate can be seen in this positive light : men and women no longer have to stay in bad marriages if they choose not to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions change and make breaking free either unattractive financially or temporarily impossible . Any institution that bases its success on the weakness of one group of participants does not have a strong of a chance of success . Aquarius tends to be a bachelor sign for it prizes independence . If marriage survives and thrives as an institution , it will certainly have to change . If a couple does choose to marry , they may want to do so much later in life . Pre-nuptial agreements will become commonplace as women have more property to protect and courts will uphold those pre-nuptial agreements , something that has not always been the case . <p> Few people will marry without a lawyer at their side , a clean bill of health , and a credit check of their future spouse . This is especially true of the generations of children whove witnessed the breakup of their own parents marriages . Is this a bad thing ? Not at all . While it sounds unromantic , it will cut down on sadness later . Fewer people will marry for money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for true love . In an odd way , all these conditions will allow love more freedom than ever before , because people will choose their partners without the constraints that have held them back in the past . Free at last , true love can bloom . <p> In a recent television report on ABC News ( www.abcnews.com ) , futurists suggested that sex , in the sense of making love , could be separated from the function of procreation in the future . Sex , they predicted , will be for recreation alone . Creating a healthy child is way too risky for simple lovemaking . Good grief ! I 'll take my baby-making the old-fashioned way , thank you . <p> This brings up the issues concerning DNA , " designer genes , " and cloning issues . Society will have to determine once and for all how to define a human being , how to define death ( sure to become even harder ) , and how to define birth . The debate over abortion will get even more intense as science sails us unto these totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but will invest more in those children , by giving them a better education and more support . Society will benefit from the attention these parents lavish on their children . <p> Origins Of Life <p> We have come so far , but other questions persist . What is the origin of life ? Certainly in the next few years ( let alone another millennium ) scientists will show us amazing discoveries about the origin of life on earth and elsewhere in our solar system . Recently a meteor landed in Texas , and when it was cracked open , traces of water were found inside . Scientists now believe that anywhere one finds water and heat one may find signs of life . <p> In 1966 , Russian and British scientists found a huge fresh water lake buried under a two-mile deep ice sheet in Antarctica . The depth of the lake was measured at 1,650 feet . The pressure over it kept it fluid , even though the temperature of the water was few degrees below freezing . The water in it is thought to be over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbes that can live without sunlight . Some of these species of microbes could be eons old . A lake like this could tell us much about the origins of life . <p> Related to this , the Age of Aquarius will inspire us to question what constitutes a human being ? How do we define the soul ? What is a living person ? These become practical questions when you consider something like cloning science . Cloning may someday help parents who have been unable to conceive the child they always dreamed of . Will they be raising a little copy of themselves ? No . Astrology shows that you are not simply a mass of DNA but also part of a social order that involves the time and place of your birth . Since everyones birth chart is unique . Even if you can clone the body , the mind and spirit would be vastly different and individual . Astrologically we know that a individuals personality is influenced by the time and location of his or her birth , for that is how his or her chart is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a different time or place he or she will have a new chart making this person different and special . <p> In Conclusion <p> I have come to the end of my predictions but could have listed many more . I have chosen some of the best and most exciting ones to report to you . There are so many more inventions coming ! Cars will drive themselves to pick you up after work . New forms of education will be developed and charter schools could replace public education . Political campaigning will change as politicians use the Internet for polling . The list goes on . I hope I have turned you on to the future and that you are not one bit fearful of what 's to come . I gobble up any tidbit of information about our brave new world . The concepts being discussed are too delicious not to sink my teeth into . Hopefully , you feel the same way ! <p> An eternal optimist , I believe deeply in the goodness of people everywhere . I feel that when the chips are down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped toward the side of the angels . We are the earths consciousness , and it is up to us to steer the future in the proper direction . We will do that . <p> Finally , Religion <p> Religion will survive . I firmly believe we go through these various ages to expand our knowledge and experience , not to discard what we have gone through as we move on to the next thing . The Age of Pisces has been a powerful building block upon which to stand . Hopefully , if we stand high enough we can reach the sky and discover true wisdom , but that does require that we keep building upon what we have learned . <p> If we lose our spirituality we will have learned nothing from the Age of Pisces . Many scientists say to me that the closer you get to mathematicians and physics the closer you come to God and the underpinnings of our beautifully , magically constructed universe . Our world is ever fascinating , but complete understanding of it is always just out of our reach . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earths collective consciousness ? It is not , as I see it , a question of spirituality OR science but a question of blending the two . Science will bring up more questions than answers , and if we are to solve them , we will need to rely on the ethical , moral and religious judgements that we make individually . These are the conclusions we draw after a sleepless night , in the quiet pre-dawn hours when we lie awake and meet our true souls . If we are going to be able to live with ourselves , we must find those answers , even if it means pulling those solutions from the bottom of our hearts , and we must bravely state what we stand for out loud . There is a reason we came from the Age of Pisces , so let 's hold on to the treasures and mysteries of faith it gave us.

@@12610059 @1210059/ <h> Share @qwx196169 @qwx196170 <p> In last months report , I mentioned a list of things not to do when Venus is retrograde , such as not to have plastic surgery , not to institute radical change to your hair style or color , and not to give a big , lavish party or charity benefit . In the latter case , the donations are likely to be small . ( You can always read the previous months forecast on my site , by clicking on the box that says View Previous Month . On my app , whether you have my free or premium version , you can see the previous month by swiping to the left . ) <p> The second problem with this full moon , April 10 , is that your ruling planet , Uranus , will be directly opposed to this full moon at a 180-degree angle across the skies , considered a confrontational aspect . I will admit sometimes an opposition denotes completion , such as when you put two halves of an apple together to form a whole . It seems less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say that for sure , because Uranus is the planet of unexpected developments . You never know what will happen when Uranus is involved , and trying to guess is always pointless . Uranus tends to strike suddenly , like lightning , so I feel this would not be the best time to travel on an important long trip . Yet on one hand , it could be the trip of a lifetime , but then again , Uranus might suddenly distract you when something happens in another part of life , on the sidelines , and needs your involvement to fix it . <p> One of your sweetest times of the month will be when Mars enters fellow air-sign Gemini on April 21 , to stay until June 4 . In Gemini , Mars will light your house of true love , fun , and leisure , heralding a fantastically happy time . <p> Still , a full moon in Libra is usually very positive for you , Aquarius , because Libra is an air sign like your Aquarius Sun . The energies of this full moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this full moon will be memorable and supportive . <p> The ninth house where this full moon will fall rules other things too , so if you are not traveling or working on an international project , then you may be dealing with an immigration matter , a publishing or broadcasting matter , a legal action , or a topic having to do with academia and your goal to get an advanced degree ( or teach on the college level ) . In any of these areas , the same mystery comes up , and the question will be , is this full moon set to be helpful or will there be a jarring event that suddenly steals your attention ? That is the question . <p> I feel we never have to brace for good news , which possible now , but we do have to think ahead when we see a possibly tough aspect coming up and prepare as best we can . I would say the only way to prepare is to keep your schedule light so you can make last minute changes . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting April 9 until May 3 .

Astrologers call Mercury , Mars , and Venus the personal planets , for they tend to have a very personal effect on us all .

Socializing will bring a nice balance to your busy life in March , dear Cancer . On March 27 , Mars and Neptune will align , and bring all sorts of exciting experiences by traveling .

This is quite a complex full moon with all kinds of contradictions . Its good that Jupiter is in your house of home , protecting your parents , so do n't  freak out reading this . <p> You will have one other positive aspect from Saturn on the full moon , April 10 . Saturn , from his perch in your solar sixth house of work projects , will rush in to help you , as he is in the perfect place in the sky ( mathematically ) to offer a stabilizing effect on your career reputation and help you keep the ship from rocking in regard to your team , a subordinate , or a project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consideration . ) Your ruler is the moon , so you will feel this full moon directly , and the moon will be temporarily under siege by Uranus but helped by Jupiter and Saturn .

Now I will explain which planets I was referring to when I said that . Venus is still retrograde , a holdover from last month , when Venus first went retrograde March 5 in your house of prestigious career matters . Venus will continue to retrograde until April 15 .

To be clear , you can continue to do normal grooming trims and hair touch-ups are fine , but make no dramatic , radical changes until May , ideally after May 18 . <p> Venus is the icing on the cake of life , for this graceful planet rules all that beautifies and embellishes , but when Venus retrogrades , you go to a more no-nonsense , Spartan mode . Venus rules expensive jewelry , flowers , wine , perfume , parties , love , and affection . It might not be the best idea to buy an expensive diamond or emerald ring , for example , or to have a lavish charity benefit .

The recent eclipse of February 26 will be still exerting a very strong influence in March and will continue to do so in months ahead . You may be hearing of a new position with better salary , or a side job you can start immediately . Something seems to be bubbling up for you because that new moon solar eclipse was in Pisces , 8 degrees , conjunct Neptune , in your second house of earned income . Neptunes presence suggests that you will be encouraged to add quite a bit of your creativity and style to the project . This sounds like the position or side work will be just up your alley . <p> If you are self-employed , plenty of new business will come in and you might also be able to gently raise your prices for your goods or services . If you are employed by others , it is vital that you ask for a raise in the first week of March soon ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raise approved , but you must act immediately . <p> If you are not involved with the arts or part of the support staff that works with artists , actors , musicians , and other creative people , Neptunes presence would not be a positive but a drawback . Neptunes presence in your case could suggest a bit of confusion about the assignment you will be asked to do and the compensation you will receive . Neptune is known , under certain circumstances , to fog details . It is one of the best planets to help you create original ideas or help the ideas of others get produced , but when you mix Neptune , the planet of dreams and imagination , with a subject that is mainly about cold hard facts , figures , and money , Neptune can easily spin its pretty soft mist over everything , obscure reality , and make you misunderstand what is being said or written .

( By this point , I feel that I could practically pass the Bar . ) Later , if you have to defend to the client the reason behind the rewording of a clause , you will have already discussed it with your lawyer and will be familiar with why the change is justified . I always feel if I ca n't look at the other party in the eye and say that this is fair to both of us , then I do n't  have any right asking for a change in the first place . I never hide behind my lawyer I do the negotiating . This month , with the possibility that Neptune will create an atmosphere of smoke and mirrors if you are dealing with money matters , it will be important that you be present and involved at the table too . <p> There is another reason that this month , you must keep your thinking cap on . Venus will go retrograde from March 4 to April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength by May 18 . Venus is known to govern love and beauty , but it also rules profits . In the case of Aquarius , Venus happens to rule two houses of your chart : your legal ninth house and your fourth house of home and property . You see why I want you to have a good lawyer at your side . The ninth house covers the court system , legal actions , settlements , and so forth , with the eighth house involved too . ( The eighth house is called the financial house of other peoples money , ruling loans , inheritance , commissions , bonus , insurance payouts , credit cards , student loans , child support , and the like . ) <p> You have a very active eighth house , for you have a full moon there on March 12 .

Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by setting up obstacles . Saturn is in your eleventh house of friendships / events / groups and clubs / hopes and wishes .

( Tell me how you manage to do it ! ) You get the idea expensive pleasures might have to wait a little while . ( Gee , your list sounds so good . ) <p> You may have a bigger goal in mind , such as to pay tuition for college , buy a house , pay a bit more for taxes , send in your check for health care , or to take good care of your newborn baby . Those types of expenses would take precedence over other spending on luxuries . <p> If someone were to find all your bills and credit card statements for any year , and see the checks you paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Money is really nothing more than stored energy . You are paid for work you do and it translates into cash , and how you direct that cash says a great deal about what is most important to you .

Saturn will be in hard angle to Mercury , so again , I will ask you to hold off signing papers you consider vital for a while . If you must , then do it in the first week of March , if that works for you .

Throw a curve to a Mutable sign and they can turn on a dime , coming up with solutions faster than you can bat an eye . Mutable signs are restless and embrace change . They are the most resourceful of all the signs , and thus , they make much from little . They are highly detail-oriented , but should take care not to get so wound up in tiny particulars that they lose sight of the whole . <p> Gemini : Mutable quality , Air element : Geminis need for stimulation can not be overstated . Highly intellectual , Gemini needs news and information like oxygen . Being an Air sign , Gemini enjoys the exchange of ideas with othersthis is no loner .

Gemini can change their position as quickly as they assimilate new information , remaining at all times objective . Geminis downfall ? Their adeptness at handling several things at once can lead them to assume too much responsibility . At that point they can become scattered or begin to procrastinate . If they stay focused , they can accomplish more in a day than most of us do in a week . <p> Virgo : Mutable quality , Earth element : Virgo is more practical than Gemini and just as intelligent .

Do n't  tell a Virgo to relax and chill out , for most members of this sign have not quite mastered that ability . They feel badly if they waste time . Being an Earth sign , their powers of organization are amazing and its this skill which gets Virgo tangible results they can measure , compare , assess and perfect ( a Virgo word if there ever was one ) . But Virgo is n't rigidfar from it . Virgos Mutability allows for a willing flexibility and razor-sharp course corrections mid-way , an asset Virgo keeps hidden up their laundered and starched white sleeve . <p> Sagittarius : Mutable quality , Fire element : Sagittarius expresses its hefty intellect in the realms of philosophy and spirituality .

For a fun time , they listen to National Public Radio and watch Meet the Press . Keeping up with this high octane Mutable/Fire sign is hard , but well worth the effort . <p> Pisces : Mutable quality , Water element : Pisces use their Mutable nature to explore and adjust to the feelings ( Waters domain ) of others around them .

If you do n't  , your Pisces will be in a perpetual state of anxiety over your condition . One last word : show appreciation to your Pisces .

This can be a hot aspect because Mars is all about action and energy and Uranus is about experiencing all things unexpected .

That 's why you must act quickly . <p> Mars will change signs too this month , but not until- September 27 . All year , since March 5 , Mars was in Sagittarius , and retrograded back into Scorpio from May 27 to August 2 . Then Mars moved back into Sagittarius on August 2 where Mars remained to this day , and in that time has put an enormous amount of focus on your career to the exclusion of so many other parts of life . <p> Mars was retrograde from mid-April through June and hampered your progress . You still made advances , but the process was arduous . If you still want to make a name for yourself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send out your proposals while Mars tours Sagittarius , until- September 27 .

You will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to a friend you have now . <p> You would be wise to circulate , for Mars is the natural ruler of your earned income sector , so mixing and mingling will have a direct link to your ability to increase your earned income .

Instead , you will learn more by socializing and you may enjoy the process so much more .

That is a highly stressful vibration for relationships and for health . This month you may feel you can live with each other but that you cant quite live without each other either . You seem to have been doing a lot of collaborations all year , and so you 've had only partial control over events . The good news is that control is slowly beginning to shift back to you . The usual time Mars spends in a sign is six weeks , not the lions share of a year , as you have had , so happily , future trends brought on by Mars will be shorter . <p> You will continue to have teacher-planet Saturn in the partnership / commitment marriage seventh house sector of your chart until December 2017 , giving you time to think about the kind of partner that would be best for you .

Fortunately , Mars will be back to normal after November 9 . <p> Throughout September , Mercury will be retrograde , a trend that officially began August 30 and will end on September 22 . If your machines have been acting up , and you either quickly bought a new model or had to have the one you own fixed , join the club we are all feeling Mercury retrograde . You will feel Mercury retrograde in your home sector , so if you 're doing a renovation , keep in close touch with the workers , and be sure any overruns require your signature . <p> I have been feeling Mercury retrograde too , as this is one aspect that affects everyone uniformly , no matter what the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an enormous POP sound , and my air conditioner was sounding terribly idiosyncratic as it rattled loudly .

We all feel impending Mercury retrograde several weeks before its turnaround date . Both my TV and air conditioner were only five years old , and oddly , I had bought both around the same time . Mercury sends in his gremlins at this time . If you had the same problem or will in the coming weeks you will know why . We are together on this ! <p> Quite simply , you will be the most favored of all signs to find romantic love in the coming thirteen months . <p> Geminis ruling planet is Mercury , so you tend to feel the Mercury retrograde periods more than most , the exception being Virgo , a sign you share with Mercury , as there are only eight planets to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch new ventures with Mercury retrograde because you become somewhat distracted or forgetful during these phases . Judgment become impaired , and given that the very presence of Mercury retrograde means that things are in flux , if you rely on a previous set of priorities that you set up before the Mercury retrograde , you will find that they no longer are relevant . <p> It is also not an ideal time to buy electronics during the retrograde . Last time the retrograde came by I begged a friend not to buy a car , which she needed desperately . She wound up renting a car for a few weeks until the retrograde as over she has four children , and she wanted to be sure her new car was safe and in ideal working position . <p> Now let 's backtrack up the month a little bit to September 9 , a big date , when Jupiter , the good fortune planet , will leave Virgo and move into Libra and your house of true love for thirteen months , until October 10 , 2017 . Quite simply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness in romantic love in the coming thirteen months .

You may decide to have a baby this year , or you may do something special for the children you have now . You may save up for special lessons they need or save up for a camp experience for your child next summer . <p> Keep in mind that the fifth house , where Jupiter is based , also rules your creative efforts , so you may decide to tackle a major creative effort this year . If so , it is likely to be a success now that you have Jupiter behind you , for whenever Jupiter arrives in a certain part of a chart , he brings money and expansion with him . This is such good news ! <p> The luckiest days of 2016 , September 25-26 ( bridging two days ) , will show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love .

You can also debut an app , for anything having to do with communication or travel will be exceptionally favored . <p> The very same area will again be underscored at the new moon , September 30 , and that will be your favorite new moon of 2016 . It will fall in Libra , so all of the emphasis on love will be reinforced . There wont be another month like this in your life every aspect will work together to make you happy , dear Gemini .

The new moon will fall in your fifth use of love , and because the new moon is in the marriage sign of Libra , you will meet substantial , marriageable types . If you are interested in setting up a business partnership or important one-on-one collaboration , seal the deal on September 25 or 26 , or quickly after the new moon September 30.

You can talk and plan now , however , but do n't  etch anything in stone just yet . ) <p> In a different manifestation of the full moons energies December 13 , it may be that your sweetheart or spouse is under strong and unusual pressures or going through a crisis , and that you will instantly want to help your partner get through it in a significant way . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through the hard time and need emotional support from your significant other . <p> Full moons almost force us to make choices , and after we do , we move forward to a bright future . I do n't  think you will find out something about your partner that makes you want to break up , but in the unlikely case you do , realize that this full moon is your friend , and is working to protect you . <p> Mars will move out of Aquarius on December 19 and into Pisces until January 27 , a time when you will be spending more money than usual . Perhaps you have prepared for this , and say , are sending in your college tuition payment , are taking an awe-inspiring trip , or leasing a new car and have plenty of expenses associated with doing that . These are just a few examples . If you have no plans to spend quite a bit more money than usual , then you may want to be a tiny bit more careful in spending for holiday gifts , keeping track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end on January 27 . <p> The holidays will be quite glorious this year . First , before I tell you about the confetti that will shower you this year , and I will say that Christmas and Hanukkah will fall on the same day this year , and Kwanzaa will fall the following day , December 26 . <p> Something exceptional is happening on December 24 , when Saturn , your ancient ruler , will be in exquisite trine relationship to Uranus , your modern ruler . The job of Uranus is to suddenly tear down or sweep away anything it deems of no future value . It is the planet of genius , innovation , creativity , disruption , and unexpected , idiosyncratic style . Because this is your ruler , you are this way , too . Uranus helps us see into the future you have this ability , for you see trends years before the rest of society sees them . <p> You can never predict what Uranus will do , for he is impulsive , but this month and over the entire coming year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in personality . Saturn stabilizes all it touches , for Saturns job is to build and brings reward through patience and hard work . <p> This is the first meeting of Uranus and Saturn , December 24 . Two more are to come , May 18 and November 11 , 2017 . These planets move very slowly , as they are outer planets that inch across the sky . This means they do n't  have to be in exact mathematical aspect ( like on those days listed ) to benefit . They will be what astrologers call within orb , and that means the two planets will be close enough to send you their goodies , and that you would notice their support . This is an aspect of hope and optimism , and will color all of 2017 . <p> It is especially great news for you , dear Aquarius , for when your two rulers are friendly , you tend to do very well indeed . Said simply , you will make changes in the coming weeks and months , and Saturn will be on hand to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which to build your dreams . <p> If your birthday falls on February 10 , plus or minus five days , you will feel this full moon more than other members of your sign . The same would be true if you have Aquarius rising , the natal moon in Aquarius , or a natal planet in Aquarius , Gemini , Libra , Aries , Leo , or Sagittarius , at 22 degrees , plus or minus five degrees . In any of these circumstances , you will find a way to make the full moon benefit you in a very substantial way . <p> Now let 's get to December 25 , because I am bursting with excitement to tell you about what the universe has cooked up for you . Venus will receive messages from three dignitaries : Jupiter , Uranus , and Saturn , and in each case , Venus will have a separate , private conversation , and in regard to Venus , all three planets will be outstandingly harmonious . This is remarkable . Venus is the natural ruler of TWO of your solar houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth house of international relationships and travel , among other things . Wow ! Let me explain . <p> When , on December 25 , Jupiter will communicate Venus , all the areas ruled by the ninth house will light up for you international travel and distant travel within your own country . It rules import-export of ideas , goods , and services , as well as international relationships , visa , green card , and citizenship . Also covered are publishing , broadcasting , and the Internet , as well as the actions you take to attain a college or graduate school degree . Finally , this house also rules the dogma of religion , spirituality , and philosophy . <p> The most common way Venus will exert her influence will be in international or distant travel . You might travel for the holiday , or you may be entertaining visitors to your city at a beautiful dinner in a festive restaurant , or even host out of town guests at your home , possibly offering them your guest room . The beauty of this day will be felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the excitement mounting . <p> Uranus , your ruler , will meet with Venus too on December 25 , adding the element of delicious surprise . Venus and Uranus together will bubble up conversation , flirtatiousness , and romance , so you may be pulled under the mistletoe more than once . <p> Saturns friendly warmth toward Venus on the same day , December 25 , will make sure that promises made will be promises kept . Love becomes deeper through the experience of this day . <p> Not to be outdone , the Sun will receive positive signals from Mars the following day , December 26 , and the result might be that you receive a valuable gift , cash , or gift card . This aspect has a plus or minus one day . <p> In a month so chock-full of aspects , you might think that after December 26 , things will quiet down , but no , there are some important aspects still to come that represent wonderful news . An important one for you , Aquarius , will be the one on December 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on December 29 after having been retrograde since July 29 , a period of five months . This is a monumental development , for in the many days surrounding December 29 , you will see that something dearly important to you is about to push forward . <p> Think back to the end of July or in August , when you may have had to do a bit of backtracking to improve a project , a relationship , a plan , or your strategy . Re-dos are common when a big planet like Uranus turns , especially when it is your ruler , and that was at the end of July . Now you have the green light to go full steam ahead . The turn of Uranus direct will make everyone happy , but most of all you . 
@@12610146 @1210146/ <h> Cardinal <h> Share <h> Qualities of the Cardinal Signs : <p> Aries , Cancer , Libra and Capricorn <p> As the " scout signs " which generate the seasons , cardinal signs govern creativity . These signs are restless , active , self-motivated , ambitious , and they often are the leaders in their communities . They can be a bit domineering , but that comes part and parcel with their best qualities of being enterprising , independent , creative , spontaneous and forceful . <p> here 's how each signs unique mix of Quality and Element influence how they express their Cardinal nature . <p> Aries : Cardinal Quality , Fire Element : An Aries role is to project himself upon the world through firsthand experiences . Self-expression is paramount to this pioneering sign , and Aries likes to see how far he can go in exploring , discovering and experimenting with the world around him . Aries fire element gives him supreme faith in himself along with a fierce sense of courage . His Cardinal nature makes him restless and in need of change for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get himself known in a fairly short time . Says Aries , " If I do n't  attract some attention to myself , how is anyone going to know me ? " Right on , Aries ! We can all learn from you . True to form , Aries does get to know the right people . ( In Aries case , the " right " ones tend to be venture capitalists or high level muckety-mucks who can make some splendid introductions for them ! ) Where would we be without Aries daredevils to push us forward ? <p> Cancer : Cardinal Quality , Water Element : Cancers role is to actively explore the entire realm of human emotion . That Cancer is both Cardinal and Water motivates this sign to explore new emotional states and experiences . As a Water sign , Cancer is the most subtle of the Cardinal signs when expressing his independence and ambition . But do n't  be fooledthose qualities are just as powerful within Cancer as in the other Cardinal signs , no matter how gentle a Cancer outwardly appears . <p> Astrologers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times , but that description oversimplifies Cancers rich textural nature and their ability to accept , initiate or even embrace change when they feel it is necessary . They have a capacity for sympathy and compassion that is unmatched by any other sign except fellow water sign Pisces . Cancers have a wide emotional spectrum , and they generally experience an inner life that combines higher highs and lower lows than the rest of us . Cancer would n't have it any other way ! <p> Libra : Cardinal Quality , Air Element : Libras are great matchmakers and know how to get things cooking by introducing individuals to one another in relaxed social situations . This sign mixes with lots of people and communicates often , so a Libra alone is a bit of an oxymoron , or a bit like the sound of one hand clapping ! Bewildered Libra would wonder what happened to the other hand . Trying to do anything without the " other half " of the unit seems pointless to them . Libras do their best work bouncing ideas off others and working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal quality brings them in contact with successful over-achievers like themselves , so they quickly build a data base of influential friends , associates , and contacts . ( Need an introduction to advance your pet project ? Ask a Libra for helpthey will throw a party or arrange a lunch . ) Since they 're Cardinal , Libras can be bossy , but they express their dominance in such a charming way that others become easily ( sometimes joyfully ) wrapped around Libras little fingers . <p> Capricorn : Cardinal Quality , Earth Element : Capricorn is a Cardinal sign who initiates activity with the end result in mind . They are not impulsive or impetuousthe Capricorn Earth nature sets goals and plans carefully . Unlike fellow Earth sign Taurus , a sign motivated by money , Capricorns motivation is to maintain and improve their reputations . Prestige is candy to Capricorn , for they love being respected for their work . Anything they put their name on has to be the best they can do . They work with almost the same dedication and obsession of a Virgo ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in area of obsession and perfection . ) Gaining honor or fame for its own sake will always interest Capricorn , especially if the position allows them to use their substantial leadership abilities . Why would a practical Capricorn accept a high profile position without a big salary attached ? Earthy Capricorn realizes they can leverage the title for more responsibility and compensation later . Some people say that each of us is only two phone calls away from people in power . If that is true , and you want to reach someone high up in the stratosphere ( the White House ? ) call your Capricorn first . They know all the right peopleand eventually become part of the inner circle themselves .

This should bring to fruition something of enormous importance to you , and only you would know what that might be . A full moon in your own sign happens only once a year , so this might be a key moment for you , especially if your birthday falls near January 17 .

If you have an architect , contractor , decorator , or other professional helping you with your home , this person will be a gem to you on and near this date , and offer you great solutions . Uranus will go retrograde for five months ( as is normal ) on July 29 , so if you can make your most important decisions earlier , doing so would work to your advantage . <p> In love , if you are happily coupled up , you will have the edge this month in the romance department .

This is the same professional tenth house that Mars has been orbiting during those seven months your tenth house of career honors , awards , and achievement . Clearly you were focused on your reputation and professional progress , to the exclusion of just about everything else in your life . Now the universe will make a correction in October , and life will become lighter , with plenty of opportunities to socialize with friends . <p> Months end will be delicious for you for two reasons . First , you have October 26 , when Venus , by then in Sagittarius , in ideal angle to Jupiter in Libra , will link your house of fame and honors to your house of money . ( This is your eighth house , so the money will come in as one large check . ) Lovely ! You will be popular with VIPs and peers alike from October 18 to November 12 , for Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , you may be planning a long trip , possibly overseas , as a result of the new moon , October 30 in fellow water sign Scorpio , a sign that blends beautifully with yours . You may go abroad , or you may discuss a publishing or broadcast opportunity . The house so lit up will be your ninth house of foreign people and places , so you might not leave home but instead work on a project with a company based overseas . <p> If you have any immigration matters to smooth out , this new moon of October 29 ( plus ten days ) will allow you to get a green card or visa , or even start the process of citizenship . <p> Neptune will be very prominent , and that is your ruling planet , suggesting two things the assignment will be perfect for you , and hold the possibility for you to contribute great creativity . <p> If your birthday falls on February 26 , plus or minus five days , this new moon will mark a very exciting time for all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have Pisces rising , your natal moon in Pisces , or a natal planet in Pisces , Cancer , Scorpio , Taurus , Virgo , or Capricorn at 8 degrees , plus or minus five degrees . <p> This wont be a big month for romance , not unless you travel to a beautiful paradise setting or new city overseas with your partner after the October 29 new moon . Now that sounds amazing ! Earlier in the month , from the very start until October 17 , Venus will be in Scorpio , making any trip divine . <p> Also having Venus in a water sign like yours Scorpio makes that phase , from October 1 to 17 , a great time to buy new clothes and see about improving your appearance . Last month Mercury was retrograde until September 22 , not a time to shop , but by October , Mercury is coming back to former strength and wont hold up your shopping go find things that are madly flattering on you , then step out to see what Cupid and his little fleet of angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Scorpio with a direct signal from Neptune , indicating a wonderful time to go to a Halloween party or to give one . This year , the costumes will be better than any year !

Your time will come in October . This exciting news comes as a result of a fabulous new moon , one of the best of 2016 , to appear in your eighth house of other peoples money .

Whatever the source , money will likely arrive in one lump sum . <p> Over the past year , you seem to have collaborated with one individual , such as an agent , business partner , manager , publicist , writing partner , or other person with expertise you need , and if so , the work you did together will now pay off . If you are married or are in a committed relationship , you may now gain financially through your romantic partner . <p> A new moon is active for ten days , but is strongest right after it appears , so schedule your actions to ask for money early in October .

Do n't  let this concern you , for your overall prospects for generating hefty chunks of income are so very strong not only for October but also for an entire year to come , all the way to October 2017 . <p> This month wont be all about money . Mars will be in Capricorn all month , until November 8 , and will pep your social life substantially in a way you 've not seen all year . You will have time to see friends ; arrange dinners , drinks , and get-togethers ; and add in museum visits , a Broadway play , or other fun activities .

You may be traveling , or you may be doing assignments for those based far from you without ever leaving your desk . Publishing and broadcasting projects could capture your imagination this month . Alternatively , you may be interviewing colleges or graduate schools , and if so , it would be the perfect time to begin the process . Your ninth house , so lucky for you in the ten days that follow after October 30 , covers all these areas . <p> No matter what you begin at this new moon , you will be deeply inspired by the work , because Neptune , the planet of imagination and also Pisces ruler , will be magnificently angled to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has your name written all over it , dear Pisces , and will favor you above all others .

The Sun , new moon , and Venus will be at 90-degree angles to Neptune , as well as Jupiter , and 180 degrees from Saturn . This forms a box pattern where tension is hard to be released . There are three kinds of cross patterns : Cardinal Cross , Fixed Cross , and Mutable Cross . This is a Mutable Cross because all the heavenly bodies involved will be mutable signs : Gemini , Sagittarius , Virgo , and Pisces . The Mutable Cross is the easiest of the three kinds to fix . Mutable signs are flexible and open to others views , and they love to talk . The way out of any briar patch that you might find yourself in is to act like a mutable sign talk and negotiate your way out .

The Sun and Saturn will be in perfect sync , so any action you take on August 1 will have lasting benefits , for Saturn will supply solid stability . You may decide to do something for your health , such as to consult a doctor or have a procedure done , because the Sun is the natural ruler of your sixth house of health , ruling specifically the preventive measures you need to take to boost your constitution . Work projects will go well , too , and add to your reputation . <p> On August 2 , the new moon will arrive , and its a honey of a new moon , full of sweetness and growing light . Saturn will signal the moon , suggesting your love life will become stable , and at work , your creativity will shine and garner much applause .

Or , take up a new sport , and get a package of professional lessons .

I never advise you to do things I do n't  do myself I just went through that last month . It is time consuming , but that one half hour you spend at the doctors office can save your life . August is the perfect month for you to schedule appointments . <p> Many people try to get in shape on January 1 , but I only shake my head no . Each sign of the zodiac has a specific time to start exercising and getting fit , and this is your turn August 2 and in the two weeks that follow that new moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sooner you will benefit from the strong energy of this new moon .

Here is another interesting point : the actions you take just after the new moon appears will have the power to affect you for a full year , until the next annual new moon arrives next year , August 21 , to refresh the energy . New moons are very powerful . <p> The sixth house that is so lit up for you by the new moon August 2 is also the house of work projects , so if self-employed , your phone is about to ring , and new people will be clamoring for your goods or services . If you work for others , you are likely to get the most enviable project of the department , and while you work on it , demonstrate your talents , managerial ability , and your readiness to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial news you 've earned will be August 16 , thanks to the cooperation of the Sun in your workaday project sector , and Uranus , planet of surprise , in your earned income sector .

This same day may bring other news too , and it will be related to your health or fitness , that your goal to become stronger will show exciting progress . <p> Your career is about to take center stage , for now , Mars is in strong position and brilliantly lighting your fame sector . <p> By the time you reach the full moon on August 18 , you will be craving rest and relaxation .

If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rehab help , or other protocol of medical treatments , full moons tend to bring an end to those treatments , or at the very least , to an encouraging plateau . <p> Now let 's talk about Jupiter , giver of gifts and luck . Jupiter has been touring your marriage and business partnership sector since August 2015 last year , so this year you may have become engaged or married , or felt much closer to your present partner . If you used Jupiters golden energy in terms of a business partnership , you received outstanding help from one or more business partners or collaborators . Your agent , manager , publicist , writing partner , business partner , investor , or others who bring expertise to your business are also among those who will be worth their weight in gold . If you regularly represent talent , for example , or you are a lawyer who represents various people , you will find that you have quite an important person to represent this month . You likely have a very good idea of what I am saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more chance to find out . <p> Jupiter is getting ready to buy his air ticket to fly to Libra , and to leave Virgo , where he is now . He is due to arrive in Libra on September 9 . Once Jupiter leaves , he wo n't have time to get back to this area of your chart for twelve years . That does n't  mean you cant get married for another twelve years ( heavens , no ! ) but that you were to receive special luck from a business or romantic partner now , while Jupiter is in Virgo this year . You will certainly have more opportunities throughout your lifetime . You also need to check for your rising sign too . <p> This month , we have an extraordinary linking of two different planets on two different days with Jupiter while he is in his final days in Virgo , your opposite sign six months from your Pisces Sun . <p> The first shining day will be August 21-22 ( the aspect spans two days ) when Mercury will conjunct Jupiter .

You may get a new apartment , or be able to sell a house , as two examples , or find the perfect space to lease , if not for your regular residence , then perhaps for a vacation home . You may get help from a family member too if so , that person loves you and it shows . This will be an extraordinary day , for Mercury- and Jupiter have not conjoined in Virgo since August 23 , 1992 . Typically they meet every twelve years , but they skipped meeting in November 2004 and went directly to Libra .

This would be a terrible day to get engaged or married , or to sign a business partner or collaborator ( such as a writing partner or new agent or publicist ) , as it would carry the aspects of this day throughout your term together . <p> If you do n't  have a partner in love or business , when this house is under pressured aspects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the ancients called the seventh house not only the marriage / partnership house , sealed by contract , but also " the house of open enemies . " In modern day we call these enemies competitors , unless we work in government or the military , in which case we would call them people who want to do us harm . I admit , this is a tough aspect , and fortunately it will come and go within a few days . If anyone criticizes you on June 2 plus or minus one day , you will likely feel wounded . Do n't  let those words crush you you can go on , for just because one person is critical , it does n't  necessarily mean that person is right . Take a deep breath , dear Sagittarius . Those born near December 4 will feel this the most . <p> Two days later , on June 4 , we have the new moon in Gemini , 15 degrees . This will light your house of partnership and marriage in a bigger way , and this new moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a serious business partnership . This new moon has some lovely aspects and some tough ones . On the plus side , the Sun , and the new moon will arrive with gentle Venus in your seventh house of commitment . Its lovely having Venus in your partnership / marriage house Venus softens and soothes all she touches . However , Saturn will oppose that new moon , Sun , and Venus directly , and this means you may come up short on money , perhaps with more than usual bills to pay . ( Do n't  worry too much about money , for your outlook is good , and your fears may be assuaged by months end . ) Saturn will be in hard angle to Neptune in your home sector , so a problem may pop up there , and to Jupiter in your prestigious career sector ( Jupiter never sends affliction , so no worries there ) . Saturns strong role in this new moon suggests your best way to handle things is to be practical and realistic . A new moon in Gemini is mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This new moon will be fending off many planets , and creates a box pattern , and forms what we call a Mutable Cross when planets move into almost exact calibration to form a perfect square . Energy bounces off the walls of the box , trying to find an escape or release , but finding none , creates tension . You are a mutable sign those include Sagittarius , Gemini , Virgo , and Pisces . ( The other two kinds are the severe Cardinal Cross and the not easy Fixed Cross . ) Mutable crosses are the easiest to untangle , as these crosses are not rigid in fact , mutable signs are flexible , adaptable , communicative and open-minded . The person you are dealing with may not want to change their opinion or plans , and may be making demands , but little by little you may be able to get them to compromise . The way out of the bramble bush quagmire is to listen to others opinions , debate them , and to keep talking , for that is what mutables like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can do this . <p> Travel may prove very difficult in the first week of June , and for this , blame Saturns challenge to the Sun . It would be best to put off an important business trip or vacation for later in the month . All kinds of media projects will go smoother in the latter part of the month too , from June 13 onward . If you are in a court case , nearing a verdict or settlement , see if your lawyer can delay things to the middle of the month , when the tide begins to turn to your favor . <p> A good sign that things will work out , despite the problems that might be generated that the new moon June 4 creates , is that Mercury , the planet that rules Gemini will be in friendly conversation with Neptune , the planet of vision , love , and creativity . I feel the results of your efforts will have a happy resolve , even though you may have to get over bumps and lumps along the way . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sagittarius , June 20 , at 29 degrees , the degree of completion . This will be the second full moon two months in a row in the same sign , Sagittarius , but of different degree ( 1 degree ) . Last month , if you have a birthday that falls on or within five days of November 22 , you would have felt that May 21 full moon most directly . <p> This month , if your birthday falls on December 20 ( minus five days ) , I know what you are thinking " Great . I get two full moons in a row in my sign ! Why is the universe picking on me ? " No , this is not necessarily bad news , for full moons bring conclusions and closure . You are getting closer to what you truly want in life , and to what will bring you the greatest happiness . <p> All Sagittarians will feel both full moons , but as delineated , some more than others . I love that the full moon of June 20 will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling your third house of agreements and contacts . You may be able to make a surprise agreement with the person who has given you pause . Uranus is currently based in your fifth house of originality , so your creativity will be very high , and you may be finishing a project that gives you great satisfaction , industry attention , and praise . You may also , as a side bonus of great magnitude , have a romantic interlude that keeps you breathless , no matter what your marital status happens to be . <p> No discussion of June would be complete without a nod to Mars , a planet that has been driving us all a bit crazy since it started to retrograde . We feel planets that orbit close to earth ( Mercury , Venus , and Mars ) more directly than the outer planets . Venus has been in fine shape , but Mercury went retrograde most of May , along with Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , and Pluto . Mars was , and still is , the one to watch . Mars first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 .

Mars move into Scorpio for June and July suggests you 'll get the rest and feeing of ease that you will dearly need , as this year the pressure has been almost relentless . You will get a chance to catch your breath and plot your course . <p> Now , here is the best news of all ! <p> On June 26 , Jupiter and Pluto will be aligned perfectly , a rare aspect that almost always signifies success and financial bounty . Jupiter is your ruling planet , so when it has conversations with powerful other planets , that is important for you to note .

Trust that if you plant a seed at this time , it is likely to grow to the sky and flourish beautifully . Pluto is known to take the good fortune that Jupiter provides and multiply it many times over . <p> This aspect wont return in a similar way until October 2018 , but will not be nearly as strong as the one coming to you this month . A better alignment of Jupiter and Pluto will come in April 2020 .

This is an aspect that can create possible mishaps , so be sure to watch where you are walking or driving . Do n't  go into places that are not well lit . I did that once , when I was at a friend of a friends house , looking for the ladies room . She kept pointing to a door in an odd place and walked away and told me the rest room was there . I opened the door and it was pitch black , but figured the light switch was on the wall , a bit inside . I took one step forward and tumbled down an entire flight of stairs in the complete darkness .

( As a Cancer , you put a high priority on having a loving , nurturing home life , so you will especially love this coming phase . Jupiter will work hard for you in coming months to allow you to make your castle . ) <p> In late August , the planets are planning a going-away party for Jupiter . Venus and Mercury have already arrived in your third house to greet Jupiter there , too .

You need not go far even a short distance trip would bring great joy . Jupiter will conjoin Mercury in the sign of Virgo on this day for the first time in twelve years , and it will be at least that length of time again until these two planets choose the Virgo constellation to meet again . If you take a jaunt , you would have beautiful accommodations , and you would be thrilled with your entire time away . <p> August 21-22 would be the best day of the year for signing important papers . This would also be the time to send in your manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your editor , or finish your broadcast segment . Unveil your new website or app , or change your social media page . <p> August 22 will be very important for another reason . Mars was retrograde for a long time and finally turned direct June 29 . Everyone , of every sign , was happy to see Mars awaken , for Mars when weak tends to make projects proceed very slowly . It must have seemed that you were being forced to watch paint dry . Mars retrograde can be maddening . On August 22 , the same day as Mercurys alignment with Jupiter , Mars will be back ( mathematically ) to former strength , to the place Mars was occupying before the retrograde started back in April . <p> Your other stellar day will come over the weekend of August 27 , when Venus and Jupiter will combine forces .

Another bonus of the day is that the third house rules siblings , so you may benefit in some way from your sister or brother , or your sibling may have good news to share . You may want to check in and find out what 's going on . <p> Venus may be IN your third house , but it RULES two of your houses of your horoscope , and one of those two is your eleventh house of hopes and wishes , friendships and parties . This suggests you may be going to an enchanting celebration party ( possibly a wedding ) that weekend , and it will be so beautiful , it will be clear that no expense was spared .

See how things go I will discuss that full moon in a second , but trust that the full moon will have sweet elements to it , too . The person in your environment that Pluto will be pointing to this month might not be your mate or steady lover , but rather , your agent , manager , business partner , or other professional collaborator who is being disagreeable and even dictatorial . Dealing with Pluto to reach some semblance of compromise is nearly impossible , for Pluto takes no prisoners and uses a scorched earth method of negotiation . <p> Another different possibility to this trend brought on by Pluto is that this person may not be a business or romantic partner , but rather a competitor who will use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your market share . This person would be operating out in the open , not hidden in the shadows , so at least you can see what is going on . I know you 're laughing " Yeah , that does n't  sound like a plus !

Cancer is a fiercely intuitive sign , so use the insight your inner voice will whisper to you to your advantage . <p> If your birthday falls on July 4 , plus or minus four days , then you will feel this new moon very directly , with both the lovely support of Neptune , Jupiter , and Mars , and the possible frustrations you may feel from a partner or a competitor . <p> As you see there is a complexity to this new moon , but only if you have someone who seems like a pushy , my-way-or-the-highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very strong in the first ten days of July . Cancer is a reserved sign , and as a rule does not seek a lot of attention , but this month , attention and affection could easily find you . Take special note of how well things go for you in matters of the heart when Venus in Cancer receives sparkling vibrations on July 6 . <p> I also love July 8 , when Mercury will be in sync with Jupiter ; you will have a superb weekend to travel to a place near water ( always a Cancer favorite ) as well as near mountains and lush display of nature . <p> Over the weekend of July 9-10 , we have a very powerful aspect , when the Sun in Cancer will receive greetings from Jupiter in Virgo . This would be the most magical weekend of the month to travel , and it may be one of the best of the season . So much will go your way this weekend its due to be that sweet .

The tables seem to turn by the time of this full moon . The full moon will be conjunct Pluto , so by now you appear to be ready to stand up to anyone who is giving you a hard time . Let 's not forget the moon rules Cancer , so the position of the moon is vital to seeing your forecast each month . <p> Mars will be very supportive , and so will Jupiter , giver of gifts and luck . Pluto will be too far away to give you problems , but Uranus will act up too , by being in exact hard aspect to the Sun , so you may encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely involve a higher-up or client that causes you to feel thrown off balance by something that comes up unexpectedly . Or , it may be that conditions in the company are changing suddenly , and news will require you to make a sudden adjustment . Wear your armor . There will be no way to anticipate what or who will surface , so stay on your toes and be as flexible as you can be . We will all feel this , no matter what our signs , so go with the flow and do your best . <p> If instead it turns out to be a competitor that will give you pause , then you will have enough planetary power to deal with that person at the full moon . In the complex month , Pluto will still be within tight range of a gorgeous trine to Jupiter , a lovely and rare aspect denoting enormous potential for profit and gain . This will be true all month , not just at the time of the full moon , and may explain why you are trying to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or financing this person can bring to you , but at the same time , you might find the process of dealing with this person maddening . <p> As you see nothing is exactly straightforward this month , but then again , that can be positive .

Although what happens from Pluto may not be fair at all times , if you bide your time and quietly build a strategy , you can eventually win .

Do n't  freak out because financially , you will do well very soon this appears to be a blip on the screen . <p> A case in point that your finances will be looking up may arrive on June 13 , a sterling day , when you will have a superb chance to make more money , perhaps by getting a raise , by bringing in new business , or by making a big sale on June 13 .

Either or both may bring up an obstacle . Admittedly , this new moon is a mess , and because new moons start trends , it might take weeks for you to sort everything out . This does n't  mean you ca n't be productive you can . You just have to be vigilant , determined , and organized . <p> Part of the problem with the first half of 2016 was that beginning on April 16 , Mars went retrograde in your twelfth house of the subconscious mind , intuition , dreams , hunches , and also things that happen off stage and behind closed doors . The twelfth house is also the place that healing takes place of the mind , body , and spirit . Mars job is to provide the energy that gets projects and relationships cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that gives you the courage to tackle endeavors that require patience because they are difficult to achieve . Mars helps you take on endeavors that just a few years ago would have seemed beyond your ability to handle . <p> With Mars and Saturn in your twelfth house , you have had an enormous amount of energy focused there , the last house of the horoscope , symbolizing the end of a cycle , and the preparation for a new one . This means you seem to be tying up loose ends and getting ready in the second half of 2016 to set off in a new direction . This same part of the chart rules intuition yours has been evolving to new heights , and it is still very active this month .

These very same houses rule other parts of life , and I will get to those and list them , so you can judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have had Saturn , the solar systems taskmaster , in this area of your chart for over a year , and Mars since March 2016 . This is the area of healing for the body where a surgery or procedure would be involved or concerning the mind , making the past months and weeks a superb time to seek help from a therapist , priest , or rehab facility . This month you have a full moon , June 20 , which remarkably is the second full moon in Sagittarius two months running and will bring one of these types of matters just listed to a finish . <p> Alternatively , it may be that you have been working on confidential matters , such as a product launch , or a corporate merger or takeover , or another business or government project that required great secrecy . In that case , the June 20 full moon would bring those matters to a finish . Allow a plus or minus four days from that date . A new secret matter may come up in early August , or another phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 27 of this year , you truly will be , as they say , done and done . <p> Another element related to Mars is that Mars is the natural ruler of your fourth house of home . With Mars retrograde since April 17 , if you wanted to move , buy , sell , lease , fix up , or decorate , or find a new roommate , as some examples , Mars slow backward orbit did not do you any favors . If you were beset with delays , you now know why blame Mars retrograde . <p> Mars will finally go direct on June 29 , so home-related projects will begin to perk up and go more smoothly from that date onward . Having said that , it will take Mars time to ramp up to former strength until August 22 . You wont have to wait that long to see life start to beat to a faster tempo , and you will notice the change almost immediately . Watch the days that surround July 29 for a clue of what area of your life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very definite clues of how things will change for the better on the day , plus or minus one day , the planet turns direct . Your clue may center on home and family , or on friends and your social life or both areas . <p> As Mars retrograded , Mars slipped back into Scorpio on May 27 late last month and will remain in Scorpio until August 2 . As a result , your social life is about to pep up magnificently in a way you 've not seen in months , and you will be able to let go and breathe . I will come back to Mars in Scorpio at the end of your report , but suffice to say , you will love the change .

You are fortunate too that sexy Mars will be in Scorpio , another water sign , and will coax you to take a quick vacation or , at the very least , flee town on weekends . <p> One of your best weekends of the month will be June 25-26 , when the transiting moon will be in water sign Pisces , and Venus and Neptune will be in gorgeous , sparkling angles , bringing glamour and romance that might just take your breath away . <p> Summary <p> Your career shows news at the June 4 new moon , so you may be offered a new title or new position during the first half of June .

Neptune will be in hard angle to the new moon , so you may misunderstand the package of benefits of the job . In that respect , you may have a more optimistic view of the job description or the payment scale than is in actuality the case . In this instance , ask that the deal points be clearly outlined by the employer or client in writing before you accept the job .

This job would require a lot of time and a strenuous effort . If you choose not to agree to take on more responsibility and this new title , it might also be due to what is going on with your physical space , a concern about relocating , renovating , doing massive repairs , or other reason . Alternatively if your space is not a concern , you may be thinking about all those at home who depend on you for their welfare , most likely your family or a parent .

@@12610233 @1210233/ <h> Can Susan do my chart ? <h> Share <p> Susan considers it an honor that you would want her to do your chart . Her extensive writing schedule and other commitments simply preclude her from being able to do personal charts any longer . She is so sorry . If you would like to have one done , here is what she recommends . <p> A. Get your accurate birth time . <p> First , you will need to have your birth date , month , and year , the city and state or country , plus the exact time you were born to the minute . If you were born in the United States , contact the Department of Vital Statistics in the capital of the state where you were born . You will need to ask for a " vault copy " of your birth certificate that is , a copy of your birth certificate with your correct and official time of birth . Be very clear in your request that you do not want the computer version of your birth certificate . A proper copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If it only costs $5.00 , it is very likely the wrong , computer version that does not list the time of birth . If you live outside of the USA , you will probably need to contact the local jurisdiction of where you were born , or possibly the capital of the country where you were born . <p> If you can not find the exact time of your birth , here are a few recommendations : Ask your mother , if you can . Shell often know within a few minutes when you were born , and although every minute makes a difference in astrology , its better to be close to your birth time than not close at all . If you cant ask your mother or she does n't  remember ( after all she was quite busy in labor , most probably in a delivery room without windows , so it would be hard for her to judge the time of day ) , then ask other relatives who might know when you were born . Your mother might have kept a baby book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list the time you were born . <p> B. Ca n't get your birth time , try reading Susans Summaries <p> If neither of those solutions is possible , then Susan recommends that you read all of the summaries of her forecasts for six months . You will probably find one sign other than your Sun sign that will resonate with you above all others , and that sign will probably be your rising sign . One of the primary purposes of having your chart done is to determine your rising sign the sign that was on the horizon when you were born ( which is why each minute can make a difference ) . It is your rising sign that determines the placement of all of the planets in your chart . The rising sign also dictates the career you will likely excel in , so it is useful to know . The only time your Sun sign and rising sign would be the same is that if you were born at or near dawn . <p> C. Order a sunrise chart <p> If you simply can not find your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Sun sign would also serve as your rising sign . This is not as accurate as having your actual rising sign , but it will definitely tell you where all the planets were when you were born . <p> Next , once you have all of your birth information , you can have your chart done . Susans first recommendation is to order a copy of My Personal Horoscope , which is a print-on-demand book written just for you . My Personal Horoscope is written by Susan and will tell you everything you need to know about your chart . Just click here , or go to **38;178;TOOLONG to order it for $55.00 plus shipping and any applicable sales tax ( New York State only ) .

You wo n't need the legend box Susan will explain everything in your chart clearly . Susan never uses astrological language when writing or speaking to non-astrologers . Once you have your natal chart done , you need never do it again . <p> We regularly pay an atlas company to keep our charts up to date for many reasons . Each year daylight savings time and return to standard time falls a different date , not only in the US but also in other countries . Also , occasionally counties change their names and borders . Back during World War Two we had War Time . All these considerations are put into the charts that I do by the atlas company , to make them accurate , . The algorithm I use is Placidus Tropical , for those who are interested and know astrology. - <p> In addition to the My Personal Horoscope book Susan developed for her grown-up readers , there is also a book for newborns and small children ( covering newborn up to age six ) . In this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child , including some of the inherited traits given by the father and mother . Before you order the baby book , you will need the first name of each of the parents of the child and just the Sun sign of each , such as Tom , a Taurus , and Erica , a Gemini . ( If the child is part of a gay couple , she will write a report on a child with two fathers or two mothers . ) <p> Susan also writes a relationship compatibility custom book for a specific couple , straight or gay . Susan suggests , however , that you first become familiar with your own chart before you order a report for compatibility . <p> There is also a My Personal Horoscope Annual Solar Return Book , which most people order when they are anticipating their birthday . This is a book that progresses your natal Sun to the year you will now enter . Solar return means the return of the Sun to the place it occupied at your birth . This is considered significant in astrology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way other astrological reports can not do . <p> All of the My Personal Horoscope books may be purchased as either hard copy or downloaded in PDF format . If you live outside of the USA , we recommend you order your book as a PDF , since you can save on shipping charges . <p> If you can not find your time of birth and want to know what your actual rising sign is , then you will need to work with an astrologer who could do what 's known as chart rectification . This is where you provide the astrologer with ten of the most important events in your life this will allow the astrologer to work backward in time to find the aspect that triggered that event , and in so doing , pinpoint your rising sign and degree . Some people call the rising sign the ascendant both are the same and used interchangeably . <p> Finding a Personal Astrologer in Your City <p> If you would prefer a personal astrologer to create your chart ( this will be more expensive than purchasing My Personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to meet with you or speak with you on the telephone once you have your chart , Susan would recommend that you contact one of the following three organizations : <p> These organizations are all based in the United States , although they might be able to recommend someone in an overseas company too . Through any of these organizations you should be able to locate a personal astrologer you would be comfortable with in order to provide advice as well as to do your chart . Susan belongs to all three organizations , so please mention her name when you contact them . Susan receives no compensation from any of these organizations , but she would like you to receive special care when you call . If you live outside of the USA , its also possible that there are other organizations in your own country that can provide these same services .

Both of you are spirited , energetic , and enthusiastic fire signs with a fundamental understanding of one another . Your Leo lover has the same view of the world that you do vast , expansive , and ultimately your oyster . <p> This relationship is exciting , active , busy , passionate , noisy , glamorous , fun loving and flamboyant . It can be volatile too , since both you and your Aries have quite a temper . But somehow , you love the fights as much as everything else , probably because you have so much fun making up . Passions are strong in both of you ; when you two get together , you light up the sky with fireworks ! Neither of you does anything halfway or without enthusiasm . You will have an ardent relationship but one of extremes . <p> Aries are ambitious , but Leos do not generally exert themselves unless conditions force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect things to fall into place . Your lover will marvel at this point of view . Lions and Lionesses say , " Why wouldnt I get what I want ? Certainly I deserve it ! " This is Leos ego speaking . But realize that your Aries does not have this kind of strong self-image , nor the same expectations that his or her needs will magically be provided for by the Universe . Aries assume they have to struggle their way to the top . Winning , not how the game is played , is everything to them , and they are willing to put in a big effort , bashing their Rams horns gleefully through the opposition and enjoying the spoils of their victories . Inside , however , Aries will wonder why you do n't  want to put in more of an effort an area to watch in your relationship . <p> You will admire your Aries courage and ability to start new ventures in the face of adversity . There is nothing Aries wont take on if they feel impassioned , and they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are terrible with details and so are you . Hopefully you two can hire some help to do mundane things , like buy soap , toothpaste , or paper for the printer . <p> Your creativity will get high marks from Aries , as will your generosity and talent with entertaining , partying and networking . You 'll never get grief from your Aries over too much socializing they despise staying home as much as much as you do . They do n't  have your penchant for the jet set or high living , and they would rather spend money on a new fax machine than dinner in a four-star restaurant . But when Aries run out of cash , they just figure out a way to make more , so its unlikely you will have many disagreements about finances . Aries like to be self-employed , by the way , so do n't  try to talk yours into working for anyone else if he or she has just started a business . <p> You like to give orders , whether you realize it or not . This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dictate to them , least of all their lovers/mates . Independence is vital to Aries , so if you want to make one do something you have to make him or her think it was his or her idea in the first place . Aries may discover that they can actually control you if he or she lavishes you with compliments . I hear you protesting , but you have to admit it works ! Aries can make you feel so warm and cozy that you 'll let them have their way . Aries are very clever and as children learn quickly how to get their parents wrapped around their little fingers . Later in life , getting their lovers to succumb to their charms is a piece of cake . <p> In lovemaking , you will find your Aries lover is the perfect blend of wild abandonment and sweet tenderness . Both of you want to be the others one-and-only , but for different reasons . As I said earlier , the Ram wants to win . Coming in second seems shoddy and not worth the challenge . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wo n't concede your crown to any other beast . It would n't be fitting . My best advice to you , Leo , is to keep your mouth shut about past lovers . Your Aries is n't going to take kindly to knowing someone else has already conquered you . You like to reminisce about past love and admiration it never leaves your memory but to tease your Aries lover with this information is playing with fire . As odd as it may seem , you will come across as " damaged goods , " whether you are female or male . Aries wants to feel your love is pure and unmatched by anything you have ever felt before .

You 'll find Virgo detailed , diplomatic , determined and articulate just the kind of person to make you shine at dinner with your boss . It is hard not to admire Virgo . The trouble is , Virgos like to work , while you like to play or study . If Virgos workaholic schedule cramps your style too much , you 'll get on your horse and ride off into the sunset . <p> If their work schedule does n't  turn you off , their penchant for neatness could .

Because Virgos communicate so well , you could soon find you are grooving on the same sexual frequency and loving every minute . In order to get them into the proper mood , you may have to indulge in lots of verbal foreplay , something very erotic to Virgo . Once he or she is home from the office , Virgo does n't  relax that quickly or easily but your tender attentions can get them to if you try . <p> You are a fire sign and Virgo is earth , so this match of personalities does not come naturally to either of you . Luckily , you both are highly flexible creatures . This is a strong plus , and indicates that if you work at this relationship , you can make it happen . A 50/50 chance of success is the estimation here , but that does not account for the bushels of optimism you bring to every endeavor , or your wonderful meeting of the minds with your Virgo . Give it a try .

In many ways each of you has exactly what the other one lacks . <p> You both are very driven and ambitious so you agree : Work is important . Looking at your horoscope , I see that Aries Sun falls in your house of other peoples money and your Sun falls in Aries house of work . Therefore , you understand each others need to be recognized , and you both want to make money . Feeling successful and productive is a priority for both Virgo and Aries .

Remember that ! Your Aries lover is full of enthusiasm and bright ideas , but is not good with details and organization . Those are your big strengths , so help your Aries . You are also practical , a quality , which could help your impractical lover , get things done .

Aries need continual praise and reassurance . Morality , discretion , and strong ethics run deeply through your system , so Aries play-the-field attitude could really grate on your nerves . This will be true even if realistically it is too early on in the relationship for you to have the right to be jealous .

A focus on your home will arise by next month , and this month , you 'll have many important opportunities to travel to distant cities or to hear news from abroad . You may also see news regarding an international alliance , a media project ( broadcasting or publishing ) , or in regard to your efforts to get an advanced university degree . An in-law may have an idea , and you may have conversations . Its sure to be a busy month ! <p> Let 's first discuss Mars , the energy planet that has orbited back to Sagittarius after a two-month hiatus in Scorpio during June and July . Mars will re-enter Sagittarius on August 2 , a sign that 's been in since March 5 to May 27 . The difference is , earlier this year , Mars went retrograde from April 17 to June 29 , but even before that official start to the retrograde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April too . We all had to be patient while Mars rested . On June 29 , Mars awakened , but the problem was , like a little sleepy head person , Mars was feeling groggy and needed time to get back to former strength . ( When Mars goes retrograde , it takes him 12 days to go one degree . When he is in good shape it takes him two days to go one degree . You can imagine the difference ! ) Mars is the booster rocket to all ventures , so without Mars feeling peppy and strong , you were left to do all the heavy lifting by yourself . <p> The good news is Mars will return to full strength by August 22 , and already you are seeing a difference . Meetings are more productive , decisions are getting made , products and services are being launched , and even relationships are moving ahead with greater certainty . ( Earlier , for most of the first half of 2016 , you may have had a circular relationship you went in circles , saying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have felt you were living the movie " Ground Hog Day " . That complete lack of progress will change in a close relationship too ! <p> Now that Mars is back in Sagittarius and strong , you will be at the head of the class . You will have right of way , and your courage , drive , and confidence will impress others . In fact , you will find many will want to follow you you can light a nation to your cause . The ancient astrologers always wrote that having Mars in your own sign was a big plus , and that one should use that period to push forward on any goal dear to your heart . You will have two months in which to act , until September 27 , but you will have a big problem with September . <p> The glitch is this : Mars brother Mercury will go retrograde from August 30 to September 21 . This is problematic because you , along with the rest of us , should never sign a contract with Mercury retrograde because Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mercury also rules negotiations and agreements , contacts and important launches , especially in the communicative field , for if you do , you will run into roadblocks and difficulties . <p> Your career is about to take off like a rocket on or very near two days , August 22 and August 27 . <p> This means you have to act on important matters now , in August , as early in the month as possible , because you need to leave space between the date you act and the start of the retrograde August 30 . If that is off for you , and not possible , then delay your signing of paperwork , and/or launch until after September 22 . I particularly love September 26 , so put a circle around that date . August has more than its share of gorgeous planetary dates , so do n't  assume you 'll have to wait . Stay with me because this is one month I have plenty of good news to share with you . <p> One more note about Mercury retrograde : If you need a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphones , any other electronic or kitchen appliance , you need to buy it in August . I love August 16 for that purpose , for the Sun in Leo ( a fire sign like yours ) will contact Uranus , and that planet is the higher octave for Mercury and rules all things newly invented , including all high-tech electronics and the digital world . If you are launching a new website , do not do it while Mercury is retrograde . <p> Let 's look at the month in detail , now that you know that Mars will be favoring you all month . <p> On August 1 , Saturn and the Sun will be in perfect alignment , and send you gifts of financial security . Saturn is currently in Sagittarius , and so receiving strength from the Sun is wonderful news . Saturn is the natural ruler of your second house of income , so something that will happen on this day should boost your income . Here I am referring to earned income , not money you will be given as a gift or win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still be within a degree-and-a-half of a perfect trine to Uranus , planet of surprise . A trine is from the word triangle , denoting 120 degrees , considered the most heavenly aspect you could ever wish to have . Venus is currently in her last days of your travel house and will be signaling Uranus in your house of true love , so August 1 should bring not only money and a welcome feeling of being settled and secure , but also fun with romance , children , leisure activities , and travel . <p> The following day will be a very important date for you , August 2 , for it marks the new moon in Leo , 11 degrees . This new moon will shine in your long-distance travel house , so you may be packing your bags to take a long trip , possibly overseas , to an exciting distant location . If so , make it a warm and sunny place , for a Sun in Leo does not like cold , icy weather follow the sunshine . <p> Alternatively , you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Internet , or a broadcast that you are putting together or appearing in . These projects shine , and you will get the best boost you 've seen all year and possibly more than any you saw last year , in 2015 , too . <p> The courts and the judicial system will work in your favor at this time ( just AFTER the August 2 new moon arrives ) as well as with any matter that has to do with immigration , citizenship , green card , or a visa . This new moon will be special not only for those topics , but for money too , for the moon is the natural ruler of Sagittarius eighth house of commission , bonuses , cash advances , royalties , inheritance , and other such sources where you might receive a large sum .

Your ruler , Saturn , causes you to take responsibility to heart . You value practical and realistic solutions , and having a cardinal quality , you like to get on with things . Certainly , you are action-oriented . Yet while tap-dancing faster can make you feel better , the danger is that you can get so lost in busywork that you lose sight of the bigger picture . Just be sure what you are working on so intently is worthy of that amazing Capricorn output ! Also , if your spouse , boyfriend or girlfriend keeps complaining that you 're never around anymorethats a sign to rethink your schedule . <p> Capricorn is an earth sign , so you would probably enjoy taking a breather in the mountains more than at a seaside setting .

So when you book a lunch with an friend choose a restaurant in a club , or has a club-type aura , complete with wood paneling and fireplaces . The goat also likes heights , so a restaurant with a view is just your speed , but be sure it has a calm atmosphere . Be determined to talk about general thingsnot all lunches have to be major negotiations ! Sports with social twist are good too , so you might think about taking up tennis or golf . <p> Most Capricorns like to play the stock market and make investing a hobby . Give yourself some time off to hear a lecture by an expert , surf the net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good shows which tackle investments in depth . Other Capricorns might like collecting rare coins or stamps ( or start a collection of new ones ) . <p> Since Capricorn likes history , you can relax in front of the Discovery Channel , check out the natural history museum or visit the historical society museum of your city . Many Capricorns enjoy browsing antiques . Auctions are another good bet , and even if you do n't  bid , you 'll have fun fingering the valuable objects and documentsobjects that are usually under glass in museums ! Do n't  expect to chill out immediately . It may take weeks of vigorous fun to loosen you up ! <p> Most Capricorns are close to one parent ( while Gemini rules siblings , Capricorn rules parents ) .

You may be amazed how they say something which " hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally , renting a funny movieeither a new release or a golden oldiecould also be the best medicine . Other ways to tickle your funny bone would be to check out funny sites on the web like cartoon Dilbert ( www.dilbert.com ) or click into Comedy Central on cable . Tell a few jokes to your friends ( if you cant remember any good ones , go to a comedy club and crib a few for friends and family . ) Hang out with a witty , funny friendor a dimwitted friend ( you 'll be the star ) .

Gemini is up-to-the-minute on trends , but too liberal a sexual situation is probably not a good idea for either of you .

@@12610261 @1210261/ <h> Sagittarius : Work Out , Be Philosophical <h> Share <p> Easy-going , mellow Sagittarius ; ruled by Jupiter , life events rarely get on your nerves . Your style of dealing with change is to periodically review and revise your methods as soon as a warning light beeps . Your only problem may be the flip side of your greatest asset : your optimism . You may , at times , take too rosy a view of things . You like to move ahead quickly . You get easily bored with details . This combination can occasionally trip you up , since you could miss something important or incorrectly judge a situation . Surround yourself with detail/analytical air types ( Gemini , Aquarius or Libra ) or hire an earth sign ( Virgo , Taurus or Capricorn ) assistant to balance you . A mutable sign , you are one of the lucky flexible ones that can accept change best . Your fire side of your nature makes you enthusiastic , energetic and creative in thinking up new plans and ideas . <p> When life becomes just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toss off stress better than a good sweat . Besides pumping iron , taking your dog for a run is great . Your sign is symbolized by the centaur , so try an equestrian sport . Hire a horse for an hour and go for a morning gallop through a park , or learn to play polo . Being outdoors regularly is good for you , for Sagittarius is not a sign known to sit still happily or stay cooped-up inside for too long . <p> Games of agility such as fencing or archery , could appeal to you as well . There are some Sagittarius that do n't  like many sports , but instead , they like to walk . That 's all they do , but they do so much of it , that they leave the rest of us in the dust . When they walk they open the windows of their minds and clear out all the clutter blocking new creative ideas . The unity of mind and body is highly regarded and maintained by Sagittarius . <p> If you need some entertainment , check the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wee one to a day at the circus or a zoo . Sagittarius rules large animals , and it is a rare Sadge that does n't  enjoy being around pets and rare animals . Hang out with positive spirits like yourself . Choose a Leo , Aries , Gemini , Aquarius or Libra . The water signs are likely to be too emotional for you , and the earth signs too serious ( earth " puts out " fire ) . <p> Like your opposite sign , Gemini , you enjoy books . Head to the nearest bookseller with a large selection or go to the library . Unlike your opposite sign of Gemini , who likes either to read best sellers or self-help books , you are more likely to gravitate to books that deal with a particular philosophy of life . You may also enjoy inspirational biographies of well-known people who have met lifes challenges with courage , and are willing to share their insights . <p> Your sign is the natural ruler of the 9th house , and therefore your sign is a reflective one . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverend ( or other religious person ) or even a professor or other scholar , could prove stimulating . Sagittarius is a give-and-take sign that does not become threatened by others differing views . Highly cerebral , you like the process of debate . and hold your own quite well in any discussion . By allowing random or unfamiliar points of view within your radar , you might be able to come up with creative solutions to whatever is causing your tension . <p> Another Sagittarius activity that would give an instant change of pace would be an evening adult education class . Your sign enjoys learning , so go hear an expert speak about a topic of interest to you at a neighborhood school , university or even a lecture at a local YMCA or bookstore event . The class need not have any information about whatever is troubling you . Try a class on wine tasting , shooting pool , modern American Poetry , Chinese cooking , or anything that interests you . <p> Finally , think about getting away for a short time if you can spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . Check your frequent flier mileage or keep an eye out for bargain airline rates . Sometimes it is necessary to get away to see ones problems with objectivity . A long weekend in London or a five days spent camping in Wyoming would fix you right up , and you could return with an entirely new point of view . Sadge is independent and self-reliant , so if you have nobody to bring along , traveling alone would be no big deal . See Notre Dame at dawn , have a croissant in an outdoor cafe , stroll the Left Bank , stop by the Louvre , take a drive in the French countryside . Sounds good , eh ? Think about it , Sadge.

Mercury represents non-emotional , highly rational , objective thought . Its placement in a sign determines that signs intellectual style . As a quickly moving planet , Mercury is flexible , responsive and adaptable . A big part of Mercurys job is to disburse information ; as such it rules perception , language , writing , editing , research , speaking , all kinds of learning experiences and learning styles and the assessment of data . It rules telecommunications , computing , software , electronic gadgets , the postal service , shipping , couriers , and all forms of transportation . This planet has a LOT of responsibility . <p> When Mercury retrogrades ( something you will read about often on my website , Astrology Zone , at www.astologyzone.com ) , it scrambles information , causes static and confusion . Its effects are felt universally . Mercury retrograde episodes are highly unreliable to sign contracts , complete important transactions , access accurate information or make big decisions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart reveals a great deal about that persons natural style of gathering and giving out information . Mercury also rules sibling relationships , maps , letters , travel plans , appointments , roadways , vehicles , advertising , publishing , sales , and public relations . <p> Mercury rules both Gemini and Virgo . Mercury spends about two-three weeks in each sign , but when it retrogrades , which it does three to four times a year , it can stay in one sign as long as ten weeks . Never far from the Sun , it takes about one year to circle the zodiac .

Those born six months away from one another form an astrological opposition . This actually means you can fit each other perfectly because each of you has what the other is missing . <p> Your Pisces lover is all right-brain : full of dreams , imagination , and compassion for others . Pisces may not be common-sense realists that is your domain but they more than make up for it by understanding some of the mysterious things in life . They excel at reading symbols and gestures , while you are a literal creature . Where you are precise , they are diffuse ; where you are rigid , they are flexible ; where you see limits , they see endless horizons . <p> Together you can accomplish a great deal . Being mutable signs , you both are open-minded , flexible people , and welcome new thinking and fresh ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where you are neat , compulsive , and detailed , your lover is just the opposite . Pisces live in chaos quite happily ; it fosters their creativity . To set boundaries , sort , seal , and punctuate is too limiting for a Pisces ; they swim better in open , unrestricted space . Who wants to worry about paying a bill or balancing a checkbook when one is thinking up words to a song about true love or plotting a film about empathy and loneliness ? Pisces have human emotions on their minds as well as in their hearts ; against the universality of the human condition , attending to housekeeping seems unimportant . <p> If truth be known , Virgo , you tend to be fascinated by this point of view and feel you could gain something from your Pisces . You are right . Each of you could learn from the other . While your Pisces could use more practicality and structure in his or her life , you could use the confidence to dream and build a bigger and brighter future . Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that one piece of the mosaic , you fail to see how bright the whole picture could be .

They feel if they just allow goodness to triumph , it will . Others may manipulate them , but they know what is going on and allow it . If you need a Pisces energy so dearly , they will allow you to have it , for their own well is deep and replenishes as they sleep . When Pisces lend money , they give it without any expectation that it will be returned . Pisces do n't  really lend anything they give it freely instead . It is perhaps with money that you are to find your most profound differences ; Pisces are unmaterialistic , which would not describe your attitude . You wish your lover was wiser about financial matters , but his or her eyes are not on this world , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your lover . Perhaps it is because of the pure and loving vibes he or she sends out . <p> Pisces have a fine imagination but often do n't  know which ideas have commercial potential and which do n't  . They are pulled in two different directions ( as shown in their symbol : two fish swimming in opposite directions ) . Here is where your common sense and practical approach to life could be valuable to your lover : Your words will be listened to ( Pisces listen well , not only to what is said but the way its said ) , carefully considered , and even accepted as truth making you feel especially needed and content . Your Pisces does need you , Virgo . <p> Pisces have the gift of ESP and know what you need without asking .

Your earthy nature prevents this from happening on its own ; around your lover , you find you can swim in deeper emotional waters and feel things youve never felt before . Your earth sign is nurtured and enriched by your lovers water element over and over again . Pisces loosen up your all-too-prudent ways , and help you view the unlimited possibilities of life and love . <p> Your Pisces still believes in magic and make-believe and , being all too practical , you want to believe as he or she does , but havent had the courage or the chance .

To both of you , sex is holy and beautiful , not something to be taken lightly , and thus , you wont be disappointed . <p> Hang on to your lover , and try to make this work .

If your Gemini lover ever discovers that the way to your heart is through physical affection rather than reason and logic , you may have a chance to survive as a couple . <p> This is going to be a tough relationship if it works you two will share many wonderful gifts and talents . If you love your Gemini and your Gemini loves you , you have already begun the process of sharing your greatest attributes successfully .

Those changes are on the way , for you will now enter your very best year in over a decade once you get to September . Jupiter is in his final days of spending time in your twelfth house , considered the last house of the horoscope before the wheel turns to point to the first house . Ancient astrologers pointed to the twelfth house as one of healing and health , and for a time to delete anything in your life that you feel you no longer want or need . The twelfth house symbolizes the time you spent in the placenta before you were born , so it is a house of preparation . <p> The twelfth house is also a house of enormous creativity while you work in solitude , for this house is naturally ruled by Pisces , the sign that gives great emphasis on imagination and the arts .

If that phone were to ring , who would be calling , and what news or offer would that person have for you ? Until you can see your life like a little movie , down to the tiniest detail , it will be hard to make a dream become reality .

Working alone , behind closed doors , is very favored now , so if you are writing a book or finishing up your thesis , get cracking in August , for you will be very productive . <p> Mercury also rules your ninth house of big ideas and wide horizons . On August 22 , you may travel to a foreign country or to a distant point , or you may be going off to college or graduate school and making final plans .

Capricorns sense of responsibility is so strong it covers their hidden sensuality , and you need to gently peel back their layers of resistance . Go slowly , without too much Leo exuberance . Outwardly , Capricorn is always very reserved , but you can bet inner raging passion and earthy lustiness are dying to come out . Who better than a warmhearted Leo to light up Capricorns all too duty-oriented days ? <p> This is an unusual pairing , but one that can work if you both admire each others qualities and accept each others spiritual gifts .

Neither of you feels casual about anything ! When you first met your Scorpio beloved you may have felt this person was more fascinating than anyone youd ever met . Perhaps you noticed that he or she had qualities you wish you had , too .

Your steady , calm demeanor will give solid grounding to them as they weather their fluctuating emotions , and this is certainly a big part of your attraction . However , because Scorpios do n't  like to discuss their feelings freely , and Taurus are not given to examining feelings frequently , powerful resentments could build up and be swept under the rug .

Neither of you will become distracted from the goals you 've set . This also means that neither of you is very flexible or good at compromising , which can lead to dead-lock . This kind of stand-off interrupts the flow between you , so be mindful of conflicts and ask yourself if there is a way to compromise . <p> When it comes to handling finances , Scorpios really excel . Their sign rules the natural 8th house- of joint resources . Your sign rules another financial house , the 2nd house- of personal wealth .

Soon , you will find yourself asking his or her advice on how you can best handle the negotiations in your own life . <p> Both of you are reserved and not especially outgoing . Neither of you likes the dating scene and having to continually tell your life story to strangers . You are both highly possessive lovers too , but you wo n't find it causes conflicts .

You know I am thorough here it is ! <h> The Precession of the Equinoxes : What Sign Am I Now ? <p> Or , more simply said , " Am I still a Leo ? " <p> By Susan Miller April 19th , 2016 <p> It started as any other January morning . It was January 14 , 2011 , and I was excited because I had my special annual talk in New York coming up the next day , where I discuss the year ahead . The event was entirely sold out , so there was plenty to do updates to ticket sales , flowers to be delivered , guest lists to double-check , discussions with the Club chef , and name tags to print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we were all operating at top speed . Things were under control . I had booked a very early hairdresser appointment before 9:00 a.m. because I felt it was best to get that done first . My event was to be the morning of the following day , a Saturday . As I walked in , I gave a kiss to my hairdresser on both cheeks and proceeded toward my chair carrying my paper bag of coffee , breakfast muffin , and The New York Times , along with my laptop and cell phone . I was set and planned to handle some last minute details from there . <p> Sitting in my hairdressers chair , after he had completed my trim , as the sound of the blow dryer began to buzz around my ears , my cell phone started to make strange popping sounds like popcorn popping incredibly fast . Text messages were suddenly coming in furiously , faster than I had ever seen any come in before . At first I thought the sound of the hair dryer was making me hear things that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the texts were exploding from the press . There were 23 texts and 10 phone messages , and it was n't even 9:00 a.m. yet . My office was texting me , too get back here ! <p> What had happened ? I worried that a terrible disaster had hit , but was relieved to hear it was not that , but something I never could have imagined or anticipated . <p> Five days earlier , on January 9 , a lifestyle reporter named Bill Ward working for the Minneapolis Star Tribune had discovered a previous article dated October 23 , 2007 , and posted on LiveScience.com , which reported that the astrological signs used in newspapers were all wrong and that you are likely reading the wrong sign . The story went on to explain that this was due to a gradual westward shift of the constellations over thousands of years , called the precession of the equinoxes . The reporter assumed the astrological community as well as the general public knew nothing of this , and in addition , there were " new discoveries , " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as urgently as he would have announced the cure for a modern-day plague . <p> Ward called on Parke Kunkle , an astronomer who currently holds a seat on the board of the Minnesota Planetarium Society , to make a comment . Ward jumped on the opportunity to " teach " the astrological community a thing or two about science . Basic to all scientific study is proper research , but neither Mr. Ward nor Mr. Kunkle called a single astrologer before going to press . <p> Mr. Ward reported that Mr. Kunkle had " discovered " a 13th sign of the zodiac , Ophiuchus , that was found near the celestial equator at the end of Scorpio and beginning of Sagittarius that is typically depicted as a man wrangling a serpent . " Ophiuchus , " pronounced OFF-ee-YOU-Kus or alternatively , OFF-YOO-Kus , means " serpent-bearer " in Greek , and should be added immediately as a new zodiac sign . The story went on to say you were likely a member of the sign previous to yours , so if you thought you were a Virgo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the topic began to trend all over the world . The reporter had presented not one , but two , very complex ideas to discuss , each somewhat unrelated to the other : 1 ) adding a new zodiac sign ( never done on a whim ) , and 2 ) the whole concept of the precession of the equinoxes . The story was clearly made to discredit astrologers , and astronomer Kunkle freely admitted later he had assumed astrologers know nothing about the precession of the equinoxes but we do . <p> I knew the Minneapolis Star Tribune story was wrong , but the situation was not an easy one to address because astrologers were now in the horrendous position of having to disagree publically with a scientist and a newspaper journalist to an already inflamed , now doubtful public . The concept required discussion and explanation but the 24/7 news cycle and social media favors rapid-fire sound bytes . <p> The headlines were all very much the same no matter what sign you think you are , it has changed today , so start reading that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was understandably upset , for the article suggested that the astrologers , through their ignorance of astronomy , had duped them . News of this small story was quickly picked up by bloggers , on Twitter , and on Facebook . Suddenly the story went viral , trending in every country of the world , and my life was being turned upside down . <p> By January 14 , five days after the story appeared January 9 ( and I had seen some casual buzz about it from the Twitterati , a term I use to denote frequent , opinion leader posters on Twitter ) , every major news organization was calling any astrologer they could find for comment . By then , news of this tiny story in the lifestyle section of a Minneapolis newspaper had gone round the world and reached me early that morning in my hairdressers chair . <p> I was finding that when I did describe things correctly , the journalist or on-air host did n't  understand what I had to say and summed up things incorrectly . Or , I found that my words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patently wrong , much to my horror when I saw my interviews on air later . Many times the reporter , who seemed so warm and friendly on meeting , was really out to discredit astrology and me any way he could . Because I am trusting , I did not think to put on my armor . Not all journalists were like this , but many were , and it made for a tumultuous time . At CNN , things went so horribly wrong , I did something I swore never to do I called the reporter afterward and asked that he redo the interview that had already aired . Much to CNNs credit , they invited me back two days later to have a second interview with a different reporter , who this time got things right . <h> Hipparchus of Nicaea Discovered the Precession of Equinoxes in 134 BC <p> The fact is , the theory of the precession of the equinoxes was not started by the astronomers at the Minneapolis planetarium at all , but was developed in approximately in 134 BC by the Greek mathematician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaea ( 190-120 BC ) . <p> It was obvious that if Hipparchus had developed the concept of the precession of the equinoxes in 134 BC , that meant modern-day astrologers have had 2,000 years to study it and we did ! <p> Hipparchus is credited with founding the precepts of trigonometry , so he was certainly a giant in his time , and of course , that was only one of his discoveries . Back in those years , Hipparchus noticed that the earths axis had changed directions and that the constellations were gradually moving in retrograde motion . How Hipparchus developed this correct discovery is interesting , so I will describe it here . <p> Hipparchus had been looking at a brand new star in the Scorpio constellation , and the appearance of that star gave him the idea of cataloguing all the stars he knew about the list numbered over 1,000 stars . He also posted the position of each stars latitude and longitude . To this day , that list is considered to be remarkably accurate . <p> Next , Hipparchus looked up observations noted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 years before and noticed that those stars had shifted from the fixed points that they had occupied in their constellations . After he made those comparisons , he must have instantly known he was on to something . Those changes had to be a result of the movement of the axis of the earth in the direction of the apparent daily motion of the stars . This causes the equinoxes to fall ever so slightly earlier than they had the year before . <h> A Few Scientific Facts and Definitions of Terms <p> Before I go on , I need to define the term " equinox " : either of the two points on the celestial sphere at which the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator . <p> That definition probably does n't  help you , so I will make it clearer . I need to show you how we fix the position of planets in astrology . <p> The planets in our solar system generally exist on the same plane and move along a circular belt that surrounds the center of the earth called the " ecliptic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where all the constellations of the zodiac are found . In other words , those constellations are not found all over the sky , but in a very narrow band that circles the earth . The constellations are of different size and brightness , but in astrology , those things do n't  matter . Some constellations overlap each other a bit , and again , that 's not relevant . All twelve signs of the zodiac are comprised of 30 degrees ( 30 x 12 = 360 degrees in a circle ) . Remarkably , this holds true in all astrologic theory , whether you subscribe to Western astrology or Vedic astrology , which is practiced in India . <p> There are two imaginary circles we can draw in our minds eye to help us pinpoint the positions of the planets . One is to draw the equator , the thin circle you draw around the center of earth , separating earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres . When you extend this line into space , it is called the " celestial equator . " ( This is good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section . ) The celestial equator is important because it provides a standard of reference for positional measurements without the necessity of taking the varying distances of the planets and stars involved . <p> The ecliptic is defined as the path that the Sun will take , as it seems to travel around the earth . ( This is an apparent motion , not a real one , because of course , the earth travels around the Sun , not the other way around . Thinking about this from our vantage point on earth is a legitimate way to help us fix the planets positions . ) The ecliptic lies at an angle to the celestial equator , and where these two elliptical circles touch , twice , sets 1 ) the Vernal equinox , marking the start of Aries , and 2 ) the Autumnal equinox , marking the start of the sign of Libra . <p> Now we need a little bit more science , but this next section is easier to understand , and actually quite fun to think about . It involves the three ways the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> The Three Ways the Earth Rotates , Plus a Wobble <p> One type of earths rotation is " diurnal motion " which , very simply , is the way the earth rotates to give us day and night . Every day we have a sunrise and sunset that 's this rotation . <p> Another type is earths revolution , which is the fact that the earth takes a year to revolve around the Sun , giving us the four seasons . Lovely , yes ? Sometimes we take all this for granted ! <p> A third way the earth moves is a little more complicated so I will describe it this way . Imagine a gigantic dinner plate that holds the earth , its moon , and all the planets , all spinning together as a group , our solar system . You can see it as you remember you were taught in grade school or how you saw those planets aligned at the Planetarium . The earth and all the planets will keep spinning on this big ( imaginary ) white dinner plate through all twelve signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles per second , in the Milky Way . It will take earth 2,000+ years to get through one sign , and approximately 26,000 years to complete a visit through all 12 signs of the zodiac . You have heard of the Age of Pisces and the Age of Aquarius this is what they are talking about the departure of the earth from its 2,000-year visit to Pisces and its recent ( or impending ) entrance into the sign of Aquarius . <p> There is some disagreement about whether we have entered into the Age of Aquarius yet or not some astrologers say we are there , and others say its still 600 or more years away . ( I say we arrived the minute Sputnik went up in the 1950s . ) Each Age is over 2,000 years , so its hard to be specific about start and end dates . The Age of Pisces saw the birth of Christianity and the age of faith . The art reflected the emphasis of the times , and the beautiful cathedrals came out of the Age of Pisces . Astrologers look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Great Ages . <p> The earth , as it spins , creates a wobble like a fast spinning top . The term " precession of the equinoxes " refers to that motion or wobble . This means that certain fixed stars , such as Castor , which used to be in Gemini , is now in Cancer . In Western astrology we use a tropical ( or fixed ) zodiac , and refer to the area of the sky named after the constellations , rather than the constellations themselves . That is a vital concept , and you will see me mention it several times so that you do n't  miss it . <p> Here is another way of understanding this concept of earths wobble . Imagine a round piece of fruit like an orange ( earth ) with a long metal rod pierced through the orange at an angle ( signifying the North and South Poles ) . The earths North Pole , over the course of approximately 25,868 years , now points directly to the North Star , Polaris , but wont do so forever . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will point to another star altogether , such as Vega . This refers to one way the earth rotates , in a backward ( or retrograde ) motion , through all the zodiac signs , each called Great Years , each of which take a little over 2,000 years . <p> That will be important for you to know , for it relates to the Great Ages that we will talk about in regard to the Mayan Calendar in the next chapter . You may have heard that earth is moving out of the Age of Pisces , a period of over 2,000 years of faith and emphasis on religion , to the Age of Aquarius , an age of peace and brotherhood , and also likely to be a time of vast technological change . <h> The Great Ages 2,000 Years Long from Leo to Aquarius <p> The earliest of the Great Years known to us is the Leo Great Year ( 10,000 to 8000 BC ) . After that came the Age of Cancer ( 8000 to 6000 BC ) , Age of Gemini ( 6000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 BC ) , Age of Aries ( 2000 to 1 BC ) , Age of Pisces ( approximately 1 to 2000 AD ) , and the Age of Aquarius is due next , or , what I feel we are in now . While there were Great Ages prior to Leo , we measure those years by what can be seen as emphasized through culture . The Leo Great Year corresponds to the cave paintings of great beauty in Lascaux , France , some of the earliest artwork ever found , and typifies the creativity of Leo . The Age of Cancer showed the initiation of farming techniques and the start of structured housing , and speaks to the home-orientation of Cancer . Keep in mind that the earth is spinning in retrograde motion , so that we have the Age of Leo , followed by the Age of Cancer , and so forth , going backward . <p> To put astrology in context , astronomical observation began in Mesopotamia , where prominent constellations were recognized and named shortly after 3000 BC . Similarly , the astronomers/astrologers ( practitioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five wandering stars of Mercury , Mars , Venus , Jupiter , and Saturn , which , along with the Sun and moon , form the seven original planets . ( The word " planets " is derived from the Greek word for " wanderers . " ) <p> Babylonians , who lived in Mesopotamia from approximately 2000 BC through about 700 BC , are considered the worlds first great astronomers . The minutes and seconds of modern astronomical measurement derive from their numbering system . It was the Babylonians who introduced the concept of astrology and the zodiac as we know it today . ( Zodiac comes from the Greek word meaning " circle of animals " and that description is true for all signs but the air signs of Gemini ( twins ) , Libra ( scales ) , and Aquarius ( water bearer ) . The Virgin ( Virgo ) also is human , not animal , but the word zodiac covered all signs anyway . The Babylonians lived in the Great Age of Aries . <p> Finding out that the equinoxes were moving west is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It told us the constellation behind the Sun would shift slightly in retrograde ( backward ) motion at a rate of 1 degree every 72 years . The constellations will continue to keep moving and they will , someday , thousands of years from now , return to the original place they occupied in Babylonia , 26,000 years before , when astrology was born . That 's an important point worth reiterating the equinoxes will return eventually to the place the zodiac started , but not anytime soon . <p> The assumption of the Minneapolis Star Tribunes article was that astrologers do n't  know astronomy but we do . In fact , astrologers had long ago created an entire branch of astrology devoted to the study of the precession of the equinoxes called " Sidereal astrology " that takes the shift of the equinoxes 23 degrees into account . Reporter Ward did not call one astrologer for comment prior to going to press . If you search for this story on the Star Tribunes website , it has since been removed , but the LiveScience.com article is still there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign divisions which of course do not correspond to Western astrological thinking . The " new zodiac , " which the vast majority of astrologers reject ( and from what I could see by social media posts , the public also rejects ) , includes the following list of cusp dates , with the addition of a new sign Ophiuchus near the sign of Sagittarius , which would have pushed Pisces down the list to be the 13th sign . Under this method , the cusp dates get shifted and condensed . Here are the dates for the " new zodiac , " but I reiterate Western astrology does not recognize these divisions . <p> Capricorn : January 20 to February 16 <p> Aquarius : February 16 to March 11 <p> Pisces : March 11 to April 18 <p> Aries : April 18 to May 13 <p> Taurus : May 13 to June 21 <p> Gemini : June 21 to July 20 <p> Cancer : July 20 to August 10 <p> Leo : August 10 to September 16 <p> Virgo : September 16 to October 30 <p> Libra : October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 29 <p> Ophiuchus : November 29 to December 17 <p> Sagittarius : December 17 to January 20 <p> You will note the dates overlap by one day on each end , presumably contingent on the time of day that someone is born . <p> When it comes to a vote on whether Ophiuchus is a sign or not , I am on the side of Claudius Ptolemy , who was another esteemed Greek mathematician , astronomer , astrologer , and geographer . Ptolemy was the author of Tetrabiblos , a landmark work that established much of the tenets of astrology that we still use today . Ptolemy , who lived from approximately from 85 to 165 , is considered the father of modern astrology . He knew about the Ophiuchus and Cetus constellations and listed them on his list of 48 known constellations at the time . Ptolemy was among the most distinguished astrologers and intellectuals of his time , and we know he was involved in the debate about whether to list Ophiuchus or not he voted no . <p> ( As a point of information , today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole authority for assigning designations and names to celestial bodies , and they have divided the sky into 88 sections or " constellations . " ) <p> The Minneapolis Star Tribune made a common mistake when using the word " sign " to mean both " sign of the zodiac " ( such as Leo ) and " constellation " ( as in the constellation of Leo ) . They are not the same . <p> Said another way , many people confuse " constellation " with " Sun sign " ( other terms used are " birthday sign " or " zodiac sign " ) . Some people assume that we get our qualities from the constellations , but we do not . We all get our qualities from the planets , and in particular , our ruling planet contributes the most and is of paramount importance . <p> In a coming section , I will speak about the importance of your rising sign and how important it is for you to know it once you do , keep your eye on the ruling planet of your rising sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving you your signs characteristics . It is simply a beautiful grouping of stars that have been linked into a shape so that you may more easily spot it in the evening sky . We look up and we can see Pisces and the stars shaping two fish swimming upstream and downstream , or we marvel at the beauty of the archer of Sagittarius . <p> Constellations do not give you your traits the planet ruling your sign gives you those . The planets will give you your influences constellations are not capable of that either . In fact , the constellations are like a calibration system or big tape measure that allows us to refer quickly to where the planet will be traveling at any given time , and to make quick mathematical calculations in regard to the other planets in the sky , whether square ( 90 degrees ) or opposition ( 180 degrees ) and so forth . When we refer to a sign , we are referring to a section of the sky that is named after the constellation , not the constellation itself . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None for Ophiuchus or Cetus for they are not Planets but , Rather , Constellations ! <p> In astrology it is vital to know the planet(s) that rules your sign . In the next paragraph , here is a list for you , and if you memorize your ruling planet , you will find this to be very helpful as you read any material on astrology , including this article , or your monthly forecast on my site , AstrologyZone.com . You may also want to memorize the planet that rules your sign , once you discover it . <p> Planetary Rulers : Mars rules Aries . Venus rules Taurus and Libra . Mercury rules Gemini and Virgo . The moon rules Cancer , and the Sun rules Leo . Scorpio is the only sign ruled by two planets , the recently discovered Pluto ( 1930 ) and Mars . Jupiter rules Sagittarius . Saturn rules Capricorn . Aquarius ancient ruler is Saturn and astrologers tend to look at both , but might put a bit more emphasis on this signs modern ruler , Uranus . Finally , Pisces ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again , modern astrologers can , and often do , look to both planets for Pisces . <p> As you see , each of us has a sign and a ruling planet that bestows talents and gifts , and explains where you get your personality traits . You get those traits , not from the constellation but from the ruling planet associated with your sign . Without a ruling planet , you would have a sign that 's as empty as the little cartoon character , Casper the Ghost . ( Cute , but invisible ! ) <p> Ophiuchus does n't  even have a glyph associated with it to place in a chart ( considered important ) , for glyphs are reserved for the 12 zodiac signs , the planets , Sun , moon , and the major asteroids . No one would have any idea of what personality traits to assign to Ophiuchus . <p> Why would the ancient astrologers create such a confusing situation where the name of the sign is the same name of the constellation but not really related to each other ? That 's an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellations actually did line up perfectly with the path of the Sun . The Aries Sun was in the constellation of Aries , the Taurus Sun was in the constellation Taurus , and so forth . As said , in time , the equinoxes have drifted west at the rate of one degree every 72 years . <p> Back in ancient days , the sky was a big calendar that farmers used for knowing precisely when to plant seeds , reap their crops , and so forth , so starting with spring made sense . The planting season was a critical one , so it began the zodiac . To this day , Aries begins the zodiac on March 21 and begins the rhythm of life , which starts with the seed . Pisces is considered the last sign of the zodiac , and goes from February 19 to March 20 . <p> During the time astrology started , the astrologers did n't  know that there would be a shift in the constellations and that naming those constellations the same name as the signs could bring confusion . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 134 BC , a decision had to be made by the astrological community back then about how to make calculations ( astrology is very mathematical ) . The choice was whether to work with a fixed , unchanging zodiac , or one that moved . In Western astrology , the decision was made in favor of working with the fixed , unchanging points of the four seasons and keeping the zodiac stationary . In India , the choice was to work with a moving zodiac , called Vedic ( also called sidereal astrology ) , and their astrologers shift the whole chart 23 degrees retrograde , the precise amount of degrees each sign and planet would have moved due to the precession . <p> Your zodiac sign in Western astrology corresponds to the movement of the Sun in regard to the solstices and equinoxes . In other words , astrologers in the West base the chart calculations on the four points of summer , fall , winter , and spring . Those are fixed , unchanging points . This way of treating astrology is called tropical astrology . Your sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanging sky , not to the shifting belt of the constellations . <p> In India , the Vedic astrologers acknowledge the precession of the equinoxes in their calculations , and shift all the planets and constellations 23 degrees . Vedic astrology puts much more emphasis on the fast-moving moon , and in the West , we underscore the Sun . ( By the way , making the 23-degree shift is easily done on any present-day astrologers software program , so some Western astrologers do this to a chart , but 98 percent do not , simply because we feel the results do not produce as accurate results both in terms of personality description and forecasting . ) In both systems , Western and Vedic , the sky is divided into 12 signs to correspond with each of the 12 months , with each zodiac sign accounting for 30 degrees . <p> The reason why there are 12 signs and not 13 has to do with the lunation cycle . There are approximately twelve cycles of the Sun and new or full moon in a year . A Sun sign stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more days than a lunar month , that latter being 28 days . <p> In Western astrology , the Sun is king . In Vedic astrology , astrologers in India put more emphasis on the moon , which is a faster moving body than the Sun . In the West , the Sun is the face you give to the world , and the place in the chart that shows where you shine brightest a very Western cultural idea . The Sun indicates the father in the chart , or at the very least , authority figures . In India , the moon is more important , focusing on your inner feelings , emotions , love , family , conception , care for a child , and for mother . Each culture has a different emphasis . I am completely oversimplifying the two methods , and mean no disrespect to those who follow the Vedic method . I may have characterized things a bit too simply in the interest in clarity , but if I did go too far , forgive me . <h> Tropical ( Fixed ) Astrology of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize the precession of the equinoxes may be a difficult concept to take in , so let me show you in another way to demonstrate the way Western astrologers think about their favored tropical ( fixed zodiac ) method . Let 's say you bought a large , beautiful plot of land with many acres near an old country road that runs parallel to your land . You build a charming cottage on it , and the street your cottage is near , where all your mail is sent , is called Primrose Lane , so you call your cottage Primrose House . ( Not many people name their house , but stay with me on this . ) In time , the town rezones , and the name of the street in front of your darling cottage changes . Part of your house stills stands on Primrose Lane , but now most of the cottage stands on the same street , suddenly called Blue Bell Lane . Like many country roads , Primrose Lane runs straight into Blue Bell Lane as you go along that old dirt road . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . However , the name of the road in front of your house has changed . Your cottage is still called Primrose House . Even if someday the town rezones again and changes the name of the country road in front of your house to a completely new name , your house will remain the same yours , untouched and constant and you keep the same name . This is the theory behind Western " tropical " astrology that the vast majority of astrologers use today . The " road " ( constellation ) to your plot of land in front of your cottage ( your Sun sign ) would not change , and the road is the same too , but with a new name . The road ( constellation ) helps us find you . <p> In summarizing this concept , as Western astrologers we point to the piece of sky that is " owned " by your sign , and we do n't  give relevance to the name on the changing road ( constellation ) . <h> Western Astrology Corresponds to the Sun as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific terms , in Western astrology , your astrological zodiac sign corresponds to the position of the Sun as it sits in relationship to the two solstices ( June 21 and December 21 ) . At the solstice , the Sun is either nearest or farthest from the equator ( depending on if you live in Northern or Southern Hemisphere ) . In America , for example , June 21 marks the beginning of summer . That is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere , and December 21 brings the shortest day of the year . <p> The signs are also tied to the equinoxes ( March 21 and September 23 ) . The equinox is when the time of daylight is precisely equal to nighttime the two are in perfect balance . In springtime in northern latitudes , after March 21 , the light begins to increase in length ( number of hours ) of each day , and beginning September 23 , the number of hours of daylight decreases . ( If you live in the Southern Hemisphere , the reverse dates are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 23 . ) <p> People often ask me , since I write my forecasts based on the symbolism of nature in the Northern Hemisphere , can they be valid for the Southern Hemisphere , too ? Absolutely yes . Astrology works the same in all locations , Northern and Southern Hemispheres . Think of astrology as sensitive to the pace , forces , and rhythms of life , as determined through the mathematical patterns and cycles seen in nature . Those are enduring energies that are manifested in each of our lives , and within us , no matter where we are living at the time . You will always have free will to make your choice . The answer to the question is , then , the same you can read my forecasts or anyones in any part of the world and it will apply . Due to time zone changes , you may feel an aspect a day earlier or later , but that is all . <h> The Qualities and the Elements Form Some of the Structure of Astrology <p> Now let me show you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cant just make a sign active one day , on a whim like the Minneapolis Planetarium scientists thought you could . You need to take into account the three qualities and the four elements . <p> Each season has three months , and there are three different qualities . One is assigned to each of the signs falling within that three-month season . Consequently , within each season we find a cardinal , fixed , and mutable sign ( 3 ) . <p> Cardinal signs begin a season , define direction , and produce energetic people who enjoy change and pioneering into new areas , sometimes for the very sake of change . ( The cardinal signs are Aries , Cancer , Libra , and Capricorn . ) <p> Fixed signs are strong leaders and remain true to goals . The fixed signs fall in the middle of each of the four seasons and are the standard-bearer or powerful pillar for their particular season . Thus , you have Taurus , Leo , Scorpio , and Aquarius serving as the fixed signs . For example , Leo , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Northern Hemisphere latitudes , and in the same regions , Taurus brings , in May , the most quintessential expression of spring . In Southern Hemispheres , just substitute the words " winter " and " fall " respectively . <p> Mutable signs are the most communicative and flexible and are excellent in a crisis , as they are conceptual and think on their feet . Those signs are Gemini , Virgo , Sagittarius , and Pisces . The mission of the mutable signs is to get you ready to transition into the next season , accounting for why people of these mutable signs are so adaptable . As you see , in astrology , we assign characteristics from what nature teaches us about the time of the year you were born . <p> The zodiac signs are also assigned one of the four elements to each of the signs and are classified by fire , air , water , and earth signs ( 4 ) . Fire signs are enthusiastic and often creative . Air signs are quite analytical and intellectual , and they love a good debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reliable . Water signs have a high degree of emotional intelligence and are intuitive . They are quite compassionate , too . <p> When an element is paired with one of the qualities listed above , you have 4 elements x 3 qualities totaling twelve signs ( 12 ) for twelve months of the year , each of which is unique . No combination is repeated , as you will see here : Aries is fire-cardinal ; Taurus is earth-fixed ; Gemini is air-mutable ; Cancer is water-cardinal ; Leo is fire-fixed ; Virgo is earth-mutable ; Libra is air-cardinal ; Scorpio is water-fixed ; Sagittarius is fire-mutable ; Capricorn is cardinal-earth ; Aquarius is air-fixed , and Pisces is water-mutable . From this pairing even more unique qualities of each of the signs can be gleaned too numerous to list here ! <p> As you see , if you add a thirteenth sign , what quality would it have ? What element would it be ? Three qualities times four elements equal twelve no room for thirteen . <h> Balance and Symmetry Are Key in Astrology <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize why Ophiuchus can not become a sign unto itself now or in the future . <p> Astrology is based on polarities . Aries and Libra share the same axis , as do Taurus-Scorpio , Gemini-Sagittarius , Cancer-Capricorn , Leo-Aquarius , and Virgo-Pisces . These signs are tied to one another in interesting ways , working to balance one another and to bring the gift that each other possesses out in the open . The opposite sign also takes those gifts and often will bring that talent or proclivity to a new , more evolved place . This is something I wrote extensively about in my book " Planets and Possibilities " ( Warner Books ) . In astrology , you need the yin and yang another reason a thirteenth sign would not happen . <p> In the end , Mr. Kunkle was forced to admit he did n't  know astrology , never studied it , or even read one book . That served as a gentle kind of retraction that came later . <p> I hope you have come to understand more about the rich history that astrology brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must read for the sign you always thought you were , and came to love .
