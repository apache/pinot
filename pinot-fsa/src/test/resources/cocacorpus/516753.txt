The recommended file to use is a small ' needle file ' of the triangular shape . File evenly and carefully , it may only take a few strokes to gain a reasonable slot and be sure to remove any rough edges/burs . <p> After these few simple mods are carried out your bridge should perform as good as any , bear in mind heavier gauge strings will aid the stability of the bridge not to mention improving sustain and tone . <h> Pickups <p> Your stock pickups are not wax potted if you own a Japanese Fender Jaguar . This means the cavitys within the windings/bobbin of the pickup will cause microphonic feedback if you use the guitar in high gain situations . When wax potting is carried out it encases the entire pickup so that there are no cavitys eliminating a large percentage of the possibility of microphonic feedback . Here is a wax potting link that takes you step by step through the procedure . Its not difficult to do but safety is paramount , be sure to wear eye and hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the melt wax . <p> Alternatively you can upgrade your pickups with Fender Jaguar replacements by a reputable brand like Seymour Duncan ( SD ) , Fender USA re-issue , Lollar or Novak . However some players go one further by fitting such as : SD JB Jr ( a humbucking pickup that fits into a single coil pickup cavity ) , SD Cool Rails ( a single coil pickup that is hum cancelling but stays reasonably true to original Jaguar pickup specs ) and even DiMarzio Super Distortion S ( single coil sized ) humbucker . It is all down to personal choice but remember .... you own a Fender Jaguar , keep it that way and try to stay true to what the guitar is . Plus if you decide to re-sale the guitar , irreversible modifications will lower the value of it . <h> The Tremelo System <p> This is a detailed diagram of the Fender Jaguars synchronised tremelo system . <p> The Jaguars tremolo system offers many possibilities- you can set it to hard tail , lock it off so that string breakage will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light " shimmers " or set for more extreme whammy bar tricks . On setting up the lock button , you have to make small adjustments with the tension screw to find the point that when the guitar is in pitch the lock button will slde effortlessly just under the plate almost touching . The reason for this as mentioned is so that when the trem is locked breaking a string will not send all the tuning flat ( with the loss of tension ) . <p> If you do choose to use the trem a common adjustment is to use a piece of insulation tape near the end of the arm where it sits in the socket so that you have more control/dip when in use . However , this is'nt very stable and the arm can fall out quite easily . I found a more permanent adjustment much better , using a vice i slightly bent the arm upwards at the point it is right angled and also slightly bent it upwards where the arm 's shape kicks-up about midway . This means I have maximum control/dip with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram the red line represents the degree the arm was ' bent ' to : <h> The Fender ' mute ' <p> Fitting a Fender ' Mute ' on a CIJ Jag like the vintage models have is cheap to do , it looks ' snazzy ' and can open up new possibilities as far as sounds go . The mute itself cost 's around $15 new , this comes without the plunger and spring so you will have to make a cylinder shape plunger out of hard plastic ( or other material ) and buy a suitable spring . <p> Homemade plunger with spring <p> Also the mute does'nt have the foam on it either so i used a piece of PC mouse pad , you could also use doorstrip or similar fabric . <p> The other things needed are : <p> 14mm Bradpoint drill bit <p> 2 x 3.55mm x 20mm countersunk self tapping screws <p> metal countersink <p> Drill <p> Drill stand <p> You can see that on any Jag scratchplate there is a pre-drilled hole where the mute spring/plunger is fitted . I used this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Scratchplate illustration <p> Drilling illustration <p> Then i removed everything that would be in the way of the drill stand so that it would sit flat to the body thus drilling a 90 degrees hole , i set the depth plunge so the bore hole would be 36mm deep : <p> Once cleaned up i tried the homemade plunger to see if it fitted ok ... <p> Then started to fit the mute . The two larger holes in the mute allow the bridge posts to go through , whilst the smaller ones are to attach the mute to the body of the guitar . The mute was not countersunk for the self tappers so i did this with a metal countersink bit , if you do n't  the screwheads stand proud and you have to set your bridge higher . CHROME-TASTIC ! : <p> The mute fitted <p> Fitted and happy but as i set it back up and try everything out i notice you have to have your bridge set higher to compensate for the mute , this may not suit everyone and players that like low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher bridge : <p> Conclusion : If you have the skillz and tools this is an inexpensive mod that visually adds a bit of mojo to your CIJ Jag , in operation i noticed the mute throw the tuning a little ( about a quarter note ) but i 'm putting that down to the material i used ( mouse pad ) something softer may be better . In comparison to palm muting it does sound totally different and free 's your strumming hand away from the bridge . <p> The finished look <h> Pot Hacking <p> The Fender Jaguar is renowned for it 's bright tone and some people do find the guitar too trebly . There is a simple modification to resolve this other than swapping out the tone pot for one of lower value . If you wire in a 1meg resistor in parallel with the pot , it halves the resistance of the 1Meg pot to 500k and makes the pickups sound more like a strat 's . This can also be done on the volume pot but you may notice a slight drop in output .

This particular Mustang is a 1966 model that has been refinished . The control plate , switches , pickups , pots , input jack , capacitor and wiring are all new . The only thing original was the brass shielding plates and one original ground wire . <h> Getting Started <p> You are obviously going to need a clean , stable work area with proper ventalation . Fire up the soldering iron , lay all your tools and materials out , within easy reach and break out the guitar . Hopefully , the pickguard and control plate are already off and ready to go . Let 's get started . <p> Here , you see all the new parts installed onto the pickguard and ready for final wiring . <h> Wiring the Switches and Pickups <p> Here , I 've grounded the switch . The wire used was the excess wire from the capacitor . Apply your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , make contact with the soldering iron to the flux , then immediately touch the area with the solder . Hold it there for 1-2 seconds ... you should see the solder do it 's job . If not , the soldering iron is either not hot enough , or you need more practice . Also , please notice which tab you solder by noting where the tab is , in relation to the pickguard holes and pickup . <p> Repeat the same thing for the second switch . Because of the close proximity of the connection to the pickup , I had to temporarily remove the pickup . Once you add the ground wire , reinstall the pickup to the pickguard . ( Please note that the wire is n't soldered to the switch body yet . What you are seeing is the acid core flux . ) <p> Here , you see the second ground wire you soldered . In addition you should see the lead black wire from the control plate/cavity . Make this happen . <p> In this pic , you 'll notice that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two ways to do this . You 'll see what I mean in a minute or so ... <p> To make the " Out Of Phase " part of the Mustang happen , here you see the ' criss-cross ' pattern starting to take shape . Please notice that I did n't cut the wire ... I simply stripped the cloth back , twisted the wire to open it up and slipped it over the tab . <p> Here , we take that same white wire and make the jump to the neck pickup 's switch . <p> You guessed it ! The end of the line for this white wire . <p> Now ... let 's do that again . This time , it 's the black wire . <p> Here , I 'm using my solder to apply flux . Probably not the smartest thing in the world , but I usually get impatient ... <p> Ok ... now for the fun part . We 've just wired all the lead wires that go into to the contol cavity . Now , we are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please notice the wire and the switch in relation to the pickguard , and it 's holes . Also , notice how I ran the wire ( through one tab and back into the other ) . You 'll want to apply flux and solder both tabs . <p> Here is the same switch , but now I 've just installed the white wire . <p> Now for the other switch : <p> And voil+ ! Here 's what the switches and pickups should look like . <h> Control Plate Wiring <p> Well , the hard part is over . Now for the easier part . ( Trust me ) <p> With this particular guitar , the ground wire from the brass/copper shielding was cut too short to be of any use . So , instead of completely replacing this wire , I wanted to show off my mad skillz and do a wire splice for youse guys . First , pull the cloth back ( or denude the plastic shielding ) far enough back to work . Apply flux to both wires and solder them together . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm talking about . <p> Now , you 'll want to get the cloth as close to one another as possible and slip a 1/2 " long piece of shrink tubing . Apply a bit of flame and you are done . <p> Ok . You should have fed the white and black wires from the pickguard to the control cavity . And now you have one white wire and two black wires . Strip back the two black wires and get ready to ground those bad boys to the volume pot . Here , you 'll see where I 've lightly scratched the area and applied flux . Apply flux to the wires , too . <p> Now , solder away . It should like the picture below . If not , you need more practice . LOL !

@@80331596 @1831596/ 124136 @qwx744136 <h> Contents <h> The Tremolo <p> The Mustang uses a unique tremolo known as the Fender Dynamic Vibrato . It is a very sensitive tremolo capable of bending the pitch many steps . However , if setup correctly it can be made to accommodate subtle playing styles . The tremolo should be adjusted so that the tremolo arm can sit comfortably in your hand while playing . For most people this means the arm will be parallel to the body of the guitar . To adjust the projection of the arm two things can be adjusted . The first being the height of the tailpiece . A 3/32 " allen wrench fits into the two small holes on top the tailpiece to adjust it 's height . The higher you set the tailpiece the farther towards the bridge it will lean . Adjust it lower and it will lean farther back . The second function for adjusting the tailpiece angle is by moving where the springs attach to the posts . Remove with tremolo plate from the guitar to access the springs . You will see there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The far notch will make the the tailpiece lean back , the higher notch will decrease the tension causing the tailpiece to lean farther forward . Adjusting both the tailpiece height and the spring notch to balance stably with whatever strings you choose will allow you to set the tremolo arm however you find most comfortable . <h> The Bridge <p> The Mustang uses Fender 's floating bridge design . You may have noticed that the bridge shifts around as you use the tremolo . This is part of the design and enables smooth action of the tremolo . It is similar to the Jazzmaster/Jaguar bridge , the only difference being the saddles . The saddles are a fixed height matching the radius of the Mustang fretboard . The height of the bridge can be adjusted to set the action to your preference . A 0.05 " allen wrench fits in the holes on the side of the bridge to raise or lower the bridge . <h> The Tremolo Arm <p> The tremolo arm is attached to the tailpiece of the tremolo and held in place with the grub screw on the end of the tailpiece .

Originally an intermediate level model it has been popular with smaller handed guitarists as well as people who just like the unique tone and feel of a shortscale guitar . It has maintained strong popularity in Japan and reissues are now being produced in many varieties by Fender Japan . <h> Contents <h> Fender Mustang : The Beginning <p> The Fender Mustang was put into production in August of 1964 . It evolved from the need to have an intermediate level guitar between their popular student model guitars , the Musicmaster and Duo Sonic and the more " professional " models of the Telecaster , Jaguar , et al . The body design was reminiscent of the Musicmaster and Duo Sonic but had the addition of an offset body similar to a Jaguar . It also had a brand new tremolo system known as the Dynamic Fender Vibrato and two pickups with a switch for each ( ON/OFF/OUT OF PHASE ) . It was offered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was originally offered in the colors red , white and blue . Later these colors became known as Dakota Red , Olympic White and Daphne Blue . <p> The Mustang of this period was a slab body with no contours made of either poplar or mahogany . The neck was maple with a rosewood fretboard and the fingerdots on the fretboard were clay . The walnut " skunk stripe " commonly found on Fender 's long scale guitars was never present on shortscale Fenders . It had slot head Kluson Deluxe tuners with white plastic buttons . <h> The Early Headstock <p> In 1964 , before the sale of the Fender company to CBS , all Fender guitars were equipped with Kluson Deluxe tuners with white buttons , and this student guitar was no exception . As for the decal , this small headstock had the " Transition Fender Logo " decal . <h> The End Of An Era <p> In January of 1965 , CBS bought the Fender company and started making changes right away , however the complete change-over would take until late summer/early fall . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would replace it with the F-tuner ( aka " F-keys " ) , larger headstocks would now crown the Mustang and the " L " series of serial number plates would now begin with an " F. " <p> 1969 Competition Mustang <h> Introduction of the 69 Comp Stang <p> In May 1969 , Fender introduced the Competition Series Mustang . These guitars brought the addition of arm and body contours to the mustang body as well as a racing stripe added below the newly appointed arm contour . These guitars came in bright new colors and for a short time matching headstocks . The guitars came in Red Competition ( w/cream stripes ) , Orange Competition ( w/dark orange stripes ) , and Blue Competition ( w/light blue stripes ) , although the plain red , white and blue Mustangs were also available at this time . Also , about this time ( 1969-1971 ) Fender finally phased out the 22.5 " scale neck . <p> Sometime in 1970 , Fender discontinued the regular Mustang and continued to produce the Competition Mustang . In this same year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing , method of dating was adopted . ( More on this later ) . <p> In 1972 , month unknown , the Competition Mustang ceased to be produced . In it 's stead , the Mustang was now finished in 3-Tone Sunburst , Natural , Walnut , Black , White , and Blonde . With the Sunburst and Blonde Mustangs , enter the Ash body . <h> 1976 to 1982 <p> In the year of the American Bicentennial , the Mustang goes all ash with black pickguards and black-tipped whammy bars . CBS , ever seeking to streamline production , makes the knobs common with that of the Stratocaster and the tuners now have chrome buttons like the rest of Fender 's models . One-piece maple necks are also now available as an option . 1977 saw the introduction of the antigua mustang and serial numbers were moved to the headstock . Due to declining sales , 1982 saw the end of the production line for Mustang . It was replaced with the Fender Bullet and Fender Lead models . <p> Note the Stratocaster knobs and extra string tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrected the Mustang . The ' 69 Fender Mustang and were offered in Vintage Olympic White and Sonic Blue . Available only in 24 " scale with the " A " width neck , ( more on this later ) , the Mustang was a near perfect replication . However , the wood used , Basswood , was far less superior to the previously used poplar , mahogany and ash . Tone and sustain were greatly compromised in this author 's opinion . The necks were shot in poly instead of nitro , and the brandished the " Made In Japan " logo , under the poly on the back of the neck , just above the neck pocket .

The company was forced to change it when Gretsch claimed prior rights to the name .

@@80331600 @1831600/ <h> Fender Jaguar 124136 @qwx744136 <p> The Jaguar is a guitar designed by Leo Fender , originally intended to take over from the Stratocaster and Telecaster . Its popularity was somewhat hampered by its complicated electronics and other idiosyncrasies , as well as the conservative nature of guitarists . Despite this , it has managed a cult status over the last 20 years thanks to its prominent use in alternative bands . <h> In the Beginning <p> The Fender Jaguar was created in 1962 , just 4 years after Fender introduced the Jazzmaster .. The Jaguar has the same offset body as the Jazzmaster . They also shared the same bridge and floating tremolo that was very unique at that time . But there are differences between these two offset body guitars . The two main differences being the scale length ( Jazzmasters have a standard Fender 25.5 inch scale while the Jaguar has a shorter 24 inch scale ) and the pickups ( Jazzmasters have overwound single coils where the Jaguar 's pickups are almost identical to that of a Fender Stratocaster ) , the Jaguar 's pickups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve sustain . <p> The Jaguar and Jazzmaster both have two circuits and share the unique rhythm circuit , this allowed a pre-set tone for rhythm playing but the ' Lead ' circuit is different with slider switches instead of the toggle switch . The Jaguar also has a ' Low cut ' switch that reduces bass frequencies whilst using the Lead circuit , because this gives the circuit a restricted trebly sound it was commonly known as the " strangle switch " and was popular among 60 's Surf guitarists . A few other differences that the Jaguar has is the ' mute ' which only features on vintage and vintage re-issue Jaguars , the chrome control plates and improved RF shielding . <p> A white Fender Jaguar . <h> Jaguars Today <p> Jaguar values today are lower compared to other full scale models because of the shorter scale length . The pickups are better shielded and more powerful which eliminated some of the hum problems previously associated with the Jazzmaster , however , Japanese Jaguar pickups are not factory wax potted so guitar players looking to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can be resolved by having the pickups wax potted by a tech or by upgrading them . Initially surf band 's loved the shorter 24 inch scale as it suited their music but during later years the Jaguar became unfashionable and was discontinued in 1975 . They dropped in value which is beleived to be one of the reasons alternative musicians eg. Nirvana , Placebo , Red Hot Chilli Peppers etc. started to use them due to it being an affordable Fender with quirky looks . The guitar soon gained a cult status like its brother the Jazzmaster because of its association with alternative styles of music and also the success of these bands , making it once again popular and came back into production during the 1990s . The current models available that stay fairly true to the original 60 's Jaguars are the AV and CIJ . There are other models available based on variations of popular modifications such as the Jaguar HH . <p> A ' Bottom Master ' Jaguar <h> Jaguar spin-offs <p> During the 90s and later years due to the Fender Jaguar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the Jagmaster and the Fender Jag-Stang . These guitars offered variations on the Jaguar theme such as humbucking pickups , different tremolo systems and different electronics to name a few . <h> Common Jaguar Upgrades <p> The Fender Jaguar arguably does have a few design faults in its stock form . These minor problems can be solved with a little knowledge and patience , yet most players and owners opt for common upgrades . Here are a list of a few common upgrades and why : <p> The Bridge <p> The Jaguar bridge ( like the Jazzmaster 's ) is notoriously problematic- it buzzes , rocks and the grub screws work themselves loose . There are many solutions to solve these problems and this is a widely argued topic amongst Jaguar owners . <p> Jaguar bridge . <p> Mustang bridge ( a common Jaguar mod ) . <p> Common modifications include ; <p> i ) setting the saddle grub screws with glue or grease so they do n't fall out , <p> ii ) cutting down the length of the D and G intonation screws so they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge posts with insulation tape so that the bridge is set rather than rocking ( however this does not let the tremelo system work efficiently ) , <p> iv ) filing the string slots deeper on the saddles so that the strings do n't jump during playing . <p> Alternatively there are upgrades such as fitting a Fender Mustang bridge or a TOM ( tune-o-matic ) bridge . There is also a device called a " buzzstop " that fits behind the bridge guiding the strings downwards thus creating more tension on the bridge , some players swear by these to reduce bridge buzz and they allegedly improve sustain . <p> All down to personal preference . <p> The pickups <p> If you have a Japanese model Fender Jaguar the pickups are not wax potted ( which makes them prone to microphonic feedback in high gain situations ) , fairly low output and have a ' spiky ' treble sound to them ( although this is part of the Jaguars personality ) . Some players find the stock pickups fine and feel no need for upgrades , yet others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distortion look towards upgrades . <p> Apart from the solution of wax potting the original stock pickups there are choices of Jaguar pickups available from various companies such as : Seymour Duncan , Fender USA vintage reissue , Lollar and Novak . Wiring in new pickups is usually a straight forward job especially if they are Jaguar pickup replacements , for additional info here is a schematic . <h> Fender Jaguar set-up <p> Set-up admission from a CIJ user <p> A general rule of thumb when setting up your Fender Jaguar is to use heavier gauge strings such as 11s . If this prospect is n't what you would normally do consider the fact that the Jag has a shorter scale so moving up a gauge from your usual choice will not be noticeable , plus it helps bridge stability , sustain and tone . <p> Considering the bridge modifications have been carried out and the intonation is correct that leaves us with the ' playablity ' of the guitar .... <p> Style <p> Depending on your style of playing the Jag 's action will matter . Most players prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering the bridge ( which helps eliminate ' buzz ' ) and raising the saddles . However this will mean the D and G intonation screws will need cutting shorter so that as mentioned before they do not encroach on the strings . The neck 's truss rod may need adjusting and , whilst it is always advised that if you do n't have sufficient guitar knowledge you should let a guitar tech carry out this work you can attempt this yourself with great care , once again I state take great care when adjusting truss rods , overturning can cause irreversibile damage ! <p> We will assume the bridge 's problems have been resolved , you 've strung up with your preferred gauge of strings and stretchedthem in , we can now look at other adjustments . <p> Setting up the Tremolo System <p> The Jaguars tremolo system offers many possibilities- you can set it to hard tail , lock it off so that string breakage will not send all the guitars tuning flat , set it for light " shimmers " or set for more extreme whammy bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make small adjustments with the tension screw to find the point that when the guitar is in pitch the lock button will slde effortlessly just under the plate almost touching . The reason for this as mentioned is so that when the trem is locked breaking a string will not send all the tuning flat ( with the loss of tension ) . <p> If you do choose to use the trem a common adjustment is to use a piece of insulation tape near the end of the arm where it sits in the socket so that you have more control/dip when in use . However , this is'nt very stable and the arm can fall out quite easily . I found a more permanent adjustment much better , I slightly bent the arm upwards at the point it is right angled and also slightly bent it upwards where the arm 's shape kicks-up about midway .

A beautiful guitar with so many possibilites and so many varied styled users , what is it capable of ? Well , anything !

While Epiphone creates excellent quality copies of established Gibson guitars at more affordable prices , it has branched into creating some new and entirely independent models of its own , harking back to the days when it was Gibsons main rival . <h> Contents <h> Early Business <p> Epiphone dates back to the 1870s , in Smyrna , Turkey , where Greek founder Anastasios Stathopoulos made his own fiddles , lutes , and Lioutos . Stathopoulos moved to the United States of America in 1903 , and continued to make his original instruments , as well as mandolins , from Long Island City in Queens , New York . However , Anastasios died in 1915 , and his son , Epaminondas , took over . After two years , the company was known as The House Of Stathopoulos . Just after the end of World War I , the company started to make banjos . The company produced its Recording Line of Banjos in 1924 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Epiphone Banjo Company . They produced their first guitars in 1928 . Epi Stathopoulo died in 1943 . Unfortunately , control of the company went to his brothers , Orphie and Frixo , who were not as capable an owner as Epi . In 1951 , a four month long strike forced a relocation of Epiphone from New York to Philadelphia . <p> The company was founded by Greek national Epaminondas ( " Epi " ) Stathopoulos ( in Greek , +-+++++++-++++- +-+++--++-++++- ) when he inherited his father 's business , The House of Stathopoulos , in 1915 . The name Epiphone ( a combination of Epaminondas ' nickname " Epi " and " phone " , Greek for " sound " ) would not appear until 1924 . The company had a heated history of competition with Gibson until Stathopoulos died in 1943 , when it fell into a commercial slump . Weakened , it would be bought out by the competition in 1957 <h> Epiphone Today <p> Epiphone is now a subsidiary of Gibson , somewhat like Squier is a subsidiary of Fender ( the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-house by Fender ; in other words , there is no such thing as a " pre-Fender " Squier guitar ) . Because of this subsidiary relationship , many of the instruments look the same as the more expensive Gibson versions . However Epiphone still maintains its own line of professional-quality Archtop Guitars , a type of guitar used in Blues and Jazz music styles . The instruments given the Epiphone badge usually have roughly equal quality components to the Gibson ones , but may not be quite as elaborately decorated ( such as gold hardware on a Gibson model and chrome on an Epiphone model ) .

@@80331612 @1831612/ <p> I worked on a friend 's silverface Twin a while back and liked the Vibrato on his better than the effect on mine . Mine was decent , but I wanted more " chop " out of it with the Intensity turned up all the way . <p> Long story short , after reading up on Fender vibratos and studying the diagram for my amp , I thought I saw a quick fix . Basically , the vib circuit provides the guitar signal with 2 parallel paths to ground : one through the vib photoresistor and the other through the " low " end of the Intensity pot . All I did was disconnect the grounded end of the Intensity pot . <p> Now the only vib-related path to ground is through the photoresistor , and it has a slightly greater effect on the signal . The difference between full-on and full-off is greater . This could be because the " on " portion of each vib cycle is louder than it used to be , instead of the " off " portion being quieter . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mod boosts the amp 's overall signal a tiny bit , because none is leaking to ground through the Intensity pot anymore . Another side benefit is that the Intensity knob is useful through more of its sweep , with the effect noticeable down to about 2 . I can still hear the amp 's circuit noise being modulated when the effect is on 0 . I just stomp on the footswitch to remove the effect entirely . <p> I also ordered a new vibrato " roach " and a new cap for one of the tubes in the vibrato circuit . Both were original to the amp , and I figured replacements might improve things further . The " roach " is a neon lamp with a photoresistor shrink-tubed to it . Lamp leads stick out one end , cell leads stick out the other , and it looks like a four-legged bug . <p> Old on the left , new on the right . <p> The vibrato oscillator circuit makes the lamp flash , which is mildly cool to see when the amp 's open . The photoresistor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious mojo away to ground depending on the brightness of the light , and you 've got your vibrato effect . <p> Here are the new " roach " and new capacitor soldered in place . For reference , those input jacks are for the Vibrato channel . ( I reconnected the Intensity control to ground also . ) <p> The new " roach " has about as much " chop " as my mod did . However , it also ticks loudly -- a common problem with this circuit . Also , it 's only effective between about 5 and 10 on the Intensity knob . Below 5 the vibrato is so faint it 's virtually gone . I did a few things to deal with the ticking , but those were n't effective . <p> I did some quickee recordings while working , and overall I liked my modded version better than unmodded-with-new-bug . So I removed the new insect , put the old one back in , and disconnected the Intensity pot from ground again . Live-n-learn . <p> My nifty new Fender reverb/vibrato footswitch looks lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it has the correct cable it did n't correct the loud POP I get when the reverb 's on and I turn on the vibrato too . Basically when this happens , the vib switch is connecting about -50 volts ( negative ) to ground , and the sensitive reverb circuit " hears " this temporary rush of current in the footswitch cable . That 's what I think is happening anyway . <p> I tried putting a few low-value capacitors across the vib footswitch contacts . These took a little edge off the pop , but just barely . I noticed that if I hold my thumb firmly against both switch contacts , it softened the pop sound better than any of the caps I 'd tried . The human bod is essentially a big capacitor with personality problems , sooo .... <p> Enter the nasty old 5uF 50Volt electrolytic capacitor I 'd just replaced in the vibrato circuit . I clipped that in place of my thumb , and it takes the footswitch pop down quite a lot . Enough so that it 's barely noticeable if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solder it in there . <p> Works great so far . A side effect is that the vibrato effect lingers for a second or so after I turn it =off= . That makes sense , because the cap takes a while to recharge itself when that happens . I can live with that , though . WAY better than that gritty CLICK the footswitch was making before . <p> Last edited by filtercap on Mon Feb 18 , 2008 4:09 am ; edited 1 time in total <p> Works great so far .

@@80331623 @1831623/ <p> I thought some people might find these humble guitars interesting , others may remember them as a good ' first guitar ' and others may not know about them . Prepare for Iceybomb . When you mention a Peavey guitar , if it is n't a Wolfgang or T model its easy to dismiss it as an average ' international series ' model but these are quite different . <p> I stumbled across the Predator at my local guitar shop last year , the owner passed it to me as a repair . It looked surf green in the dim light and i instantly joked i 'd give him 50 for it . He accepted . When i got it home i could not believe how good the neck was on it , to the point of researching as to why i knew nothing about these models , they are effortless to play . I found several threads on various forums and other reviews were people are banging on about the Predator neck , also suggesting that with a pup upgrade and a maybe machine heads change these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive models by other brands . Not so sure about that for everybody though , the fretboard is quite flat with jumbo frets and the headstock shape is n't pretty . All things that do n't  generally appeal to usual Strat users . <p> I picked both of these up for 50 each . The black one is a standard model ; <p> The blue one ( that sometimes looks surf green ) is a higher end AX model ; <p> These pictures were taken before i modified them . Reasons being i 'm not keen on the Strat volume knob directly below the bridge pickup and the s/s/s configuration is not need in my Punk band . As standard they are along the same lines as a decent Squier as far as sounds go . The tremolo system is of similar quality too , i block mine off anyway . This is how they look now ; <p> The good thing about modifying these guitars is a standard Strat guard will fit directly onto the body and also , the body is factory routed to take a humbucker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ) . <p> After doing a bit of research i found out the body is made from Poplar , which is quite light . One of the interesting things with the maple neck model is Peavey used a bi-laminated method that stops any twist or warping . You can see the joint here ; <p> These guitars also have the neck micro-tilt adjustment ; <p> The machine heads hold up quite well although the ones on the AX model ( top ) are better quality ; <p> Understandably the deal breaker here is the headstock shape , it does n't personally bother me but i know some folk will hate it ; <p> If anyone is interested in finding one of these models some of the International Series look identical , but the way to tell the difference is the US Patent on the back of the headstock ; <p> All in all two great Strats that cost me very little 124140 @qwx744140 124139 @qwx744139 <p> Thanks guys . The original pup in the blue one is basically two Peavey single coils together that can be combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit microphonic at gig volume , mostly due to the covers not being properly attached to the bobbin . All the pups in these guitars were ceramic single coils . <p> Freddy- basically these were the guards i could find on ebay . I may drill for a tone pot on the red guard as that old 70 's DiMarzio is quite bright sounding . On the other hand the pup i put in the blue model ( custom made by a local luthier some years ago ) is quite dull sounding so the tone pot is always wide open. 124140 @qwx744140 124139 @qwx744139 <p> Nice finds !

I also agree with what 's been said before about the stock strings being a little on the light side . <p> There is no rear contour like the Strats have - it 's a slab body . The Vintage White is quite creamy and banana-like .

I 've never seen string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinks and bends ... perhaps this is where they saved the money . I replaced them with my usual Elixir 11s and was much improved . <p> When I plugged it in it seemed noisier than expected ... I took the guard off pre-restring and investigated further , hence the lack of pickguard screws . I think by shuffling the guard on and off as you do I managed to lose a solder joint , so I re-soldered that wire up and pondered some more . I compared it with 2 other mustangs in the shop , one was very quiet and the other like mine . I 'm still trying to decipher whether it is an issue or not . Shame mine was n't the quiet one is all I 'm thinking . I plugged it just now and compared with my japanese jag and there ' just about on par noise-wise .

The guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatham . Either way I 'll be outing the bridge pickup with a mini humbucker so I can investigate further then . <p> Again , during all this I took the time to shim the neck . In between the neck and joint , there was a lot of little wood shavings , which had consequently indented one another . Not really issue , but kind of makes me wonder how quickly they do actually put these together . <p> The finish is really nice , I love the Pale Sonic Blue , however some of the edge body curves in one area is just slightly flattened off . Again no biggy. and a little patchy around the neck , but very minimal . <p> When taking of the guard the screw holes are splitting the paint up a lot in and around the hole .

It could be improved of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyways , so Squier has done good . <p> The switches are recessed which is nice result , ala Cobain Stang . <p> Got to say I 'm really impressed with the fretwork , I was expected this to be the biggest down side judging by some of VMs but it play nice without any chocking . They could do with a polish or just a lot of playing . <p> The fretboard as mentioned yt just about everyone needed the Lemon oil treatment . <p> Control seems little low to the butt of the guitars aesthetically , and maybe not enough of a spike on the guard , but purely cosmetic of course . <p> Eventually I 'll probably change the nut , never liked Squiers nuts ... very soft and plasticy but I 'll give it a chance . <p> Pickups , sound nice ... like I said earlier I would prefer the bridge humbucker , but for you more traditional Mustang players I think you 'll like them . <p> Trem and bridge feel good also .

Scott makes most of his own instruments many of which are covetable . He fashioned an acoustic bass that is great , has converted vintage electrics with custom bodies etc. etc . It seemed to us that the limitations of custom instrument manufacturing was limited to ' parts ' that were available . Yes , you could trick out a body ... and the head you could customize , but what about the necks ? ... most instruments that are custom use stock necks . Why ? cause no one could be bothered to fret their own . <p> That being said , we started wondering why some of those little trinket guitars you buy in Mexico or in asia sound Ok .. mean to say they can be tuned . Then some are obviously for show and sound like crap . My son has a little kid sized Mexican guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tune cause the keys are shit , but it will intonate . <p> So we thought there must be a formula for determining fret distance according to the size of the neck , or more accurately the length of playable string . This would have to work for any ' western ' stringed instrument from a fender to a violin . Mandolins are violins , and mandolins are intonated like guitars so logic follows they 're all the same . I think the ' western ' intonation could even be applied to Sitars and more obscure stringed instruments as we 're not judging culture ... but rather frequency , and string vibration does n't check passports . <p> So ... Scott busted out some old papers he has about making instruments and they contained instructions for determining the placement of frets . <p> The instructions boiled down to : <h> f=s/17.817 <p> where f=fret and s=string length ( from bridge or fret to nutplayable string ) <p> initial notes : It is more desirable to use metric measurements when fretting ' planks ' as fractions of inches require way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call this the hard way because it requires many more calculations than the other method , but it should be addressed to fully grasp the concept . Also a calculator must be handy for each fret where as the ' easy ' way requires only one calculation with the rest done with calipers(manually) . <h> Given <p> We begin with string length : let 's take a playable string length of 24 " or 609.6mm as the playable string length from nut to bridge . <h> Measurements <p> firstly we take 609.6 and divide this by 17.817 giving us 34.21mm . A mark from ' fret 0 ' ( nut ) to 34.21 gives us ' fret 1 ' . <p> Next , because we have taken 34.21 off of the playable string length our new ' s ' is 575.39 <h> The easy way <p> We figured a way using what we did n't smoke from pre-calc to do the entire operation using only the initial calculation . <p> Since we 're going old-school you 'll need accurate calipers .

@@80331636 @1831636/ <p> Greetings all ! I do n't frequent gear forums regularly anymore , but I thought I 'd pop in for a relevant review of a guitar I recently purchased . The specific guitar in question I will be reviewing is the Jay Turser JT-MG2 in Sonic Blue : <p> I am not sure where I first saw it , but I was rather excited when I found the Jay Turser JT-MG series just recently , for several reasons . First , I was already looking into some of the newer Squier shortscales . Mustang knockoffs are quite uncommon compared to other styles , so the JT-MG is a welcome option . Secondly , it is a very inexpensive guitar . Last of all , me and my friend used to always crack jokes about buying Jay Turser guitars , since they are n't highly regarded among other things . <p> Of course , the most interesting feature is the omission of the traditional dynamic vibrato , replaced instead by a Jazzmaster style vibrato system , not unlike that of My Bloody Valentine guitarist Belinda Butcher . At any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I reckon Jay Tursers choice to use a Jazzmaster vibrato tailpiece has more to do with economy than mimicry of the afhormentioned guitarist ; import/clone units of the Jazzmaster vibrato are already out there as an available part ... I have yet to see an imitation dynamic vibrato unit as seen on Mustangs ( although I do n't claim to be an expert on this ) . I reckon the Jazzmaster style tailpiece is the closest they could come this side of a Strat style bridge , at which point they would have just been making a Cyclone , but I digress . Anyhow , I liked the idea of the Jazzmaster trem , so I went for it . <p> At the time of my purchase I saw these guitars selling in the ballpark of $150-200 USD , however I was able to purchase mine new for $129 shipped using the Best Offer feature on eBay . The seller had listed it for $159 . <p> I 'd like to discuss some points about the guitar that are not as apparent from the pictures . <p> To accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your typical Mustang which are normally quite thin . I am glad that Jay Turser only made the body fractionally thicker for this purpose ; the body still seems thin and light . The body also features a tummy cut and forearm contours . While I am not personally a fan of these design cues ( I prefer ' 65 style slab body Mustangs over their more sculpted late ' 60s/early ' 70s variants ) it does make for a comfortable body and does look nice . The finish on it is well done , up to par with any other decently made guitar . <p> The vibrato unit does not seem terrible , but not top notch either . It does not have a lock on it . My main gripe however , is the vibrato arm . Traditional units normally hold the arm in place with some sort of teeth clicking into a groove on the arm . Even the MIM Blacktop Jazzmaster used a screw in style arm not unlike a Stratocaster . The Jay Turser however , offers neither method ! The arm stays in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it does have the possibility to fall out of you are having a particularly psychedelic day , and that is somewhat disappointing . <p> The pickguard is not real imitation tortoiseshell , rather it is just cheap photo tort , so it does n't offer any of the subtle translucency and depth from the real deal . This is strictly an aesthetic concern , and a subtle one at that . All things considered , it actually looks pretty good . <p> The Mosrite style roller bridge seems fine . Sure , I 'd prefer the rocking setup with a traditional mustang bridge , but I am not going to endeavor to replace the roller bridge just to have it . I wish there was more leeway for intonation on the saddles , but I got close enough . <p> The wiring , electronics , and pickups are poor quality . Mind you , for my tastes , the bar is set quite low when it comes to this stuff . But , when I received it , the bridge pickup barely made much sound . It sounded like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . The neck pickup worked just fine . I popped off the pickguard hoping to reflow some cold solder joints thinking it might repair it . While inside , I measured the pickups . They are wound to about 7k , which I think is a pretty respectable value . Sadly , in the process , the bridge pickup gave up the ghost . I 'm not a fool with the soldering iron , and frankly it 's far from unreasonable that a cheap pickup in a cheap guitar should go kaput . However , this is still disappointing . The electronics wiring and components in general are of cheap quality as well . However , as long as they work , I do n't have a major complaint . For what it 's worth , I do find the sound of the one working neck pickup to be quite enjoyable . <p> The neck I think is just dandy I think . If I close my eyes , I 'd say the profile is right nice as any other good guitar . I ca n't comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in general I 'd say it 's a great C neck befitting to a Mustang style guitar . One small disappointment about the neck , which may not be the manufacturers fault at all ( it could have happened in handling ) is that a small bit of rosewood was chipped off of the fretboard , thankfully just behind the nut . I touched the chipped spot with some clear nail polish to try and match the finish of the rest of the ( finished portions of ) of the fretboard . The damage is no longer very noticeable . The frets are all well done with no sharp overhang , so you do n't have to worry about them being dressed poorly . They are of a traditional width and height , no crazy jumbo frets here . I am not sure what material the nut is , but I think it may be Tusq , and it also seems just fine . I do n't find the headstock shape offensive , although it is a bit generic . But what can you expect , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fender headstock here . My guitar has a matching painted headstock ( The JT-MG2 series has matching headstocks , JT-MGs do not ) . I am not a fan of matching headstocks usually , but it looks pretty good . The back of the neck has an amber colored finish pretty similar to the Made in Japan Mustangs and it looks and feels good . The tuners are Kluson style . I ca n't tell how cheap of quality they are or not . One screw was n't fully tightened down when I received the guitar , but I fixed that . I think I may replace the tuners in the future with known better units , just in case . For now they work fine . <p> So how does it play ? Well , it was n't bad at first , but the stock strings had to take a hike ! I put 11 guauge D'Addario strings on and the whole thing became much better . It intonated better , the vibrato became more stable , as did the tuners . I am sure I will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that this is a guitar which must be set up , and very likely set up with 11 gauge strings . I could run 10s on my old MIJ Mustang if I needed to , but this Jay Turser really demands 11s for stability . <p> THE UGLY : Chip in the fretboard wood behind the nut ( likely the fault of the seller , but not worth returning it for , although it could have been lazy inspection on part of the manufacturer as well ) . <p> BOTTOM LINE : Let 's face it , it is a cheap guitar . As cheap guitars go , this one is fairly unique . If you need something a little more dependable at this price , then you 'll need to settle on some sort of cheap Squier Strat or Tele . But if you do n't mind a little work , this one is probably more fun . Clearly , this makes an excellent modding platform . It may also excel at certain musical styles that a cheap Strat or Tele would not . Do n't pay $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $179 , which is okay , if this is a guitar you really want to go after . However , I 'd recommend trying to find it for $160 or less . At the $129 I paid for mine , I will not make any complaints , despite some clear problems with my unit . As I have mentioned , the wood on this guitar is good and that is the most important part . <p> I intend to keep the guitar stock for now , other than I will order some cheap clearance pickups from GFS ( likely with ivory covers which will look better than the black ) to replace the bad bridge pickup . <p> In the future I definitely see replacing both the tuners ( hopefully with some white button Kluson style ) and the vibrato unit ( with a legitimate locking Jazzmaster vibrato ) , but for now , the stock parts will do fine . <p> Lastly , I am curious to see if a standard Fender short scale neck fits . I 'd like to find out for a fact before I pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plunge blind . If I do , I may consider getting a Mustang neck from eBay , or an Allparts Jaguar neck .

Burns guitars were recently reintroduced in 1992 , and have been best known for their Marquee model , with its scroll headstock and distinctive pickguards . <h> Contents <h> Burns London <p> Burns London was started by James Ormston Burns ( 1925-1998 ) , often described as the British Leo Fender due to the similarity in terms of his life and the direction his company took under his ownership , and the parralels to be drawn between the latter periods of both companies when they were later sold off . Jim Burns set out to make , in his own words , " mass produced one-offs " , such as the Marquee , a radical take on the Stratocaster style with many more differences than it is <p> A black Bison from 1961 . <p> generally credited with . The Bison was another guitar now considered a classic , combining fewer Fender influences with a shorter scale length of 25 " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing the high-output Tri-Sonic pickups to be selected in many different , and sometimes unusual , combinations . <p> The original guitars made many showbiz friends , having been sighted in the hands of some extremely high-profile celebrities for the time , such as Elvis Presley , Hank Marvin and even David Gilmour on occasion . Most impressively , Burns guitars enjoyed a relatively high level of popularity over the course of its first two decades despite often being seen as a cheaper alternative to more expensive US brands such as Fender and Gibson . Another reason accounting for the popularity in Britain especially was the trade embargo against all American goods , making it next to impossible to buy US-made guitars in Britain . <h> The Decline <p> The Burns London name and company changed hands several times during the course of the ' 60s and ' 70s , all the while retaining the Burns London moniker . The period and name most fondly remembered is , of course , the original Burns London Ltd , established in 1960 . The timing of the establishment of Burns London was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom , in part thanks to the popularity of British pop bands like the Beatles , and again thanks to the trade embargo on US-made goods . Even Ampeg , a relatively well-known brand , bought the license to manufature guitars under the Burns moniker , most probably for the US market , though these were n't much of a success . <p> Despite the good times for guitar sales , Burns London Ltd was deeply in debt to suppliers and creditors and in desperate need of rescue . The company and name were sold in 1965 to thhe Baldwin Piano and Organ Company of Cincinnati for the price was -380,000 , small money in comparison to the -13 million for Fender which Baldwin had earlier lost out on . Unfortunately , the acquisition did see quality levels increase at Burns , and standards began to slip . The earliest casualties were the pickguards . With huge levels of unsold stock still stored when the Burns name was purchased , Baldwin resorted to cutting out the piece of pickguard bearing the Burns name and replaced it with a much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This resulted in colour clashes , as the plastic was sometimes slightly the wrong hue , or even shrinkage , while the rest of the pickguard remained in good condition . A little later , Baldwin also resorted to using exactly the same necks for all models , consisting of a bound fingerboard and much lower quality carved scroll headstock . As the quality fell , the earlier popularity declined as well . Baldwin eventually closed the doors on the Burns guitar line in 1970 . <h> Burns Guitars from 1970-1983 <p> While the original Burns guitar line ended in 1970 , Jim Burns never quite stopped working on his creations . Several attempts were made to revive the Burns name , inbetween projects with entirely new companies . In 1966 , Jim Burns , unable to use the Burns name , started a new company called Ormston , formed initially to market a range of pedal-steel guitars made by Denley . In 1968 , just before Ormston shut its doors also , Jim Burns created an original guitar which later became a prototype for the Hayman range , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on a new range of guitars under the name of Hayman . The line lasted from 1969 to 1973 , and enjoyed a fair share of popularity . <p> Towards the end of the ' 70s , two more attempts were made at resurrecting the Burns guitar line . Again , due to the agreement with Baldwin , the Burns name could not be used , so the first attempt was named Burns UK , and the second called Jim Burns Ltd . The former appeared in 1976 and lasted until 1978 , a mere two years , and produced only one guitar of note ; The Flyte ( sometimes referred to at the time as the Concorde ) . The latter company was established in 1979 and lasted a longer four years , into 1983 , and produced some more recognisably " Burns " guitars , such as the Steer , and even the Scorpion . <p> A white Marquee from the Club range . <h> Burns London Ltd . <p> After Jim Burns Ltd , no more Burns guitars appeared on the market until 1992 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns as a consultant in the company . The original idea was to manufacture handmade replicas of famous Burns guitars from previous incarnations , such as the Marvin and the Nu-Sonic . The company enjoyed serious critical acclaim from many corners of the market , and manufactured many guitars for individuals , including Steve Howe of Yes and Gaz Coombes of Supergrass. later on , in 1999 , the company began work on a budget line called the Club range , outsourcing production to Korea . The Club range became the first Burns guitars ever to be manufactured outside of Britain , but the original Burns design ethics , construction and style did n't suffer as a result , with the range exploding in popularity throughout the following years . The Club range expanded quickly , with nearly every Jim Burns-designed guitar ever constructed from 1960 to 1983 receiving its own budget model , such as the Marquee , the Steer , the Bison and even the Barracuda six-string bass/baritone model . Newer designs have begun to emerge in the last few years , usually building upon the designs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Marquee with a Bison-style headstock . <p> More recently , an even cheaper range ( manufactured in China ) has emerged with two new models , the Cobra and the Nu-Sonic . The Cobra is the closest Burns have come to a straight copy in its lifetime . The body is that of a Stratocaster , but the model retains the sectioned pickguard . Tri-Sonic pickups and ( shrunken ) batwing headstock common to other Burns guitars . Meanwhile , the Nu-Sonic borrows the name of an original Burns guitar , and resembles more of a Telecaster , albeit with a distinctly different pickup setup with two Tri-Sonics and a bridge humbucker borrowing directly from the Steer . As well as the pickups , it also retains the shrunken batwing headstock of its cousin , as well as a german carve around the front edge of the guitar . While the Club range is considered the " budget " end of Burns London , the small Chinese range are much closer to the general perception of a budget range such as Squier and Epiphone , with the Korean models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenders . <h> Confusion <p> Burns London Ltd now produce a great deal of guitars , including four complete ranges . The Burns Custom shop sits at the top , with some of its models included in the Elite range . Below those two sit the Custom Elite range , which feature a wide array of construction methods , with the parts constructed in Korea , then assembled and wired in Britain , or the guitar manufactured in a Chinese factory staffed with extremly highly skilled workers , such as the new Jet-Sonic . Finally , there are the previously mentioned Club range , which includes the Korean and Chinese models . <p> Gaz Coombes of Supergrass playing a Burns Legend , from the Elite series . <p> Unfortunately , Burns London have become somewhat infamous amongst its fans for printing misleading information in its catalogues and on the website . Burns continually upgrades its guitars , meaning two guitars of the same type bought within a year of each other can feature different bridges , sometimes pickups and even ( in the case of the Batwings and Cobras ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the company , with some problems with guitars only coming to light several months after the initial run of guitars , or perhaps a simple desire by the company to upgrade current models . Sometimes it 's simply a problem with the pictures printed in catalogues being of prototypes . Most notable in these instances are the Batwings and Cobras pictured in catalogues in the first quarter of 2005 . The Cobra appeared to feature a colour-matched Bison-style headstock , while the Batwing had a much smaller , shrunken version . When the guitars went on sale in shops , it <p> Close-up of the trem and bridge Tri-Sonic from a Cobra . <p> appeared that the catalogues had mixed the two headstocks up , with the Batwing receiving the elongated Bison style and the Cobra receiving the much smaller shrunken batwing style . Other examples are the Steer pickguards , which were manufactured from 2000 to 2003 with the stainless steel centre section , which was then changed in 2003 to a black plastic piece , and then swapped back to a stainless steel section again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any of the catalogues or the website . <p> Thankfully , all of these inconsistencies proved to be purely cosmetic , and sometimes were simply a result of the guitar going on sale before the appropriate changes were made to the literature and catalogues accompanying them . Although many argue that this simply adds to the charm of the range , and that it helps a now prolific and mass-manufactured range to stick closer to the original 1960 design ethic of " mass produced one-offs " than any other guitar company .

@@80331648 @1831648/ <p> Not sure if a thread has ever covered this and it was mentioned in a previous thread so i thought i 'd put some info here . <p> I personally like low action on a guitar but it can be a difficult process to get it right depending on the brand and model . This is for bolt-on neck guitars only of course . Fender guitars are versatile on this kind of set-up , usually you can get the action super low but it does not always work so well with vintage radius as the notes can ' choke ' on string bending due to the frets being higher in the centre of the board . <p> Shimming the neck seems to scare some folks and is also sometimes seen as a bodge job ( it is reversible and can cause no damage if done correctly ) . But in theory this is no different to the 1970 's Fender Micro-Tilt System and in the 1960 's some Fender guitars came with a neck shim straight from the factory . Some may still even to this day as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shim your guitar neck when you can change the height of your bridge or saddles ? Sometimes , that alone is not enough and you wo n't get the full potential of playability from your guitar . Here is a diagram explaining the effect of a neck shim . <p> As the diagram shows , it wont correct neck relief issues . This is a different thing . <p> What would you use as a neck shim ? I 've seen everything , seriously , from steel washers to off-cuts of ply veneer , cigarette packet card , plectrums ... Theoretically they all do the job but something neat that is full width of the pocket seems the way to go . Like this factory made shim on the Ernie Ball guitar . <p> What thickness shim would you use ? Finding the balance between the shim and bridge/saddle adjustment usually requires only a thin shim . A piece of card maybe 0.05mm will change the neck angle more dramatically than you can imagine . The only time you would need to shim more is on a major modification like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material should the shim be made of ? The industry uses plastic . DIY'ers seem to use card , however , some people say sandpaper/glasspaper works better as it grips the surface eliminating any friction or movement during resonating . As ridiculous as it sounds this makes sense . I once shimmed a CIJ Jaguar neck with Rizla card and it did not sound the same , i tried sandpaper which improved it . I 'll leave that one there for the Cork Sniffers . <p> I hope someone finds this useful , many players do n't  get the full potential from their guitars and this is n't all about the Malmstainz either . 124140 @qwx744140 124139 @qwx744139 <p> in the 1960 's some Fender guitars came with a neck shim straight from the factory .

Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy . <p> I 've only seen one pic of a locked-down mustang trem , googling around , and the pic had a nut on top , directly under the cigar , but it was too thick and the cigar was still pretty high . <p> So Honeyiscool , if I spend a half hour whammying the fuck out of the guitar , and tuning it to kingdom come , she will stay in good tune eh ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut-slots filed out to accommodate fatter strings , or just have the nut replaced altogether with a graphite or tusq nut , and routed for fatter strings . My little E string seems not to want to respond to being turned , and the string is wound only once around the post . So I wonder if the nut is more of a problem than the bridge . And granted this is a NEW guitar so I assume after being made love to for several months , its attitude will improve <p> On the split tuners , on the high E string , I like to put it through the hole ( that 's what she said ) , wrap it once around the split portion of it only , before wrapping it normally . This keeps the string from slipping and results in really solid tuning in my experience . Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy . <p> I may . But my main concern is finding a nut that is flat enough so as to not make the cigar too high off the baseplate . <p> I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WASHERS , one on each side of the baseplate . Now call me dumb , but would the cigar itself be holding the washers down on the top side , and with the bolt on the other side , that is enough tightness to hold it in place ? I have n't actually seen anyone mention using a bold and a NUT , but a bolt with 2 washers , one on each side . <p> Again : if anyone has Pix of an actual lock-down job they 've done , please let 's see the guitar pron . <p> I do n't have a photo but when I was mocking up my " Mustang VI " I had no trem routes so I needed to get the cigar held in place without the spring posts . I just put a couple of metric screws ( M4 I think they were ) from under the plate into the cigar . You can screw it down as flat as you want as long as there is still room for the strings to pass underneath - or flush , if you pass the strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it shows the M4 screws coming from under the plate into the cigar tube . I had to cut some little spacers out of a metal tube in order to stand the screw heads off from the plate , because the cigar tube threaded holes were not deep enough for the entire screw to go in . Excuse the strings going everywhere , I decided to leave them in rather than crack the cores by pulling them back through the holes . You can also see where I Dremeled the edges of the string holes to make for a shallower bend so as not to break bass strings there . Here 's the view from underneath . Note - this held full tension on a set of bass strings and did n't budge even slightly . Tuning was perfectly stable . That said , I am going to experiment with the spring posts to see if I can get a trem on the VI . <p> If I were going to lock a Mustang , I would probably flip the cigar 180 degrees so that you can just pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush as possible to the plate , since you do n't have to pass the strings under at that point and you get a good string break angle . Is n't that what Cobain actually did ? Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy .

To adjust the projection of the arm two things can be adjusted . The first being the height of the tailpiece .

Adjust it lower and it will lean farther back . The second function for adjusting the tailpiece angle is by moving where the springs attach to the posts . Remove with tremolo plate from the guitar to access the springs . You will see there are two notches on the end of the tailpiece posts . The far notch will make the the tailpiece lean back , the higher notch will decrease the tension causing the tailpiece to lean farther forward . Adjusting both the tailpiece height and the spring notch to balance stably with whatever strings you choose will allow you to set the tremolo arm however you find most comfortable . <p> The Bridge The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noticed that the bridge shifts around as you use the tremolo .

The tremolo should be adjusted so that the tremolo arm can sit comfortably in your hand while playing . For most people this means the arm will be parallel to the body of the guitar . To adjust the projection of the arm two things can be adjusted . The first being the height of the tailpiece . A 3/32 " allen wrench fits into the two small holes on top the tailpiece to adjust it 's height . The higher you set the tailpiece the farther towards the bridge it will lean . Adjust it lower and it will lean farther back . The second function for adjusting the tailpiece angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remove with tremolo plate from the guitar to access the springs . You will see there are two notches on the end of the tailpiece posts . The far notch will make the the tailpiece lean back , the higher notch will decrease the tension causing the tailpiece to lean farther forward . Adjusting both the tailpiece height and the spring notch to balance stably with whatever strings you choose will allow you to set the tremolo arm however you find most comfortable . <p> So your advice is actually to decrease spring tension and to lower the pressure onto the bridge , to get the trem arm angle right . Advised by this forum I did it the other way ' round and have an awkward angle . But I have tuning stability instead . So this part seems to be discussable .

Fender does advertise that the RI pickups are made by Seymour Duncan , but only on the Japanese web sites for some reason . The reissue pickup is a bit brighter , the vintage pickup sounds more " vintagey " if that makes any sense . Both sound like a good P-Bass , with a bit more mids .

But the reissue 's neck is just a little bit faster to play . <p> The bodies are usually poplar on the vintage ones , with some ash bodies made in the mid-1970 's . The reissues all come with alder bodies . The originals that were made after 1968 all have contours on the body , unlike the reissues that only come with slab bodies , ( even the competition models ) .

They both use a humbucking pickup , so noise should n't be a problem in either case unless something is improperly grounded in the electronics . <p> Both types are excellent basses , so unless you 're looking for a particular feature that only one version has , I 'd say go for either one that 's available for cheap . If you 're lucky you can score a used vintage model for as little as $600 , but often I 've seen people sell the reissues for as little as $400 or less .

@@80331690 @1831690/ <p> Winter project time is winding down and I have to get moving on this thing . Its going to be a short scale ( 30 " ) Telecaster/ Esquire bass . I was inspired by some pics I saw of a bass Rhomco built that was laid out similar to this so I thought I would give it a go . <p> It will use an off the shelf 3 piece Alder Tele body from Rondo that was routed for standard Telecaster bridge and neck pickups but not drilled for the guitar string through bridge locating holes . To keep the overall length close to that of a guitar I am going to seat the neck deeper into the body by knocking through to the space routed for the Tele neck pickup . <p> For the neck I am using a 20 fret Maple donor neck from a Squire Bronco . Its is a 30 " scale that I picked up for $75.00 . It was well worth that just for the neck . It 's straight with well dressed frets The headstock will be re-profiled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is maple the " theme " is going to be a cross between a 51 Fender Precision Bass and a early 50 's Telecaster . There is no neck pickup so I guess this makes it an Esquire Bass ( if Fender had built a 30 " scale in 1951 or 52 ) . It will have black Bakelite pickguard and a Butterscotch or Blond body . The bridge is a string through body Fender Musicmaster bridge with individual saddles . I will have to rout a little room for a Lindy Fralin Split Coil 51 Precision pickup in what is now the Tele bridge position . Moving the bridge back to make it a bass means the bridge position hole is a great spot for the 51 P pickup . <p> I started this in January and am quite a bit further along than this I just wanted to keep the posts in some order resembling a timeline . <p> Sorry if I missed it elsewhere , but do you have plans for the Bronco body ? <p> Steve . No plans yet but I 'm holding onto it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-profile the peghead . . . There is just enough meat in the right places to get a 51 P bass/ Tele style headstock . I tweaked the profile a just little from the template . The Bronc peg head is way to long for it 's own good . I need to lose 1/2 an inch to get this thing into a baritone guitar case . <p> It was roughed out with a coping saw and sanded the edges to 80 grit . I have to open up the tuner holes from 3/8 to 9/16 to accommodate the bushings on the replacement tuners . I 'll finish sand after that step . <p> . . <p> Now Plug the holes from the stock Squire tuners . The new tuners will be lightweight types to stave off neck dive . I dyed the neck a shade with amber dye to give it a bit more of vintage tint . final finish for the neck is Tung oil for warmth and then Tru Oil that has poly in it to seal it . It has a nice satin feel that wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakelite pickguard and will have to lengthen the neck pocket opening to account for the neck being so much further into the body . This one came out OK but it 's a little to sloppy so there will be another . ( maybe red tortoise shell ) . . <p> The next step is to locate the bridge at the right distance to reach the 30 " scale . It must also be properly centered so the strings are spaced evenly on the fretboard . Must find the center line . <p> Before I took the Bronco apart it took the critical measurements from the front of the nut to the bridge saddles . I transferred those to the blue tape . . . <p> I am stringing fishing line to get the bridge in just the right spot . Once I mark the spots on the tape I can drill pilot holes for the mounting screws . <p> . . . . <p> . The Musicmaster bridge is a string through body design and not having a drill press makes getting the holes evenly spaced on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilled 1 and 4 string holes all the way through . The hole for the 2nd and 3rd string was only drilled a 1/2 inch deep from the top . I flipped the body over and used the bridge as a template and marked and drilled the 2nd and 3rd string centers based on where 1 and 4 emerged . When I open up the holes in the back the 2nd and 3rd string holes in the back will meet the ones from the front and the pattern in the back will be as evenly spaced as I can make it . <p> I counterbored the holes in the back to uniform depth to use some long bass ferules I found . The short ones came with the musicmaster bridge . . . . . . . Drilling that hole for the bridge ground wire was a nail biter . A footlong bit and I made it just to the bottom of the control cavity without hitting any of the screw holes . I thought about going to the cavity via the endpin and the dropping a hole to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the end I just did the hole straight from the bridge . <p> . . . <p> Now I have the bridge installed and I can string this thing up to work on the Pickup location and angle . This is also the first chance to get a feel for it and I like it . The shorty feels great . Low string tension and easy spacing between positions . The tone was lively and it intonated just fine so the bridge location is right . I did have to use a neck shim to raise the neck a little so the bridge saddles were not bottomed out . . . ........... Next is finishing the body and I can tell the sealer that is on this cheap imported body is going to be tough to sand out . <p> nice work so far . interested to see how it balances without a proper top horn though . <p> Being shortscale , I think the balance might be a lesser issue than with a standard Tele bass .

@@80331691 @1831691/ <p> I 've been a long time lurker here on ShortScale , so I figured it would be best to have some contributions for my first few posts . Since I 've had some experience with the new VM offsets , I 'll be posting my reviews - each detailed with pics and demos . <p> First up , my Surf Green VM Jag . <p> Now , out of the box I was shocked . Intonation was good , string height was just about right , and it was easily playable - even with the ultra cheap , thin strings that were on it . Even with these strings it sounded fantastic . Nice and chime-like cleans , biting dirt , and a nice bit of jangle , while keeping thickness . <p> That being said , the strings HAD to go . There was corrosion on them here and there , they 're super thin ( feel like 9 's , and other people have mentioned them being 9 's as well ) , and they 're just not great feeling . I popped on a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge . All the good aspects of the tone and playability got better , and the negatives ( a bit of buzz from the thin strings , tuning being off a touch after trem use ) were gone . If you play one of these , do n't write it off just because of the garbage stock strings . <p> On to fit and finish , I was impressed again . The guitar overall feels very solid - just as much as my CIJ Jag , or my old CP Jag , though it 's about two pounds lighter than either of them . The hardware is all secured perfectly , and even the pickguard screws are nice and straight , which I ca n't even say for my CIJ . The neck finish is perfect for me - glossy , but not too thick . It has a real quality feel to it , and I prefer the finish to both the CIJ and CP Jag . It almost reminds me of a thin gloss finish that has just the slightest bit of steel wool sanding - not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish just enough to make it feel great in your hand . It 's worth noting that the neck feels different than the older VM Jaguar HH - I compared them , and the newer VM definitely has a better feel to it . Fret ends are very well done , and I ca n't find a single buzzy spot on the neck . I 'm really , really digging the neck , and it was a pleasant surprise to have it feel so nice . <p> The body 's finish is gorgeous - a classic surf green , and not nearly as faded as the stock photos make it seem . It 's not quite dead-on vintage , but it 's close . The pictures , I feel , show it accurately - at least on my screen . There are no major blems in it ( unlike my VM Jag HH , which has scattered black specs here and there in the Fiesta Red finish ) , and it has a great look to it . The quality difference between this VM Jag and the former Jag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good guitar , it definitely does n't feel as nice as the new VM Jag . <p> The pickguard is n't perfect - though the white looks nice on the Jag , so it 'll stay . AVRI/Classic Player guards fit perfectly , so swapping them out wo n't be an issue at all . The stock guard has some sloppy edges , but that 's about the extent of it . Nothing terrible , but it 's definitely not going to compare to an AVRI guard . <p> As for hardware , which is a major concern for a lot of people , I see nothing wrong with the stock stuff . The plates are just as nice as those on a Classic Player , the switches feel nice and solid , the trem is nice and smooth , and the bridge is surprisingly stable . I figured it would need loc-tite from the start , but it 's holding up perfectly . The tuners are very solid as well - with the 11 's on it I 'm having no tuning trouble whatsoever - even with fairly heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to say now - I love the pickups and they 're staying . I know a ton of people will probably toss in Novaks or similar Jag pups , but for me these stock ones sound great . I prefer them to those in my old CP Jag , as well as the my CIJ 's pickups . They 're nice and balanced , while keeping the signature sound of a Jaguar . I dig them - a lot . <p> I recorded two demos , cycling through all combinations on the pickups . Both demos cycle through in this order : Bridge , Both , Neck , Bridge ( Bass Cut On ) , Both ( Bass Cut On ) , Neck ( Bass Cut On ) , Rhythm Circuit . The first demo is clean , the second demo is dirty , using one of my Soviet overdrives for some dirt . <p> Alongside my VM Jazzmaster , I also received my CAR VM Jaguar yesterday . My first CAR Jag arrived as a trainwreck of blems , dents , black marks , paint chips in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It went back , and this is the replacement I received . <p> To my relief , it was flawless out of the box . No marks , not neck issues , just a nice , clean , CAR finish , and perfect Jaguar tones . It 's a slightly different shade than my VM Jazzmaster 's CAR , so I 'd imagine they were finished at different times . It 's darker , and definitely more red - though it still has a bit of vintage tint to it . <p> It weighs in around the same as my Surf Green VM Jag - roughly 7.5-8lbs . Not too bad , but enough to feel substantial . <p> As many have seen , the pickups on the VM Jags are vintage style , but with higher output . This one matches my Surf Green Jag pretty closely , though the bridge is n't quite as hot . I 'm guessing there 's a bit of variation in the output on them . <p> It needed some setup work , as expected , out of the box . Intonation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other than that it was good to go . I was able to get the action incredibly low on it - as in shredder low . I might actually raise it , just because it 's almost *too* low , and far beyond what I 'm used to . <p> As with my other VM Jag , the neck is excellent with great fretwork . It 's the same C shape as the first , which , IMO , is more comfortable than a CIJ or CP neck . Great playability , and a solid neck . <p> The pickguard on this Jag is perfect . Nice and clean edges , good cut , etc . I 'll only change it once I find a nice tort guard for it . Until then , I 'm happy with the white . <p> Hardware is all very solid . While my first VM Jag has some angled screws and such , this one has almost all of them nice and straight . I ca n't even say that much for my CIJ Jaguar . <p> The bridge on this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It works really smoothly with the trem , which , as I said in my other reviews , is nice and solid . I 'd only change the stock trem in the event that I have a serious need for a lock . I can definitely see harder players swapping the bridge , but for my style it works fine . <p> The metal plates are nice - easily the same level of quality that you 'd see on a CP or CIJ Jag . <p> As with the Jazzmaster , the only things on it that feel cheap are the knobs . They 're cheap plastic , and while they work just fine , they are n't as nice as they could be . Personally , I do n't mind and wo n't change them unless they break . Someone else might be bothered by them though . <p> Tuners are nice and solid , as I said in my other reviews . Vintage style , and they 're fairly tight . They hold up decently with trem use - as long as the setup is good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me for these Vintage Modified offsets . I 'd say play in person if possible , but ordering online should n't scare you off . Just be sure to order from a place with a good return policy in the event of defects ! <p> do you have some microphonic issues when you use a big muff ( or another big dist ) with a high gain and level ? compare to the CP and cij. i 'm an overdrive guy <p> That 's the funny thing - the two Jags respond quite differently . The Surf Green will feedback more easily . It 's still controllable , but if I kick on one of my heavier fuzzes ( I mainly use one of my 3.14s ) , it let 's me use some feedback decently in a good way . <p> The CAR almost seems lower output on the bridge , and I 've yet to get it to really feedback at all . Even at loud band volumes with heavy fuzz , or even stacked fuzzes . <p> I know some people are having microphonic issues with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly no newbie to fuzz use . <p> DanHeron wrote : <p> Super . <p> Can I ask why you got 2 jags ?

I also recently sold a CAR Classic Player , which I really missed the finish of . <p> As of now , the only mod planned is a nice tort guard on the CAR . I might stick lipstick pickups in one of them down the road , but for now I 'm digging them stock . They 've already become my " main " guitars ( including over my CIJ Jag , and the CP I sold ) , so having two options for my base sound works out nicely .

@@80331692 @1831692/ <p> I have tried three short scale basses : a Fender Mustang Bass RI , an MIA Fender Musicmaster Bass , and a Squier Badtz-Maru Bronco Bass . My favorite of the three ? The Bronco Bass . Maybe because it was my first bass , but it has become my #1 go-to bass and been with me through many recording sessions and rehearsals . <p> I know the Bronco Bass gets a bit ignored around here , especially now that the higher end Squier Mustang Bass is available . But the Bronco Bass is a great player . Set up correctly , it is a very comfortable bass to play and has the potential to play and sound really awesome , with that deep and hollow thud common to 30 " scale basses . The Bronco Bass has these following things going for it in terms of modding : <p> 1 . Cheap . Very cheap . A used one can often be found for less than $80. 2 . Satin poly finished maple neck with Mustang Bass dimensions . It takes stain very easily if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Your choice of inexpensive upgrade pickups. 4 . Small tuners that offer good weight distribution , can be easily replaced . 5 . Even with all the modding , the Bronco Bass will probably be cheaper than a Fender Mustang Bass , which IMO does n't even sound that great stock . As for the Squier Mustang Bass , it might be close , but replacement pickups ( Aero and Nordstrand , as far as I know ) are expensive . 6 . Easy to work on . <p> In my mind , a stock Bronco Bass lacks in three key areas : <p> 1 . Pickup : The stock pickup is a cheap Squier ceramic Strat pickup . It 's half decent in a cheap guitar , but it 's a piece of shit bass pickup . This is the only thing that really needs to be replaced . 2 . Bridge : Although it 's possible to intonate it pretty well , the D and the G strings will always be a challenge . 3 . Tuners : The stock tuners are OK . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strings . <p> So let 's tackle them one by one . <p> Pickup <p> The stock Bronco Bass pickup is a generic ceramic 6-pole Strat pickup . The only thing this pickup is useful for is for taking the bar magnets off and giving it to your younger relatives . It lacks output , it hums , and makes your bass sound really , really bad . But on the flip side , it 's a standard Strat pickup , meaning we have a lot of upgrade options , without any modding : <p> 1 . Any Strat pickup . Lining up pole pieces is mostly for cosmetics . It will make little sonic difference whatsoever if you line them up or not . So you could , in theory , use any Strat/Mustang pickup and be no worse off for it . I do not suggest this , however because OCD . <p> 2 . Rails pickup - $25 to $60 There are many choices here , from DiMarzio , Seymour Duncan , GFS , etc . I think the one that I always hear about is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Bronco/Musicmaster Bass have raved about it . Cheapest ( probably ) is the Dragonfire Duo Rails , and I am honestly a big fan of Dragonfire stuff . They seem to be the same quality as GFS but slightly cheaper . <p> 3 . EMG HZ S4 or EMG Select SES - $45 to $60 These are passive pickups . These are passive dual rails inside an EMG housing , which makes it not look like rails . Those who have installed it rave about it . Maintains a near stock look . <p> 4 . Lace Sensor - $55 My personal favorite . Low noise single coil . I choose a Red Sensor for its increased output and frequency response . Lace actually makes a bass pickup whose numbers look identical to the Gold Sensor , so even that would make a pretty good pickup , but it 's probably a little too low output for me . Not humbucking , so they have some noise , but Lace has greatly reduced noise compared to standard single coils . Older versions benefit from shielding , although a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than a lot of Fenders I 've seen . Modern examples of Sensors are very well shielded out of the box . Also maintains a near stock look . <p> 5 . Aero Musicmasterer 4 Type 1 - $120 This is the only bass pickup in the world that 's designed specifically for the Musicmaster/Bronco Bass . Aero is a boutique hand-wound pickup manufacturer , and I can personally vouch for the fact that they make a great pickup . However , I have not tried this particular pickup , so I ca n't say it 's worth the $120 , but I 've seen good reviews . Single coil . Maintains complete stock look , since it fits into an existing cover . <p> Basically , anyone who 's upgraded to any of the many aftermarket pickups has found that the bass now sounded much better . A medium output humbucking bass pickup in the middle position has the iconic sound of bass guitar that 's been used on countless records , so they 're probably the kind of pickups you want , but certain single coils will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route , the Bronco Bass can take other pickups , as long as you want to mod your pickguard/create a new one : <p> 2 . Mustang Bass pickup . Honestly , the Duncan Designed Mustang Bass pickup that 's in most Mustang Basses ( yes , the Fender has a Duncan Designed ) today is very mediocre and I would n't do this . I know that a Red Lace Sensor blew away a stock Mustang Bass in terms of sound . Good Mustang Bass pickups can be had from Aero , Seymour Duncan Custom Shop , and Nordstrand , but they 're not cheap . The Aero one is wonderful . I have one and recommend it . Seymour Duncan is unique in that theirs comes with plastic covers . Most aftermarket Mustang Bass pickups do n't . <p> 3 . Slanted single coil P-Bass pickup ( like in Tele Bass and such ) . This is a really intriguing idea and I have to say , I like it , but never tried it . <p> So I think this covers everything . <p> Bridge <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of the Bronco Bass , and I do n't mean just the Badtz Maru variety . I had a standard Bronco Bass at some point and I noticed that the drill pattern for the bridge grounding hole was actually different from the Badtz Maru bass . Talking to Larry at Aero Instruments , he said that Bronco Basses have had some variation over the years in string spacing . <p> Anyway , it is possible to intonate the 2-saddle bridge pretty well . Here are some tips : <p> 1 . The E and A strings will intonate pretty well with standard string spacing . 2 . I 've found that raising the G string a lot improves intonation greatly . However , I do n't really like to do this . 3 . The best compromise is that you make it so that at the 12th frets , the D and G are off about equally . Then , when you 're tuning the bass , tune so that the 5th frets of all the strings are in tune , instead of tuning the open strings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to upgrade , I think an obvious solution is a 4-saddle Squier Musicmaster Bass bridge ( from the Vista Series , around $20 ) for that stock look or a Mustang Bass bridge if you want to be fancy . That said , these bridges come with their own issues . For one thing , they require drilling for ferrules , which is a pain , and then through-body stringing might require you to use 32 " scale strings instead of 30 " scale strings , and some strings are not suitable for through-body stringing . So I think it 's better to use top-loading bridges for the average modder . So here : <p> 1 . Hipshot Vintage Bass Bridge ( .669 String Spacing ) - $60 - $70 <p> This is an excellent , excellent bridge . I have an earlier version of this bridge on my Bronco Bass and I love it . Also , string changes are easy with this bridge . Keep in mind , there are multiple versions of this bridge , and you want the narrowest spaced one . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website . This actually has narrower spacing than a stock Bronco Bass bridge and I actually like that , since it gets the outer strings more inside the neck . I also like the fact that it looks similar to a stock bridge . <p> 2 . Any other Hipshot . The B Bridge can get you a .669 spacing as well . Hipshot A Bridge is especially wonderful because it can get you the even tighter .656 spacing ( or .687 which is closer to stock ) and each saddle is adjustable for intonation as well as spacing . So you can really nail down your string action the way you like it . <p> Either of these options should suit you well . My earlier version of this document recommended a Fender Highway One bridge , but honestly , I have to go back on that one because in my mind , Hipshot is the only company that really makes good narrow 4-string bass bridges . You should be able to cover all the existing holes , no problem at all . <p> Tuners <p> The stock tuners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks , though , and they had different tuners . One neck held tune very well , whereas the other did n't hold tune as well . I realize it was probably the nut or whatever , but I decided to replace the tuners since they were n't turning so well anyway . <p> The peghead holes are a bit smaller than 7/16 " , so you will want a reamer to ( slightly ) enlarge the holes because you wo n't see any tuners smaller than 7/16 " . Removing the bushings is also a bit of a pain , so do it patiently . I prefer using a socket bit that just fits the hole and hammering it very lightly from the back . Anyway , Here are my two suggestions : <p> 1 . Schaller M4 - About $80 for a set <p> These are high-end German-made tuners found on boutique basses like Alembic . They look stock from the front . I needed to enlarge the hole a tiny bit ( I just used a bit of sandpaper ) , and obviously I needed to drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are excellent tuners , no doubt . <p> 2 . Hipshot Ultralite HB6C 3/8 " - About $100 for a set <p> Ultralite are made in 1/2 " or 3/8 " versions , and you want the 3/8 " version . The nice thing about these tuning keys is that you can get them in multiple shapes . If you want that vintage Fender look , you can get the clover keys . I used Schallers in my bass , but if I did it again , I 'd probably choose Hipshots . I use Hipshot on my Mustang Bass and prefer their construction to the M4 I have in my Bronco . <p> I know some of you may gasp at these prices , but trust me , you do n't want big , heavy standard tuners on a Bronco Bass neck . It ruins the excellent balance of the instrument . <p> Strings : <p> Fortunately , there are many , many options for strings for your Bronco Bass . Unfortunately , the Fender 5250XL strings that came stock with the Bronco Bass are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . While the stock strings were good , I think the new 5250XL strings are crap . Subjective , I know , but I believe the 5250XLs are now just rebadged D'Addario bass strings , and I hate , hate , hate them . <p> Here are my top three suggestions : <p> 1 . La Bella 760FL-S Light Flatwound Strings : The best flatwound strings in the world , I say . You can go with the 760FX-S ( Extra Light ) if you 're so inclined , but the slightly heftier 760FL is probably a better choice . <p> That comes to a total of $269 for a really , really great bass that sounds better than any stock short scale out there . That said , with the new short scale Jaguar Bass , that might be an easier modding platform , but I still say the Bronco Bass deserves love .

I 'm looking at cheaper options this side of the pond <p> On this UK site they have one bridge with 54mm spacing " Chrome Hip Shot Style Bass Bridge " . Not exactly the vintage look but hey ho <p> There 's also " Wilkinson Classic Style 4 String Bass Bridge with offset Brass saddles " but they are 58 mm - would that extra 4mm push the outer strings way too close to the edges ? I do n't have a bronco bass neck to measure ... <p> If it 's 54mm spacing , I think it should work very well . It would keep the stock feel .

@@80331693 @1831693/ <p> In the late ' 60s , when Domino guitars were fading away , tube amplifiers were out of vogue . Old technology , man ! Cool bands played through solidstate amps that delivered lots of clean power with none of that awful tube distortion . Cool bands played through Standels and tuck-and-rolled Kustoms . Entire bands were run through a single 350-watt Mosrite monster . <p> Coming out of the late- ' 60s affection for transistors was the Acoustic Control Corporation , which specialized in what were , for the times , pretty advanced solidstate amps . However , in ' 72 , Acoustic introduced its one and only guitar and bass design , the Acoustic Black Widow , which represented a fascinating foray into the world of guitar manufacturing . <p> The Acoustic Black Widows were particularly interesting because they really went in the face of trends of the times . Black Widows were likely designed in the U.S. , but the majority were built in Japan ( though Semie Moseley said he built the final 200 ) . The Black Widow shown here is Japanese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly different features and a feel that is unmistakably Mosrite . What made these so curious was that , while most American importers and manufacturers were rushing headlong toward the copy syndrome , the Acoustic Black Widows were unique , designed with certain technological objectives in mind . <p> Guitars and basses were equal double-cutaway solidbodies looking like an enlarged Les Paul Junior . Cutaway horns were flared , the wide lower bout was oval-shaped . Bodies were black-lacquered maple , with a German carve around the edges . The black-finished maple neck was bolted on , with a wide , triple-bound center-peaked headstock that was kind of a cross between a Kay and a Gibson . The logo was all lower case . The neck had a zero fret followed by two octaves of frets in a rosewood fingerboard on the guitar , 20 frets on the bass . Position markers were mini-dots . Strings passed over a fine-tune bridge to a large tailblock placed further back , designed to increase sustain . These were not instruments for the timid . The guitar had a whopping 27 " scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guitar had two humbuckers with chrome sides and a black plastic insert , with 12 poles , a three-way select , and two volume and two tone controls . The bass had one humbucker with eight poles in the center position , with volume and tone . Jack was front-mounted , and they came with a plush-lined hardshell case . The guitar was equipped with Grover Rotomatic tuners , while the bass came with Grover bass tuners . By ' 74 , the bass tuners had been changed to Schallers . Knobs were brushed aluminum . The most striking feature of the Black Widows was a red leather pad on the back of the guitar , attached with snap-on fasteners , stitched with a " black widow " pattern . <p> Toward the end of the run , the Black Widow guitar got an endorsement from jazz fusion great Larry Coryell , the only big name player to align himself with these guitars . <p> The Black Widows exhibit a surprising quality for their time , far in advance of comparable Japanese guitars . The pickups were fairly high-output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While they look unprepossessing , when you pick one up you feel in the presence of a solid guitar worthy of respect . The guitar and bass were still offered in the ' 74 Acoustic catalog , but disappeared by ' 75 as the copy era finally triumphed . Acoustic would continue to make amplifiers , but would never return to the guitar business . Acoustic Black Widows were not produced in enormous quantities , so they are relatively rare , but they turn up with some regularity if you keep your eyes open , mostly because few people pay attention to them . Expect to pay much more for a Moseley version , if the seller knows what he 's got . Most folks do n't know what they are , and they should n't cost you a fortune , even though they represent an interesting punctuation point in American guitar history . <p> The Acoustic Black Widow Story by Mark Schlipper - July 2004 <p> Here 's the story as I 've pieced it together . Ill edit as needed to make sure I have the most accurate story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerst , a former Acoustic employee . <p> In 1972 , solid state amp pioneers Acoustic Control Corporation introduced thier first and only guitar and bass models , the Black Widow . Guitar maker Paul Barth , who 's history includes work with Rickenbacker on thier first electrics , did the original designs for the Black Widow . Barths company Bartell made the first few Widows . They had smaller cutaways , a normal neck join , 20 or 22 fret neck , and normal humbuckers . <p> Acoustic 's Harvey Gerst then took that original design and revamped it , essentially taking it up a notch to a whole new kind of guitar . Gerst deepend the cutaways , and upped the fret count to 24 . The pickups were changed to hotter , lap steel style single coils with lots of wire and lots of magnet . The controls were shifted up a bit so the volume was accessable while playing for swells . The bridge rollers were enlarged for more sustain . Weight was added to the body for a better balance . And the novel neck design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers Acoustic wanted , so the designs were taken to Matsumoto Moko in Japan . At the time , they were producing some of the finest guitars coming out of Asia , that still rival the American made stuff . The majority of Black Widows out there in the world are Matsumokus . <p> Then at some point ( after Harvey left , so details are missing ) Acoustic brought production back to the states , and put it in the capable hands of Semie Mosley , whose Mosrite guitars already shared some design elements with the Widow . The fact that Paul and Semie both worked together at Rickenbacker is no surprise . Its my understanding that a few things changed back to a more normal design after this transition , namely the neck join . Shortly after Mosley took on the Widows , he stopped . <p> At some other point , Paul Barth took his design to Hohner . To date , I 've only seen Hohner Widow basses . The overall shape is the same as the Acoustic , and they have the carved top like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambered body , two pickups ( on the bass ) , and an option to have it in natural maple finish with a maple fretboard . Also , while ( to my knowledge ) Acoustic only made fretted basses , the Hohners were primarily fretless ( with one fretted one seen ) . Smaller differences are the black pad on the back , and bridge/tailpiece design . They have " Hohner " on the headstock and a label in the f-hole stating " Mfg. by Bartell of California " . <p> All in all its " wildly guessed " that no more than 1000 of these guitars were made for Acoustic . With the fewest being Barths , and no more than a couple hundred being Mosleys . But due to company hand changes , production hand changes , etc , its really hard to tell . We may start cataloging them here , see how many there are in the world , and how many variations . <p> Last edited by westtexasred on Tue Mar 31 , 2009 3:14 pm ; edited 4 times in total <p> The Acoustic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated above but earlier . <p> Paul barth working with Bartell started making them in 1968 and Acoustic Released its first known catalog in 1969 advertising the Acoustic Black Widow Jimmy Hendrix was photographed with one as well as Frank Zappa as early as 1969/1970 <p> More on the Frank Zappa Acoustic Black Widow Guitar : <p> Frank Zappa 's Black Widow Guitar <p> Acoustic Control Corporation Black Widow Electric Guitar by Bartell of California , designed by Paul Barth .

Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy . <p> *shrug* I 've never had problems with fat winds on my basses in the past 15 years . The thickness of the wraps is n't much of an issue with a standard , Fender style , bass tuning peg ; many strings are not made with a taper , and if it is , if you end up wrapping before the taper , you 're still ok . If you 're breaking strings at the tuning peg , you 're doing something super wrong or buying some pretty crap strings .

It really depends on which strings you 're using . But really , is it so hard to buy proper scale strings and to use them for what they were intended for ? <p> I 've bought the Fender brand bass strings that are packaged as " short scale " . The problem is though , the fabric that wraps the taper at the tuners extends past the nut about an 8th inch . I 'm not sure how much it really effects anything and doubt I 'd notice a difference in sound if they did n't . Personally I like having the strings tapered at the tuners instead of cutting down a full scale set , you get more winds around the tuner post .

That said , yeah , Rotosound makes a solid string ; I use Tru Bass 88s on my fretless . <p> But , even with a tight break angle , if you wrap properly on the peg , you can minimize the wear&amp;tear on the string core where it bends around the peg slot/hole . Having a full wrap reduces the amount of slippage and strain around the peg ( too many wraps can cause issues with tuning stability though , there 's a sweet middle ground ) , reducing the small changes in tension at the anchor point . Spending some time/care installing the string will greatly reduce your worries and keep your strings healthy .

This is not correct as the dot spacing , peghead shape , and type of rosewood on a 1962 jaguar neck is different than these 9/65 to 10/66 necks .

I could have slipped a boost in there , there is power on the socket too . The VS switch on the panel is disabled by applying a control voltage to the VS socket when you plug in the footswitch <p> The drawback with this rather than switchable attenuation in the real FX loop is that the reverb and the clean channel are mixed in separately at the master volume , so the reverb level stays the same whether you 've attenuated the dry signal or not .

I prefer to velcro my pedals and i 'm not sure how well my pedals would stay mounted to the board . Yes . <p> The board that they supply with the Spider case is very good for sticking velcro directly to . I used to use a NSP Flightcases pedalboard and that had a very nice textured grippy surface which was very nice but velcro just would n't stick to it . Velcro sticks so well to the Spider board that when I removed a strip of velcro from it recently it took a bit of effort and brought some of the top layer of the plywood with it - not so good though if you plan on moving your velcro around often .

@@80331735 @1831735/ <p> Hey all , wish I had a better first post to make , but I 'm in a rush to make a purchase and was wondering if anybody knows if a 98 Squier Affinity series Duo-Sonic neck ( never new there was such a thing til ' I bought it ) would fit the pocket of a vintage Duo , Mustang , or short scale from the 60 's or 70 's . I have no knowledge whatsoever on what changes Fender has made in regards to neck pockets over the years and what is interchangeable with what . I do n't even have any tools at my disposal right now to give measurements on the neck dimensions , I 'm just hoping that on a longshot someone might have an answer that can get me started on a project with a corresponding build thread once I have some idea of how I can marry this neck to a vintage body with vintage electronics . Thanks a bunch . <p> In a lot of things I 've read , they say that most of the vintage " student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available in both 24 ' and 22.5 ' scale lengths . Knowing Fender 's habit of using the same bodies with minor alterations for different guitars , I assumed that there would n't be differences between the short scale and shortest scale bodies , but that the necks would be interchangeable . Is n't 22.7 close enough to 22.5 to fit with just a saddle adjustment ? <p> nope , not close enough , i had a mid 90 's 22.7 " on my 74 mustang for a while , no matter what i did without actually moving the bridge back a bit further it would not intonate properly past the 8th fret , i was fine with that for about a year , but got fed up when trying to record , or play anything beyond open chords <p> the necks are what is commonly known as a conversion neck . other conversion necks are , the current squier cv duo 24 " conversion current run jagmaster 24 " ( if you find a 90 's vista jagmaster neck it will work as it is a true 24 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've read , they say that most of the vintage " student model " guitars like mustangs and broncos , etc were available in both 24 ' and 22.5 ' scale lengths .

Is n't 22.7 close enough to 22.5 to fit with just a saddle adjustment ? <p> it 's close in length , yes , but the fret placement will be different . because of their respective intended bridge placement they will end at different points on the scale . what I 'm saying is .... the vintage are 21 fret and the 90s are 22 fret . <p> The CV Duo and Jagmaster II have necks that give them roughly a 24 " scale . The Squier " conversion " neck came into being through the dissatisfaction over the Jagmaster 's ( first reissue ) long scale and its un-Jaguar-ness . So with a shit ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched from the 25.5 " necks to the newly designed ( ? ) " conversion " necks that made use of the bodies routed for 25.5 " scale necks . I believe the actual scale of the Jagmaster II is n't exactly 24 " as that math would never work . Hence , these necks are n't drop-in replacements for Mustangs , Jaguars , Jagstangs , etc . <p> However , they ARE drop-in replacements for guitars of the 25.5 " scale variety ( ie Strats and Teles ) . Although my Jagmaster is long-gone , its neck lives on bolted to a Strat and it fucking rocks ! <p> I believe the actual scale of the Jagmaster II is n't exactly 24 " as that math would never work . Hence , these necks are n't drop-in replacements for Mustangs , Jaguars , Jagstangs , etc . <p> no , they are 24 " it 's just that , being that it was originally designed for a 25.5 " neck , the bridge is in a different place in relation to the neck pocket than on mustangs and jaguars. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point on the scale . <p> well that kinda blows , looks like I 'll have to build my own body to stick the stupid thing on . Thanks for the help and the pics . <p> or maybe just do some research before you buy random stuff ? <p> Naw man , this was my research . It 's actually a fine neck that I got at a fantastic price with the intent to build my own body for it . I just became curious as to wether or not it could be a drop in replacement for a vintage body , and within these last 10 or so posts I 've learned more about it and said guitar bodies than I could find anywhere else on the internet . After I finish one or two tele builds I can go back to trying to figure out just what I want to do with it . <p> Not sure if it was clear from the discussion , but the fact that it 's a conversion neck means you can use any body with the bridge placed for a 25.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type body , or a Jazzmaster body , etc etc etc . Lots of options there . <p> That would be a sick ass beast , but I think I wan na go offset for this one , I 've been thinking of making a Cyclone Plus with the lace red dually in the bridge and blue single in the neck . Thanks again for all your responses , you guys are going above and beyond with the pictures and measurements ! <p> if you 're buying a cyclone body double check to see what the scale length is , if you 're building one , do it up , and start a thread in the Guitar Projects , actually any build toss it in there and document the shit out of it ..

@@80331747 @1831747/ <p> I 'm not going to argue with your view of B5-placement aesthetics , but as someone who 's played both types of B5s ( Along with guitars featuring every current production Bigsby , save the B11 ) will happily stand by Fender Japan 's idea to put it there for the sake of practicality and vibrato comfort ... The B5 in general feels nothing like the delightfully squishy movement of the B3 and B6 on my G6128 and G6122-1962 , respectfully for example , and the increased tension when a B5 is kissing the bridge results in more effort to make the thing work . As an aside , this is why an F-Stamped B5 is actually not as practical on a Telecaster , creating more problems than just the stirrings scraping the bridge assembly before barely passing over the saddles . <p> Along the same lines , Gibz doing a similar thing on some late ' 60s and early ' 70s SGs simply made sense .

Even moreso probably . Even if a bigsby looks like a boat anchor on a small guitar body ( which it does , sorry ) , it still trumps the stock trem if it 's at least functional . <p> But still . That trem probably weighs almost as much as the guitar it 's bolted onto . " I bet you like your Big Muffs like your vodka , Russian and made of military surplus .

Granted , the Jazzmaster 's tremolo has a lot more play in the floppy arm that allows me to swing in deeper and get more subtle tones in comparison , and is thus fair to say that they 're simply different . I will reiterate that the main problem with the F-Stamp B5 on a Tele is the strings dragging over the backend of the bridge ass'y , easily rectified by blowing a chunk on a Master Bridge . I 'm not a Nels Clinesque violent wobbler ( so for me it 's not much of an issue ) , but for some it might and I 'd wholeheartedly recommend a standard B5 if one 's Tele really needed one .

For a company that started out making cheapo Teisco copies and selling them for a few hundred bucks new , they seem to have learned awfully quick that by actually buying old defunct brand names of rarities they can get away with charging three times as much as they used to as long as the product stays cheaper than a vintage example . When Eastwoods first came out they felt , played , and sounded like Epiphone quality to me , which was cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every newer model Eastwood I 've played feels , plays , and sounds just like the old ones and the only justification for these $800 stickers that I can see is that they have a " proper " brand name on the headstock now and they 're still cheaper than paying $2000 for a minty vintage example ( that admittedly probably has way more quirks and distress than a new Eastwood ) . <p> So great , you 've decided to buy a cool looking guitar whose value was set by the manufacturer whose only basis for pricing are 50 year old vintage examples and not competitive with other guitars offered by companies built with similar specs . So what does that do for resale ? A quick eBay search pulls a ton of active listings , all over $700 , but a look at completed listings shows that none of them sold .

Of course it comes down to which guitar do you like more and if you 're not getting along with the fat Epi neck now it 's likely you never LONG ... <p> I have tiny girlhands and find fat necks more comfortable than really skinny ones .

@@80331756 @1831756/ <p> I believe the bridge is a Mexi Vintage bridge , not the all-steel 57/62 Vintage hardtail bridge . The bridge , however , works and intonates fine . <p> Pickups sound ok ... they are very " neutral " to my ears , not super chimey or twangy ... right in between a Strat and Tele . They are not " hot " ( more below ) but not thin either . Bottom Line : they make guitar noise . BTW , I play through a 2014 Deluxe Reverb Reissue with the bright cap clipped with a Weber ceramic speaker . I either play clean or use a RC Booster with the gain control turned all the way up for a bit of additional gain . <p> Finally , the toggle switch is solid and pots are smooth . <p> I opened it up today to look inside and here 's what I found . <p> Pots are stamped in English " Made in Korea . " Output jack looks fine but I do n't think it 's a Switchcraft . Wiring in general is low-priced PVC insulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled ... in other words two wires ( one insulated ) are wrapped in one larger PVC sleeve . Surprisingly , the toggle switch is all metal with decent lugs and looks pretty durable . The tone cap is a no-name , ( at least not Fender USA standard ) and I could n't tell if it 's a .022 or .047 .... I think it 's the later but not sure . The pickups seem ok , the coils are wrapped in thick protective tape but I think I saw some bright copper Formvar peaking out . i de-soldered them from the switch lugs and they measured 6.35K ohms for the bridge and 6.1K for the neck . There 's some shielding paint in the cavity , but it 's uneven , thin or even missing in spots ... not a good thick coating . In general the pickup/controls rout in the body is big , but it 's not a bathtub . Overall , the interior workmanship , soldering , neatness , and quality is pretty good ... not great or elegant , but definitely competent and sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewmac stuff , to include : two CTS 250K solid shaft pots , a Switchcraft jack . some cloth and shielded 22 gauge wire , a .022 orange drop cap . I 've got some leftover shielding paint in the garage from another project . I also am considering a set of CBS-era pickups from The Pickup Wizard on eBay ( I have a soft spot for plain enamel wire , under-wound pickups ; ever since I got some Custom Shop 69 pickups for my American Strat years ago ) . However , I think the OEM pickups are ok and frankly , how much money do I really want to dump into this little guitar ... <p> Anyway , thought it would be interesting to post my quick observations . Not sure if others have observed the same .... <p> Am I happy I bought it ? Yes . A decent guitar for $500 in my opinion . And those colors are irresistible . <p> I 've also started to look at this guitar more since my bandmate just got one . It 's a really nice guitar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiring is that it has Gibson 50s wiring , where the tone knob is attached to the output and not the input of the volume knob . This means the guitar stays bright as you turn the volume down , but it also loses volume as you turn the tone down . On standard Fenders and modern Gibsons , the guitar gets darker as you turn the volume down , but stays the same volume as you turn the tone down . Passive guitars being what they are , you have to choose one or the other , and it 's interesting that they used wiring more associated with a vintage Gibson than a Fender . Either way , it can be changed in seconds with a soldering iron , but I thought it interesting enough to point out . <p> I think the only thing I do n't like about this guitar is that stupid string tree that 's jammed up right against the headstock . Replace it as soon as you can . I actually think that 's a glaring enough issue that it 's worth changing right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd probably change it in time , but it 's certainly not something that needs to happen right away , it 's more of something you do at the 2nd string change after the return period is over and you know you 're keeping it . You could definitely buy the guitar and gig with it right away . Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy . <p> The jack failed in practice yesterday . Took the thingy home and changed her out , and while I was at it , I decided to just look at a few other things . Anyway , the bridge humbucker in the HS measures in the low 8k range , and is 3-conductor with shield and goes from red to white to green to shield . So it is possible to change the push-pull to do parallel/series pretty easily : <p> 1 2 3 4 5 6 --- Pot <p> Now , disconnect the bridge humbucker and free up the white and green wires from each other and the heat shrink . There should be a long wire that is performing coil split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the push-pull . Make it so that 6 is ground + humbucker ground ( was already grounded in this guitar , so made use of existing wiring ) , 4 is white , 2 and 1 are connected , 3 is humbucker green , and 5 is humbucker red + output wire . Now connect that long output wire where the bridge goes on the 3-way switch , and you 've made a parallel-series option for the humbucker . Useful if you 're installing a noise-free neck pickup and you do n't want the split to mess that up . Also , I found that the humbucker was out of phase with a DiMarzio pickup in default form , which I kind of expected since most Fender pickups are out of phase with most aftermarket pickups in my experience .

@@80331766 @1831766/ <p> If you look at the bottom case , this " back to back " placement is a common configuration in fuzz/overdrive pedals to clip up the signal . What a diode does is to conduct current in only one direction , when the voltage across the diode is above a certain threshold level . Basically this arrangement means you clip both the top and the bottom halves of the wave form ( a guitar signal is AC in that it has positive and negative components to it - that 's why capacitors are used to couple stages without DC offset , but I digress ) . This way when the voltage signal exceeds the diode threshold , it turns on and conducts , clipping this additional signal from the output .

The Pedal itself lifts the tone out of the murk and gives it the bite and clarity I was hoping for . <p> Turning the voice all the way left gives me a tone I really dig with the amp distortion . Hard to explain but its like it gets me the sort of low end clarity I hear on Shellac records . I have a riff that usually only sounds right when on the bridge pup as too much bass murks up the dynamics and you cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Using the voice knob far left really brings out the dynamics of the riff whilst retaining the low end grunt . Its a really really great tone for my purposes . In fact , if I understand his rig set up right , Albini has his signal set up so that one half is routed through a 60s Bassman into the 1x15 cab , so in effect I am achieving a similar vibe by routing the my signal through a pedal that emulates a ballpark similar tone into my own 1x15 . COOL . <p> A question : What would be the benefit of being able to turn off the speaker emulation ala the Tech 21 Blonde ? Has anyone looked inside the Joyo to see if this feature is available either via an internal pot/switch or with an easy mod ? <p> Oooh just used this to plug directly into my PC which is at the bottom of my bed ( yeah yeah ) and it means i can have a decent sound coming out of my monitors for ad hoc noodling !

A disturbing observation is that it is the only guitar in the world shaped as a coffin , the white colour makes this all the more obvious . Whether Curtis had this in mind when purchasing the guitar is anyone 's guess .

Once its in muscle memory then it becomes nothing , like the main part from battery there are a few spots where you ( or at least I ) have to switch the picking pattern for one or two notes and bring it back to the original but because the triplet/gallop feel is ingrained in muscle memory it does n't  pose much of a problem . <p> If you 're not playing bottom strings it helps anchoring your forearm on the body at an angle to the strings ( whatever is comfortable ) .

@@80331795 @1831795/ <p> I found this in an old magazine spotlighting the Beatles . Probably from 1963/64 . I found this and thought the guitars were pretty interesting for Hoboken , NJ era Guild . I did n't find any existing pictures of this so I thought I 'd upload it here . I hope you enjoy . thanks ! <p> There is some interesting info on the Guilds in this letter to the Editor of Vintage Guitar Magazine : <p> " Just read the Guild S-200 Thunderbird ' Instrument Profile ' by Michael Wright in the November 2006 issue . I 'm really sorry to say that , apart from the social commentary , the article is full of mistakes and almost all the factual information is wrong . The fact that the information is wrong does n't bother me that much ; we all make mistakes . What bothers me is that most of the information could be checked if one would take the trouble . <p> Here are quotes from the article followed by a comment from me : <p> All three of Guilds new solidbodies had glued-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thunderbird and Jet-Star and a reverse six-in-line on the Polara . <p> That is not correct . All three solidbodies had a similar shaped Florentine headstock when they were introduced in 1963 . The six-in-line headstock wasnt used before 1965 . <p> Initially , the S-200 was equipped with small Guild Anti-Hum humbucking pickups . How long these were used is unknown , but at some point ( probably early on ) Guild switched to Frequency Tested single-coils manufactured by DeArmond , as seen on the guitar shown here . <p> The humbucking units were used into 1965 . The switch from humbucking pickups to the small single coils ( aka Mickey Mouse pickups ) took place during 1965 . Also , these small single coils were not manufactured by DeArmond . <p> The Thunderbird was also equipped with a version of the Hagstrom knife-edge vibrato . Whether Guild licensed the design and made its own or obtained them from Sweden is unknown . <p> These vibratos were obtained from Hagstrom , who were distributing the Guild line in Sweden , together with the adjusto-matic bridges , tuning machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guitars and basses . <p> Before 1964 , Guild guitars had a headstock design that was very similar to Gibsons open-book shape . That year Guild switched to a new center-humped shape for its acoustics and archtops , and at some unknown point close to this , Guild ditched the Florentine head for the new standard shape seen here , possibly as early as 64 . <p> The first guitars with the center-raised headstock were done in 1962 ( not counting the Johnny Smith Award Model that already had the center-raised profile in 1956 ) and the design change was incorporated into the regular model line during the course of the following years . The S-200 however kept the Florentine headstock into the year 1965 . <p> We have to be a little vague here because Guild never bothered to change the Florentine art in its catalog through 68 , though the majority of Thunderbirds that show up have the standard head . <p> Catalogs in general are not a very good source for information . Most manufacturers often use photos long after the specs for a specific model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my research I have found that the change from the Florentine headstock to the regular center-raised style took place around the same time that the serial number system was changed , which was towards the end of 1965 . My database already contains more Thunderbirds from the 1963-1965 period with the Florentine headstock than the official 91 that were produced since the change of the serial number system , which makes me wonder what the claim that the majority of Thunderbirds that show up have the standard head is based on . <p> Thunderbirds were available from 63 to 69 in cherry or sunburst finishes . <p> Cherry and sunburst were indeed the colors mentioned in the catalogs and price list but the price lists also mentioned optional colors and Ive come across quite a few Walnut and Black examples . <p> The downscale Polara and Jet-Star were a little more conservative in shape and sported the Frequncy Tested DeArmonds , but did not have the fancy electronics or built-in stand . <p> The pickups used on the Polara and the Jet-Star were always Guild pickups and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced in 1963 , both the S-200 Thunderbird and the S-100 Polara had the built-in stand . <p> Its not known exactly how many of these early Guild solidbodies were made , but probably not many . Records indicate about 90 Thunderbirds were produced ; the serial number on this 66 Thunderbird is SC 120 , SC being the Thunderbird prefix . Knowing that 90 are accounted for , this number suggests consecutive numbering that reflects actual production totals . <p> Guilds serial number system was changed during the year 1965 . The new serial number system used a two letter prefix for each individual model followed by consecutive numbers starting with # 101 . The last number for 1968 was SC-191 indicating a total production of 91 guitars since the start of the new serial number system up to and including 1968 . <p> .... there were probably 30 or so made in 63-64 . Add a few more for 68 and the total output is likely 150 or fewer , qualifying the Guild Thunderbird as being of the rare variety that never really flew . <p> Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my database . These are actual existing guitars that I 've personally checked and in the cases where the info was given by other people , I did get photos . I have the serial numbers and all of the specs. of these individual models including the headstock shape , pickups that were used and the finish color , and these are only the ones that Ive come across . Knowing the way that Guild worked and the usual size of their batches I could fill in the missing numbers in between known serial numbers and the possible number of Thunderbirds would be quite a bit higher . All of this again makes me wonder what the authors claim that the total output is likely 150 or fewer is based on . What is the source of this information ? <p> As a writer you have a responsibility towards the reader who might go out and spend a couple of thousand dollars on the basis of what you wrote .

@@80331809 @1831809/ <p> I actually took a classical guitar class in college , so the one thing I learned was the finger picking . I use my thumb for the E-A-D strings and the index-middle-ring fingers play the G-B-E strings . Pinky finger not used . I ca n't pick as fast as the guy in the video , but I am able to finger pick and sing . J Mascis Jazzmaster Baja Telecaster AVRI Jaguar 1967 Fender Coronado II 1977 Mullet-stang 1973 Fender Bronco <p> what taylor said is right . EAD is thumb and GBE is index , middle , ring accordingly . <p> I 've been working a bunch of exercises to learn finger picking and mainly hybrid picking because I want to have some mad chickin ' lickin ' chopz . If you want me to tab some out and make a pdf version , I can do that for it , it really is n't to hard if you practice is 10 minutes every day. twitter.com/skcwillie <p> I still ca n't use all fingers competently . A few years ago I started with just the thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then introduced the index when I started banjo , and now recently I can use use the ring and pinky which are all ( just about ) comfortable . <p> Honestly , it was a really long and drawn out process for me - I think everyone just needs lots of experience and to build up one or two fingers at a time . It is really hard . <p> You also do n't need to rigorously assign each finger to each string . If you can play the piece that 's the end goal . And that piece looks really hard too , you 'd just to rough it out and practice at half speed and build up etc . <p> When I first started out I found it really difficult to fathom but as you get a bit more experienced , it gets easier . <p> A friend of mine gave me the best advice , he basically said that it does n't matter what fingers you do or do n't use , it 's more important that you hit the right notes , at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're writing your own stuff because you can make up your own rules . I know you ca n't apply that rule to every song that has fingerpicking in it , but it 's a start . <p> I ca n't say that I have a particular technique but I definitely started out just using my thumb for the bass notes and my index for the rest , as long as you can keep the rhythym going on the bass notes then it 's just making sure you hit the right notes at the right point after that . Plucking out the melody ... <p> Also , the whole playing the song slowly first , just to get your fingers used to the pattern , is definitely a good technique . I think after that it just comes down to muscle memory and knowing which strings to pluck first , then the rest just follows naturally , without barely even thinking about it . <p> Practice makes perfect as they say . I 'm sure others will be able to give better advice but I 'm just going off how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a classical guitar class in college , so I learned the one finger per string method . 1st finger - G , 2nd finger - B , 3rd finger - e , and thumb for E , A , and D. It felt weird at first , but after I practiced it by just using that method and walking up and down a D major chord string by string , I got really good at it . When I teach fingerpicking to my students I teach them that way , and I tell them to just walk up and down the D chord to get used to it . <p> The thing to get used to more than the one finger per string , that I 've noticed my students have trouble with , and that I had trouble with myself when I was learning was hand position . You have to have your hand positioned just so that each finger falls under the string that it is designated to and so you can just pluck each finger in towards your palm , and get it back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand positioned so that your 3 fingers are able to do that reasonably , you can just move your thumb to where it needs to be easily . The thumb is honestly the easiest part to get for finger picking , so I usually suggest you focus on that last , after you get used to your three fingers picking each string . <p> I 'm pretty non-conventional as a teacher , since I was mostly self taught , I do n't believe that there is only one way to do everything so honestly I believe in the " If you 're hitting the right note at the right time then you 're fine " system to an extent too . But from personal experience with trying to teach myself fingerpicking and not doing it correctly , and then learning the " correct " way , it is much much easier to do , especially when you get to playing faster things . It may be harder to nail at first , but once you get it , the payoff is worth it . <p> Does anyone use their finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chew em off ..... tryin to think of a reason to keep em <p> The last month or so I 've had nails . The tone and dynamics etc make it really worth while for all types of playing in my opinion . Even for riffing I do n't use a plectrum now . <p> george , i have a mate who fingerpicks and he gets acrylic fingernails sorted monthly . Says it makes it a lot easier but he got a weird reaction from the nailbar when he only asked for the one hand to be done <p> ive ended up using the paul mccartney/stephen fretwell " easy " technique which is smith also uses in the verses of that tune . you use your thumb to pick out bass lines and any moving notes in the chords that you wan na accentuate and the " strum " with your forefinger accross the other strings . its very rudimentary but you can get some great effects with it . <p> its basically lazt guitar playing but i put quite a bit of work into " proper " fingerpicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terribly Rock N Roll <p> I can play Angeles , ( &amp; I 'm not that good . ) Angeles is really a pattern-picking song . Once you learn the basic right hand alternating bass pattern it 's actually pretty easy . It 's almost like a trick--songs that sound impossible are n't actually that hard ( Angeles &amp; also Dylan 's Do n't Think Twice , It 's Alright for example ) . You have to learn the pattern though . You could try playing something like " Landslide " which is pretty easy but basically the same pattern . Then check out Lowdenjim 's videos on youtube--they are really good--the below one is for Do n't Think Twice , It 's Alright . I basically used the video below to teach myself how to fingerpick a year or two ago . Once I got it , I was amazed I could do it--it 's really like a trick . It does take a while to get the hang of it though--like a few months . <p> ( You do n't necessarily need long nails either--mine are n't long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just not as loud ) . ( Also , once you get the initial hang of it , one thing that helps is to keep your pinky finger on the top of the guitar--excruciatingly uncomfortable for a week or so while you 're learning to keep it there--you 'll think it 's not a good idea fro your particular hand--but once you 're used to it you 'll agree , it helps you pick a lot faster &amp; cleaner . ) <p> Luckily , I never tried fingerpicking before my mum and dad got me lessons for my 14th birthday . So I got into a good technique before any bad habits occur . I am not excellent at picking , but I think with some practice I could eventually get rather good . <p> As for Elliott , he 's something special . I have XO tattooed on my arm ( an E.S album ) , Tomorrow , tomorrow has the craziest fingerpicking ever .

@@80331812 @1831812/ <p> As some of you know , last night , I bought a new , candy apple red ' 66 Jag reissue , for chump change . A free setup of the guitar was thrown in as a part of the purchase ( they have a luthier on staff , who along with doing repairs , and restorations , does guitar setups ) . I left instructions that I want my Jag set up for 12s with a wound G. I used 10s for a very long time ( about as long as I 've been playing - 31 years ) .

What do you guys think , 12s , or 13s ? <p> johnny marr and fran use 10s on their jaguars. that 's a good enough vote of approval for me. my opinion is either 10s w/ wound G or 10s w/ heavy bottom , depending on the tone you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm looking for more punch soundwise , and frankly I prefer a stiffer feel playingwise ( I 've never been much of a string bender - I 'm more of a picker ) , so I think I 'll give 12s a try .

I honestly ca n't figure out what the trem is from though , it 's the only one I 've seen that 's Fender branded , but has no lock . Also a trem arm I had leftover from another project---which I think is for an MIJ/CIJ trem---fits it perfectly , even locks in place . <p> Body is just a standard vm jag body I routed for a humbucker in the bridge .

Your Punkacc9 evolved into Awstin. **34;561;TOOLONG <p> Man you are n't kidding , I just strung it up and the Squier Mustang bridge is unfortunately as awful as everyone says . The strings do n't stay in the slots , and the low E string wo n't even intonate . Is there anywhere I can get a Staytrem bridge aside from their site ? They 're closed until the 24th . ( WTF what kind of business shuts down a website due to a building relocation ? ) I 've never tried a Warmoth Mustang bridge , but I 'd almost rather try my hand at drilling and threading adjustment screws into the Fender Mustang bridge I have . That or just buy Graphtech saddles . <p> I heard the warmoth bridges are pretty good . I do enjoy my staytrem bridge on my starcaster though . You got ta make sure to get 9.5 radius . And yeahhh I had that problem too . There site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off someone on OSG . I just made a wanted to by post . Congratulations ! Your Punkacc9 evolved into Awstin. **34;597;TOOLONG <p> I once spent a very pleasant hour on the phone with John Staytrem back when he was starting out . He strikes me as an older guy who is running this business and also holding down a normal life , so I guess he has himself some downtime when needed . I simply can not speak highly enough about him and the stay trem Jag arm I got from him ( custom made to fit a CP jag - the first he 'd done ) . <p> Yeah I would go staytrem over mastery . I 've seen a lot of the staytrems last longer on OSG and the masters are too expensive . Congratulations ! Your Punkacc9 evolved into Awstin. **34;633;TOOLONG <p> Oh it was just that people were accusing you of paul1k-ness because of putting a Fender neck on a Squier <p> Well , it turns out that the Squier pickguard is a different shape entirely than an MIJ/CIJ Fender . Or rather , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't use the black pickguard I have . But , it DOES look kind of nice with white Jag pickups . <p> I also ca n't use the Squier pickguard to mount the Mosrite pickups , because the pickup holes are wider than the mounting points of the Mosrite pickups . I could use a mounting ring , but it would cover up the pickguard screw holes . So , I ordered some AVRI pickups off Amazon of all places , $80 brand new for a pair , could n't pass that up . 
@@80331821 @1831821/ <p> bad news : i have to route it more to fit a mustang bridge pick-up , we tried a bwb guard and it would not fit , which is a shame because it actually looked cool , pics to come . <p> good news : we pulled the EMG bridge pickup and got the mustang bridge pickup to fit in the humbucker route like an early 60 's duo-sonic . <p> now there is a mini 3 way switch , and we are trying to wire this thing up fresh . we are using the below diagrams ... <p> the problem is that the mustang pickup has blue and yellow leads like below ... <p> so since neither of us really know what we are doing , which wire on the mustang pickup is live and which is ground ? if we get that figured out , my buddy can wire it up this week and the thing can be one step closer to a functioning guitar <p> It appears that the blue would be the ground wire while the yellow would be the lead wire . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it will work , but it is all I could come up with . The chart appears to be correct enough though , by havin strat leads listed as white and the grounds black . <p> I think people try to use light and dark for the two . Blue and yellow must tell you which pickup it is . I have one where the guy used whatever wires he had laying around , so the colors were hard to track . Yell Like Hell <p> do n't think it matters as long as you are consistent between the two pickups . <p> The confusing part is the pickups you use vs the orientation of them . I recently put in strat pickups into a Duo Sonic and got super confused because the Strats are meant to be installed with the leads coming out the bottom on all 3 pickups . But the Duo Sonic and Mustang diagrams expect the neck leads to point down and the bridge leads to point up . Furthermore , this expected orientation precedes the pickup maker 's decision on polarity and winding direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconcile a RWRP polarity middle strat pickup with the Duo Sonic diagram . I ended up looking at the direction of winding and making sure they are reversed ( easy to tell because you can see where the wraps started ) . And then understanding that the strat has reverse polarity on the middle pickup , I installed them with leads facing down , and making sure the wiring is reversed by looking at the wiring direction rather than the color . <p> In your case , I think what you want is for the Mustang pickups to be oriented so leads are facing each other ( neck leads facing down and bridge leads facing up ) which will get you the expected polarity . And then whatever leads you use to hook up one pickup , make sure you use the right leads to result in a reverse winding . Not sure what colors those will be . So you will have to pay attention to the winding and which color lead goes to where . <p> I had to do this with the Strat pickups and i got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to have to go back in and reverse one of the pickups if it did not sound right ! It is so confusing you might as well try it one way , and if it does n't work , simply reverse the leads on one of the pickups.

This circuit provides all the tonality and feel of an all-tube power amp . Obviously this " small " power amp would not be very loud if it was connected directly to a loudspeaker therefore the tube circuit is connected to a larger , completely transparent solid-state power amplifier , that is run very cleanly so that it does not add its own colouration to the tube signal .

Have you modded your yba1 at all ? <p> Jumpering the inputs simply means bridging the guitar input into the bass or vice versa .

And presumably you could mod the bridge with compensated saddles . <p> I own a Mustang , Duo Sonic II and Music Master , so I 'm very familiar with both bridges . <p> Hidden : <p> I actually really like the Duo Sonic II / Music Master bridge . The " hardtail " models have a slightly different feel than a Mustang bridge , even when you 're not using the Mustang 's vibrato bar . The only issue with them is that , like a Tele , the three saddles means making some compromises in terms of individual string intonation . I get around that by using a $10 - $12 set of compensated brass replacement saddles . They have the added benefit of increasing sustain , and they sound great . With a set of those saddles , I have zero reservations about that bridge . <p> Thanks guys . I did n't think about the shared saddles , so that 's something to consider . There is n't a modern replacement for the bridges ( without modding ) , is there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd ask just in case .

@@80331849 @1831849/ <p> My experience has been that most strats ( tremolo equipped ) will not intonate properly with the squier CV duo sonic and jagmaster " conversion necks " .

Info on them are in the above links as well . <p> On the stock bridge , you might find that with the saddles adjusted far enough out for proper intonation the strings interfere with the mechanism . The GFS bridge is designed so the strings are adjacent to the adjustment screws instead of inline with them . The mounting holes might not line up perfectly with the stock holes . If that happens , then just fill them with a hardwood dowel and re-drill them accordingly . <p> I just measured , and it 's shorter than that . It 's actually more like 6 5/8 " , maybe even less .

@@80331851 @1831851/ <p> I 've been interested in trying an abstract design on a white pickguard . I was wondering if RIT dye might work in the same way it does on lax heads ?

@@80331865 @1831865/ <p> I got this from the other guitarist in Chattanooga punk sensation 40oz . Folklore . Here 's a quick list rundown of wha happen . <p> PROBLEM : Sound fades out and sometimes fades back in - as if someone was turning the amp on and off . <p> DIAGNOSIS : 1 . Tubes it had EL34 's in it , but this model was made for 5881 's . I 'm pretty sure you can get away with swapping them around , I 've done it for a while in other amps . I had some JAN PhillipsECG 6L6WGB tubes that I put in it to try . NOTE : Some of these actually did use EL34 's , you can tell the difference by looking at the value of the power tube 's screen resistors . <p> I noticed that the tubes were redplating like a motherfucker , so i swtiched them out with some 6L6GB 's I had and they still redplated - I could smell the tubes burning up . Nasty ! At this point , I 'm like ' FUCK WHAT ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat on those tubes . This seemed to do the job . <p> The amp seemed to be working ok and I thought maybe it was just the tubes , but then it starting the ' ol cutting out trick again , which is annoying as hell . I messed around and looked all over but did n't notice anything out of the ordinary . I noticed only the phase inverter 12ax7 was lighting up and decided to swap around all the 12ax7 's to make sure they all lit up in that same spot - they did , so they were all ok . I plugged my GOTH LES PAUL into the FX Return and it worked and sounded great and I found myself relieved about having a fully operational power section . <p> 2 . Preamp So , now I know it 's some shit in the preamp keeping these tubes from lighting up , I finally narrowed down the problem enough to find some useful information on this here internet . Apparently there is a very common problem with some of the DSL models in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube 's heaters gets so hot that it melts it 's own solder joints causing the 12ax7 's to shut down . People were replacing the actual bridge rectifiers thinking they were the actual problem , but I doubted a component like that would fail without being physically destroyed . <p> REPAIR : I unscrewed and flipped over the preamp board and went through with my BABY SIZE FLASHLIGHT to find any shitty solder joints - there were quite a bit . NOTE : The overall build quality on this thing seems rather shit compared to other amps I 've had the pleasure of glancing into ( but it may have been fucked with before ? ) . Anyway , I reflowed and resoldered all bad joints I could find and especially focused on all the bridge rectifiers there . I turned the amp on and fiddled around a bit more with the soldering on some bridges and it seemed to be working . I left it on for quite a while and checked back every so often and it 's been stable . <p> TO DO : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fuck it up again 2 . Bias the 5881 's or maybe put the el34 's back in and bias them right 3 . Record some clips ! <p> i used to own an SL-X and hated it . but then again i prolly never knew how to use it . but ... either it was clean or dirt . or dirt and dirt louder . i sold it and bought an ' 68 twin instead . and then some . never looked back ... <p> I kept the amp on ALL NIGHT LONG and woke up to properly working tubez ! Now I just have to figure out how to put that jank on there without having it pick up extra buzz and shit because of the wires ... <p> Amazin'ly enough , I had linked to this on a local music forum where the owner posts and it got me two more amps to mess with - a solid state ampeg svt bass amp and a jcm 2000 tsl that fell off the cab during it 's very first show and fucked up . i 'm excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me in Atlanta , GA .

@@80331870 @1831870/ <p> So on a ss guit , normal strings are a bit more stretchy and noodley . I assume the same is true for a ss bass ? I noticed that according to the fender site the standard mustang bass ships with .40-.95 's where a P Bass ships with .45-.100 's . It seems that common sense would say if a ss makes strings " floppier " , it would ship with at least the same string size as a 34 " scale , if not a tad larger ? Or is something else in play here i 'm not accounting for ? If i use .55-.110 on my P bass would there be less tension on a mustang bass ? facebook.com/Steelscape facebook.com/GetToMars <p> They do the same strings with the same gauge descriptions in medium , normal , long and super long scale as well but if you look at their tension charts the tension decreases as the strings get shorter .

Might turn up Saturday , with luck . <p> I think I missed the first thread .... is this basically an amp footswitch that routes the send/return from the amp through one cable into that box ? <p> On the amp the effect send/return is after the master volume , which means effect noise goes straight into the power amp section at full volume . The amp provides a connector that gives you the main channel dry clean and " VS " ( dirty ) feeds and a connection to the top of the master volume control , plus an input to disable the internal connection to the master volume . <p> This box switches between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let 's you switch a pot into circuit to give you a volume drop for lead/rhythm switching . From there it goes back to the master volume where it 's mixed with the second channel and reverb signals . This does require the effect to be capable of working with line level inputs , as it would on the main amp . <p> The main limitation is that only the dry signal goes to the switch box &amp; effect loop , and reverb volume is unaffected by the lead/rhythm switch . You set reverb to suit the rhythm setting and lose some when you switch to lead . I 'm still not sure whether it 's a workable compromise , and I guess I wo n't until I 've used it in anger for a while . 
@@80331872 @1831872/ <p> Ok , story time . So , sometimes I go to the local Guitar Center on my lunch break out of boredom , since it 's literally within walking distance of my work . Yesterday was one of those days . I usually just go and hang out for a few minutes , maybe stay to try out the classical guitars , as that 's my latest fancy . But yesterday was different . To my astonishment , they had an honest-to-God Mosrite on the wall in the " special " room , ya know ... the one with a ton of other more expensive reproduction guitars ( mostly Music Man and Fender / Gibson custom shop stuff ) . I had to play it . <p> The thing was INCREDIBLE . I 've played my fair share of Mosrite copies over the years ( Univox , Eastwood , Aria , etc. ) and none of them even come close to this . It 's extremely well made , not a flaw to be found , and in great shape overall . Beautiful CAR finish . Thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bigsbys and Jag / JM trems out of the water . Plugged into a Deluxe Reverb , it 's basically the stuff of wet dreams for surf lovers like me . I would have bought it on the spot , but the $1300 price tag set me back , considering that I do n't really NEED a guitar like this . <p> Now , here 's where it gets interesting . Looking at the hang tag , it said it was made in 1993 . I was under the impression that Mosrite stopped making guitars some time in the 80s , and even those were n't of the typical Mosrite / Ventures style body . After doing some research , Mosrite did make guitars into the 90s , in a very limited amount . Semie Moseley collaborated with Nokie Edwards of the Ventures to build official reproductions of the original Ventures models , in celebration of the 30th anniversary of their meeting . They were called Nokie models . Moseley died in 1992 , and his wife continued to run Mosrite , exclusively producing this model . The last Mosrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mosrite went bankrupt , and the rights to build the Ventures style body were sold to Japanese manufacturers . Hence why today you see so many reproductions . <p> That means that this guitar is quite possibly one of the last real Mosrites ever made . The odd part of it is that everything I 'm finding says that these Nokie models were all set-neck . This one is a bolt-on . I 'm going back today to take some pictures and write down the serial number , see if I can get some more info on it . It would be awesome if it has the original paperwork , but I 'm not getting my hopes up . <p> I 'm strongly considering buying it as an investment ... I 've always wanted to own one of these , and as rare as this is , it might be worth the asking price , especially if I talk them down a bit . But , with no paperwork , I 'm not sure it 'd be worth it . What do you guys think ? Any Mosrite experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . I would suggest posting on the Mosrite forum where they have a couple of ex-employees who can tell you for sure if the model is real . I have some pictures of Nokie models on my old computer , post pics of this one and I can tell you if it looks real or not . <p> If it 's real $1300 is nothing . You can get twice that easy on Yahoo Japan . <p> Definitely speak to the guys on the Mosrite forum . I 'll bet its real , maybe something that later moved on to the Hallmark range . I 'd love to have a go on a proper Mosrite , but its unlikely unless a tag along to some UKers house off that forum . Please post pics ! ! 124140 @qwx744140 124139 @qwx744139 <p> Went back during lunch today and they were quite busy . Surprisingly , the room was locked .

Got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think it 's probably a mutt , made from whatever leftover parts were available at the time . I 'm going back after work to ask about looking at it in detail . Also , price apparently has been lowered to $1200 . <p> Rox : I wanted to ask why it would n't be an investment , but I guess I know now . After doing some more research , these are n't quite as collectible as the vintage ones , even though they are more rare . But it 's still a great piece of history as far as I 'm concerned . And yeah , I 'd play it more than most of my other guitars <p> So here are a couple more pictures of the important bits , in my excitement I forgot to get a full shot of the guitar . Turns out it was in a locked room because that room also contains a $13,000 Slash signature series LP , signed by Slash himself . Serial number is 90043 , which according to this page indicates a Nokie model , from 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it also says " 1 of 3 " ( presumably this should be 1 of 300 ) and " signed by Semie " , which this one clearly is not . Another unusual thing , the truss rod cover is engraved with JEG , and there is a sticker on the back that says the same thing , any idea what this means ( if anything ) ? It almost looks like a previous owner did that . I 'm leaning more and more towards buying it .

This was one of 15 that this store bought from him . I ca n't help but wonder what else was in the collection ... I 'll never know , but I 'm glad I found this thing . Now to start asking around for more details on it ... I 'm hoping I can find someone who can tell me how many of these were actually made , and place a real world value on it .

I originally became interested in offsets from MBV , but the Mustang was the only offset I could afford at the time ( this is when Mustangs were cheap ) so I bought that . It was a ' 69 RI , MIJ , and my first nice guitar . I really enjoyed playing it but I still wanted a Jaguar . I eventually ended up trying a lot of Jags out and did n't really care for any of them , whereas Mustangs stayed my favorite . <p> At this point , I think I 'm a Mustang fan more than I 'm a short scale fan . Something about the Mustang just completely works for me , esp . the contoured body models . I love how the neck feels , and I love the unique pickup configuration that gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they sound different ( better ) in a Mustang . Moreover , I have come to appreciate other things about it . I love how the tailpiece is so close to the bridge so I can use the vibrato without a bar . I also love how Competition Mustangs look . <p> A very underrated feature of the Mustang is the slanted neck pickup positioning . Sure , it contributes to the look , but to me , it makes the neck pickup much more useful . It gives it a tad bit more articulation . Moreover , it is not where the 24th fret would be , as it is on most other guitars , it is somewhere between where the middle and neck pickups would be on a Strat . That means that it just has a little more punch and allows for more harmonics in the sense that you can do the 5th fret harmonic on the upper strings and still have them work , whereas on a Strat , you ca n't use the neck pickup for that . As a result , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guitars , I have to switch pickups depending on the situation . I 've just gotten used to these kinds of things and when I go to other guitars , it just is n't quite the Mustang , and that makes it less fun for me . <p> So yeah , I play a short scale because Mustangs are the greatest guitars in the world for me . If Mustangs did n't exist , I 'd be perfectly happy playing Gibson scales all day and every day . Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy . <p> The jag-Stang was my first shortscale but I never really played it . Surprisingly I played my Squier mini strat . The neck just felt so much more comfortable . I would probably really enjoy 22.5 scale . But lately I 've been playing my teles and once in a while my compstang . Congratulations !

@@80331875 @1831875/ <p> I am purchasing an offset that takes a Strat 25 1/2 scale neck but want to convert to either a medium scale or even a short scale . What compatible short and medium scale necks are direct bolt ons to a strat sized neck body ? <p> Get a ruler and see where your stuff ends up . Then you can figure out if you can change the neck , and to what if you can . For example , I 'm putting a 25.5 " on the Mexican Duo project that I 'm working on right now which came with a 22.7 " scale . The throw is only about 1/8 " of bridge adjustment . <p> I 'm sure someone here has a 24 " neck laying around , and could give you the length from the nut to the heel . Then measure from the neck pocket to the bridge , and do a little addition . You 'll know soon enough what you can do . <p> the new classic vibe duo sonic has a conversion neck , the body is setup for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 " scale <p> I bought a recent ( 2008 ) Squier Classic Vibe Duo-Sonic neck on ebay . I thought it was supposed to be a conversion neck . There is exactly 12 " between the nut and the 12th fret ( 24 " scale ) . But there is a a little over 12-1/2 " between the 12th fret and the saddles when placed in a strat body . So , unless I am wrong , mine does n't appear to be a conversion neck . Here are a couple of pictures : <p> These are 21 fret necks . I believe many Fender 24 " scale guitars have 22 frets . So , I question whether these necks will work on the Fender 24 " scale guitars . Has anyone tried one of these necks on another type of body ? <p> the CV duo necks will not work on a shortscale body ( ie : mustang ) but will work on a strat body with a bit of an intonation setup ( about 1/8 " ) IIRC <p> Thanks , I am glad to hear someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have guitars that are not official Fender guitars . They are supposed to be to Fender spec . But there are apparently some differences . So that may be a part of it . <p> I am not trying to argue the point . However , I did get curious and made an attempt at the full math ( for theoretical purposes ) . If anyone is interested , here it goes : <p> According to the Warmoth website the distance from the nut to the end of the heel ( not including fretboard overhang ) for an official Fender Strat neck is 18-7/6 " ( 18.4375 " ) . <p> The fret calculator at stewmac.com indicates ( for a 25.5 " scale guitar ) the distance from the nut to the peak of the saddle to be 25.652 " ( at the centerline of the guitar ) . <p> This leaves a difference of 7.2145 " ( which is the distance from the end of the neck heel ( or neck cavity in the body ) to the peak of the saddle . <p> The Squier CV Duo-Sonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17.375 " ) from nut to end of heel ( no fretboard overhang ) . <p> Add 17.375 " ( neck ) to 7.2145 " . This equals 24.5895 " . <p> Now , according to the stewmac fret calculator ( for a 24 " scale guitar ) the distance from the nut to the peak of the saddle ( @ center line ) is 24.143 " . <p> So , subtract 24.143 " from 24.5895 " . This equals 0.4465 " ( or a little over 7/16 " ) . <p> There is not enough ( 7/16 " ) intonation adjustment available in the strat vintage tremolo bridge . So ( mathematically at least ) , unless I have made a mistake , one would have to either alter the neck , neck pocket , or relocate the bridge in order to have proper intonation .

@@80331877 @1831877/ <p> I 've just recently acquired my first Mustang , a 65RI .

In fact , when they 're in parallel it sounds basically like just the neck pickup is on ; I ca n't notice much difference when I turn the bridge on and off . I 'm wondering if this is just a weird pairing . I like the versatility of the neck pickup , so I was thinking maybe I could replace the bridge with the hot gold bridge pickup .

I think you may be pleasantly surprised . <p> My old Mustang ( which Johnnytheboy has now I think ) had Lace Sensors in - a silver in the neck and a blue in the bridge . That combination worked really well for me - a more conventional brightness for the neck with a darker bridge sound with more lows and mids . <p> I du n no about how other Sensors sound though , apart from the Red being a little underwhelming . <p> Novaks are a little pricey for those on a budget , but very good - my jazzmaster has a pair of Novaks and they sound fantastic .

I will probably put something under the pickup cover to make it space correctly . also , the poles are supposed to be " hand beveled " . they are barely beveled. just enough to take off the sharp edge . not like some pickups I 've seen that have a real bevel so they are like almost rounded off . these are pretty much the kind of defects you would expect when paying this much for a set of pickups and obviously they do n't affect the tone drastically in any way whatsoever . <p> lastly the middle pickup is not phase reversed so the 2 and 4 positions on the strat have kind of a thin sound I 'm not a big fan of .

So if you want the strings to be straight across the nut , on a standard bass headstock they would be crowded right down the end , and 2 wo n't even fit . If you install standard tuners where the bass tuners are , you will have an extreme break angle at the nut which will make tuning impossible . I solved this by doing a cut-and shut - I sliced out the row of tuners from a shortscale headstock to make the normal Klusons fit .

@@80331914 @1831914/ <p> Hello there shortscale , thought I 'd bring you up to speed with what I 'm up to , since I 've dropped various hints over the last few days ... Not entirely sure if this counts as a build/project , since I 'll be building the guitar from very big , guitar shaped bits , but thought it could be interesting ... <p> I 've been promising myself a lovely tele for ages - had some in the past that I 've loved , and they suit the way I play perfectly . I had a Baja recently , but the neck was never quite big enough for me , and it always felt a bit stiff and lifeless to me . Played a 52ri a couple of months back , and even that neck felt too small to me ( smaller than a Baja , in fact ) . I 'm pretty particular about what I want , and had eyed up the various Warmoth options , but ( corksniffer alert ) I did n't want to spend all that money on a guitar with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my specs in 7.25 " radius ) and a poly finish ( fuck you if you sneer - I want it with a nitro finish ) . Flushed with my success at putting together my baritone tele , I looked at some of the various tele projects and builds around the place , and Mark Jenny from MJT Guitars was a name that kept cropping up . <p> Now , I 'm not usually a fan of relicced finishes , but people were waxing lyrical over his painting skills , and his ' closet clean ' finishes are grand - no big gouges or owt , just nitro finishes with light yellowing . So I got in touch with Mark about the specs I wanted , and he 's been good as gold ... He usually uses Allparts necks ( same as I used on the baritone ) , which , word on the street is , are the same as are used on CIJ guitars . However , since I was very particular on what I wanted , he advised we use Musikraft . I also wanted the finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baja - I 'm aiming for under 6.5lbs. ) , and he was able to lay his hands on a very light swamp ash body made by Wildwood Manufacturing . This was all starting to look much better than Warmoth , and cheaper too , so I went for it . <p> Mark sent through examples of shell pink finishes with varying degrees of yellowing - I went for this one with very light yellowing ( ignore the battle damage , and the fact it 's a strat ) : <p> img/img <p> The neck is going to be a real caveman job : was umming and ahhing about a V neck profile ( my old CIJ tele had a great neck like this ) but also wanted the neck to be as thick as possible ; gone for the fat C figuring that I can always shave it down/replace it with a V/have a tele custom made with this profile sometime in the future . Plus , this frankly terrifying image of a Musikraft Fat C helped me make my mind up : <p> ... mother of god . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrics ( more about these another time - suffice to say , I 'm a little confused ) and pickups . Did a load of listening to clips , eBay scouring and so on for pickups this last week : I know I want a traditional tele sound , and I tend to shy away from overwound pickups as a rule . Fender ' 51 Nocasters seemed to be a good choice - traditional , but still grunty , and in the world of m@j@ pickups , not a bad price . So some of those are winging their way to me . <p> So that 's what I 've been up to : bit of a TLDR post to start with , but I 'll update you as we go . Mark reckons on a 4-6 week build time , and sends pictures throughout . The guitar arrives as a kit , so we can all laugh together as I fuck up my beautiful shell pink nitro finish by dripping solder over it , then drill up through the fretboard when the time comes to attach the neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versatile set of pickups and the series and out-of-phase options are amazing . <p> In terms of the four-way switch : no , I had it on one of my older teles , and I 'm not that keen on the boosted humbucker-esque sound , and since I 'm a clumsy fella , one of the appeals of the tele switch is that it just clonks from one position to another - the four way makes me skip past the neck pickup and makes the whole thing unnecessarily fiddly . <p> In terms of the S1 system , I really did n't like the feel of the pot with the button on the top : I 'm flipping the control plate because I use volume swells a lot with delay - I thought the S1 pot felt horrible and got in the way of this . <p> Good luck m8 , the MJT examples look good .

Even odder when you think that , although they 're tracks we 're really familiar with , they were just rough sketches for him at this point . <p> Went to see them play just a couple of months ago . Joey and Black Francis both used two Marshall stacks each - I was n't close enough to see what exactly . Les Pauls and a Bigsby-equipped Gibson hollow-body for Joey , a Telecaster for Black Francis . He must have been using some kind of acoustic simulator pedal as he played all the acoustic parts with the telecaster as well .

I felt like getting something to add to the vintage collection , though ) . He says " Gee , I think I have one of those Brocos in the back . " I did my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TKL case ( not the original , oh well ) . Sure enough , it was a pretty clean old Bronco . " What do you want for it ?

@@80331918 @1831918/ <p> I have tried everything I know to sell enough gear to purchase a Jazzmaster and nothing has worked . So I am throwing down the gauntlet and I will just make the best one ever . I can probably build one by the time I get enough money together anyway and it will way cooler anyway . <p> First thought : . I had been pining for a J.

I loved the feel of the necks and the pickups . I tend to like the Larger 70 's headstocks on a Jazzmaster similar to what comes on Mustangs and Jaguars . <p> Colors : I want to do something unique with colors on this one . I really liked the gold anodized pickguards from the J Mascis Jazzmaster , so I will probably stick with that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring . I already have a Sunburst Jaguar . I want to attempt the matching headstock on this build as well . I went to Reranch and here are some possible colors that sound appealing : <p> I have Ash Wood for the body , and a JM template I need to check . I will definitely need a gold anodized pickguard , pickups and Jazzmaster neck . I might even consider different wiring for the rhythm circuit . <p> Seeing as you 're all about gold anodized pickguards , I 'm wondering what 's keeping you from the Squier J. Mascis model . Surely , it 'd be cheaper to get one of those than to build one yourself . My girlfriend and I are building a telecaster and try as I may , I 've been unable to keep it under $500 , if sticking strictly to parts that were anywhere near upper scale Squier in quality .

This has taken the brittleness of somewhat . I have more sustain and more defined note seperation . But , it 's still too bright for my taste . I 'm dissapointed to say the least . I have two weeks to get a refund ( -15% ) . Trouble is , the guy who works on my guitars has gone on holiday for a week . To day a thought came to me . I was wondering if my guitar had 1meg pots .

Maybe it was because most of the original copies had become so faded they look more like pink than the original red . <p> Yes , I would bet this . The same thing happened to many other aged Fender/Gibson finishes ... those earlier guitars were n't romanticized until the ' 70s , by which time their earlier and more fragile topcoats had spent a lot of time in smokey bars/houses or under bright stage lights . People did n't talk about " butterscotch " in the ' 50s , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were actually more of a natural finish . Similarly , TV Yellow was just plain " TV finish " and was closer to an off-white than an actual yellow hue ... they bounced between beige and cream from the factory over the years and the yellow ( or lime green , depending on the nature of the original TV finish the guitar had , which changed throughout the ' 50s ) came later with the aging nitro clear/drying and settling grain filler .

No finish flaws , intonation is nearly on , and the setup was decent .

They were promptly replaced with D'addario 11 's . <p> In terms of sound , I 'd say it 's definitely in the classic Jazzmaster realm - though with a bit more heat to it , especially on the bridge .

No dents , dings , chips , black marks , or other nonsense . Just a nice , smooth finish , over what looks like a three piece body . <p> Color-wise , it 's what I 'd call an aged CAR . It has a slightly yellowed tint to it , giving it a rust-like appearance in some lighting . In other lighting it looks like a deep red with a perfect shimmer to it . It looks to be a gold base coat with trans red over it . My guess is that they 're using a slightly yellowed poly on these - giving the CAR a rust tint , the sonic blue a green tint , and the olympic white a slightly off-white tint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green Jag as well , so it makes sense .

Mine also has a good amount of flaming in the neck and on the headstock , which was surprising to see . <p> Tuners feel the same as on my Surf Green Jag - nice and solid , vintage style tuners . They seem to be holding up just fine , keeping in tune decently and all that . As with my Surf Green Jag and CAR Jag , they 'll be staying . <p> Hardware wise , it 's very solid .

I 'll eventually put an anodized gold guard on it , but I 'm in no real rush . <p> Knobs are on the cheap side , though they work fine . There 's no dire need to change them , but some may want to .

It 's fast ( playable in 7-10 days ) , and easy ( no need to seal or grain fill ) , non-toxic ( rub it on with your fingers ! ) , cheap ( under $10 ) , and best of all , it will give even the novice finisher the most incredible feeling neck finish . You wont need to tint , either . I feel the natural amber color is perfect for the slightly aged look without approaching the stupid fake orangey high gloss " Vintage " OEM finish popular right now from Fender/Squier .

Either play an electric or an upright . They do not project enough to go unamplified and their amplified tone is too similiar to an electric to really make it worth it .

@@80331961 @1831961/ <p> What you see here is the result of just two days work ... breaking all the " rules and traditions " ( ie. no rule of threes , no wetsanding between coats , no waiting period between colors , no grainfill ( which is very obvious without the clearcoat ) . <p> Here is the aftermarket CBS head B&amp;D neck from Flexguitars.com in Singapore . They are easy to deal with and ship quickly , its not a scam . The neck is said to MIJ and carries the same part # configuration as Allparts necks ( also MIJ ) . When I ordered , it was displayed as STR65B but now , only a few weeks later , its advertised as NSTR65B ... and the pics look finished . If the numbering scheme is indeed the same as Allparts , the N would stand for nitro . I wish I had waited ! Anyway , it appears to be of reasonable quality and I 'm happy with it . <p> I 'll let the pics do the talking : <p> I got started on the neck right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I want this project to look realistic , I had to do something about the Allparts stamp . I decided to fill it . <p> ( Note the crappy neck pocket , not a big deal to fix but disappointing ) : <p> One coat : <p> Then two : <p> I was n't sure how the filler would take the yellow dye , more on that later . Other pics of the body : <p> I have mixed feelings on the body . It was made in USA , but there was alot of fuzz from the router left over and the neck pocket shape needed alot of filing and sanding to be correct at the lower edge . The good news is ... the bridge pickup route lines up with the pickguard UNLIKE a previous Allparts body I had . The other body was ash , this one is alder . I do n't  know if that was the difference , or if they 've switched vendors . At any rate , the ash body with incorrect routing did NOT have Made in USA stamped on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filler only on two knots : <p> Paint . This is ReRanch Coral . It does n't look like Coral to me . It looks like Fiesta Red . Their Fiesta looks way too dark for my eyes . This looks more like the FR that I 've known and loved . I 'm glad it went with it . Another thing to note , it does n't shine like most nitro I 've used . It will definitely HAVE to be clearcoated . Even though I 'm building a well-worn ' 65 , I want to start out with a decent job . So what you see here is NOT yet clearcoated . I 'm going to try to keep my mitts off it for a week or so and let it cure . <p> Tinting the neck . I taped off the heel for two reasons , one .. so it looks untinted where it sits in the body and two .. so I can put it in the vise and paint all sides . <p> While that was drying , I sanded the body and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket came out OK .

However I could n't find a vintage B&amp;D neck and ended up with a ' 66 B&amp;B neck and then switched the pots and pickups to match ... ... and the color turned out to be IBM instead of FR along the way ( Pontiac engine paint that I had on hand ) . <p> I really liked it but never forgot the ' 65 B&amp;D idea . The ' 66 is no longer with me , so I reverted back to the original idea . Only this time ... the bulk is aftermarket parts with a few exceptions , most notably the bridge ( which ca n't be faked ) and some hardware that I already have on hand . I 'm keeping tabs on what this costs me and I 'll let you all know in the end .

I do find it irritating though , that they would let it out the door like that . The route between the pickups is awful too , you can see it in one of the shots . <p> No , Flex does n't have B&amp;B necks on their website . Actually , for us long-scale Jazzmaster bastards ... the B&amp;D neck is much more desireable as it was only made for less than a year . The Allparts B&amp;D neck has the small Strat-shaped head which guys have added a wing to and cut it in a Jazzmaster shape . So this neck is like the holy grail for many of us who ca n't make our own necks ... <p> When you painted the headstock , how did you mask the edge beyond the nut ? I painted a neck using two different types of tape , both left a furry edge to the paint just behind the nut , maybe it was the grain of the rosewood . Are you a Wizard ? <p> Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compelled to use Fiesta . But they should put you in charge at Fender . I understand the corksniffing part . If I cut a corner or have imperfections , etc . I have to change it or get rid of it . I have no problems with chips and sand-throughs though . Yell Like Hell <p> That 's just the way they were originally done . The yellow served as the base of the sunburst , and since they did n't  know which ones would be custom colors at the time of the cutting the body , they dyed them all . <p> I think it looks cool when it wears , where you can see the finish , the white , the yellow and then the wood . <p> This is super-thin ... I left off the grainfiller and sanding sealer , so it should wear really nicely . I 'm gon na cause some nitro checking and maybe intentionally polish through a few areas , but I 'm not gon na drag it behind my truck or anything ...

The gauge may also make a difference in such a case . <p> According to the Shortscale Technical Bible , Cyclone scale to strat is pretty far off from conversion ( the most relevant chart is on the last page ) : <p> edit : I did check out the difference between Cyclone and Mustang , it does seem pretty large , almost 5 mm . Also " conversion scale " to strat comes out even worse : more than 6 mm . Maybe the long scale Jagstang necks were non-standard . <p> i mocked up the neck against an old strat body , altho it does match up to a 25.5 its a 22 fret and the intonation would be way off . I could have sworn that fender had a conversion scale , or squire did at some point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@80331981 @1831981/ <p> As a quick introduction , I have been trying to learn to play acoustical guitar for a few years now . I do all my own setup work , etc. and love working on guitars . I have even built a ukulele from a kit sold at stewmac.com . I have found that short scale guitars are more comfortable to play due to my short fingers . My current main guitars are a Larrivee Parlor acoustic guitar ( 24 " scale ) . And a 628mm ( 24.75 " ) scale classical guitar . I also had a Fender Highway One Telecaster once , but I sold it . Do any of you folks play acoustic guitars ? <p> I am beginning my first partscaster project . I bought most everything from guitarfetish.com . It is going to be a strat copy , in the vintage style . I will have some questions as I go along . And I thought this place might be a good place to ask them . And to share the experience . <p> My first question is regarding the neck-body joint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fender spec ( 2-3/16 " wide ) . However , the neck is about 1/16 " too wide ( 2.252 " ) at the widest point , according to a digital caliper .

I might want to put on a conversion neck to shorten the scale to either 24 " ( squier jagmaster conversion neck ) or a 24.75 " conversion neck from Warmoth . <p> So , my first question is : <p> Given the above dimensions , etc. , does it make the most sense to carve or sand the neck down to fit in the body cavity ? Or is sanding the body cavity larger the proper way to proceed ? My instinct tells me to make the neck smaller . But , this is my first project of this type and I wanted to get some advice from more experienced folks . <p> Thanks for the help in advance . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personally if it were me I 'd sand the neck down , this is because the wood at the neck joint is rather thin and is the most fragile area of the body so I 'd avoid making the wood thinner .

Then use fine grade wire wool finishing with a few coats of danish oil - you just want to treat the wood not make it LONG ... <p> There were no holes pre-drilled in the neck . So I used a laser mounted on a tripod to help get it properly aligned . <p> The bridge hole in the body needed enlarging a small bit on the bass side . This was in order to center the bridge on the body and to give a little clearance for the sustain block to move inside the body . I used some sandpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here I have the tuners , bridge and strings installed to make sure things line up properly . <p> The tuners required a little filing on the edges in order to fit on the headstock . <p> I managed to unsolder and re solder the wires on the jack in order to thread the wires through the hole in the body . The pickguard required a little sanding where it meets the neck , and at the bridge . <p> The string trees mounted on the headstock : <p> Here is a 10-step Strat setup based on the one in Dan Erlewine 's book " Guitar Player Repair Guide " . Dan says he learned this at the Fender factory . <p> First make sure electronics are working , no springs installed on the tremolo , tremolo claw loose ( 1 " from rear wall ) for easy installation of the springs later , intonation is rough " pre-set " according to Fender 's bridge saddle pattern . <p> 1 .

In the playing position , depress one of the wound strings at the 17th fret . Adjust the neck to the proper relief at the 7th fret . Factory specs are .012 " for most strats . The Clapton model is .008 " - .010 " . ( I prefer a straighter neck and have initially set this one at .005 " . ) <p> 5 . Set the string height . With the capo still on , adjust the string height at the 17th fret to match the factory specs . This is 4/64 " for most strats . The Clapton model is 3/64 " - 4/64 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5/64 " and the treble E string at 4/64 " .

Adjusting the final intonation can be done quicker now while the tremolo is still blocked . Tune each string to pitch and check for intonation at the 12th fret .

Helped me get started with guitar modification . However though I never use a step by step method anymore , I do it all by feel and sound .

Even if you do things by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It 's more flexible IMO . <p> The Jazzmaster rhythm circuit ( the predecessor of the Jaguar 's ) was designed to give Jazz guitarists a " jazzy " ( darker sounding ) tone at the flip of a switch - Fender was trying to make it easy for the relatively technophobe Jazzers of the late 1950s to get a sound that was familiar and appealing to them , and Fender was n't really trying to make a flexible second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mod them to make them that way if it appeals to us . <p> Soldered in a .1 cap into the rhythm circuit the other night .

The Jag , though schematically more complicated than a Tele or Strat , is proving pretty easy to mess with as far as mods . <p> I would compare the rhythm circuit tone ( wide open on volume and tone ) as closer to a Strat neck pickup . So , with this mod , I now have four very usable setting on the Jag . 1 ) Rhythm neck ( Strat like ) 2 ) Lower neck ( nice for brighter rhythm parts ) 3 ) Neck / Bridge split ( I use this for some parts to " mimic " an acoustic 4 ) Bridge ( pure jangle ) <p> Makes for some very nice tonal options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I think it 's probably best to use an open tuning so I do n't need to fret any strings which should help with consistency . On each test I 'll vary picking/strumming from very light to very aggressive . <p> I 'll record with a Digidesign MBOX2 , with channel 1 ( left ) taking direct input from the guitar , and channel 2 ( right ) with an SM57 on a blackstar series one combo ( bright clean channel , gain low for maximum headroom , all eq settings at 12 o'clock ) . The only effect I 'll have in the chain will be an MXR fullbore metal with the gain on maximum , which I 'll kick in for testing with distortion . Along with the video , I 'll include a link to a FLAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor . <p> Does anyone have any suggestions for any additional tests I should do or method/s I should change ? I 'd like to make sure that the results are both accurate and believable . <p> I 'm not sure about the idea of putting the pickups unusually close to the strings . I can understand why you 're doing it , but would a more " real life " test be more useful ? I do n't know . <p> I 'm interested too , the EMG 81 is one of my favorite pups . Agree with Paul on the distance from the strings , magnetic pull and irregular distance could void the test imo . Interestingly , the 81 measures at 10K ( according to specs ) which surprises me , i 'd have thought it was more like 18K . I wonder if the compression factor is why the pup works so well with high gain , especially note definition. 124140 @qwx744140 124139 @qwx744139 <p> Awesome idea ! Put it in front of a sensitive fuzz like a fuzz face to see if the extra voltages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a documented case would be cool <p> Would an MI Neo Fuzz suffice ? <p> Quote : <p> I 'm not sure about the idea of putting the pickups unusually close to the strings . I can understand why you 're doing it , but would a more " real life " test be more useful ? I do n't know . <p> I wo n't set them unusually close , approximately 2-2.5mm from the strings with the strings fretted at the 24th fret , which is what I meant by relatively close . It 's a little higher than I 'd normally set them , but some have them set even closer . That said , they apparently have relatively weak magnets , so string pull may not be as much of an issue as it can be with passive pickups . <p> I have n't been able to find anything that comes close to a proper A/B test . <p> Most I 've seen are someone playing some widdly widdly stuff with huge gain , then they stop and spend a while hooking up their 18v setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't A/B test two sets of speakers with a different piece of music for each , and only listen to each speaker once . You 'd go back and forth with the same track playing . The same sort of consistency is needed for an accurate pickup test . <p> I heard the 18v mod to the emg81 is about the best mod you can do . If you want an emg81 feel with a warmer tone , i suggest trying out the dimarzio evolution . Currently my favorite pickup , although i 'm forever faithful to the JB

If so .... <p> There are six preamp tubes in your Twin . These are often referred to as V1 through V6 ( V for " valve " ) . When you look at your Twin from the back , V1 is way over on the right , and you number leftwards from there , with V6 being the last preamp tube next to your big power tubes . V1 is the Normal channel preamp tube , and V2 is the Vibrato channel preamp tube . If your Normal channel 's working correctly , then swap V1 and V2 . Check to see that the Normal channel still works OK and the Vibrato channel is still broken . <p> Now unplug your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speed , and Intensity controls to 0 , and check both channels again . Now set Reverb to 10 and check again . ( You wo n't hear reverb of course because the tank 's unplugged ... we 're just checking for dry signal . ) I ca n't say that these steps will make any difference at all , but you might as well remove those items from the picture as much as possible to isolate the problem . <p> If both of the tubes you tried in the V1 position worked OK , you can assume both those tubes are good . Leave one of them in V2 and plug the other known-good tube into V4 . ( V4 amplifies what comes out of the reverb tank , and also the mixed dry-plus-reverb signal . ) What to do with the tube you pulled from V4 ? Plug it into the empty V1 socket . Try Normal and Vibrato channel again . If Normal works , you now have verified 4 good tubes , currently in positions V1 , V2 , V4 , and V6 . V6 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splitter tube , and nothing would sound right if it were broken . <p> If the Vibrato channel is still broken , you can assume it is n't a tube issue , because you used known-good tubes all the way along the Vib channel 's dry-signal path : V2 =&gt; V4 =&gt; V6 =&gt; powahTubes . The 6L6 tubes work together on everything , so if they work OK with either channel then they are n't the problem . <p> Be sure to at least put the amp on standby before swapping tubes , better yet power it down completely . Try all the above nonsense , and that will probably settle the tube issue . ( Reverb driver V3 and trem tube V5 should n't affect the dry signal , even if they 've gone wrong . So you can ignore them for now . ) <p> In spite of your inspection turning up nothing amiss , I 'd suspect a cracked solder joint someplace . Hopefully the fix would be cheaper than a full retube anyway . <p> EDIT : Still mulling this over . You get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... AND the reverb does n't work at all AND the vibrato does n't work at all ? <p> If you dropped a Twin Reverb on your foot , the first thing I 'd check is your foot ! <p> EDIT : Still mulling this over . You get a signal thru the Vibrato channel , but it 's quiet .... AND the reverb does n't work at all AND the vibrato does n't work at all ? <p> Hahaha my foot was in a bit of pain throughout the gig and the morning after , it sucked but I do n't think anything was broken thankfully . <p> Anyways , yeah that 's the gist of it . I just tried everything out that you said about the tubes . Channel 1 sounded fine no matter what , channel 2 had the same symptoms . Just for shits and giggles I also switched 3 and 5 , still nothing . <p> Also , I think I underestimated the signal that 's actually going through channel 2 . I 'd say it 's more like 1-1.5 when the amp is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedal demo with , but nothing else really . <p> Any ideas what specific area might be weak in solder ? I know I 'm going to probably have to just have it looked at but I think it 'd help to know what 's up . <p> I was puzzling over how you could be getting a wee bit o ' the signal without hearing any reverb or vibrato at all . <p> Aen may well be onto something . In the schematic diagram , I see one place where signal going through V2 ( Vib channel preamp ) will likely cause the voltage across V1 ( Normal channel preamp ) to fluctuate , possibly causing V1 to create its own " copy " of what V2 is doing . I do n't know why these two tubes are tied together this way , but schematix for several different Fender amps show the same thing . <p> So it could be that when you plug into the Vibrato channel , everything works OK through V2 , the tone controls , and the Vib channel 's volume control ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V1 gets a whiff of the signal and sends its reduced-volume copy thru the Normal channel . That would give the kind of bleed-through Aen 's talking about , and it would bypass the reverb and vibrato . <p> If all the above holds true , it would suggest that the break -- if there is one -- is somewhere downstream from V2 and before V6 . <p> A rather rude way to test more of the Vibrato channel would be to make sure your reverb tank is plugged in the correct way , unplug the footswitch , turn your Reverb knob up to 10 , and then make like Dick Dale and shake your amp hard enough to get the reverb springs to vibrate . If you hear anything , then you 've likely got an OK circuit from V4 onwards , and ( if the above stuff is true also ) the problem is between V2 and V4 . If you have a quarter-inch-to-RCA cable or adaptor plug , an even better way to test is to plug your guitar right into the reverb-output jack and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop broke one of the wire connections inside your reverb tank ( likely easy to fix ) . The Dick Dale reverb-shaking test does n't exactly extend the life of those wires , so do n't get too violent , eh ? <p> Also .... you do have a footswitch , right ? The vibrato effect wo n't work without one , so that could provide an easy explanation for vibrato not working . <p> Just telling the tech the same stuff you 've posted on this thread should be enough info to let them zero in on the right chunk of amp circuitry.

@@80332024 @1832024/ <p> something occurred to me last night when i was pondering some mildly grating bits on a recording we 're doing at the moment , and i realised i 've only got a noob-like knowledge in this particular area . <p> firstly , a few days before doing these recordings i thought i 'd put some shiny new strings on my duo-sonic. now , the only full set i had kicking about had a wound G , and i 've never used such a thing before . i 'll admit it never even occurred to me to check the intonation on that string after i 'd put them on . when i got the rough mixes back i noticed one song in particular where i 'd recorded the main track with the duo , then overdubbed a distorted track with a different guitar , there was a bit of a clash on either the G or B strings ( it 's hard to tell which ) . obviously i carefully tuned both guitars before doing the takes , which makes me think it 's more of an intonation thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duo-sonic has 3 compensated saddles fitted , it 's impossible to just change the bit that the G string sits on without affecting the D string too . does that mean that i 'll never be able to get proper intonation with a wound G on this guitar ? or does it really make enough difference to be noticeable ? fill me in , and do n't spare the horses . <p> It 's best to re-intonate your guitar when you change your strings to a different set of gauges or brand or really anything other than a direct replacement of the old set . I 'm sure you can get the guitar within the golden 5cent zone . With 3 saddle bridges , you can get close , even if they are n't compensated but the compensation helps get it a little closer . <p> The fact that you switched to a set with a wound G is n't necessarily the issue , there are probably more variables that are also at play . <p> A wound G will change the intonation a crazy amount if it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D and G to intonate pretty close but because of the saddles it 's going to be tough to get it exact . . . if you even can . You should be able to get it playable though. twitter.com/skcwillie <p> it 's the same gauge of strings apart from the G. here 's what the saddles look like- <p> so you can see the problem if the G needs to be moved to any great degree . i 'll have a play about with it today and see what happens . annoying . i 'll just go back to a plain G if it does n't work , it 's not the end of the world . <p> There is generally going to be a difference between 3 saddle intonation and 6 saddle intonation . The discrepency will be between the intonation of the open strings and when the strings are fretted up the board . Given this theory you could probably resolve the issue in the cotext of your song ( only ) by looking at what it is you are playing and tuning THAT if possible rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riff is two bar chords A and B ( repeat ) . So get you tuner and tune up the A bar chord . In the context of your recording this will likely sort things out . Of course if you have lots of open strings in what you play it might be square one again .. <p> There are a few guides and different methods to intonating 3 saddles . Some people er on the side of ' implying intonation ' on their Teles. in the same way a string that is out of tune can be made to imply being intune by fretting and using finger vibrato - the difference between the extremes is the implied note ..... so the top and bottom of your vibrato is compensated towards an implied in-tune note . Do n't think I 'm explaining this well . Umm it 's like binaural beats yo <p> There is generally going to be a difference between 3 saddle intonation and 6 saddle intonation . <p> Trouble is , he has a 3-saddle set compensated for a plain G. With a wound G it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight one would at least be somewhat better . <p> Whilst true what I say about tuning it in the context of recording he is doing holds true enough I reckon . <p> How about flipping the d/G saddle over so it is non-compensated side up ( assuming its the kind with carved compensation rather than angled saddles ) . Actually if it is angled barrels then flipping it will achieve wot you just said anyway : " it needs to slant the other way to be compensated , though a straight one would at least be somewhat better " <p> right , i played about with the duo-sonic last night and managed to get the G intonating ok with a surprisingly minimal amount of buggering about . i had a look at the coronado while i was at it and it seems the culprit on the recording might have been the B string on that . adjusting the bridge on that guitar is a fucking nightmare , so i tweaked it as best i could without taking the whole bridge off ... which would certainly have resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rage . i foresaw it . <p> I worked for a fender dealer ( been so since early 70 's ) and the tech guys there told me to use 10/11 gua strings and a wound g to get intonation as good as it can get with a 3 saddle deal ( that is they said if I did n't  want to bend the screws of course ) . Ive been doing so after they told me this and Ive got ta say it does help , its way easier to get it close .

If I 'm going by car then a full size instrument is the choice .

The same is true of the Brunner , a carbon fiber travel guitar that folds .

But the problem I have with Ukes is that they are two strings short of what I want to practice on . <p> I think I came up with the terminolgy " suitcase guitar , " but the concept is certainly not new and can be seen in other terminology like " micro guitar .

If you run across any suitcase guitars , give me a sign . <p> Thank you for the pictures and information of the innovative travel guitar . It is more expensive than the Yamaha , but about the same price as the Miranda and a bit less expensive than the Frameworks . The sound tracks sound solid and the guitar is obviously a serious contender in the travel guitar market . As you observe , it is a long scale and thus not exactly what I 'm looking for , but it 's sweet . Thanks for the taste . <p> i 'm for the sloan option as well . keep in mind when you are dealing with a super short scale or 3/4 sized guitar the fretting is n't perfect so it wo n't play intune past a certain fret . the martin backpackers are " ok " and can be had for pretty cheap , but they sound like ass after the 5th fret or so ....

Someone mentioned they did n't like the 1-1/2 " nut width on the 24 " -scale SX 's . However , there 's a good bit of extra space on the fingerboard for altering the string spacing , and I 've been having my luthier cut me a new Graph-Tech nut that gives me about an additional 5/32 " . This gives me about the same string spacing as my modern Squier Jagmaster .

Then I adjusted the rest to taste , which ended up meaning raising the two center poles about a quarter turn . But , I want to try this , too . I also want to experiment with raising the " hidden " pole pieces , and swapping the neck and bridge pickups , which apparently gives a lot better balance . <p> Idk , I REALLY like vintage WRHBs which is why I never pulled the trigger and got a set of Novaks when I had a RI Tele Deluxe , so maybe I 'm overly picky on the issue .

I really the presence control on it , you can make your amp sound like vintage gear or biting modern gear . Its got a pretty good range of gain on it too , it can go from clean boost to almost big muff sounds at full gain .

Car finish rubbing compound and polish . Look though the car color touch up spray paint that they have and get a can of what you like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need more paint depending you good you are . But one can at a time is fine . <p> Take the body and scruff it up with some 600 grip sand paper . This will let the paint stick . Hang your body somehow by the neck screw holes . Use a kitchen paper towel and some rubbing alcohol to give it a quick rub to de dust and degrease . <p> Learn how to spray with spray paint . Test on some type of scrap . Hold can away from object and hit spray button then go to paint the body ( do n't want spurts from initial button push ) . Thin coats with color is better then too thick , which can cause drips . Do 50% overlaps . You will need several coats to get good coverage . Do n't be greedy and do too much at once . If you get a drip , do n't worry , when it dries you can use your 1000 grit ( or 600 ) to sand it down . If you sand too much just do a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . <p> Once your base coat is down . let dry the recommended amount of time and start with you clear coat . Same thing applies - practice first with the clear coat . you want a wet coat with no runs , but if you go too thick you will get orange peel . Orange peel you can fix so it is not the end all . Actually it is almost inevitable to some point . Do multiple coats 3-5 . <p> if at anytime you get a bug or dust just let it be until that coat is dry . you can test for dry set bu touching in a pickup cavity or the neck pocket .. Use a tweezer to get it out or a paper towel to knock it off . if you get a smudge you can sand that out quick with 1000grit . <p> Let dry for a couple of days before you wet sand . The can will tell you how long you need to wait . Wet sand with water or baby oil with 1000 grit . do n't use too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screw holes . Fold the paper over itself several times and sand/rub with even pressure . Sand until you see the paper loading up the rinse the paper in the water bucket and wipe of guitar with clothe . Then keep going at it . The glossy finish will look hazy after you do this , but will come back . AVOID the edges of the body when doing the flat surfaces ( unless you want that roadworn look ) . Close your eyes and feel the surface to test if it is smooth . you might see tiny shiny spots . That is the bottom of the orange peel pits . You can go until it is all the same look or the pits are mostly gone . <p> Then use rubbing compound as recommended . I use with a polish pad and a car polisher . This step will remove any minor orange peel you have . You can use a pad and elbow grease . Then go to the car polish and use a terry cloth towel . Finally use some kind of car wax- I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time in your painting or finishing you get a problem , you can always sand it out- touch up with spray paint and clear coat .

Or do I only need to sand it enough to rough it up for the new paint to stick ? <p> Not sure how bad of dings you have in the guitar . What I would do is get some 400/600 grit sand paper and scuff the original finish up really good . Do a proper sanding , but you do n't have to take off the finish that is on there just make it is rough so the primer has something to grab on to . Where you have chips around the edges , you want to feather the finish down with the exposed wood . Your best gauge to if it is smooth is closing your eyes and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dings or dents use JB weld to fill . the stuff is cheap and two part and wo n't shrink with the solvents in your paint . Mix up small batches with a tooth pick and apply to the ding . Let dry overnight and gently smooth to flush with 600 grit . <p> Wipe everything down with paper towels ( they are great at getting rid of dust because it will get trapped in the towels fibers ) . Then you can use a degreaser or some isopropal to wipe down before priming . Use a high build primer from the auto body store and use the whole can . This will give you 3-4 coats . do n't go too thick in one coat . You want build up bit try not to get drips . Practice on some scrap wood . This will fill in any minor bumps and pits . Sand with 600/800 grit until smooth to touch . The high build will also let you do a bit of shaping on the edges of the guitar . <p> Procrastinating again , but I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten a couple of jobs . In the meantime , do I want to go with flat wound or round wound strings ? <p> Ok , I finally got around to going shopping , which ought to put me somewhat closer to finally actually starting this project ( my summer did not go at all as planned ) . Can cur or somebody tell me whether I got the right stuff ? I was guessing a bit on the paint , primer , clear coat , etc . <p> OK with they assortment you have , here is what I would recommend . First off , you do not have any sand paper . Depending on the finish and condition of your guitar you are going to want to , at a minimum , scuff up the pain that is on there with 600 grit . If you have dings and stuff to fix do that now as well . Light sanding with 600 and water with a little bit of dish soap will clean up the surface and get rid of any grime . Once you do this you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff you have but if the surface is good any way it should work well . I usually get high build primer from the auto part store to help with any slight imperfections . Shoot a couple light coats then and lightly with 600 of needed . If your primer coat went down how you like it then hit with your yellow gloss ; s enamel . Since this is a gloss enamel , you may not have to hit with clear . If the yellow goes on nice then you could probably get away with light wet sand with 1500 and 2000 grit , then buff with rubbing compound , polishing compound and finally spray wax . <p> so if the enamel coat is nice and shiny after you shoot it , then the sanding will dull it up to start out , but it will all come back when you go up the grits to 2000 and the the different compounds and wax . <p> If you go with the clear coat after the enamel coat , go for several lightish coats to build it up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to be safe start with 1500 ) and compounds . Avoid sanding near the corner bends because it is very easy to sand through the finish at the transitions . Also , use wet sanding with water and a small drop of soap in it . wipe often with a terry cloth and rinse you sand paper often so it does not build up . When you think you have it good enough stop , going too much with any of the steps usually leads to problems . <p> You can go to any auto part store to get the sand papers , 600 , 1500 and 2000 should get you where you want to be . <p> I actually did get sandpaper ( 400 , 600 , and 1000 grit , if I remember correctly ) . It seemed self-explanatory so I did n't stick it in the picture . I 'll pick up some 1500 and 2000 as well .

All of the CP offerings have the flatter 9.5 " radius . <p> Is the Thurston Moore Sig worth $400 more than a CP ? Probably not . But that 's what Sig axes go for .

" In Power Trios I Trust " <p> I have a ' 62 reissue , and from your shortlist would vote for that one . But Noirie 's right - a CIJ Jazzmaster has all the feautures you want at a lower pricepoint than all the others . And I take issue with your evaluation of the bridge , too . <p> 1 ) Get a japanese Jazzmaster and see if and what you want to mod ( bridge , pickups ) or 2 ) get a used american reissue , which seems to be the best deal in USA , or 3 ) get a beaten up old piece of Leo wood and build it up . <p> That SY model , to me , seems like less guitar for more money .

I jive with the heavy sting thang but I set that thing up so it was as slinky as possible with no buzz or fret-out whatsoever and told him to try it and let me know if he needed the action higher . He played it , made a cum-face and said it played like it was brand new - later after rehearsal he said there were certain notes that rang out like a bell that sounded dead before for what that 's worth . <p> My current philosphy is that even dirt cheap guitars can be set to play like expensive ones because most expensive ones get set up before being sold and the cheap ones do n't , so guitarists who are n't savvy with set ups think it 's the guitar that is better ( it FEELS better ) rather than realsing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm also of the opinion the hardware and pups are far more important to amplified tone than the wood its made from . <p> I 'm not saying anyone who likes anything different than me is in any way wrong - far from it - different things make one play differently and if that gives you the thing/feeling/sound you want there 's no reason to fix it at all . I should also say I 'm a bit OCD with this stuff and ca n't stop tinkering , plus i 'm gradually making a little extra cash doing stuff for people which is nice . <p> I think sometimes people can make a lot more out of something than there really is , especially with the Classic Player necks and the Radius difference . <p> Gavin is a Jaguar purist and before he played my CP Jaguar he was dead against the idea of a Jag without a 7.25 " radius . After he played it , not only did he like it , but he said he could n't really feel a difference . The fact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile that forms the way a neck feels in your hand .

They 're both great guitars and feel fantastic to play , and in my opinion the difference between the necks is definitely exaggerated by people for whatever reason ; corksniffing , puritanical venom , elitism ?

Again , that was very helpful to me , and I thank you for posting that information . However , may I respectfully point out ( with a full realization of my status as a noob on this forum ... ) that the CURRENT Mustangs that are officially sold in the USA by Fender are ALSO part of the Fender Classic Series : <p> However , as you suggest , the current model clearly spells out that it is a " ' 65 Mustang " where the earlier versions did n't specify a model year in the sales ads / Fender USA marketing literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " ' 69 reissues " not being released until 2002 , this was the case as late as 2005 - I confirmed that by looking up the Mustang in a 2005 edition of Fender Frontline I happen to have here in the studio . As with the models from the 1990s , it says " Classic Series " and does not specify a specific year that it is emulating / " reissuing " . You can either take my word for that , or if you 're still skeptical , I can take a few digital snapshots of the Fender Frontline catalog and post them . <p> However , setting that aside , there is some discrepancy between what Fender USA and Fender Japan does in terms of the naming and marketing of these guitars . For that , I do have an illustration - Here 's a picture of my ' 94 MIJ neck 's heel : <p> Note that it is stamped " MG-69 " - which is the code they use in Japan to identify 1969 Mustang reissue necks . So while Fender USA was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were intended to be such by Fender Japan . Fender Japan still uses similar codes on their current production Mustangs - including the models that Fender USA imports to the USA as " Classic Series ' 65 Mustangs " . <p> Here 's a picture from a current Ebay auction for a ' 65 reissue neck that shows the " MG-65 " model code : <p> So you see , there is some legitimate reason for people to believe they are , and for them to refer to these guitars as " ' 69 Mustang reissues " . <p> Now my theory - and again , this is ONLY a theory - is that Fender USA did n't feel the 90s - mid 2000 's era Mustangs were close enough to the original 1969 era guitars to warrant being called a " Classic Series ' 69 Mustang " in the USA . For whatever reason , Fender Japan felt OK with calling them that in Japan , where they are still available and are still marketed as ' 69 Mustangs ; which a quick look around on the Gakki and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'm sorry to be so detailed in my reply , but IMO , you 're not 100% on the mark with your comments either , and in my experience , whenever people resort to SHOUTING things like " STFU AND LISTEN TO ME " , it tends to stifle discussion and discourse , not encourage it . Again , I realize I 'm a noob here , but IMO , you 'd be more successful at getting people to give credence to your knowledge and points if you were a bit less overblown in your responses when they dared to disagree with you . And dare I add , you might occasionally learn something yourself . <p> I had a 69 RI . Only problem I had with it was the pickups were weak for my style of playing . Otherwise built like a tank .

The reason why this is a better solution than any other glue is that it never fully cures , so it retains some precious elasticity which is essential in preventing your speaker from tearing open again .

@@80332123 @1832123/ <p> This was a happy little mod I made to my ' 57 Dano a couple days ago ; just thought I 'd share . <p> I 've been having noise problems with it for months now , mostly due to crappy old wiring in all the places I usually play . I had been using an EHX Hum Debugger that works great , but I wanted something a bit more permanent that would let me plug directly into the amp . After a little research , I settled on a dummy coil . <p> For anyone who does n't know , a dummy coil is just like a regular pickup but with no magnet . It 's wired out-of-phase ( in series or parallel ) with your existing pickup(s) and stuck inside the guitar body . Any RF , LF , or AF interference that would normally be picked up by you regular pickup ( acting as an antenna ) is also picked up by the dummy coil , but 180 degrees out of phase . The noise signal is canceled out just like a humbucker . Provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works extremely well . A " stacked " single coil is just a regular SC with a built-in dummy coil . <p> It 's possible to make your own by getting a cheap ceramic Strat pup and breaking the magnet off the bottom . To be most effective , though , it has to match the specs and geometry of the pickup as close as possible . For the Dano this was a problem , and nothing I could home-brew really worked . After searching , I found Vintage Vibe Guitars . I emailed Pete , and $45 + 1 week later I had a custom-wound dummy coil . I used foam to wedge it inside my Dano , wired it up in series , and the noise was gone . Not perfect , but a solid 70-80% reduction in buzz and hum . Side-by-side , it actually has less buzz now than my 335 . The tone was darkened a bit , but adjusting the EQ fixed that no problem . <p> I ca n't recommend Pete and VVG enough . The coil works perfectly , is extremely well-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle . I asked for a coil that would match my lipstick at 3.66k , and the final product was 3.73k . That 's a 1.9% margin of error ! <p> Even if you do n't use VVG ( yes , I promised him a plug ) , it 's a great mod if you have some extra room inside your guitar . <p> To that , I have no good answer . Gibson used them in the Nighthawk , but I ca n't think of any other major model . Suhr started including them as a custom option for this model year . They also offer a strat back-plate with a coil built-in , though it 's stupid expensive . <p> My guess is that for the longest time in the 70s and 80s humbuckers were the major trend . By the 90s and 2000s , the whole tone-snob trend started to take hold and they were resistant to look into it because of the tone change . A tone-snob is , by definition , a purist . Most makers were content with humbuckers . Fender has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their line of silent single coils , though , which include a built-in dummy coil . Other makers interested in reducing noise , like Nat Daniels , tended to focus on shielding rather than cancellation . That does n't answer the question , though , because the concept of a dummy coil has been around since the 20s . <p> An add-on dummy coil is usually still noisier than a humbucker , though not necessarily . Careful consideration has to be paid to placement . There is a tone change . If you put the coil in parallel , the tone thins and becomes quieter . If you put in in series , it dulls slightly . Series is the less drastic change by far . Specifically , series increases the PUP 's DC resistance which magnifies the effect of coil and cable capacitance . It 's equivalent to turning the tone control down a minute amount . Thus , to compensate all I had to do was turn my tone up a touch . I know my Dano 's sound very intimately , and the change was negligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YMMV . I know my Dano 's pickup is extremely inductive , and it tends to respond to resistance/capacitance changes less drastically than my Mustang for example . <p> Still , if you have a noise problem , extra room in your guitar , and some know how I think it 's an amazing mod . <p> Still , if you have a noise problem , extra room in your guitar , and some know how I think it 's an amazing mod . <p> Absolutely . <p> I can see how guitarists would turn their back on this , we are a fairly polar bunch , I suppose , and this sort of represents some sort of middle ground . <p> I think that , by and large , guitarists when presented with a solution to a problem , we tend to see the worst of both worlds rather than the best of both worlds . <p> The whole zeitgeist of guitar-dom has become extremely originalist in the last few years especially . Often it 's forgotten that the industry moved forward for very good reasons . TGPers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the merits of a single tone control or single volume on an amp , but it does n't change the fact that a 3 or more band tone stack works better 99% of the time . Alnico speakers are period correct , but they distort nastily if you play close-voiced harmonies Digital is more versatile than analog . Old single coils sound great , but they buzz like bees . <p> The average listener does n't care if my ' 57 Dano is bone-stock , but they do care if there 's an off-key buzz coming from my amp . <p> I think that with guitarists it goes beyond just gear and tech stuff , though , or that the gear and tech stuff is n't what 's making them hold the opinions they have . I think there 's often something that aspires to be part what they see as a tradition ( that probably does n't exist ) that maybe includes Jimi Hendrix , SRV et al ( or whatever other couple of guitarists they are copying , or whatever other type of setup they are copying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify the gear that they think puts them in the same group as people they admire . " I ca n't play blues on a BC Rich , a Strat was played by Hendrix , now a Strat must be played by me . " It 's like the gear is more important than the player . It 's why I love showing up to gigs with a Jag-Stang and playing fairly sleazy blues . People do n't expect it . <p> I think that guitarists buy into an image thing that they attach to the gear too , despite the fact that most people in the crowd do n't care or notice what the guitar looks like . I think that there 's a part of that image in not having a dummy coil under your scratchplate . <p> This is one of the reasons I love reading bass forums . Bassists do n't seem to do this . It 's odd . Somebody in a bass forum asks what 's a good bass for metal , and someone will mention the Marcus Miller signature Jazz Bass . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funk , and someone will mention that they own a BC Rich or s Steinberger or something that they 've used at gigs before . <p> No-one ever mentions that the Tele bridge pickup sounds great for metal , or that an Ibanez RG neck pickup will do well for jazz . <p> Exactly . In fact , I played a buddy 's old Ibanez S-series from the 80s . Thing was hair-metal to the bone , but the sound of the neck pickup was amazingly sweet . It was a great jazz guitar ! <p> I have a Silvertone 1448 that I keep strung with cheap 9s or 10s and a Fender Champ 110 . It 's Cat Power 's exact rig from the 1994-1997 period , and nails the sound perfectly . It 's also a noisy and extremely flawed rig . It 's fun to have all the right stuff , but it 's not really useful to me . I suppose I 'm guilty of some of that star-worship as well . <p> This is one of the reasons I love reading bass forums . Bassists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> many 's the time i 've been put off watching a band because the bassist has some sort of monstrosity that looks like les claypool 's nightmare , and they 're playing 60s style beat music or something . it 's like someone having a ponytail playing rockabilly. it 's kind of anachronistic . i think image is important to a degree , and most of the people here do too , or you would n't have someone turning up every week asking how they can make their jag sound like a les paul . depends on the situation though , if you 're just in to jamming around in pubs i do n't think it 's such a big deal . i can see both sides of the snobbery argument.

It 's definitely one of the least-used pedals in my collection , but it 's a pony with one badass trick I 've found quite invaluable for the music I do . <p> In Normal position it makes for a reasonable Ross-style comp , although it felt a little stuffy for me and my Moollon comp does that trick like a champ . The Dark position fairly useless . The Bright position is where it literally shines . I set gain ( input signal into the comp stage , seems to lower the threshold ) and attack ( compression amount/attackspeed ) to 11:00 and it does the rest . Bright and chimey , it evens things out yet keeps a consistently vibrant ring to the tail decay that works wonders when wanting to get a jangley arrpegio not buried in the mix . <p> And I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle comp from my SPL Channel1 tube preamp is more than enough and sounds lovely , giving a balanced boost while keeping the dynamics of my picking intact . Listen to the recent shortscale comp tune Cindi and I did ( Death : Embracing the Beauty ) for a tasty use of " normal " outboard comp on all of the 12-string parts : No Janglebox used . <p> On the other hand , the Janglebox rather is excellent for blending nice single coil guitar work into a mix when you do n't want a strident ice pick yet want that obviously jangley , gently bright tone that could use some good ol ' studio squashing to stay alive when fighting levels in a mix , or even when just playing second fiddle in a band a la Tom Petty stuff .

You could gig with it ( unless you need pristine clean at high volume ) , it feels and looks solid , and sounds great right out of the box . <p> NOW . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes . The one area they went really cheap on was the tubes . I have heard this in the reviews , and I just got the same impression in about 10 minutes of playing time . I will hold off before ordering a bit , but I def see new tubes in the future for this thing . I am pretty sure ( as I have read in reviews ) , that it will open up the clean a little bit more and give the amp dome more usueable headroom and a small improvement in overall tone . Especially v1 and v2 . <p> Also , I want to qualify my TT observations . I always played my TT through a 2x12 open back avatar cabinet with 2 emminence tonkers . It is not exactly a fair statement to keep saying the Jet City amp is not as full since I am using half the amoutn of speakers . I think no matter the cab , the TT is probably a better head overall as far as pure tone , but would really have to compare the TT and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That said , HT5 head and cabinet runsa bout 600 over here now and I was not fond of the cabinets and I did not feel it would really be a gigging amp . Of course you could mic it , or for low volume gigs , but it just did not quite push enough air . And at 5 watts and a shallow 1x10 cabinet that should be expected . The TT is about $900 over here with the matching orange cabinet . From a price perspective ( having owned all of these and an epi JR at one point or another ) , the Jet City is a cool amp at a great price that I think with some new tubes will be better than the ht5 by far ( I use pedals anyways if I want heavy OD/distortion ) and not quite equal to , but in solid competition with the TTs <p> SPOILER <p> For those who have not checked out the companies website , they are about to roll out a version of the THD univalve amp and the head will be under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to work to get the best connection for prices , high end parts , and construction overseas and then find builders ( like Mike Soldano who is one of the 3 founders of Jet City ) to design a boutique style amp for them to mass produce at import pricing .

I like the Jet City better , but they 're very different amps . <p> The bells and whistles are cool on the HT-5 , but to be honest I hardly ever find myself switching channels or using the effects loop when I 'm playing at home , so for me they 're not necessities . <p> I 've never had a simple set-it-and-forget-it amp before , and the Jet City fits that bill . Just dial in your dirty tone , then roll back on the volume to clean it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads with more switches and features than anyone could ever need , it 's kind of refreshing . <p> I may get another volume pedal to take advantage of the way this amp responds to the volume knob ( I prefer the pedal to the guitar knob ) <p> Also , the amp takes pedals pretty well . I used the Timhulio green muff and my plane ticket through it and they both sounded great . They say great minds think alike .... Sometimes we do too ... <p> I just got back from the studio I record at and took the Jet City in with me . Did nto record it as we were doing vocals , but I got to plug it into a marshall and a mesa cabinet and then we A/B 'd it with Andy 's ( the owner/engineer ) Dr Z Mazarati 18 watt head . I have to tell you , the Dr Z sounded a little bit better at anything except higher gain levels , but it was pretty damned close ( and that was the stock Jet City tubes verses the Z @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra JJ 's he had and threw them into the Jet City just to check it out . While not earth shattering change , it definitely made it sound fuller and more gain . Then switching out the V1 with a 12at7 gave ti more headroom ( but of course cut down its overall gain ) . <p> Only problem I have found is it hums quite a bit with both volume and gain over 5 . As you get higher up , the hum gets a litte louder than it should really be . I am going to email the company and see what they say . It was probably more than double the " noise " that the Dr Z was putting out at similiar volume/gain levels . There is probably a small grounding issue or something .

However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.5 " , but I doubt it would be very noticable . <p> Secondly , I found this post on TDPRI where someone actually worked out the math and show how the bridge radius should be bigger than the neck radius . <p> Here 's the visual explaination where the line by the tip of the cone would be the nut curved to the neck radius and the base is the bridge at a wider radius . <p> When I found this all out , I figured it made sense as to why I no longer had any fret buzz issues on the Jag . <p> Anyone else find this out ? <p> sunshiner wrote : <p> you can allow yourself to appear on the central tv channels wearing coat indoors and saying " fuck " every ten seconds 124145 @qwx744145 <p> christ I remember fucking around with these kids giving them the cheese touch in the back of the van <p> i think he 's saying that because the nut is 9.5 " and the bridge is 12 " , the strings are conical as a result , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tom and 9.5 " radius on my bratocaster. the major drawback with them is that you ca n't get a nice gradual increase in action from the high E to the low E without sacrificing a few things , namely too low action at the D and G strings in my experience . and if you have the bridge set flat your high e is going to be too high or your low e is going to buzz . so the whole thing irks me and I 'd rather have adjustable saddle height . <p> interestingly my shreddy jackson has fixed saddle height and 12 " radius neck due to the floyd and does n't have this problem and both e 's can be set with very low action at the same height without buzz . i think the 9.5 " radius just is n't suited to the job <p> you can raise the saddle height on a jag bridge . and that is what you do if you get fret buzz ( especially if you use wimpy strings ) . so other than not liking the jag bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before to prevent fret buzz . <p> I also read somewhere ( can not confirm if true , however ) that some 1950s Les Pauls had 9.5 " radius fretboards with a 12 " bridge straight out of the factory . <p> Also Cur , the Squier Jag bridge is what I have a problem with . I ca n't get along with it at all , especially since the saddle height screws are pretty crooked and fucked .

@@80332154 @1832154/ <p> A friend of mine tried the Marr Jag at GC San Francisco . He said he loved the neck and felt it was more comfortable ( read : thinner ? ) than other Jag necks he 'd tried before . <p> I will say I 've found that there 's a big difference between AVRI Jag and JM necks . Jag necks always feel thicker to me ( may just be shape , as Owen has said ) . Kinda like comparing apples and oranges . This has kept me away from Jags for the most part . <p> It kinda depends on the nut width as well . When I measured my AVRI neck for the Nut Width thread , it 's a thin C profile but the nut width is wider than all my other guitars(43mm) . So there is more fretboard area despite it being a thinner neck and it does n't feel as cramped between the frets as my other shortscale necks . I am guessing the Johnny Marr neck is a little chunkier like my 1969 Mustang neck on my Mullet-stang <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if the neck is chunkier , if it 's 1mm narrower than a AVRI Jaguar neck , that will help it not feel as big . Definitely , play before you buy or be able to return it . <p> Ah fuck it .

It 's c-shaped , so it 's not like ' 52 Tele-big . I ca n't imagine anyone would have a problem with it . OK , maybe shredders .

Picked it up , tuned it up ( set up was a bit high but serviceable ) , and I can report that the neck is JUST FINE . Very comfortable . That picture posted above is deceiving . It is a bit thicker than the AVRI JM neck , but I liked it fine . It did not bother me the way that the Squier JMJM or 2012 American Standard Stratocaster chunky necks bothered me ; maybe that has something to do with the 7.25 radius , I do n't know .

I even brought in my own head to test it with .. they were actually really surprised when i walked in with my bassman head .. and my sovtek. had to test it through both as i swap between them or a DI depending upon the venue , and other bands on the bill , or the setlist i 've written out .. <p> But they were happy to let me try them all .. <p> Since I already have a few acoustic Cases I decided against picking one up ( The more expensive one includes a case ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some reason I never understood .... But hey , now I have a box to Ship Robert(OG) the jazzmaster , and cooterfinger the jag-stang to route .. so it actually all worked out quite well . 
@@80332158 @1832158/ <p> i 'd mentioned this in a thread a month or so back , so i 'm finally getting around to posting the examples : <p> do n't know why there has to be such a disparity between good and bad tortoise shell guards FROM THE SAME GOD DAMNED GUITAR MANUFACTURER , but there definitley is . <p> here is what i would call crap . it 's a squier jagmaster , and this looks like three-day-old , moldy diarrhea. you get thiese for a street price of $280 right now . wow . <p> Hidden : <p> this is better . it 's a mexican jazzmaster. it does n't look quite as sweet as a the real deal , but it at least looks like they did more than use contact sheets to make it . you got ta spend $900 to get this quality , though . <p> Hidden : <p> my avri jag . notice how it actually looks like bits a material mixed together like symphony . $1900 ? wtf ? <p> they had a big thread about this on OSG where they ordered samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end nothing compared to the vintage stuff but the consensus was that WD Music has the best tort. even better than Fender CS. but whatever the method was they used to make the stuff back in the day , it 's long gone now . <p> i ordered three different samples of tort from terrapin pickguards and their very expensive " celluloid " tort is the only one that looked decent . i went to guitar center and compared it to fender avri tort and it is identical . the other stuff they sell looks screen-printed. but nothing compares to the vintage fender stuff . <p> they had a big thread about this on OSG where they ordered samples from all the pickguard makers . I think in the end nothing compared to the vintage stuff but the consensus was that WD Music has the best tort. even better than Fender CS. but whatever the method was they used to make the stuff back in the day , it 's long gone now . <p> I have a lovely red tort guard from WD on my P-Bass ... it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back reminding you not to stick the pickguard on a flame because it could explode or something like that , because it 's made of cellulose . <p> Why exactly does the vintage stuff look so damn good ? Is the modern nitrate cellulose somehow different from back in the day ? Were there chemicals used then that are no longer permissible ? <p> the good tort is nice and ... chunky . less swirled/thin/soupy ( good adjectives are escaping me right now ) the cheap tort on the vista jag and hotrod 's strat look similar and equally poor quality . but the 62 jag and the 65 haze sleeps with have an almost pearloid-size texture , though more blended . <p> they had a big thread about this on OSG where they ordered samples from all the pickguard makers .

To be honest some of the super faded cellulose vintage tort puts me off as well . <p> to each his own , and it 's good that you 're in love with your guitar . what floors me is how much money one has to spend to go from what we all agree is an abomination to the good stuff you 've got on your guitar . i mean , $600 more for a better pickguard and electronics ? i actually thought the neck on the jagmaster was decent , every bit as playable as the CP jazzies and jags . <p> It seems as if somewhere along the way , the meaning of tortoiseshell within the guitar world changed to describe anything containing a swirl . Most of the stuff I have seen used on guitars after the 70s looks pathetic when compared to the real deal . The stuff used on 60s Fender guitars generally looks nice . <p> This is what genuine tortoiseshell ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The only thing that seems to come close these days is Tor-tis by Greven . It 's somewhat expensive , but it 's far superior to anything else out there . <p> I ca n't remember the name of the guy who did this for me but my custom guard was made from celluloid with the the bottom ply made of regular plastic to stop shrinkage and warpage . It 's supposed to be the ' real deal ' ( in vintage terms ) and have a 3D quality but it looks kind of reguar to me . But hey , it only cost an extra tenner from the regular stuff . <p> I 'll add a close up if anyone 's interested , it does have a certain 3D quality . It 's definitely not a print job like my original CIJ - that was terrible . <p> absolutely , 100% agreed w/ narco. his examples of tort are what i think of when somebody describes it , and it more closely resembles the old fender and the avri materials . you 're right ; the whole idea of swirling has become WAY overstated. 
@@80332159 @1832159/ <p> Fyi the neck is shimmed a little , and the bridge raised a bit . Already has electrical tape on the bridge posts . It 's strung with 11-48 half rounds I think ( just a cheap set I got on clearance I do n't normally play with 1/2 's ) . All that helps the bridge rattle a lot less than it did new out of the box . It was also my first Mustang and shortscale as well tho so others can probably weigh in a little better . 
@@80332160 @1832160/ <p> Any opinions ? I played a Squier Classic Vibe p bass , and it was of surprisingly good quality . I 'm thinking about getting a second bass somewhere during the next year and a Squier would n't make a huge dent in my wallet . The humbucker is a plus . Unless it 's utter crap . Wild spirit of the Eagle , Black hawk , bird of prey design <p> i liked that bass , dddave has one and let me play on . the styling is awsome , and his felt really good . i ca n't really remark on the sound tho . I did plug it in , but it was at low volume and we were talking and having a good time , it was n't like i was really trying to play it or pay attention to the sound of it . Dwarfcraft Devices <p> I have a vintage modified p bass ( not the tele bass ) , that i bought to play in a punk band where i knew i 'd be throwing it around and dropping it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 'd feel bad dropping a cv p bass . it feels good , sounds good and everything . and now that i have a proper bass amp makes it even better . if you 're looking for an upscale bass I.E. fender quality . then the cv 's your best bet . mine must of been a good one , because other one 's i 've played were n't teh best of quality . <p> Hidden : <p> that picture was taken back in the summer . and the finish has held up well , it 's been through alot of abuse . i would recommend these but play it first . <p> I ca n't speak for the tele bass since I 've never played one , but the VM p bass is pretty nice for the money . It sounds great and looks awesome . It does n't feel like it 's of much higher quality than the affinity p bass though . The CV basses I 've played all sound , feel and look amazing ! for only like $80 - $100 more for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CV
