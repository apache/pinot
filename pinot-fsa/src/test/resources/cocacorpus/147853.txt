Iowa , coming off a 19-15 season , is adding two 6-foot-11 freshmen , both of whom will be on display in the PTL . <p> But Luka Garza and Jack Nunge have much different skill sets . <p> Garza is a prototypical center , something Iowa lacked after the graduation of Adam Woodbury . He will be called on for low-post scoring and rim protection . Watch his footwork on both ends of the court . His technique is sound , but how about his quickness ? Does he have what it takes to make an immediate impact in the rugged Big Ten Conference ? <p> Nunge is the more versatile player and could give the Hawkeyes a true " stretch 4 . " He s also more comfortable on the wing . Check out his range , to the college 3-point line and beyond . Does he couple that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell need to keep defenses honest ? Nunge could be a quintessential wild card for the Hawkeyes this winter . <h> Quiet veterans <p> Dom Uhl and Brady Ellingson are Hawkeye upperclassmen who still need to carve out roles for themselves . Both have shown flashes of promise , but also a knack for being overly deferential , even in summer league games . <p> Is this the year they seize a bigger opportunity ? For Uhl , Iowas lone senior , its the start of a meaningful summer as his team prepares to fly to his hometown of Frankfurt , Germany , in August to begin its foreign exhibition tour . At 6-9 , he has shown the ability to block shots and to hit 3-pointers , just not in the same game . Last summer , Uhls shooting was slightly off in the Prime Time League , and that dogged him all season . How does his shot look this summer and is he more aggressive about seeking it ? <p> Ellingson , a junior shooting guard , had one superb stretch of games last winter , showcasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't  make mistakes , but also seems reluctant to force things at times . The graduation of Peter Jok , however , opens a big void in the long-range shooting department . Ellingson should be the first option to fill that part of Joks production , at least . This summer is the beginning of his chance to make a statement that he s ready . <p> Peter Jok was invited to the NBA Draft combine . Let 's take a look back at some of his games as a Hawkeye . Tyler Davis/The Register <h> Filling up the stat sheet <p> Late last season , Iowa point guard Jordan Bohannon became a double-double phenom , his assist totals suddenly keeping up with his ability to score in bunches . <p> Reserve wing player Nicholas Baer , never short of energy , has the same potential with points and rebounds . Indeed , Baer averaged 21.5 points and 12.2 rebounds in PTL play last summer , the latter leading the league . <p> Assist numbers in the PTL play are n't  typically high , but it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibitions . And is it possible that Baer could pick up a triple-double somewhere along the way ? <p> Bohannon and Baer are both solidly in Iowas rotation no matter what happens this summer , so its worth watching what they try to add to their already well-rounded games . <h> Williams ' second act <p> Last summer , Christian Williams was the heir apparent at point guard for Iowa . But the sophomore lost his job to Bohannon early on and then had to fight for his minutes . To his credit , Williams re-emerged late in the season as a defensive force who was able to score often enough in transition to add value to his team . <p> This summer , Williams could give the Hawkeyes a significant lift if he shows that he s added a jumpshot to his repertoire . Even extending his range to 15 feet , to force opposing defenses to account for him , would be a big boost for the rangy and athletic 6-5 guard . <p> An offensively versatile Williams would allow Bohannon to slide over to shooting guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to take and make big shots . The two played together well at times last season , but the onus is on Williams to make that a productive option for Iowa coach Fran McCaffery to consider . Watch his accuracy from mid-range and beyond this summer , and how much confidence he has taking those shots . <h> Are the rims ready ? <p> The first thing to notice is whether they 've reinforced the rims to prepare for all the dunking that Cook will do . Hell dunk with either hand . Some of them will be violent , others so swift you may want a slow-motion replay to be sure of what you just saw . <p> And hell smile . Always . Now a sophomore , Cook is one of the more engaging personalities Hawkeye fans have seen . Talented , too . Hell make the trip to North Liberty or Waterloo worth your while .

And they 're not the only ones . <p> In 2009 , the state ombudsman first warned state leaders about the problem , - issuing a report that found 43 cases where people convicted of lottery crimes in a three-year period- were not ordered to repay their bogus winnings . <p> Jackie " Jack " Hatler Jr . pleaded guilty to a theft charge last year after Iowa officials accused him of illegally passing a $25,000 lottery ticket to his girlfriend .

That 's a felony . <p> Iowa law requires the lottery to participate in the state Income-Offset Program , which is used to collect money owed to governmental institutions , including child support , court fees and- back taxes . <p> All prizes of $100 or more claimed at a lottery office are checked against the income-offset database . <p> Hatler , of Monona , in northeast Iowa , told the Register he passed his winning $25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valid bank account or I 'd , in part because of a past drug conviction . <p> Jerry Vander Sanden , Linn County Attorney ( Photo : Linn County Attorney 's Office/Special to the Register ) <p> " They never replied to our request , " said Jerry Vander Sanden , Linn County Attorney . " Therefore we were unable to request victim restitution without that information . " <p> Iowa Lottery officials initially told the Register- they had not been notified of Vander Sanden 's effort to seek restitution but later said the request had been overlooked as part of an office move . <p> Hatler said in an interview that he erroneously believed the unemployment overpayments he received had been paid automatically when his tax refund was garnished . <p> He said he never intended to defraud the government by asking his girlfriend- to cash the ticket . <p> Hatler ultimately entered an Alford plea to- aggravated misdemeanor theft .

" Katcher asked . " It did n't seem like it would have been worth the trouble to try to sell things just to get a few dollars back .

Jeremiah had the athleticism of a shortstop , the game management of a catcher and his throwing arm was n't all that bad , either . <p> But Estrada rarely got a chance to pitch .

Only time can tell . <p> Jeremiah Estrada , who played for Palm Desert High School is expected to be drafted by a Major League Baseball organization this summer . ( Photo : Omar Ornelas/ The Desert Sun , Omar Ornelas/The Desert Sun ) <p> Estrada started his senior year floating around the end of the first round or start of the second , according to draft projections . But a bruise from a come-backer to the forearm in an early-season game against Corona benched Estrada for about 10 days and cooled several teams interest , according to coach Darol Salazar . <p> Since , he led the Aztecs through a nearly improbable playoff run with a win , a save and a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Ward knew he could go to the Rays and possibly stagnate at the rookie league level , or go to Fresno State on a full-ride scholarship , start , see devoted attention and grow . <p> Even if he had to take classes along the way . <p> " For a smart student-athlete , it would be easier , but for someone like me who did n't  care about school much and just got by , it was hard , " Ward said . <p> Ward also said someone in Estradas position cant go into college focused on solely improving his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where players compete on a team solely for the purpose of getting game-level tests where major league personnel can watch their growth . <p> In college , players are n't  shuffling in and out every week .

" Plus , a lot of college coaches like to change you to help the team out , which does n't  necessarily help you . You 're 50 percent you and 50 percent what the coach wants you to do . But in pro ball , its all about you . Its about trying to get you to the major leagues . " <p> Ramiro says UCLA coach John Savage and the whole Bruins staff want the same thing for Estrada . <p> " One thing that stuck in my mind from Coach Savage is he said I do n't  care what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball , and its my job to get him ready for that . You 're going to have three years for him to get to that level ; why not do it here ? And during that time , earn your education. " <p> Jeremiah Estrada , who played for Palm Desert High School is expected to be drafted by a Major League Baseball organization this summer . ( Photo : Omar Ornelas/The Desert Sun ) <p> When asked about his potential future at UCLA , Estrada wastes almost no time in mentioning Savage and the success he s brought to his team and his players . Currently , three former Bruins populate MLB rosters Matt Grace ( Nationals ) , Gerrit Cole ( Pirates ) and Trevor Bauer ( Indians ) . From 2010 to 2013 , the Bruins went to three College World Series in four seasons winning the 2013 title . <p> " Coach Savage is one of the best coaches I know , and from what Ive heard and seen , he knows a lot and likes to win ballgames and set up pitchers for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top pitching coaches in the world , and this is a good team .

He could even see himself becoming a doctor because he s " not afraid of blood . " <p> " Its a priority , and I want to get it done , " Estrada said about his education . " I want to play with Coach Savage and continue learning . You 're learning more and more , increasing your growth and becoming a young man . <p> " Most likely , I 'll choose UCLA .

For one reason or another , though , the Mets were the one to finally claim him in the 21st round . Earman held MLB dreams but decided instead to go to the University of Arizona on scholarship . During his sophomore year , he got in a car crash , debilitating him and eventually leading to a transfer to Cal Baptist . <p> After his junior year , Earman wasnt drafted . <p> Ward and Salazar both said competition in the minor leagues is certainly harder , helping to raise the level of play for the right high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles . <p> " At the plate , you 're facing a Friday night type of college guy every night ( in the minor leagues ) , " Ward said .

Hesse was always quick to point out that he missed nearly two games with a hamstring injury . <p> " Anything I was behind in , I 'd always put an asterisk next to it , " he joked . <p> Even so , the numbers were remarkably even . Matt Nelson led the ends in tackles with 43 . Anthony Nelson set the pace with six sacks . Hesse , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pass attempts . <p> And that was with all three players being underclassmen . With another year of experience , Hesse said those stats should be expected to rise . <p> Bazata had a much different experience , beginning the 2016 season as a starter alongside senior Jaleel Johnson . He was pleased with his early play but said he was never the same after his Week 8 ankle injury . Bazata soldiered on in order to provide a few plays off for Johnson and fellow senior Faith Ekakitie , and said he has no regrets about doing so . <p> The offseason brought the second surgery of his life . Bazata suffered a dislocated shoulder as a wrestler at Howells-Dodge High School in Nebraska , and that surgery kept him from throwing during his subsequent track season . Undeterred , he took up running instead and competed in the 400 and 800 meters .

The two were seen walking out of Iowas football complex together after Wednesdays media session each with a barely noticeable limp . <p> Its symptomatic of the defensive linemen as a whole , Bazata said . That togetherness was something Drew Ott instituted as a senior in 2015 , and it remains two years later . <p> " We hang out at each others house . We go to movies together ( a majority vote decides which ones , but typically comedies ) . We eat together , " Bazata said .

It disappeared far into the Houston evening and for a moment , appeared to hand Iowa the necessary boost to keep its season alive . <p> " I was going up there looking for a fastball that 's what I had been seeing all game , " Adams said . " He s kind of a quick guy coming to the plate . Obviously , he got me the first couple times I faced him , and he threw a fastball right down the middle . I was ready to jump on it . Hit a big home run there in that situation . It sparked our team a little bit . right when I came back to the dugout , everybody was pumped up . <p> " I thought that was going to be the turning point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Martsching had been nails all postseason having not yielded a run in his first 10 1/3 innings but the Cougars tagged him hard after Adams unloaded . Grayson Padgets RBI double gave Houston some insurance in the ninth after Wong 's decisive blow over the center field batter 's eye . <p> Martsching , who threw 2 2/3 innings of two-hit ball against the Cougars on Friday , saw a stretch of seven consecutive scoreless appearances end . <p> " It was the situation we wanted the right guy was there , " Iowa coach Rick Heller said . " Josh has meant a lot to the program fifth-year senior , been through it all . Tommy John surgery , fought through that , and had been amazing this whole season . <p> " I did n't  have anybody else that I wouldve went to in that situation other than Josh .

The late , seesawing action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Drake Robison and Mitch Ullom essentially matched each other frame for frame . <p> After yielding a first-inning single to Mason McCoy , Ullom retired 11 Hawkeyes in a row . Robison , meanwhile , built off his strong Big Ten Conference Tournament outing with just one run surrendered over the first five frames . <p> But Iowa ambushed Ullom in the fifth , and Houston did the same to Robison in the sixth . Each squad put up a three-spot before Iowa freshman Grant Judkins RBI groundout tied the game at 4-4 heading to the seventh . <p> " Beginning of the game , we were pressing a little too much , " Adams said . " We werent our normal selves . We werent taking our 15 seconds like we 've been doing all year , and that hurt us . So once we got up there and relaxed , things started going the way we wanted to .

It was a no-doubter , and then some . After waiting through a 5 1/2-hour rain delay before the game , it appeared Iowa fans might get more postseason magic . <p> Just it was n't quite enough . <p> " We were the underdogs coming into the tournament and we knew what kind of team we had , " Adams said . " We had to keep playing the same game we 've been playing all year and we knew we could get it done . Our pitching staff throughout the year really stepped up , and when guys at the top of the order werent getting it done , the bottom of the order was turning it around for us and helping us out , which is very huge . <p> " But it comes down to a couple plays here and there , and they took advantage of them .

She never doubted that in the 33 months since she was shocked to hear she had been fired . <p> So Griesbaum does n't  view Fridays $1.5 million settlement of her wrongful-termination lawsuit as the end of a journey , but rather as a sign that a life she had placed on hold for nearly three years is ready to resume . On her terms . <p> " I 'm not relieved ( by the settlement ) . I was ready to go to trial , " Griesbaum told the Register on Monday . <p> " I never felt from Day One that me as a person , as a human being , as a coach , needed any vindication . I have always had a lot of pride in what I did and how I did it . And I did n't  need a lawsuit . I did n't  need a trial . I did n't  need any of that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridays settlement averted a civil trial that was scheduled to begin June 5 . It came two weeks after Griesbaums partner , former Iowa senior associate athletic director Jane Meyer , won her civil lawsuit against the school for gender and sexual orientation discrimination , retaliation and unequal pay . Meyer will get $2.3 million in damages from the university that employed her from 2001-16 . Attorneys fees will consume another $2.7 million , putting Iowas athletic department on the hook for $6.5 million . <p> Both cases stemmed from Iowa athletic director Gary Bartas decision to fire Griesbaum in 2014 , despite a 169-107 career record and 22 years of service to the university . Barta acted after what he said was a pattern of complaints of abusive behavior by Griesbaum toward her players . An internal university review had found no policy violations by Griesbaum . <p> Barta testified in Meyer 's lawsuit that Griesbaum refused to change her coaching methods , and he was concerned that more complaints from athletes were inevitable if he retained her . Griesbaum denied that claim . <p> During a 35-minute interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Newkirk and Jill Zwagerman , Griesbaum addressed a variety of topics , including the lingering sting of losing a job she loved , her plans for the future and under what circumstances she would consider having a conversation with Barta . <p> The University of Iowa agreed to pay Tracey Griesbaum $1.5 million Friday to end a legal battle that began nearly three years ago with the firing of the former field hockey coach . Wochit <p> Griesbaum , 51 , said she was blindsided when Barta informed her at 3 p.m. on Aug. 4 , 2014 , that she was no longer Iowas field hockey coach . She described the immediate aftermath as one of raw anguish . <p> " There was like that initial three or four months where it was completely gut-wrenching . I never had thoughts , feelings , emotions like that before , " Griesbaum said . <p> " I was 48 years old , and I think that 's really young . And I felt like we had really , really positive things on the horizon , not just in wins and losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of what we were doing . " <p> Barta replaced Griesbaum with her assistant , Lisa Cellucci . Griesbaum said she learned to channel her feelings of betrayal over time , but that the disappointment will always be with her . <p> ( Photo : University of Iowa ) <p> " I think I just want to be able to use it . I want to wrap it up a little differently and push it on to the next person and try to support them , " she said . " I would be a magician if I could pretend it never happened . " <p> Barta pointed to poor win-loss records for most of those decisions and noted that he also has replaced 11 male coaches in his 11 years at Iowa . <p> Griesbaum sensed a double standard . <p> " I felt like I knew them well enough to know that this is not appropriate , that they should n't be losing their jobs in this manner , " Griesbaum said . " I do n't  know what I would have done if I was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose their job . " <p> Instead , Griesbaum felt emboldened by what she saw as an unfair pattern of dismissals to fight against it when she was fired . She said she considers her victory to be shared among all her former colleagues , and that all have reached out to congratulate her . <p> Griesbaum remains in contact with Cellucci her " best friend " but has not attended an Iowa field hockey game or practice since she was removed from her job . She does n't  anticipate that she ever will , although the desire to coach again remains strong . <p> " I wanted to make sure that my presence was n't a distraction , " Griesbaum said , choosing her words carefully . " I still have a deep respect and care for the Iowa field hockey program . " <p> The former field hockey coach at Iowa reacts to her partner , Jane Meyer , winning a civil lawsuit against the UI .

I feel like my energy and my passion and my skills and what I bring to the table is not going to go away when I 'm 62 or 65 or 68 .

ESPN college basketball analyst Mark Adams said there was much talk about Murray State " being the frontrunner " as the MVC went through those campus meetings but that Valparaiso ultimately surged ahead after a " real strong visit . " <p> Constant chatter emerged as to whether the league would extend multiple invitations , thus pushing the league beyond 10 teams for just the fourth year since the MVCs founding in 1907 .

" But the main thing will be , if we look at going in that direction , then we feel like those teams are also good fits for the conference and certainly add significant value to what were trying to accomplish . <p> " If were not in that position , then there 's no reason to add institutions just to do it . You want to make sure you 're adding strong institutions ones that can add strength to your conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But the traditional 10-team format remains , for now , a decision Adams said is multi-layered . <p> " One , " he said , " the practical nature of the timing of this . Here we are , in May , and to add one member makes scheduling a lot more practical , moving forward , for the 2017-18 season . If you went to 11 ( teams ) , that creates a scheduling nightmare for everybody , and I think that was one of the areas ( why ) they decided that they could n't go 11 . And I think 12 ( teams ) I 'm not sure they felt comfortable that they had three schools that they wanted to make a long-term commitment to at this point in time . <p> " And then there 's the political factor of ... by adding another private university , now its balanced , with five ( public universities ) and five ( private ones ) .

" <p> Valparaiso , a 4,500-student institution located in northwest Indiana , will join fellow private MVC schools Drake , Bradley , Evansville and Loyola . Adams said the 50-50 split between private and public members could create some ideological gridlock , but will also force the schools to work together even more so than before . <p> " I think what happens is at least internally , politically its more of an even vote , " Adams said , " and also more of a situation where you 've got private schools that sometimes have a little bit of a different agenda than the public schools . And now , they 're almost forced like a split senate to work it through . <p> " So I think , in some ways , itll help the collegial type of atmosphere not that there was a bunch of animosity but I think it will help in that way because people have to work together .

( Photo : Press-Citizen file photo ) Buy Photo <p> An eight-member Polk County jury will begin deliberations Wednesday in a lawsuit that laid bare the inner workings of the University of Iowa athletic department . <p> At issue is whether longtime employee Jane Meyer lost her job because of a culture of discrimination or over concerns that she had become combative with her supervisor and no longer able to work effectively with colleagues . <p> Testimony concluded Tuesday , on the 12th day of the trial at the Polk County Courthouse . The jury of five women and three men will receive instructions from District Court Judge Michael Huppert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys . <p> The jury will consider each of those accusations and will have six hours to reach unanimous verdicts . After that , at least seven jurors must agree in order to return a decision . If that does n't  happen , it will be considered a hung jury . Huppert ruled that the verdict will be sealed , meaning it wont be revealed in open court . <p> The defense , led by assistant attorney general George Carroll , rested its case after 2 + days of testimony with a final witness who leveled pointed criticism of Meyers behavior . <p> Liz Hollingworth , a University of Iowa professor of education who also serves as chairwoman of the schools Presidential Committee on Athletics , described several troubling episodes she had in her dealings with Meyer . Meyer served as a liaison to the equity subcommittee that Hollingworth led . <p> That committee endeavors to interview each Hawkeye head coach every three years , in closed-door meetings intended to allow the coaches to speak freely about any concerns they have , particularly relating to gender equity . Hollingworth recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible " that there were gay athletes on his or her team . Upon hearing that , Hollingworth said Meyer went directly to the coach to question the assertion , which Hollingworth labeled a breach of confidentiality . <p> " I was very disappointed , " Hollingworth said , questioning whether such interviews with coaches could ever be confidential as long as athletic department staff members sat in on PCA meetings . <p> Hollingworth said she did n't  find out that Meyer was in a long-term relationship with field hockey coach Tracey Griesbaum until nearly three months after Griesbaum was fired in August 2014 . In the meantime , there had been two PCA meetings at which the firing was discussed with Meyer present . <p> " I was very confused , " Hollingworth said of that discovery . " It made a few things make sense . I was surprised I had n't  been told .

" <p> Tracey Griesbaum ( Photo : Special to the Press-Citizen ) <p> Hollingworth said she later inferred that Meyer was speaking of a threatened lawsuit by Griesbaum . Griesbaum did later sue the university for unlawful termination . That trial is scheduled for June 5 . <p> Finally , Hollingworth spoke of a private meeting in Meyers office during which , she said , Meyer gave her a list of lesbian coaches at Iowa and implored her to interview them about any potential discrimination . <p> " Do these women know that you 're essentially outing them ? " Hollingworth said she asked Meyer , mortified by what she was hearing . <p> Hollingworth met the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" <p> On cross-examination by Meyers attorney , Thomas Newkirk , Hollingworth said she did n't  put any record of her conversation with Meyer in writing . She said she wrote the four names on a napkin , which she later discarded . <p> Meyer was brought back to the stand as the lone rebuttal witness in the case . She emphatically denied making the " discoverable in court " comment or asking Hollingworth to interview gay coaches . She said she never saw Hollingworth writing anything down and noted that there werent any napkins available in her office . <p> Meyer also spoke of her difficulties finding work in athletics after she was reassigned in December 2014 .

" <p> State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald ( Photo : Special to The Des Moines Register ) <p> Fitzgerald also- reiterated his opposition to establishing a defined contribution retirement- system for IPERS , which would be- similar to 401(k)-style retirement plans offered- by many Iowa businesses . Such plans do not offer the promise of a monthly benefit check that is provided by traditional defined benefit pensions like IPERS . <p> " I am for making some adjustments in IPERS , and- and I have been for a long time , " Fitzgerald said .

Durham offers audiences and sponsors interested in art and technology , according to Emmy Parker , brand and creative director at Moog Music . <p> " It 's an event that 's totally focused on how technology enhances creativity , and that happens to be what the community of Durham is focused on right now , " she said . " That city is exploding with technology , innovation , startups , and it just makes sense for Moogfest to be there . " <p> In Asheville , officials said they were disappointed about the festival 's departure . <p> " From an economic development standpoint , I think losing ( Moogfest ) to Durham is a loss to Asheville , " said Mayor Esther Manheimer . " The folks that put together the newly redesigned Moogfest worked hard to bring people from the tech sector into the event and helped put us on the map for the tech sector , and that was different than any other event . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the location is . Parker said Durham 's biggest draw is the enthusiasm from public and private sector leaders . An organizing committee of public and private stakeholders includes Duke University , city and county government , the Durham Chamber of Commerce , the Durham Convention and Visitors Bureau , Downtown Durham Inc. , the American Tobacco Campus , and players in the tech industry . <p> And that list is just the beginning , Parker said . <p> " Durham has long engaged in these really forward-thinking public/private partnerships , " she said . " That 's how the regrowth , the rebirth , the Renaissance in Durham is happening right now . It 's not just publicly supported . It 's got to be the public , the city , the county coming together with private industry , and Durham has figured that out . " <p> A model of shared cost and shared benefit is key to organizing a festival , Parker explained . In 2014 , Moogfest had a $14 million economic impact during its five-day run , according to an economic impact study conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That shared benefit appealed to potential sponsors in Durham . <p> " Our goal here is to increase the pie so everybody 's slice gets bigger , " said Casey Steinbacher , president and CEO of the Durham Chamber of Commerce . " In order for Durham to continue to be seen as a great location for businesses that are actively engaged in the knowledge economy , we need to constantly keep the pipeline for creative talent full , and we need to keep that talent wanting to be in Durham . Moogfest is the kind of event that helps position Durham as a community that values the incredibly creative genius that is Moogfest programming . " <p> Manheimer said Asheville would have benefited from marketing itself to the technology industry because the associated jobs tend to pay well and attract a diverse range of skill sets to the area . <p> Moogfest did attract those industry players . In 2014 , nearly 100 people bought $1,000 VIP tickets to a three-day engineering workshop , for example . <p> However , the relationship between Moogfest and the tech sector represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract industry leaders , but the festival needs the industry to sponsor and support it . <p> The startup scene in Asheville pales in comparison to that of Durham , which boasts dozens of small tech companies in accelerators and startup campuses . As a group , those businesses can provide a level of sponsorship difficult to attain in Asheville , Parker said . <p> In 2014 , Moogfest looked to Buncombe County for a $250,000 grant to sponsor the festival , but the request was not met . <p> " I think there is a feeling that ( Moogfest ) gets away from our core services that we have to fund , and in tight budget times , I would say the discretionary items do get taken out and not funded , " said David Gantt , chairman of the Buncombe County Commissioners . " We understand they 've got a partnership they can do with the Durham area that they could n't do here . " <p> In all , Moogfest received $180,000 in cash and in-kind support from the city and county in 2014 . In Durham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Parker said , but she 's confident that public entities will contribute in some way since they 're already part of the organizing committee . <p> The exact trajectory of the festival depends on how it does in Durham in 2016 . Since 2012 , the festival has happened every other year , but Moog Music is not married to that schedule , Parker said . <p> Regardless of its frequency , Moogfest will remain in Durham through 2021 . <p> Walt Dickinson , an avid attender of Moogfest and co-owner of Wicked Weed Brewing , said he 's sad to see the festival leave town but not entirely surprised by the choice . <p> Wicked Weed created a signature beer for the festival , and he said the audiences of both brands overlapped for mutual benefit . Although Moogfest was n't a huge sales driver , the collaboration was fun and inspiring , Dickinson said . <p> Is he worried about the news that another festival is departing downtown Asheville , just as Bele Chere and Mountian Oasis have ? Not really . <p> " At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , and people want to be here , " he said . " I do n't see that being the last festival that 's ever downtown . Something else will come and take its place . " <p> What to know about Moogfest 's move <p> The next Moogfest will take place in Durham May 19-22 , 2016 . <p> Asheville residents will be able to purchase a discounted ticket for the Durham event for $99 , according to Moog Music 's Emmy Parker . There are a limited number of tickets available . <p> Moog Music , the locally-based electronic musical instrument company , will remain in Asheville indefinitely . It employs more than 60 people here and recently acquired an additional acre adjacent to its current facility on Broadway . <p> Moogfest will take place in Durham through 2021 , although the frequency of the event is undetermined . An eventual return to Asheville is neither planned nor out of the question . <p> According to a study by the Economic Development Coalition , Moogfest 's impact on Asheville 's economy during its 5-day 2014 event was $14 million .

" <p> According to the most recent data available through the U.S. Census ' American Community Survey , about 4,400 people chose to move to Asheville from another state in 2013 " a figure that accounts for just shy of half of one percent of the city 's total population . <p> Don Davies , founder of Realsearch , an Asheville company that researches real estate trends , said the impact these older adults are having on the housing market is hard to miss . <p> Real estate research does not track home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common narrative from the people he hikes with on a regular basis . Unlike Davies , who has lived in Buncombe County for more than 30 years , his fellow hikers are new to town , usually retired and have moved to the area from a more expensive city . <h> Asheville population changes <p> Projected Asheville population changes by age group 2015-2020 . <p> Sponsored by <h> 2015 <h> 2020 <p> " In Buncombe County , our average housing price is more than $500,000 . Couple that with the fact that we have the lowest number of houses on the market in Buncombe County in the last 12 years , and the majority of youngish working people can not afford it . They are beginning to get priced out , " Davies said . <p> " Where these folks come from , places like New York , D.C. , Los Angeles and some parts of Florida , they come here and still think we 're a bargain even though we , the local people , think it 's getting too high . When I said that our house prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you because $500,000 for a home is nothing compared to where they used to live . " <p> The median asking price of residences in Buncombe reached $330,000 in March , which means the number of houses costing more than $330,000 was the same as the number of houses costing less than that . <p> Skip Dillingham , managing broker at Century 21 Mountain Lifestyles real estate agency , said it makes sense that an area that is in demand has higher home costs . <p> " I 've always said it costs to live in heaven , and we have a little piece of heaven here in Asheville , " Dillingham said . <p> In fact , many retirement destinations begin as tourism hubs . Florida 's status as a retirement mecca can be traced back to the 19th century , when New Yorkers would flock to the state to escape their state 's harsh winter months , Bradley said . <h> Buncombe County population changes <p> Projected Buncombe County population changes by age group 2015-2020 . <p> Sponsored by <h> 2015 <h> 2020 <p> " If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have good memories of times spent with their families , " Bradley said . " When those people then reach retirement age , and if they are considering making a retirement move , they may have a limited number of destinations where they can imagine living . Among those places will be areas that they have visited and vacationed . " <p> But for other older adults coming to the region or aging in the region , their pockets are not always lined with the security of 401(k) plans or a large amount of discretionary spending . <p> " We hear stories so often about people who are drawn here by the arts and the reputation that Asheville has but it just does n't pan out for them or they do n't have a job . That happens with older people , too , " said Wendy Marsh , executive director of the Council on Aging of Buncombe County . " Not everybody who moves here is wealthy . " <p> According to a market feasibility analysis study conducted in April by Bowen National Research on behalf of Asheville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties in Asheville have significant wait lists . <p> At Battery Park Apartments , a 121-unit apartment building in downtown Asheville for adults 62 and older , for disabled individuals and for people that qualify for Section 8 housing , about 150 households were on the waiting list in the spring . <p> Givens ' Affordable Housing Director Teresa Stephens said these needs are what is driving the development of Givens Gerber Park . The project in South Asheville aims to create 262 units of senior housing , of which 202 will be designed as affordable units for seniors who earn 60 percent or less of the average median income , or less than $26,000 annually . The remaining 60 units will be " workforce housing " for senior households that earn 61-100 percent of the average median income , or roughly between $26,000 and $45,000 . <p> " As more people age , we 're going to need more resources for them , more services , more housing , " Stephens said . " To me , developing a project like this is just common sense . Not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford assisted living . When you read about demand here , the need is truly great and it 's only going to get greater . " <p> According to the Pew Research Center , nationwide , roughly 10,000 boomers will turn 65 every day until the year 2030 . <p> That fact is one that Marsh , executive director at the Council on Aging of Buncombe County , recognizes . <p> The Council on Aging of Buncombe County is a nonprofit that works to provide services to individuals 60 and older . Marsh said the organization served 8,000 people during its most recent fiscal year , and has seen a 27 percent increase in people accessing them for help in the past three years . <p> " To me , developing a project like this is just common sense . Not all folks are ready for assisted living and not everyone can afford assisted living . When you read about demand here , the need is truly great and it 's only going to get greater . " <p> Teresa Stephens , Givens ' Affordable Housing Director <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be poor and alone , " Marsh said . <p> However , on the other side of the picture , older adults can also provide a positive impact on the economy as well " especially in a tourist town like Asheville . <h> Economics <h> Economic promise versus economic strain <p> Bradley said older adults who are able to relocate to another city later in life , generally , tend to be more affluent and , by proxy , tend to contribute significant dollars to the local economy . <p> " Kind of a rule of thumb is that every two migrants to a community generates one job , " Bradley said . " They spend money locally , and it should stimulate the local economy , but that all depends on the local economy 's ability to capture that spending . " <p> In tourism-based economies , Bradley said , senior spending can actually help to counter a tourism destination 's seasonal economy by spending year-round and stabilizing the market . When the tourists leave , the seniors stay . <p> Before accepting a position at Samford University in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Carolina University in Greenville , North Carolina . There , he studied how North Carolina was affected by people who moved to the state later in life . <p> Between 1995 and 2000 , Bradley said North Carolina saw a net income transfer of $1.1 billion solely due to the influx of older adults migrating to the Tar Heel State . <p> " And North Carolina should continue to attract a fairly large number of older migrants . It 's a favored destination state , from the mountains to the coast and all the urban areas in between , " he said . <p> But while this population can sometimes sustain a local economy , it can also strain it . <p> " The problem is if older adults remain in one place once their resources run out or if they become dependent on Medicaid , Medicare or some other state or locally funded program , " Bradley said . <p> Medicaid , a federal-state program , helps pay for health care for the needy , aged , blind and disabled , as well as for low-income families with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a federal health care insurance program for people older than 65 and for the disabled . <h> Buncombe County population percentage changes between 2015-2020 <p> Like Asheville , Buncombe County shows the greatest growth by far will happen among people between the ages of 65 and 74 . <p> Sponsored by <p> According to a 2013 study from the U.S. Census Bureau , half of all people on Medicare had incomes less than $23,500 , which is equivalent to 200 percent of poverty for a single-person household in 2015 . <p> Rebecca Chaplain , an aging and disabilities specialist at the Area Agency on Aging at Land of Sky Regional Council was one of the 13 people who served on the Planning Committee of the Buncombe County Aging Coordinating Consortium . The committee authored the Buncombe County Aging Plan for January 2013-December 2017 . <p> She said she is already seeing the impact of the silver tsunami as boomers begin taking care of their parents . <p> " So many of our staff here are also caregivers . It affects everything from work performance to quality of life . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually the invisible patient , " Chaplain said . <p> Feeling invisible is something that can also happen to people who move to cities later in life , especially if these cities are quick to judge their newfound residents . <p> However , the way these adults are able to mobilize in communities can pay dividends and can even do things that an area 's locals may not be able to do . <h> Community <h> Community influence versus community isolation <p> When John Wingerter and his wife , Edythe , looked for places to retire , Asheville represented an eclectic , intellectual and vibrant arts community where they wanted to be during their golden years . In 2006 , after 25 years in Toledo , Ohio , the couple moved to Asheville . <p> However , about six years into his job-free life , Wingerter realized he was not ready to stop working . He sought purpose and he wanted to contribute to his new community . <p> " I tried retirement , and I decided I did n't like it at all , " Wingerter said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something more , and this opportunity presented itself . " <p> With 40 years of work history in the insurance business , Wingerter decided to put his skills to use and started volunteering at the Council on Aging of Buncombe County . Now , he helps his peers navigate the challenges of health care insurance as the nonprofit 's director of insurance services . <p> Wingerter estimates about 22 volunteers are currently helping the nonprofit with Medicare counseling sessions . Almost all of them are retirees . Almost all of them moved to Asheville from somewhere else . <p> " A lot of folks who retire here are very well-educated folks and they know how to express themselves , make themselves known and make their views known . They 're writing letters to the editor , doing community activities , volunteering with us and places like MANNA FoodBank , Meals on Wheels and others , " Wingerter said . " If it was n't for their contributions , the city would be a much poorer place . " <p> At Meals on Wheels , for example , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to local people in need . Many of the volunteers are retirees . <p> Catherine Frank , executive director at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute , said this volunteerism makes sense because the types of seniors who are drawn to Asheville are not the people that want to sit around knitting on a front porch all day . <p> They may knit , but they may also kayak . <p> " So many of our members want to begin their retirement years with hiking , kayaking and biking , " Frank said . " Asheville is like a college town with UNC Asheville here , but it 's also a small city with some big city amenities that still has an intimacy you can capture . If you go to the Asheville Symphony , there 's not a bad seat in the house . In contrast to trying to see a symphony performance in Manhattan , it 's incredibly affordable . " <p> In 1988 , the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute " then called the North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement " was founded on UNCA 's campus to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classes and lectures are given on a variety of topics , from acoustic music to stargazing . The most popular class , Frank said , is on Appalachian history . <p> Today , 60 percent of OLLI 's members say the existence of the center is among one of the primary reasons why they decided to retire in Asheville . <p> " They are here because they want to be engaged , " Frank said . <p> But sometimes that can be easier said than done . <p> When an individual moves to another city later in life , they are sometimes leaving behind vital support systems and relationships . <p> " There 's a social division that can occur , and older migrants , generally , do not tend to integrate effectively into their receiving communities , " Bradley said . " When you move into a community as a working-aged adult , there are a couple of key mechanisms that exist . If you have children in schools , you get to know other people that way . If you 're at work , you get to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have those avenues open to them . They have to rely on other types of social structures , like church groups or clubs . And if they 're coming from a different region or social class , it only makes integration that much more difficult . " <p> Sometimes older adults can mean well , but their wants can have negative impacts on a city 's physical environment . <p> In mountain communities , Bradley said , retirees want beautiful mountain views . But with limited land options , the desires of this population can contribute to sprawl or building homes on mountainsides . <p> " If you think about a typical housing development aimed at active older adult communities , they are usually designed with golf courses and hiking trails , " he said . " Generally , these developments are located on the furthest outreaches of metropolitan areas . " <p> Growing as a city with a large senior population can be a delicate balancing act , Bradley said . For example , ageism might rear its head more in community debates even if seniors ' concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Florida , there 's a lot of tension and push-back against older migrants there , and just the number of older adults in Florida in general , " he said . " I was reading through a story in Sarasota ( about this issue ) and the comments section of the article was brutal . There were plenty of ' send them back ' and ' we do n't need them ' sentiments . They can be an easy target . " <p> As a West Asheville native and a second-home owner for 10 years , Head recognizes the duality of her presence and what the growing population of retirees could mean for her hometown . <p> Though she lives here six months out of the year , she volunteers at Haywood Street Ministries every Wednesday when she is in Asheville . <p> " I ca n't say I feel guilt for being here . I feel blessed and gratitude more than any other emotion , " she said . " This is home . Florida is home , too . I try to give back . I try to be a good neighbor. "

But Democrats , - including Clinton , - also have called for better trade deals while saying the U.S. can not turn its back on what is a global economy without forcing prices up and making businesses less competitive . <p> Obama made note of the millions of jobs created since the depths of the recession and growing incomes for Americans , saying Clinton would continue the trend . <p> " That happens because people in ' 08 decided to choose hope over fear , " Obama said . " But Michigan , all that progress goes down the drain if we do n't win tomorrow .

Mike Pence on Thursday signed into law revisions in the state 's divisive Religious Freedom Restoration Act aimed at removing fears that it would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians . <p> The Indiana House voted 66-30 and the Senate voted 34-16 to OK revisions to the " religious freedom " law . <p> Earlier Thursday , business , civic and sports leaders who have strongly called for a fix to the legislation flanked Indiana Republicans as they announced sexual orientation and gender identity will be explicitly protected in the new law . <p> The business community and civic leaders throughout the state had overwhelmingly opposed the law , which they feared would have allowed discrimination against the lesbian , gay , bisexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative leaders unveiled Thursday morning . <p> Speaking at the press conference were Allison Melangton , who headed planning for the 2012 Super Bowl in Indianapolis ; Jim Morris , vice chairman of the Pacers ; former Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson ; and Chief Executive Scott McCorkle of Salesforce Marketing Cloud . <p> However , Angie 's List ( ANGI ) rejected the compromise , becoming the first major Indiana company to do so . <p> " Our position is that this ' fix ' is insufficient , " said Bill Oesterle , CEO of Angie 's List . " There was no repeal of RFRA and no end to discrimination of homosexuals in Indiana . " <p> The company , with headquarters in Indianapolis , put a planned expansion of its campus on hold after the original law was passed . <p> Indiana 's Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which takes effect July 1 , would prohibit laws that " substantially burden " a person 's freedom of religion unless the government can prove a compelling interest in imposing that burden . VPC <p> Senate President Pro Tem David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will " unequivocably state that Indiana 's ( religious freedom ) law does not and will not be able to discriminate against anyone , anywhere at any time . " <p> The amendment means that for the first time an Indiana law will include the language " sexual orientation " and " gender identity . " <p> The revised law potentially could quell concerns that have made Indiana the focus of national derision for one very intense week . <p> " It was never intended to discriminate against anyone , " Long said . " That perception led to the national protests we 've seen . " <p> Former Indianapolis mayor and Democrat Bart Peterson said the words " gender identity " and " sexual orientation " will appear in state law in context of anti-discrimination for first time . <p> Atterholt , a former state lawmaker himself , did not say whether Pence would sign the compromise measure . He said Pence still needed to review the plan . <p> The deal was hammered out in private between Bosma , Long , Atterholt and a small handful of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Miles , throughout the day Tuesday and Wednesday . However , early discussions about the " fix " began Friday , one day after Pence signed the law in a private ceremony . <p> The measure could put to rest some of the harsher criticisms that Indiana Republicans have suffered through in the past week . But it is unlikely to make either liberal or conservative activists happy . <p> The measure also has the potential to quell some of the damage Pence has endured in the past week , punctuated by David Letterman 's recitation of an entire Top 10 list specifically mocking the first-term governor . <p> Pence received a copy of proposed language Wednesday morning . It was then the subject of negotiations among the Republican leaders , lawmakers and business leaders in private meetings throughout the day . <p> The flurry of activity culminated in a second round of private caucus meetings for Republican House and Senate members at about 5 p.m . ET , where consensus on the new " clarifying " language was reached . <p> The compromise legislation specifies that the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense to discriminate against patrons based on their sexual orientation or gender identity . <p> It goes much further than a " preamble " that was proposed earlier in the week , and , if it stands , would be the first time any protections against discrimination have been extended to gays and lesbians in state law . But it does n't go as far as establishing gays and lesbians as a protected class of citizens statewide or repealing the law outright , both things that Republican leaders have said they could not support . <p> A draft circulated early Wednesday said that the new " religious freedom " law does not authorize a provider " including businesses or individuals " to refuse to offer or provide its services , facilities , goods or public accommodation to any member of the public based on sexual orientation or gender identity , in addition to race , color , religion , ancestry , age , national origin , disability , sex or military service . <p> It exempts churches or other nonprofit religious organizations " including affiliated schools " from the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language was added to include protections in housing and employment . <p> The clarifying language is likely to rile socially conservative advocacy groups , which hold significant sway among Republicans at the Statehouse and pushed hard for the religious freedom law after a failed legislative effort last year to enshrine a same-sex marriage ban in the state constitution . <p> Leaders of three of those groups " the American Family Association of Indiana , the Indiana Family Institute , and Advance America " declined comment or did not return messages from The Star Wednesday . <p> But in an email update to supporters from the AFA 's Micah Clark , he urged them to contact their state senators and to pray for legislators . <p> " At this very moment , the Indiana Senate is considering ' water-down ' language to the recently passed and pro-religious-liberty bill , Religious Freedom Restoration Act , " the email says . " Homosexual activists are demanding Christian business owners in Indiana be forced to compromise their faith . " <p> At the same time , opponents of the law argued the clarification being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , campaign manager for Freedom Indiana , said in a statement Wednesday that the draft bill should include a guarantee that the RFRA " can not be used to undermine any nondiscrimination protections . " <p> The prospect of the clarifying language also failed to prevent the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) from following through Wednesday on its threat of relocating its 6,000-person 2017 convention from Indianapolis because of the new law . <p> Threats from business leaders and financial institutions have caused the most worry at the Statehouse , ultimately spurring Republican leaders to reconsider a measure they never believed authorized discrimination . <p> Earlier in the day Wednesday , the California Endowment , one of the largest health foundations in the nation , sent letters to three Indiana companies " Eli Lilly ( LLY ) , Anthem ( ANTM ) and Berry Plastics Group ( BERY ) " warning of possible sales of their stock if the new Indiana religious freedom law stays on the books unaltered . <p> Statehouse Democrats continued to call for a repeal of the law and full statewide protections against discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night if Democrats , who are vastly outnumbered in the Statehouse , would go along with the compromise or if their votes were needed . <p> Senate Enrolled Act 101 , signed into law by Pence during a private ceremony Thursday , prohibits state or local governments from substantially burdening a person 's ability to exercise their religion " unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least-restrictive means of achieving it . It takes effect July 1 . <p> Although the original law does not mention sexual orientation , opponents feared it could allow business owners to deny services to gays and lesbians for religious reasons . <p> The law has garnered a national barrage of criticism from top business executives , celebrities and civil rights groups who fear the law could allow discrimination and damage the state 's reputation . <p> Conventions have canceled or threatened to move events that bring millions of dollars into the state .

Rick Seaney tackles fact and myth . ( Photo : George Doyle , Getty Images ) <p> For years consumers have suspected that airline and travel agency websites use Internet cookies to their advantage " and to the disadvantage of the customer . How ? When airlines " sense " a shopper is about to book a ticket , they quote higher prices . <p> One proposed antidote would be to delete browser cookies - before , during and after shopping - to erase the crumb trail . That 's a painful task for even the most Internet savvy .

Simultaneously automated inventory systems decide at any given moment which price point to offer a shopper , based on dozens of factors including current and historical bookings . <p> Air travel quoting systems struggle beneath an avalanche of queries each day ( the vast majority of which never result in a booking ) , and these systems use a variety of technology shortcuts like reusing earlier responses or " guesstimating " actual airline inventory . <p> Have your eye on a particular deal ? Bookings for that flight can occur even as you are contemplating your purchase ( especially if it is a really good deal ) . <p> The question is , are these travel sites smart ( or brazen ) enough to target your personal behavior via cookies to jack up rates and pocket the difference ?

@@98275954 @2475954/ <p> A- month ago , California broke its all-time solar record , with nearly 8,800 megawatts of solar power- flooding the state 's main electric- grid on a Friday afternoon . The record stood until the following Wednesday , when more than 9,000 megawatts of solar powered the Golden State , according to the California Independent System Operator , which runs the grid . <p> That record did n't even last 24 hours . <p> With- the costs of solar continuing to fall , and wind still one of the cheapest sources of new electricity around , - California should have no problem hitting its 50 percent clean energy target by 2030 . <p> But getting to 100 percent " - the goal floated by Senate leader Kevin- de Le+n in a bill last month- " - would be more complicated . That 's because solar panels only generate electricity when the sun shines , which does n't always match up with when people use energy . As a result , officials have- increasingly been forced to shut down solar farms- in the middle of the day , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , solar falls- short in the evening . The sun goes down just as- electricity demand goes up , forcing the state to fire up polluting , gas-fired power plants . <p> Introduced by Assemblymember Kevin Mullin , D-San Mateo , the bill would create a " clean peak energy standard " for California utilities . By 2029 , utilities like Southern California Edison , PG&amp;E and SDG&amp;E would be required- to get 40 percent of their energy from clean sources during " peak demand " periods- " the handful of- hours each- day when homes and businesses use the most energy- " on at least 15 days each month . <p> That requirement would encourage the development of battery storage systems , which could soak up excess solar generation during the middle of the day and- release that energy onto the grid- after sundown , reducing the need for gas plants . The bill could also speed the adoption of energy efficiency and conservation programs that reduce electricity use during peak periods . Geothermal power plants , which are more expensive than solar and wind but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , could also be a winner . <p> California 's push for renewable energy has been driven by a desire to limit greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels , which are the primary driver of climate change. - State lawmakers have set an ambitious target of reducing emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 , then 80 percent by 2050 . If California is- going to meet those goals , policymakers need- to think about how clean energy can run the power grid without help from fossil fuels , rather than just mandating higher and higher levels of renewables , said Andrew Zingale , Assemblymember Mullin 's legislative director . <p> " We ca n't just load up on more renewables that are happening at the middle of the day , and just keep loading up on ( gas-fired ) - peaker plants to run at the end of the day , " Zingale said . <h> Is Mullin 's bill the wrong approach ? <p> California having " too much solar " during the middle of the day is far from a crisis at this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and officials are- trying to figure out how to deal with it. - Stephen Berberich , president of the California Independent System Operator , said recently- the grid operator may have to " curtail , " or turn away , as much- 8,000 megawatts of power at times this spring , most of it solar . <p> " We 've been seeing the oversupply increasing faster than our forecast said it was going to increase , " said Steven Greenlee , a spokesperson for the independent system operator . <p> California will need to solve that problem , but some experts say Mullin 's bill is the wrong approach . <p> Among them is Eric Hittinger , a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology , and an expert in the economics of clean energy . If policymakers want to fight climate change , he said , they should mandate reductions in emissions , or increases in renewable energy . Encouraging the development of energy storage , he said , is a strangely indirect way to address climate change , especially when storage is still relatively expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic economic- theory : The government should set the end goal , then let the market figure out the cheapest way to solve the- problem . Incentivizing utilities to pay for energy storage before it 's needed could raise electricity prices unnecessarily , Hittinger said . <p> " The market will correct itself . If the ( over-generation ) problem gets worse " - and it will " - storage will become a natural solution , and people will naturally put storage on the grid , " he said . <p> Arne Olson , a partner at the San Francisco consulting firm Energy + Environmental Economics , made a similar point . As more solar and wind farms are built , and the mismatch between supply and demand grows , - the economic case for battery storage- will improve . <p> " These kinds of questions really come down to economics . If there 's a binding ( renewable energy ) target , or a binding ( greenhouse gas ) target , then you can work out from there what the most cost-effective , optimal way is to meet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to let the market figure it out ' <p> Mullin 's bill- " and a similar measure in the state Senate , introduced by Sen. Nancy Skinner , D-Berkeley- " were inspired by a white paper from- Strategen Consulting , a Berkeley-based clean energy policy firm . While the paper was commissioned by government officials in Arizona , its lessons apply to California , according to Strategen 's Lon Huber , the paper 's lead author . <p> Huber pushed back against the idea that utilities will start buying energy storage the moment it makes economic sense . <p> " I 'm a markets guy more than anything . But the way that California is going , they do n't have time to let the market figure it out and have years of committees and everything , " Huber said . " They 're already experiencing a massive amount of curtailment ( of solar power ) , and every year it gets substantially worse because they have to meet the 50 percent- target by 2030 . " <p> Batteries are- still too expensive for- widespread adoption . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite ready for prime time , said- Sonia Aggarwal , vice president of Energy Innovation , a San Francisco-based policy research group. - Legislative action to encourage batteries could spur further cost reductions , leading to benefits down the road , Aggarwal said . <p> " You 're paying for future possibilities . It 's not like everything needs to pencil out in the very first year , " - she said . <h> More than just batteries <p> The U.S. added a record 221 megawatts of energy storage in 2016 , according to a recent report from the clean-tech consulting firm Greentech Media and the Energy Storage Association , a trade group . A big chunk of that growth was in Southern California . In Los Angeles County , utilities scrambled to bring new storage online to make up for the loss of the Aliso Canyon gas field , which has been shut down since it sprung an enormous leak in late 2015 . In the desert , the Imperial Irrigation District debuted a 30-megawatt lithium-ion- battery , one of the largest such facilities in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy storage industry has a significant presence in the assemblymember 's Silicon Valley district .

Companies are developing creative ways to automate those shifts , so that individual homes and businesses do n't have to think about them . <p> " Batteries are coming down in price extremely quickly , but they 're not the cheapest flexibility resource at the moment , " Aggarwal said . <p> Sammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun .

The association can not make changes in the deal with CSN Chicago , since it already sold control rights to the sports IHSSN . <p> The association is aware of complaints from fans who ca n't access the championships , executive director Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - we hear their voice , " Beste said . <p> Meanwhile , the state girls ' basketball tournament will be aired on IPTV , a network of regional public stations that reach border to border . <p> " It comes down to the two different organizations , " Pella activities director Dale Otte said about the differences in viewing options for girls and boys sports . <h> The deal with CSN Chicago <p> Phil Bedella realized how big the state high school wrestling tournament is when he heard a daily viewership report from an Iowa cable company . <p> It said more Iowans watching one cable network viewed the state wrestling meet than " Dancing with the Stars . " After that , the vice president/general manager of CSN Chicago- was intrigued . <p> The Chicago network has 4.2 million viewers . Though a breakdown of Iowa viewers was- not available , CSN Chicago said it serves most of eastern Iowa . <p> The network made a name for itself with Chicago professional sports coverage . High school sports also became part of the business plan . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , " Bedella said . <p> The IHSSN , a media company started by Krogman and Associates of Urbandale , first purchased a 10-year rights contract from both the boys association and the girls union in 2006 for nearly- $2 million . Several changes would occur in the contract in later years . The union 's contract was terminated in 2013 . <p> In 2014 , a new 10-year boys ' deal was made between the IHSAA and the IHSSN . That contract called for $730,000 , including a $60,000 payment for the first two years and- eventually rising to $80,000 a year , according to Beste . <p> The IHSSN previously worked with through individual Iowa television affiliates to air coverage prior to the CSN Chicago deal . That included stations like KCWI and KDMI and cable provider Mediacom in the central Iowa market for football semifinals and finals . <p> CSN Chicago approached the IHSSN about a year and a half before they signed a contract in 2016 , Bedella said . CSN offered more than 85 hours of Iowa high school sports content in the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ken Krogman , owner and president of the IHSSN , declined multiple requests to speak to the Register for this article . But Beste said the IHSSN sought a way to get the coverage that would provide the most advantages to Iowa viewers . <p> CSN Chicago- has attempted to expand viewing options to its Iowa audience since the fall . It recently added DirecTV Now and Sony PlayStation Vue . The wrestling tournament will offer livestreaming through the IHSSN as well , which includes the state dual team tournament . <p> Livestreaming will include dual tournament coverage as well as first round and quarterfinal matches from the traditional for $9.95 . CSN subscribers can watch the semifinals and finals on CSNChicago.com , which is available through the NBC Sports app . <p> " We 're trying to be more local , " Bedella said . <h> Cable giant not included <p> Mediacom 's Channel 22 is a familiar station for Iowa high school sports . <p> While Channel 22 is n't a moneymaker for the network , it serves to help establish a brand in 309 Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " For more than a decade , we 've had a commitment to Iowa high school sports , " said Phyllis Peters , Mediacom 's director of communications . <p> The network 's aim for programming has become more complicated as rights to cover Iowa high school events are bought and sold . <p> When the IHSSN was formed- and working to negotiate a contract with both of the state 's athletic governing bodies , it outbid Mediacom for the TV rights , Peters said . That contract initially included football , volleyball , girls ' and boys ' basketball , softball , baseball and wrestling . <p> The deal extended to specific postseason events . The IHSSN was able to sell production and simulcast rights to other networks for events for a fee . That cooperation between Mediacom and the IHSSA helped lead to Mediacom 's production teams airing postseason high school tournaments . <p> " It would be nice if we cooperated the way we used to , " Peters said . " We 're hoping for more cooperation .

( Photo : Bryon Houlgrave/The Register ) <p> The picture changed when CSN Chicago bought exclusive access to boys ' basketball , football and wrestling state events from the IHSSN in July . The move placed the Illinois network into competition with Mediacom " - which offers Fox Sports Midwest , not CSN Chicago in some of its coverage- areas " - and other Iowa companies . <p> CSN Chicago has urged Iowa high school sports fans to contact their local cable companies to request the channel . <p> For smaller Iowa cable outfits , making the switch can be easier . <p> Western Iowa Networks , which is based in Carroll and offers more than 200 channels , added CSN Chicago for its subscribers last month in its expanded and supreme bundled packages . About 600 subscribers have access to the new channel . The cable company dropped Minnesota-based Fox Sports North to add the Chicago network , according to Wes Treadway , marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carroll-area viewers a chance to watch state wrestling and boys ' basketball coverage , along with programming of the Chicago Cubs , who won the World Series . <p> The availability of the state wrestling tournament , along with basketball and football , was a driver for the decision . RTC Communications in Readlyn , near Waterloo , also has contracted with CSN Chicago . <p> " It was a huge value to our subscribers , " said Treadway , who is related to a wrestling coach . " We 're excited . We 're excited now that we can offer that . " <p> RTC Communications in Readlyn , near Waterloo , - also has contracted with CSN Chicago . <p> The network has added Iowa college programming to its lineup : Missouri Valley Conference sports , Northern Iowa football and basketball and coaches ' shows for Iowa and Iowa State . <h> One state , two approaches- <p> The Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union is in year one of a three-year contract with IPTV to broadcast championships from four state tournaments " volleyball , basketball , soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than $3.8 million in 2014 , according to its most recently available tax return , does n't get revenue from the deal .

" <p> Underwriters sponsor the production costs . <p> Fans of girls ' tournaments have found a consistent place to turn for coverage in recent years . <p> " It 's just so easy for the girls , with the access , " said Pella 's Holterhaus , who also serves as an assistant girls ' basketball coach for the Class 4A No. 1-ranked squad . <p> Beste said although the boys ' - association does receive TV revenue , the money is n't as important as getting exposure for Iowa boys ' sports . <p> The nonprofit association reported $6.6 million in revenue in 2014 , according to its tax returns . <p> " At the end of the day , it 's really about making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less about the finances . " <p> Beste said the number of complaints the association received about football coverage was " not a major number , " but the statement the organization released last week was in part made to make sure the Iowa high school sports audience knew concerns would be addressed . <p> The IHSAA 's contract is with the IHSSN , not with CSN Chicago , Beste stressed . It has no say in making changes in the three-year contract with CSN Chicago and does n't have an opt-out option . <p> There was a long tradition of IPTV broadcasting the traditional state wrestling finals . IPTV carried the championships for 31 years until 2002 . Like the Union 's current agreement , there was no fee paid by public television . <p> That arrangement ended when the IHSAA was paid a $10,000 annual fee by Thompson Sports of Des Moines for a four-year rights contract . Thompson 's network included six Iowa television stations . <p> Bernie Saggau , then executive director of the association , said in a 2002 Register article about the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Television is to carry things as a service . But if somebody can make some money , they 're no longer a service . Yes , it was a service to the people in the state of Iowa , but it was also a service for us to give it to them free . " <p> Will the upcoming state tournament setup- create complaints ? That's- yet to be determined . <p> Pella 's boys ' basketball team is ranked third in 3A . Western Christian 's squad is No. 1 in 2A . Boyden-Hull is No. 10 in 1A . They may return to state in March , only to create more concerns about how fans can watch the games . <p> " If that happens , it will create people who are disgruntled , " Harmsen said .

Terry Branstad opened a debate Monday over the future of public employees ' pensions in Iowa , although he says he does n't want to create financial hardships for government workers and he recognizes the issue requires substantial study . Aaron Young/The Register <p> Gov . Terry Branstad talks with reporters at the Iowa Capitol on Nov. 28 , 2016 . On his right is Lt. Gov . Kim Reynolds ( Photo : William Petroski/Des Moines Register ) <p> Gov . Terry Branstad- opened- a debate Monday over the future of public employees ' pensions in Iowa , although- he says he- does n't want to create financial hardships for government workers and he recognizes the issue requires substantial study . <p> State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald , a Democrat , immediately responded by sounding an alarm over the- fate - of defined benefit- pensions currently provided by the- Iowa Public Employees ' Retirement System , known as IPERS , which has 350,000 members . He said all of Iowa 's public employees " police officers , school teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled by plans being explored by Republican politicians throughout the country to change public employees ' pension benefits . <p> Some Iowa conservative groups and taxpayers ' organizations have suggested it 's time to shift- away- from IPERS ' defined benefits pension- program " which promises a monthly check of a guaranteed amount . They have suggested replacing it with a defined contribution program , similar to a 401(k) plan , which is- less risky for employers because it does- not promise a specific benefit when a worker retires . An actuarial study last year found that- IPERS had- long-term unfunded liabilities of more than- $5 billion . <p> Branstad pointed out that- many private companies have shifted to a defined contribution pension system in which an- employee decides on a salary contribution level and may receive a company match that is- invested . However , that type of change would be a- significant- step and would require substantial- research and- a transition that wo n't happen in the near future , he said . Benefits of existing public employees under the current system would need to be protected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension benefits for newly hired public employees . <p> " I am open to considering changes , but I want to assure people- that we are not looking at eliminating anyone 's benefits or changing it in a way that would create financial hardship , " Branstad told reporters at his weekly news briefing . " So it is a complex , a difficult issue . A lot of people feel that- the defined benefit system is not sustainable in the long term . But Iowa does have one of the best defined benefit systems under our IPERS ' - program " of any of the states . " <p> Fitzgerald was n't reassured by Branstad 's remarks . " Every public employee in Iowa should be very concerned that there is a Republican mission to do away witih IPERS as a defined benefit plan . That 's coming , " he said . " Pensions should be for the rank and file . They need to be protected . " <p> The problem with defined contribution retirement- plans promoted by Republicans , Fitzgerald said , is that they- place- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with high fees for investments and who likely are not prepared to be choosing stocks and bonds . <p> We- want our second grade English teachers to work on being second grade English teachers . They- do n't - have any skills in managing asset allocation and all those kinds of things . The same with firemen and policemen and- county workers , the guy who is driving the dump truck , " Fitzgerald said . <p> Shifting IPERS from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan has been endorsed by conservative-leaning organizations- that include the Iowa chapter of Americans for Prosperity , Iowans for Tax Relief , and the Public Interest Institute in Mount Pleasant . Any serious consideration of legislation to implement such- changes has been avoided in the past because it would have been- opposed by Iowa Democrats who controlled the Iowa Senate . But with Republicans winning control of the Senate on Nov. 8 while retaining a majority in the House , it 's possible that bills could be- discussed- during the 2017 legislative session to make changes in IPERS . <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LLC- showed that IPERS was- 83.7 percent funded , leaving Iowa taxpayers- on the hook for $5.45 billion in- unfunded liabilities , although that was down from $5.91 billion in 2012 . A new actuarial report is expected to be released this week . <p> Nationally , many public pension funds face huge shortfalls that have created worries among state and local government policy analysts . However , IPERS ' outlook in recent years has- been brighter because of- stock-market gains and changes made by- state policy makers. - In an effort to shore up- the IPERS ' system , the Iowa Legislature in 2010 approved a host of benefit changes , including raising the number of years worked before being vested in the plan from four to seven and basing pension payments on the five highest salary years instead of the three highest years . In addition , early retirees face a greater reduction in benefits . <p> IPERS ' members include current , former and retired employees of state agencies , school districts , cities , counties and other Iowa government agencies. - The contribution rate by public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totals 14.88 percent of an employee 's earnings . Sixty percent of the contributions are funded by government employers and 40 percent by the employees . <p> IPERS had a market value of $28.27 billion for the 12 months that ended- June 30 , state officials said . That included a 2.15 percent investment return , which fell short of an- actuarial assumption- that requires an annualized investment return of 7.5 percent . However , over the past 30 years IPERS has had an annualized investment return of 8.6 percent . <p> Branstad sparked a serious discussion about- public employees ' benefits in Iowa last week by proposing that health- insurance be removed as a topic of collective bargaining from public employees ' union contracts with the state , cities , counties and school districts . He has suggested premiums can be lowered by establishing- one statewide master health insurance program for public employees , avoiding premium spikes that have occurred in some small insurance pools when a few employees have major illnesses or accidents . <p> Drew Klein , state director of the Iowa Chapter of Americans for Prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift from a defined benefit to a defined contribution system for IPERS ' pensions for the past- two years . <p> " For us , it 's one way that we can protect taxpayers. - This is even more important because there seems to be differing opinions on what kind of interest we can expect on those IPERS ' investments , " Klein said . " I also think this would be better for employees as it would improve the flexibility of that retirement account if/when they leave state employment . " <p> Don Racheter , a former Central College political scientist- who is chief operating officer of the Public Interest Institute , describes a defined contribution pension system as a " win-win " for taxpayers who would be less likely to be stuck with huge pension liabilities and for public employees who would have the potential of higher investment returns . He also suggests giving existing public employees the option of staying with existing defined benefit pensions or switching to defined contribution plans . <p> Gretchen Tegeler , president of the Taxpayers Association of Central Iowa , said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system should be carefully studied . However , she concludes- it is essential to place new employees in a different plan structure in order to protect the interests of current members . <p> " Our view is that the sooner the review process begins , the better , " Tegeler said . " Iowa may- still be in a position that it can preserve most or all of what we have for current members , but only if we do not compound the problem by adding new members . - There will come a point when the crowd-out effects of pension funding ( on government budgets ) - will become unacceptable and higher taxes are not an option . Making changes in a crisis atmosphere is never good . " <p> Supporters of IPERS say- the- current pension system can work as long as its members are responsive to problems when the system is n't fully funded. - For example , State Treasurer Fitzgerald said he favors placing a cap on pensions for highly paid state executives to avoid situations where some retirees are raking in pension checks that exeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would balloon " doubling or tripling " if newly hired public employees were n't contributing to defined benefit- pension funds needed to provide monthly checks to retirees . <p> Danny Homan , president of Council 61 of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , said he views IPERS as a sound program that has served Iowans well . He- said a fallacy is being presented that certain changes in public employees ' pensions will somehow eliminate existing funding- liabilities for taxpayers . <p> The liability does n't stop . You can not get rid of the liabiity , " Homan said . " Whatever the- state- does they will have to figure out how they will meet the liabilities , the commitments and the promises of the current system . " <p> The Iowa Policy Project , a liberal-leaning research organization based in Iowa City , issued a report in 2013 that concluded that in Iowa and most other states across the country , public-sector pension funds remain strong and healthy , serving as models of the important role pensions play in assuring retirement security for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings , defined benefit pensions became a foundation of the 20th century retirement system that made possible the middle class and eliminated endemic poverty among the nation 's elderly , the report said . But that system has begun to unravel as many major employers , particularly in the private sector , have eliminated defined benefit pensions , researchers said .

Julian Garrett , R-Indianola , is among 19 Republican senators sponsoring- Senate File 172 , a bill introduced last week that would require all Iowa employers with at least 25 workers to use the federal E-Verify system when hiring workers . <p> That free online system allows businesses to check a potential employee 's eligibility to work in the United States . <p> Garrett said the measure will reward both Iowans legally authorized to work and companies that do n't hire undocumented workers . <p> " If you 're honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who is cutting their cost by hiring cheaper labor , " he said . " Also , if you 're looking for a job , whether you 're an Iowan or a legal immigrant , it 's not fair to have to compete with those here illegally working for substandard wages . " <p> The bill calls for employers to track employee E-Verify results for at least three years . <p> If passed , it would require the Iowa secretary of state to request and publish online- a list of all Iowa employers participating in the program . And it would bar companies from receiving economic incentives unless they participate in E-Verify . <p> Garrett believes targeting the workplaces of the undocumented is the best approach to stemming illegal immigration . <p> " It 's always seemed to me that this is the simplest , most economical way to address the problem , " he said .

" But given what he called anti-immigrant rhetoric from President Donald Trump , plus the president's- promise to crack down on illegal immigration , he is n't surprised by Senate Republicans . <p> " This session is all abut fulfilling the promises on a political landscape set by a new president , " Henry said .

Republic will collect waste six days a week , Wehner said . <p> Republic also will partner with Johnson County Refuse for composting and Darling Restaurant Services to collect- grease and cooking oil . <p> Bird said some restaurants already are composting and more education will be needed before the program- is introduced in the summer . <p> Hart Epstein , a co-owner of Bluebird Diner on Market Street , said the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul the restaurant 's recycling to the city 's recycling center . <p> " I think that this area certainly could use more recycling options , " Epstein said of the north side , adding that he 's interested to see how the plan is implemented and what the recycling bins will look like . <p> As project leaders gear up for added recycling options downtown , Iowa City has rolled out its own curbside composting- service- for residents .

Winnebago is rebuilding itself , expanding its line and doubling down on smaller , sleeker and less expensive RVs that will appeal to younger buyers . <p> " We believe that we are one of the- leaders in the RV industry , " Happe told the Register .

Happe says its easier to recruit top leadership to Minnesota , where the company also does business with legal , advertising and accounting firms . He maintains an office there and in Forest City . <p> " My message to my leadership team has been quite simple : You are expected to be wherever you need to be physically to drive success in the business . And I do n't necessarily want people being stationary for very long anyway , " Happe said . <p> Still , he expects Winnebago 's plants in Forest City , Lake Mills , Charles City and Waverly to play a large role in the company moving forward .

She was returning early to take pictures of the football team for the school newspaper before reporting for a semester-long photography internship in Chicago . <p> Somewhere along the way , the car overheated and Daren added water , checked the engine and they continued on . Tammy spent the night with a friend and left Evanston about midmorning the next day . <p> No one knows for sure what happened next . When Tammy did not call that afternoon , the Zywickis became concerned . JoAnn called the school , Tammy 's friends , the police . Frustrated with the police response , she called a missing person 's group and was told to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman there wrote a story for the next morning 's paper . <p> Grinnell students went into action .

They had offers to stay in people 's homes and never paid for a meal in a restaurant . <p> " Every time we went to pay we were told someone had taken care of it , " she said . <p> " We were keeping hope alive , but were very concerned " <p> Amy Fort , Tammy 's roommate at Grinnell <p> Leads flowed in . About 60 people reported seeing Tammy on the side of the interstate between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on that Sunday afternoon . The hood of her car was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Another described a tractor trailer truck with stripes down the side of the trailer . <p> Nine days later , a man driving on Interstate 44 in rural Missouri , 490 miles from where Tammy was last seen , reported seeing something wrapped in a blanket secured on both ends with duct tape . It was about 14 feet from the edge of the roadway . He had stopped to make sure his tools in the back of his truck were not getting wet from the rain . When he got out , he smelled an odor . <p> It took Tammy 's dental records to verify it was her . She was wearing an Eastside Eagles T-shirt and shorts adorned with a Greenville County Recreation soccer league logo , not the clothes she had on when she left Evanston . She also had on lacy panties and a bra embroidered with the word love , not anything Tammy would have chosen for herself , her mother said . <p> She had been stabbed seven times , six times in a circular pattern around her heart , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost like a pen knife , McCarthy said . She died from internal bleeding . There were few defensive wounds . <p> Eastside High School held a memorial . Grinnell did as well . Tammy 's body was taken back to Pennsylvania for burial near her grandmother and cousin . The funeral was in the Catholic Church where Hank and JoAnn were married . <p> Mrs. Zywicki said it was three days from the time Tammy went missing before the Illinois State Police got serious about the investigation . And when the body was found and the FBI got involved , the two agencies did not seem to share information or communicate on any level . <p> Law enforcement set up roadblocks on the interstates between LaSalle and Joplin , Missouri , to talk to truckers , and announced they were doing so beforehand . They did n't inventory Tammy 's car when it was towed from the interstate and , in fact , an officer asked Mrs. Zywicki what was in it five weeks later . No one knows what happened to her purse , her watch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new Canon camera . <p> Mrs. Zywicki said she 's never been allowed to see the logs of calls , but has heard from people who say they called the police and were never interviewed . She also said the desk officer told her he took Tammy 's picture off the front door of the station because they were getting too many calls . <p> She has spiral binders full of information from police , from callers , from the media . Most of binders are green , Tammy 's favorite color . <p> McCarthy said men from all over the country were looked at as possible suspects , all truckers , from Tampa , Humboldt County in California , Nashville . The list included Lonnie Bierbrodt , who was detained and interviewed two months after Tammy 's body was found . Bierbrodt , then 32 , had served time in prison , nine years for two counts of armed robbery . He had received concurrent 20-year sentences and had been out about a year . <p> He gave hair samples , fingerprints , McCarthy said . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , and authorities did n't know where the crime scene was or even when the murder had taken place . They did n't have the murder weapon . Apparently no one saw whoever left Tammy 's body on the side of the road . <p> Bierbrodt was released and his identity was not made public . <p> In January 1993 , a nurse whose husband was a judge called the State Police for a second time . Her first call was made shortly after Tammy went missing . She had given a description of a man she saw standing with Tammy . In her second call , she said the man she saw had just come into her clinic . She identified him as Bierbrodt , a Missouri man who had family in LaSalle . State police did not follow up on the call , but McCarthy has since he retired . <p> ( Photo : Provided ) <p> He said the nurse is a credible witness . She knows the time she saw Tammy because she had just bought McDonald 's for her children . She clearly saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on vacation from his truck driving job when Tammy went missing , but his wife said he was home with her in Missouri , which is not far from where Tammy 's body was found . Authorities found his green Datsun truck , which had been steam cleaned and sold , McCarthy said . <p> Not long after the call from the nurse the case became the work of a single investigator , who had other cases as well , McCarthy said . He said he does n't know why the task force was disbanded , but it was clear to him he was n't to pursue it . That changed when he retired in July 2001 . He called Mrs. Zywicki and offered to help . <p> " This evidence has never been presented to a grand jury , " he said . <p> Most of what is known publicly about the investigation has come from McCarthy or from Mrs. Zywicki , not in releases from the state police . Tammy 's friends and family believe it would be helpful if information about her missing watch and camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired from Fluor in 1999 , the Zywickis moved to a gated community in Ocala , Florida . They travel frequently , visiting family and enjoying a timeshare that they can use to stay in various cities . One son is a law professor now , another a computer software engineer , the youngest a civil engineer with a Ph.D . So many graduations , weddings and special celebrations without Tammy . So many birthdays . The Zywickis have seven grandchildren now . <p> The Zywickis vowed early on that they would continue to press for justice , but they would not let their loss take over their lives . They have managed to do so , holding together as a family . Mrs. Zywicki believes Tammy 's death has made the sons stronger . <p> They have heard the criticism . She should have had a better car , someone with her . Hank Zywicki has taken that especially hard , his wife said . But a woman who runs a support group counseled him . You ca n't hold onto your children forever . Tammy was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wrong time . <p> That 's something her friends have never been able to get over . It was so random . She was n't doing anything wrong . In many ways it changed the way they look at the world . Tammy 's death and the ensuing publicity made interstate highway travel " once considered a way to bring the nation together " seem dangerous . <p> Julie Estlick , a college friend of Tammy 's , said , " It frightened the hell out of us . " <p> She also said she 's involved in the petition drive to get the state police to release information because the Zywickis deserve to know what happened . Once and for all . <p> The Zywickis ' Ocala home holds many memories of Tammy . A photo of her with her cat rests on her mother 's roll-top desk in the computer room . Mrs. Zywicki said the oddest thing happened with Bob the cat . Uncharacteristically he could not be found on the day Tammy went missing and then reappeared on the day her body was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> JoAnn Zywicki , Tammy 's mother <p> The parents have Tammy 's Garfield bubblegum machine and a soccer ball decanter . When they travel they see things and say , " Tammy would have liked this . " <p> Each year they get out Tammy 's ornaments " the ones of cats and mice and soccer " and put them on the Christmas tree . They take note of who receives the scholarship established in Tammy 's name at Grinnell . <p> Mrs. Zywicki said she is grateful for the support she 's gotten through the years . Not too long ago she received a call from the woman who wrote the first news story about Tammy being missing . The woman has retired and lives nearby . She wrote another story for a paper there . <p> And Mrs. Zywicki is amazed and thankful for the renewed interest in the case .

As the galleries , shops and studios close up for the evening , the war fighters are gathering . <p> Lightning arcs across in the sky in rapid-fire bursts of light and thunder . The first fat drops of rain are already pounding down as dozens of combat veterans file into a rough-around-the-edges , turn-of-the-century warehouse building . <p> A storm is coming , but these vets have weathered far worse . <p> Welcome to Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 1 . Formed in 1899 , predating even the VFW itself , Post 1 is the oldest regular gathering of combat veterans in the country . <p> It was also very nearly one of the VFW 's most recent casualties , part of a nationwide membership bleed-out that top leaders are struggling to staunch . But now , the first VFW post in the country is also in the vanguard of a radical rethinking of the organization " and what local chapters have to offer veterans . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to fighting Nazis in Europe and to beach landings in the Pacific . Others are only a few weeks removed from the ongoing war in Afghanistan . <p> Just about every combat zone in the 70 years in between also is represented " from the big fights in Korea , Vietnam and the Middle East to the smaller skirmishes fought in Panama , Somalia , the Balkans and elsewhere . <p> For most VFW posts , that kind of diversity is unusual . But for Post 1 , that 's not the half of it . <p> " This VFW is ridiculously diverse . It 's what VFW should be , " says Army Reserve veteran Marla Keown , who drove trucks in Iraq . " We 've got super old people , super young people , people of all colors , nations and races , sexual identities . We marched in the Pride Parade last year . What VFW post does that ?

Now teaching at Denver 's Center for Digital Storytelling , he helped start weekly film nights at VFW Post 1 . Jon R. Anderson/Staff 13177 @qwx873177 <p> It 's certainly different . For better or worse , most VFW posts are known for their bars , dubbed canteens by the old-timers . Of the thousands of posts across the country , Post 1 is among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gathering inside the post 's veteran-run art gallery . The whitewashed walls display photos , paintings and other works created mostly by members of the post . <p> One of them is Jim Stevens , a legally blind Vietnam veteran who commands one section of the gallery with his innovative portraits painted across hundreds of fishing-line monofilament threads drawn taut inside a glass case . The holographic-like work recently earned two first-place ribbons at the National Veterans Creative Arts Festival , edging out more than 3,300 other artists . <p> The meeting is about to begin . <p> Petty jealousies <p> Navy veteran and post commander Michael Mitchel is at the podium . After a few informal announcements and introductions , it 's time to get down to business . Mitchel cracks a big gavel twice on the podium and everyone stands . <p> There 's an opening prayer , followed by the pledge of allegiance . <p> Members of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1 in Denver assemble for their June meeting . ( Photo : Jon R. Anderson/Staff ) <p> " Comrades , we are assembled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do not let petty jealousies or trivial personalities influence our deliberation . " <p> Those are the exact words post commanders have used to open VFW meetings for decades . But perhaps nowhere in the organization 's 101-year history have those words been more important to heed . <p> Not all veterans can join . To be eligible , you must have received a campaign medal for overseas service ; served 30 consecutive or 60 non-consecutive days in Korea ; or received hostile fire or imminent danger pay at any point in your military career . <p> Against the back drop of those eligibility restrictions , the organization , to put it simply , is dying . <p> The dwindling twilight of the generation of World War II and Korea veterans makes that literally true . At the same time , there is a self-inflicted wound as those who remain do little to replenish the VFW 's ranks . <p> The reasons vary , depending on who you ask . But atop the list , say some of the VFW 's top leaders , are the kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn against when they open post meetings . <p> The result is indisputable . Over the last two decades , VFW membership has plummeted by nearly half . Despite 14 years of continuous combat spanning the Middle East , Central Asia and Africa " and the more than 2.5 million troops who have deployed into those war zones " total VFW membership has dropped from 2.1 million veterans in 1995 to just 1.3 million now . <p> Meanwhile , in the last 10 years alone , one out of every four VFW posts across the country has been forced to shut down . And many others are on life support , with only a handful of remaining members to keep the lights on . <p> Mitchel , the Post 1 commander , knows all about it . <p> A little more than a year ago , this post was homeless , forced to sell its building because of mounting debt and dwindling membership . Members moved into their new home last June . It 's come a long way but still needs work , as evidenced by the water that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof above . <p> Even so , this post is thriving . <p> With the storm raging outside , it 's standing-room-only inside . <p> And that 's when the lights go out . Literally . <p> If that seems ironic , what happens next is symbolic of just how this post has pulled though . <p> In the sudden darkness , Mitchel does n't miss a beat . <p> VFW Post 1 members continue with their June monthly meeting during a power outage . ( Photo : Jon R. Anderson/Staff ) <p> " We 're going to keep going , gang , " he says , pulling out his cell phone and using its light to read his meeting notes . <p> Within seconds , the hall comes alive with points of light as the group adds to the glow with their own phones . <p> Mitchel announces they 'll soon be getting a new roof with $90,000 worth of donated labor . <p> Familiar themes <p> Ask veterans from the most recent conflicts about the VFW , and some common themes emerge . Many say the VFW all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of younger vets . <p> Dismissive of female veterans . <p> Resistant to changing times . <p> Curtis Bean , who served as an Army scout and sniper through two tours in Iraq , never had the slightest interest in joining the VFW after leaving the military in 2008 . <p> Struggling with post-traumatic stress and seeking a good career fit , Bean says the organization had little to offer . <p> Local posts he 'd seen seemed closed off or worse . <p> Iraq veteran Curtis Bean , who served in the Army from 2003 to 2008 as a sniper with 10th Mountain Division , started the Art of War Project to help veterans channel their creative energies .

They just made everything hard . Who wants to be part of that ? " <p> For Army intelligence analyst Brittany Bartges , who recently graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver , joining the VFW was one of the first things she did when returning from her deployment to Iraq with the 1st Infantry Division . <p> " Even if you do n't know much about VFW , you know VFW , " she says . " To me , it just seemed like a cool thing to be part of . It was like something I 'd earned . " <p> The local post she tried to join , however , did not think much of her . <p> " They took my application and my money and just threw it away . It was a boys ' club , and I had a vagina , so they were n't interested . " <p> John Harry could n't even imagine a VFW that would welcome him . <p> A 10-year Air Force veteran who had deployed downrange more than half a dozen times , Harry left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his entire career in the closet because of the ban on open service by gays . <p> It was not lost on him that top VFW leaders had strongly opposed lifting that ban . <p> " Repeal advocates are focused primarily on pushing a social agenda about individual rights , " said then-VFW National Commander Richard Eubank , a retired Marine and Vietnam veteran , even as the policy was being reversed in 2010 . " National security , unit cohesion and morale are the furthest things from their minds . " <p> Eubanks warned : " This social experiment could spell the end of America 's all-volunteer military . " <p> So instead of the VFW , Harry joined the Colorado chapter of the American Veterans for Equal Rights . <p> Despite those early misgivings , however , all three veterans " Bean , Bartges and Harry " now all hold top leadership positions at Post 1 . <p> What changed their minds ? <p> ' VFW must change ' <p> Even the military satirists at the Duffel Blog have taken note of the VFW 's recruitment and relevancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems are not lost on at least some of the VFW 's top leaders . <p> In November , the current national commander put the entire organization " on notice " in a tersely worded memo to all post members . <p> " I am extremely disturbed by the recurring reports from the field as well as the media 's portrayal of the VFW as an organization that is comprised of old and out of touch veterans who would rather drink in a dimly lit canteen than open their doors to our younger veterans , " wrote John W. Stroud , a retired Air Force first sergeant . <p> " The fact remains that the stereotypical , dingy , dark and smoke-filled VFW Post and canteen do exist , but they have no benefit to our organization , provide no aid to our mission nor to the veterans we strive to help and serve . " <p> Stroud , the first non-Vietnam-era veteran to lead the organization since the leadership mantle was passed from the WWII and Korean War generations , chastised older members for not doing more to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VFW 's ranks . <p> " To do this , our VFW Posts must change their operational tactics to better reflect the modern crises younger veterans are facing on their new ' battlefield ' " the homefront , " he wrote . <p> " For those members and Posts who would rather serve themselves than the countless veterans who are in need , remind them that this organization exists for the benefit of all veterans rather than those of an entitled few . " <p> Petty jealousies and trivial personalities , indeed . <p> Stroud closed his wake-up call by saying he would rather fire any leader or close any post that refuses to get on board . <p> " They simply do n't belong here , " he wrote . <p> It 's no mistake that Post 1 's leaders have been invited to the VFW 's national convention now getting under way in Pittsburgh . The contingent has been asked to lead two workshops on " Revitalizing Posts &amp; Recruiting Younger Members . " <p> VFW Post 1 members and guests take part in free yoga .

A painting of Darth Vader looks on . <p> Sandwiched between a CrossFit box and another art gallery , in some ways Post 1 is a bit of both . And so much more . <p> Yoga classes every Tuesday night are run by one of three hardbody Marine Corps veterans .

Other Fridays are movie nights , projected on the post 's 150-inch pull-down screen . <p> Then there are all the other community and veterans groups that Post 1 partners with and often provides space for . Back at the post 's monthly meeting , for example , a representative from Team Red , White , and Blue is on hand to talk about the fitness-focused veterans program . <p> " I like to describe what we do here as the being the hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's all these spokes that go out that we can connect you to .

@@98276131 @2476131/ <p> Matthew Rooda , a senior at the University of Iowa , describes a new technology SwineTech , and how it helps protect piglets from getting crushed by a sow and how he got the idea for his product .

( Photo : David Scrivner/Iowa City Press-Citizen ) Buy Photo <p> The story of how an Iowa college student came to invent life-saving wearable technology for pigs sounds a bit like an infomercial . <p> Matthew- Rooda- was working in a massive swine-raising operation while going to school and grew increasingly frustrated with how many piglets were being crushed to death by unwitting sows . <p> His frustration boiled over one day when he walked into a- farrowing barn and- found one sow had crushed eight of her newborn piglets . <p> A sow is pictured here wearing a SwineTech prototype . The technology is designed to prevent piglets from being crushed to death by sows by sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being crushed . ( Photo : Contributed photo/Special to the Register ) <p> Crushing is a recurring challenge for pork producers , an oddity of the domesticated species that largely has- baffled researchers . Rooda 's co-workers were largely- resigned to the phenomenon , but the pre-med major was n't satisfied . <p> " I started thinking , ' OK , there 's got to be a better way , ' " Rooda said . <p> So , he created one . <p> The best way to describe Rooda's- invention might be a cross between- a- shock collar for dogs and a fitness tracker for people . Its purpose is to listen for the distressed squeals of piglets in danger of getting squished and send a mild shock to Mom to get her to move . <p> And it has the pork industry and investors- pretty excited . <p> His product , which will roll out to the market in a matter of months , has received backing from- pork producers in Iowa and investors from across the country . Just this month , his company , SwineTech , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City . <p> Rooda 's company will go on to represent the United States at the global showdown in Frankfurt , Germany . SwineTech also has been highlighted as one of Inc. magazine's- 16 Coolest College Startups , which advanced to the Elite 8 round of online voting to determine Inc. ' s Coolest College Startup of 2017 . <p> Rooda says he 's raised more- than- $1 million from 18 investors . And he has dozens- of commitments for orders from pork producers . <p> His success is all the more remarkable given that the 23-year-old built the product , recruited investors and created a company while attending college full-time . <p> He plans on a limited launch within the next three months , with a wider introduction to market at the 2018 World Pork Expo . <p> " There 's a lot of anxiety . You just took money from 18 people , " said Rooda , who graduated in December . " It 's actually more pressure now. - When you start out , there 's nothing to lose . " <h> ' We 're correcting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family farm and- his father manages several commercial sow farms- near his hometown of New Sharon , Ia . But Rooda himself had little hands-on experience until he took a job at a farrowing operation while he attended Hawkeye Community College in Waterloo . <p> At the time , he planned on studying obstetrics . A medical school acceptance committee told him- overseeing swine deliveries would help diversify his application . <p> Since creating his device , he's- met with veterinarians and pork producers to refine the idea . <p> He , along with business partner Abraham Espinoza , invested their own money . Rooda relied on his parents and student loans to get by . Winnings from startup contests and grants helped fuel SwineTech , which was founded in August 2015 . <p> At the University of Iowa , Rooda scheduled classes in the evenings- so he could focus on the company during the daytime . <p> SwineTech 's invention consists of essentially two parts : listening devices and wearable technology placed on the- sow- for four to six days . <p> One device- listens- for high-pitched piglet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged squeals of a piglet in distress . <p> Once the software detects a piglet being crushed , the device sends a vibration to the- sow . It then delivers a shock , about a quarter of the voltage of a dog 's shock collar , and waits five to six seconds before delivering- a second- shock . <p> The sow stands up about- three-quarters of the time , - Rooda's- testing shows . If- she- does n't move , the device sends an alert to the farmer . <p> Early prototypes used a reusable belt strapped around the pig 's midsection , but the newest rendition will be a disposable , anti-bacterial patch . <p> The devices also- help- control temperatures , which are essential for newborn piglets . <p> Early on , - Rooda- said the- sows- were startled by the shocks. - But the pairing of the vibration with the electric impulse has reduced surprise and stress , he said . <p> He said the pain is minimal . <p> " Whenever we use something , we shock ourselves first , " he said . <h> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised piglets die before being weaned , and the most common cause is crushing , said Donald Lay , a research leader at the- U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Research Service at Purdue University . <p> " About half that percentage is due to crushing , " he said . " So when you multiply it out by how many pigs are produced , it 's quite significant . " <p> Iowa , with more than 22 million pigs and hogs- in December 2016 , - is by far the nation 's leading pork producer , which makes anything that can reduce piglet deaths a big deal . <p> Wild boars in Europe do n't crush their young nearly as often as their American domesticated relatives , Lay said . And it 's rare in other animals as well . <p> " It seems like some sows crush a lot of pigs , and other sows do n't crush any , " Lay said . " Some crush four to six piglets in one litter , and their neighbors do n't crush any at all . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to reduce crushing . Sows ca n't turn around , so there 's less opportunity to lay on a piglet who strays from the pack , Lay said . <p> But other than that development , which some question as inhumane , no real solution has emerged . <p> And he worries about how the zaps might affect the behavior of sows , which are already housed in loud and crowded environments . <p> " They could do a lot more irrational movements and actually crush more piglets ; that would be the concern , " he said . " They do n't necessarily know cause and effect all the time . " <h> ' There 's no economic value to a dead piglet ' <p> The loss of piglets from any cause raises- welfare , economic and environmental concerns for producers , said Lee Johnston , a professor of animal science and extension swine specialist at the University of Minnesota . <p> " The farmer feeds a sow for almost four- months to raise that litter in utero , " he said . " And then in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the nutrients and effort that went into raising the corn and all that stuff that went into that fetus- are lost . And there 's no economic value to a dead piglet . " <p> Rooda 's early testing has found his method increases production by .38 piglets per litter. - With a value of $35 per piglet lost , he said the $1,200 device will pay for itself within a year . <p> Each- device can service up to 160 sows per year , Rooda said , depending on how long each sow wears it , saving as many as 61 piglets per year . <p> Farrowing farms are huge operations , with dozens or hundreds of crates in one building , - Johnston said . <p> So SwineTech will have to show a return on investment at an affordable price to convince producers to buy in . <p> " It 's going to have to be pretty effective to save enough pigs to pay for it , " Johnston said . " It becomes as much an economic decision as anything . Producers want to save pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Rooda says he is well aware of the possible criticism from animal rights groups. - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals opposes- anti-barking shock collars and- electric fences for dogs , calling those training methods " cruel " on its website . <p> But- Rooda- argues that the ends justify the means : After all , it 's proven to save the lives of piglets . <p> " We 're correcting a behavior that's- life-threatening , " he said . <p> Editor 's note : A previous version of this story misstated the university where Lee Johnston is- a professor of animal science and an extension swine specialist .

" Just the leadership , the desire to win . I cant tell you who he reminds me of . I have a sense he s going to be a real special addition to this team . Not just because of talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not played in the NCAA tournament , he would love to be an NBA player . He sees there 's a plan here for him to do both . He s excited , were excited . " <p> Simmons had already entered the NBA draft , which was part of his decision to leave Ohio , where he was an All-Mid-American Conference point guard last season . But Simmons also obtained his transfer release from the school to investigate his fifth-year options if the NBA did n't  look promising . <p> So Michigan was competing with his NBA dreams and other schools . <p> As Simmons told the Free Press when he committed to U-M , that first meeting with Beilein sold him as well , feeling comfortable immediately with the coaching staff . He could see his value to the Wolverines and , having watched Walton play last season as a scoring and distributing point guard , Simmons understood the opportunity . <p> " Like so many things you come in and put in the work , my role is to be myself , " Simmons told the Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get my teammates involved and just run the team . They just like the way I run my team , the way I operate at the point guard position , the way I operate in pick-and-roll situations with open space .

" He s going to be a mentor to Xavier and Eli and whoever else in that backcourt . " <p> Picking the player was the easy part once Beilein clicked with Simmons . <p> The more difficult challenge for the coach was getting over his own hesitation about the rule . <p> Beilein does n't  regularly pursue likely one-and-done players for a number of reasons , including the limited time hell have to help develop their game . With a grad transfer , its a certainty the player will leave after one season . <p> As with his evolution in the early-entry NBA departures to remain competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It was very hard for him to leave Ohio University , " Beilein said .

While their departure was Beileins decision , them landing at Big Ten schools - Max Bielfeldt at Indiana and Spike Albrecht at Purdue intensely bothered him . Each playing for the eventual Big Ten champion did n't  make it any smoother . <p> Embracing the reality , Beilein had to overcome a few fears . <p> The first was whether a player from the outside could step in as a leader , essential for the point guard . <p> " Its brand new for us , " Beilein said .

He never had the impact U-M hoped , though , and Walton ended up playing the second-most minutes in the country ( behind teammate Zak Irvin ) . <p> Finding a graduate transfer was a practical , realistic decision by Beilein and his staff .

@@98276170 @2476170/ <h> Iowa GOP bill to reverse raises worries low-income workers <p> As House Republicans push for a bill that would prevent local governments from determining minimum hourly wages , workers in some Iowa counties are expressing bewilderment over the potential loss of raises that have improved their lives . <p> Minimum wage increases have been implemented in Johnson , Linn and Wapello counties , with additional raises scheduled . In Polk , the county with the state 's largest population , a phased-in increase is scheduled to start in April . Legislation likely up for a House vote this week would stop Iowa 's cities and counties from increasing the minimum wage above the state 's $7.25 standard and would override laws already approved . <p> For Cedar Rapids resident Effie McCollom , who works at the seniors organization AARP , the raise was " a little light at the end of the tunnel . " The Linn County minimum wage climbed to $8.25 in January and was set to rise annually until reaching $10.25 in 2019 . <p> " I would lay up and worry at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do I pay my light bill or do I pay my gas bill ? " said McCollom , who also cares for a granddaughter . " This bill would impact my life a whole lot . Not only mine , but everyone else making minimum wage with a family and children . " <p> Republicans who support a statewide wage have noted employers could opt to retain the higher pay , but McCollom said she 's been told her wage will likely drop to $7.25 if the Legislature approves the bill . <p> Johnson County now has the state 's highest minimum wage at $10.10 an hour , and day care worker Ghada Janeel , 29 , said it has made a difference in her life . <p> Janeel , an Iowa City resident who works while attending Kirkwood Community College , said she used her extra pay to buy a computer so she could do homework without traveling to the library each night . <p> " When I had $7.25 , I never dreamed of buying a computer , " she said . " But I was saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer , finally . But now , I may need to sell the computer to make ends meet . " <p> Justin LeDuc , 28 , said the pay raise has enabled him to put aside a little money from his job working nights at a disability care center in Iowa City . The savings will be helpful next year when he returns to the University of Iowa to seek a master 's degree in social work , he said . <p> " It gave me the opportunity to save , " LeDuc said . " A lot of people who work minimum wage jobs do n't have that opportunity when it 's $7.25 because they live paycheck to paycheck . " <p> Gov . Terry Branstad last week supported " a modest increase " to the state minimum wage , but House Speaker Linda Upmeyer said earlier this month in a taping of the public television show Iowa Press that Republicans were focused on a single statewide minimum are n't were not interested in raising the wage . <p> " I do n't hear members wanting to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think what we need to keep in mind is that businesses can pay , employers can pay , anyone can pay more than what is minimum wage . " <p> Rep. Jake Highfill , a Johnston Republican who introduced the legislation , did not return calls or emails about the bill . <p> Officials in Polk County estimate 25,000 workers would benefit from the county 's wage increase to $10.75 by 2019 . In Linn County , officials said 14,000 low-wage workers would benefit . <p> Misty Rebik , co-founder of the Iowa City-based Center for Worker Justice of Eastern Iowa , said she saw middle-aged employees who had worked for several years at fast food restaurants receive their first pay raises after the county decisions . For some low-income parents , she said , it meant no longer deciding between buying diapers or food for their children . <p> " It was an incredible difference for them in their lives , " said Rebik , whose group advocates for worker rights and affordable housing . " You had working class parents working two minimum wage jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bill they were n't going to pay that month . That is the reality for workers . " <p> The cost of living varies across Iowa , Rebik said , making it vital that local governments can respond to their community 's needs . <p> Karen Kubby , the co-owner of an Iowa City bead supply and jewelry repair shop Beadology Iowa , said she was initially worried about the wage increase but found the change was " actually fairly inconsequential . " Whatever happens , she does n't plan to return to the lower wage but thinks some businesses would cut worker pay . <p> " In the business world , the bottom line reigns , " she said . <p> McCollom said she hopes legislators will try to understand what the pay cut would mean to her and others . <p> " I hope they think really hard about that decision because it would really , really impact a lot of lives , especially the kids , " McCollom said .
