His spirit lives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drumming available to everyone alive . <p> We will miss you . Rest in peace , Remo <h> Remo D. Belli Obituary : <p> What Xerox is to copying machines and Kleenex is to tissue , Remo is to drumheads : a trademark that has become virtually synonymous with an entire product category . Remo Belli , the man behind the product , did more than anyone else to introduce the world to synthetic drumheads . With his passing , the industry has lost one of the few individuals deserving of the much-overused phrase " icon " . Not only did he revolutionize a product , he built a world-class company and spent an entire career promoting the benefits of drumming with an unmatched zeal . <p> While the origins of rock n roll remain the subject of debate , it 's safe to say the genre would never have gotten as far as it did without Remo 's synthetic head . Previously , drumheads were laboriously made by wrapping calfskin around a wooden hoop . As rock ' n ' roll gained traction in the early 1960s , driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply unable to keep up . Remo 's Mylar solution , dubbed the " Weather King " because it was impervious to climate , saved the day , providing drum makers with enough heads to fill their growing order books . <p> The story behind Remo and his drumhead is a classic entrepreneurial tale . Born in Mishawaka , Indiana , Remo developed his interest in drums at an early age , watching his uncle 's polka band at the local Italian Club . His father urged him to take up the accordion , but he was determined to play drums . Remo , who often said the market for musical instruments was made up of " compulsive " musicians who had no choice but to play and " impulsive " musicians had only a passing interest , placed himself squarely in the " compulsive " category . <p> By the time he entered high school , World War II had broken out and all the local drummers had been drafted . As one of the few drummers left in Northern Indiana , he soon had more gigs than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he enlisted in the Navy at 18 , he was immediately assigned to the Navy band . <p> After receiving his discharge , he moved to Los Angeles and began his career as a professional drummer . Starting in saloons , he quickly graduated to touring with singers Anita O'Day , Betty Hutton , and a host of other notables . When he was off the road , he was a first-call studio drummer . <p> Although Los Angeles had five drum shops at the time , Remo did n't think any of them were serving the market properly . In 1950 , with $2,300 borrowed from his parents , he rented a small space on Santa Monica Boulevard and opened Drum City . It quickly became a destination for top West Coast drummers . <p> Drum manufacturers began actively courting Remo , not just because Drum City was a growing customer , but because his proximity to leading players gave him unique insights into the market . On a visit to the Slingerland Drum Company in Chicago , owner Bud Slingerland asked for his opinion about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary new plastic film . Remo was impressed with the material , but immediately realized that a new technique was needed to attach it to the rim ; tacks just did n't work . <p> Upon returning to Los Angeles , Remo 's accountant put him in contact with a chemist named Sam Muchnick , who devised an innovative solution : punching holes around the edge of the Mylar head and using a fast-setting liquid resin to bond it to a u-shaped aluminum hoop . The unique bonding system was patented in 1957 , and Remo immediately began head production in a 500-square-foot space adjacent to Drum City . <p> As with any new invention , Remo 's synthetic head initially drew criticism from purists who argued that it " was n't the same as calfskin . " He responded by marshaling an all-star list of endorsers including Louie Bellson , Buddy Rich , and Gene Krupa to vouch for the musical quality of Mylar heads . As demand for drumkits soared , manufacturers and retailers enthusiastically embraced the new head , and by the time the Beatles made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the undisputed head of choice . <p> In the early 1980s , Remo developed a " Pre-Tuned " head , which involved tensioning Mylar film on a hoop without the use of any hardware . This invention led to the development of a broad line of world percussion instruments . It also dovetailed with Remo 's personal interest in drumming as a tool for enhancing human well-being . He explained , " Drums can be used by anyone for relaxation and enjoyment . They can be used for helping people with Autism or Alzheimer 's , or for someone just showing up at a recreation center on a Tuesday night having a ball . " With his wife Ami , an MD practicing alternative medicine , he partnered with neurologists and education experts to develop wellness-based programs using rhythm . <p> Remo committed himself and his company to providing drummers , the world over with quality products and programs while striving to expand the acceptance of rhythm and in particular drumming as an integral component of an individuals wellbeing . Through his ongoing efforts , the professional , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those faced with both emotional and physical challenges have been brought to the joy of drumming . <p> Remo Belli made the world a better place by giving drummers better tools , by pioneering the concept of music as a means of enhancing health , and by creating a valuable enterprise that employs hundreds . His name , emblazoned on millions of drumheads worldwide , is a fitting and perpetual epitaph .

He moved around with his family numerous times but has spent most his life living in various places in Utah . At age 15 Branden felt a desire to start playing drums to take after his father who passed away when Branden was only 11yrs old . After a few drum lessons Branden lost interest in a practice pad and sheet music . At 16 Branden got his first drum set and began learning by ear and started his first band . Branden loved to play everything from punk rock , hardcore , funk and ska in his early bands . Drums were a good escape for Branden from an abusive home and friends who were diving heavily into drugs and alcohol . Branden has maintained a 100% sober and drug free lifestyle throughout his entire life and career . At 17 Branden dropped out of high school and began to pursue music . <p> After years of homelessness , several bands and living in the small , unknown local scene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 Branden started a band he named The Used which consisted of old friends/bandmates from the Utah music scene .

His debut album reached Gold record status in the US and Canada . The next four years Branden released 2 live DVDs and another studio album which all achieved Gold record status as well in the US , Canada , Japan and Australia . <p> Branden was not like his other band mates . He spent his free time producing bands in his own studio called Unknown Studios , doing studio drum work and hired drum gigs for various artists such as Milla Jovovich , Perfect Circle , Johnette Napolitano , Secondhand Serenade and Mercy Killers ( to name a few ) , and started a skateboard company called Twenty Twenty Skateboards . <p> Brandens favorite music was always punk . He found music late in life through art when his sister would have him draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She always suggested he listen to the bands while he worked on them . From that and among friends Branden discovered The Clash , Social Distortion , Nine Inch Nails and Red Hot Chili Peppers . Which still rank among favorites of his .

Bands like Nirvana , Rage Against The Machine , Green Day and Rancid soon became favorites of Brandens and the source of where he learned to play drums . Branden always appreciated music that pushed the boundaries and drumming that took a more " song writer " approach . <p> After being kicked out of his band Branden was receiving great support and advice from good friends and incredible artists .

Branden went home with a sense of optimism and the flame of ambition burning brightly once again . <p> 2 weeks later Tim Armstrong called Branden to inform him Rancid drummer Brett Reed had quit Rancid . Rancid was scheduled for a sold out UK tour less than a week later . Tim asked if Branden would do the tour . " I was given 25 songs to learn in 3 days " says Branden , " My stomach was a mess " . The day after Halloween Branden flew to LA to rehearse with Rancid . The band played 3 songs and knew there was something special there . After a couple more songs the band took a break .

It was madness " remembers Branden . <p> Branden has toured heavily since joining Rancid in 2006 and they have just finished a brand new album set to release summer 2009 . Rancid will be doing a 2 month North American arena tour with Rise Against this summer . In his off time Branden is still producing bands of all genres out of Unknown Studios and enjoys soccer , boating , 4 wheeling and skateboarding with friends while home .

At first it was difficult to even maintain eye contact . Knowing words could never communicate what each of us felt that day , we slowly began drumming together . The sadness we shared was overwhelming at first , as tears dampened our hands and instruments . Yet as we drummed , renewed support for each other and a collective sense of hope for a better tomorrow gradually replaced our despair .

" That 's where my style came from , so I really owe a lot to my teacher for turning me onto stick control .

Jordison joined multiple bands throughout his high school years , which led to him being invited to join Slipknot , at age 20 . Jordison immediately embraced the idea and quickly became involved in all aspects of the band . Jordison 's dedication to music led to performances and work with many other bands over his career , including Metallica , Korn , Ministry , Satyricon , System of a Down , Roadrunner United and 3 Inches of Blood .

Whether it is world music , hip-hop , R&amp;B , or rock , drumming is the force that stirs emotion and creates magic . With that said , it is the responsibility of the drummer to produce a musical sensation that determines the direction . This is a task that world-renown percussionist Sivamani has embraced with all his might . <p> Born in India , Sivamani is the son of a musician , Mr. Anandan , who surprisingly enough , did not initially wish for his child to follow in his footsteps . " When I was 7 or 8 years old , my father refused to give me a drum kit , " says Sivamani , " that was a big disappointment that eventually became a challenge .

As Sivamani 's career flourished , he composed scores for movies in India , a popular way of getting one 's music heard on a larger level . For 30 years , Sivamani was devoted to the art of adding an instrumental component ot the silver screen . All the while , he performed his solo pieces during various concerts and was well received by the people of India . As Sivamani 's notoriety grew , he began doing his own concerts all over the world . <p> Having performed in Singapore , London , South Africa and New York , Sivamani has helped to spread the rhythm of India as well as other countries as he integrates drumming from Africa , Japan and India into his show .

With The Fuse - an amazing , incendiary album from its first snare drum crack to its last molten guitar line - the legendary Hermosa Beach foursome plays with more tenacity and vigor than ever . <p> " We made a conscious effort to just go in and plug in and play and not over-analyze things as much as we have in the past , " frontman Jim Lindberg says of the band 's eighth studio set . " We made The Fuse in half the time of the last record and having that mindset going into it made us put more energy into our performances and gave the album more immediacy . " <p> Shooting off one sonic fireball after another , The Fuse - recorded with longtime co-conspirator Darian Rundall - just may be the best-sounding Pennywise record yet . From the scorching opening anthem , " Knocked Down " - which serves as a forum for the blistering riffs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry state of affairs in world politics - to the electrical shocker " Closer " and beyond , these Warped Tour icons come out swinging and do n't relent . If the latter is an urgent blast that chronicles the frustration elicited out of the daily struggles we all face in the search for happiness , it 's also an ideal platform for the thumping , fat-bottomed wares of bassist Randy Bradbury and drummer Byron McMackin . <p> Machine gun guitars ignite the furious " Yell Out , " a neck breaking , old school assault of the highest order that gives way to an equally inspired , full-throttle hardcore opus , " Competition Song . " Emphasizing Lindberg 's presence as one of modern day punk 's most distinct , forceful voices , The Fuse jolts punk aficionados like a surging KV line . <p> " Loud , hard and fast - it 's what we 're comfortable playing and we know that 's what people expect from us , " Lindberg says matter-of-factly . " With each record we just try and add subtle changes to the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to keep up with the latest trends in music . I think the real challenge is to stay true to who you are and keep things interesting . We try and keep the songs and message timely and engaging within the style of music we 've always played , and hopefully add to what we 've already accomplished . " <p> With the determination to bring their game year after year , the members of Pennywise have made a career out of not merely embracing punk rock but playing it as if their lives depended on it . Although Lindberg will tell you there 's no big secret to outlasting a myriad of other groups to become one of the biggest sellers and most beloved acts on the Epitaph roster . <p> " It 's incredibly hard to get four guys to agree on where to go for dinner let alone agree on the million issues surrounding putting out a record , going on tour and how the band is presented , " the Pennywise singer admits . " We 've always made sure we did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have made more money if we toured nine months out of the year , but that 's not what we 're in it for and then we probably would n't still be around .

" <p> Formed in 1988 by Lindberg , Dragge , McMackin and original bassist Jason Thirsk , Pennywise aligned with Epitaph Records in time for their heralded , eponymous 1991 disc . In defiance of grunge , the disc helped to define the then-emerging West Coast punk movement . Astoundingly , 1993 's Unknown Road sold a few hundred thousand copies and - rather typically - at the height of the punk resurgence of 1994 the major labels came calling . But the four-piece elected to stay put and released another Epitaph smash with 95 's About Time . When the tragic death of Thirsk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , they rallied and regrouped with new bassist Randy Bradbury for Full Circle . <p> The popularity of Pennywise continued to swell as the 20th Century ended , first with the success of 1999 's Straight Ahead , followed by the riotous 2000 concert disc Live at the Key Club and the group 's highly praised 2001 disc Land of the Free ? An ensuing tour was highlighted by a sell-out gig at the 14,000-seat Long Beach Arena and while Jim , Fletcher , Byron and Randy took a year off for introspection , the group reemerged stronger than ever in 2003 as evidenced by the glowing accolades From The Ashes received . In early 2005 , as Epitaph reissued remastered , content enhanced versions of the group 's first four albums , the band reconvened to craft what would ultimately become The Fuse . <p> According to Lindberg , much of the impetus for the lyrical direction of the new album came from recent headlines . " When we 're writing it 's all about trying to keep the energy and passion for what we 're doing alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he explains . " For me that means writing about things I feel strongly about . All I have to do is read the newspaper or watch the news every day and I get a never ending supply of subject matter . " <p> From the urban blight and unending cycle of violence that plagues our inner cities ( " 6th Avenue Nightmare " ) to our cell phone-mad existence ( " Disconnect " ) , and on to the tyrannical , power-drunk leaders in the world ( " Premeditated Murder " ) Pennywise emerges as apropos as ever on The Fuse . And perhaps most significant of all is the revulsion conveyed via " Fox TV . " <p> " That song came about just from watching shows like " Hannity and Colmes " and the documentary , " Outfoxed , " says Lindberg .

Not only is it terrible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to write a song about it before I went Elvis on my television .

He co-founded the Roots , universally hailed as one of the most sonically inventive hip-hop acts . Meanwhile , his collaborations with such artists as D'Angelo , Erykah Badu , and Common have reasserted the importance of real-time playing in a style dominated by sampling and programming . <p> " I 'm really into the game of making people guess , is it a machine , or is it him ? " says Thompson , who also goes by the name ? uestlove ( pronounced " Questlove " ) . One famous example is the Roots ' biggest hit , " You Got Me , " which sounds for all the world like a programmed side stick pattern " until Thompson cuts loose with a blazing drum-and-bass groove . Like much of Thompson 's work , the passage is startling , witty , and funky . <p> " Hip-hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Thompson . " With Roots stuff , I go for a more perfect , quantized-type sound than I would with , say , Erykah or D'Angelo . For D'Angelo 's Voodoo , we wanted to play as perfectly as we could , but then deliberately insert the little glitch that makes it sound messed up . The idea was to sound disciplined , but with a total human feel . " <p> For Thompson , " human feel " is bred in the bone . His father was the leader of the ' 50s doo-wop group Lee Andrews and the Hearts , and Ahmir literally grew up onstage . " My whole family was involved playing the oldies circuit with groups like the Coasters , the Drifters , the Chiffons , " he says . " I was playing percussion at gigs from the age of seven because my parents did n't believe in babysitters .

HealthRHYTHMS for Alzheimer 's Patients <p> By : Walker Wright <p> I have been facilitating the HealthRHYTHMS protocol for more than three years . Through my program , Rejoicing Rhythms , I have had the privilege of working with different populations including children , special needs groups , at risk youth and seniors . Having worked in the Senior Care industry for the last eight years , my initial plan was to start facilitating drum sessions with senior care facilities . Since my HealthRHYTHMS training in 2006 , my senior care clients have consisted of assisted livings , independent living centers , memory care units , nursing homes , senior centers and adult day care facilities . Each location has a different feel , but what a joy to work with the senior population ! <p> My first two Rejoicing Rhythms clients in 2006 were adult day care facilities in the Birmingham area and believe it or not , I continue to work with these locations on a monthly basis . Amazing ! These locations provide a safe haven primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the centers range from mild to severe Alzheimer 's . Concerning the latter , some of the drum circle participants can not verbally communicate . Interestingly enough , they are able to express themselves through the percussion instruments . Sometimes it can be a correlation of two instruments . I have seen Alzheimer 's patients utilize a shaker to keep the beat on a frame drum . Wonderful Creativity ! All in all , I stand amazed in working with all my friends at these locations . <p> It has been a wonderful growth process in facilitating the HealthRHYTHMS protocol for Alzheimer 's patients . I have learned beautiful lessons and insight over the years by bringing programs to our community . I have realized that the HealthRHYTHMS session truly begins as I get out of my vehicle and load in the drums . At one location , the participants wait patiently , wave excitedly and watch me through the facility windows as I arrive ! What an honor and a privilege to be with these folks . The introduction time of our session can be such fun as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " what in the world has been going on since I last saw you ! ? " My goal is to create a safe zone where people realize that NO mistakes can be made . I make every effort to eliminate stress and intimidation from the drum circle setting . Amazing things can happen when people are set free to create and express . I associate soft music with stretching and breathing . I also use " body rhythms " by tapping our feet to the pulse of the music . The good ole ' lap slap , snapping of the fingers and clapping to music of the participants ' era is terrific . Big Band music and traditional gospel are always hits , as well as rhythm based music , such as Christine Stevens ' " Drum ! Reviving Rhythms . " Intuit your group and have fun with it ! I really like utilizing the " shaker share " exercise as an ice breaker to help everybody continue to warm up and feel comfortable creating rhythms with shakers , bells , claves , and other small percussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel comfortable before incorporating larger drums , such as tubanos , djembes , frame drums , and ashikos . Another wonderful ice breaker for the group can be passing the Ocean Drum around the circle . This instrument is quite profound and produces a great sense of peace and rest within the circle . I also have a fun relaxing time with the ABCs of the drums . I consistently remind them in a light hearted way that you ca n't make a mistake . Big smiles and being animated as I show the folks how to use a mallet on the drum sets a joyful tone for the group and encourages them to follow suit . I also encourage creativity by playing the side of the drum with a mallet or using the shakers to keep the beat through the session . <p> Flowing through the program leads us to Rhythmic Naming . For some Alzheimer 's patients , they can not recall their own name and may not be able to speak . I don ? t want to set a tone of discouragement , so I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names they would recall such as mine " Walker Wright " or " Frank Sinatra " . I have even used the facility director 's name , a nurse 's name or the mail man 's name . This adaptation sets a tone of success and empowerment for the group . <p> Entrainment Building extends nicely as we proceed through the session . I have seen groups create their own " pulse " without me even striking my drum . It is powerful to see how groups can synchronize with a rhythm and keep the groove going . Changing the groove 's dynamics has proven to be very positive as we continue through entrainment exercises . I have people volunteer to start the pulse for the group and that is a wonderful thing to behold . With inspirational beats and guided imagery , I keep things very simplified for the group . Often times I ask each group member if they would like to share a " happy " rhythm with the rest of the group . I also like having participants play out positive words such as " sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With guided imagery , I communicate a story that the circle can relate to and will conjure up peaceful thoughts . Using the theme of being a train heading down the tracks to the next stop or a warm , pleasant trip through the forest can be a very positive and relaxing time for the group . Soft music , relaxation and celebration are the focus as we naturally progress to the finale , a time to reflect and enjoy our sense of community . I consistently stand amazed as I see the impact that HealthRHYTHMS has for Alzheimer 's patients . <p> Over the last four years of working with Alzheimer 's patients , I have taken in many incredible moments . I recently watched a lady in a moment of such happiness reach down and embrace a Bahia Bass Drum . She was smiling ear to ear as tears of joy fell down her cheeks . I have seen Alzheimer 's patients dance to the rhythm of the circle , as well as help each other create rhythms on a drum . One memory will always be special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and excitement on that morning . The next person to enter the room was a gentleman who was about to participate in his fifth session . He walked with such confidence and dignity . This time it was different , he carried with him an instrument case . The first session he did not participate . The second session he tapped his foot . The third session he took a shaker . The fourth session he took a frame drum and kept the beat . This time he sat down and pulled out a beautiful banjo and proceeded to play a wonderful blue grass tune . The circle accompanied him with shakers and bells . The metaphor of community and acceptance rang true . For me , I just got out of the way and let the group teach me . God has blessed me richly by allowing me to share HealthRHYTHMS with Alzheimer 's patients. -

" The album is one of rock 's most anticipated of the year , with Alternative Praise hailing All Time Low on the cover of their " Most Anticipated Music of 2011 " issue .

" Stress is really a component of every disease , " says James Rosenbaum , MD . Take a look at the adverse health effects of chronic stress : <p> Cardiovascular illnesses . Chronic stress has been shown to increase the heart rate and blood pressure , making the heart work harder to produce the blood flow needed for bodily functions . Long-term elevations in blood pressure , also seen with essential hypertension ( high blood pressure not related to stress ) , are harmful and can lead to myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) , heart failure , abnormal heart rhythms , and stroke .

( Arthritis Today , 2005 ) <p> Diabetes . Obesity is a leading cause of diabetes , but the chemical imbalances caused by stress , regardless of obesity , can also trigger type 2 diabetes development . Researchers at the University of Washington , Seattle , found that increased levels of fear , lack of control and depression raise levels of glucose and insulin , each of which are danger signs for diabetes . <p> Drug Abuse .

( Stein , R. , 2004 ) <p> Depression . Recent estimates suggest that loss of a loved-one , and the physical/emotional changes associated with aging result in depression , a condition that is severely underestimated and present in about 65% of the elderly in our society .

There was no doubt in my mind that rhythm-based music activities and drum circles would be a far more engaging activity than any of the programming that currently existed there. - <p> Like many such facilities , especially here in rural western Colorado , the for-profit home had no funds available for such programming .

Next thing I knew , the non-profit , tax-exempt regional facility for the developmentally delayed called requesting a program at their center .

Due to the nature of each individual 's illness , it is best to know the clients before trying interventions such as HealthRHYTHMS and have the ability to trouble shoot any issues that may arise in the process. - <p> In standard group therapy the clients struggle to interact with one another , some preferring not to even sit in a circle . As a clinician I struggle to keep the clients focused in " reality " . The groups are run under the guide lines of Medicare and a Physician is present to document each client 's contribution .

We took time to explore the sounds they make and how they felt . The Shaker-Pass itself turned out very differently . Group after group , despite my best efforts to get the clients to increase the tempo , everyone proceeded with caution , not even allowing me to drop apples . Some clients would not pass their shaker till they received the next one . In one group a client took it upon herself to include the Doctor in the Shaker-Pass by passing her apple to the Doctor who was sitting right outside of the circle . By the end no one was laughing . The clients instead expressed a sense of satisfaction about not dropping any of the apples and we went on to process what loss meant to them. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before group started , came in with his fist raised and was escorted to his room .

" a client who fixates on Abraham Maslow 's theory started off by intellectually describing self-actualization and achieving a state of " one hand clapping .

The only suggestions I used was : the warmth of the sun , feel of the sand on their feet , and the sound of the ocean and wind . The Doctor I work with even took a place within the circle and I handed him a thunder tube to play . The clients loved it . Most all the clients commented on feeling calmer after the exercise .

@@24480125 @4480125/ 39083 @qwx239083 <h> Tommy Aldridge <p> This business is a most peculiar one . To have sustained myself ( albeit sometimes marginally ! ) exclusively thus far with it is nothing short of miraculous . I do n't fool myself into thinking that I am God 's gift to drumming nothing could be farther from the truth . I know guys that can play circles around me that just have n't had the same opportunities and you may never hear of them . This is unfortunate but it 's reality . I say this as a reminder of how very blessed we as working drummers are . This whole concept of impact for money ' is a bit whacko for starters . I certainly had no idea as a small boy that it would develop into anything . I just thought it fun , and still do . I suppose I 've just never grown out of it though I think my mom still secretly thinks there 's a chance . After being inspired as a young boy by hearing Joe Morello 's solo in Take Five ' by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should imagine sticks , practice pad and the book of rudiments . I was fortunate , though did n't think so at the time that I did n't have a full kit to begin on . I think that as young kids we all want to be drummers because of the GEAR . We think , hey , I can do that ! ! ! ( I know a few pros that still say it and believe it ) . We see the massive kits with all the cool shiny bits . Who would n't be attracted , right ? We sit down behind it all and start flailing ! We flail and we flail , then the flailing gets tiresome and if we 're one of the lucky ones , start to realize that there 's more . It 's also at this point that we realize there just might be some work involved . Like anything of substance , it 's gon na take some time . You 've got ta play tennis for quite sometime before you become proficient at it . I mean it 's homerun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the ball in play . Drumming is no different . Learning the language ( rudiments ) of drums is tough and oftentimes tedious . Independence , though easier for some than others , can be a real struggle . Some of my very first lessons in patience were learned behind the old practice pad . The practice pad , given time , ALWAYS separates the drummers from the wanna-bes . While grafting away at the rudiments I started piece-mealing a kit together . It was a slow process but again , the lesson of working toward something another blessing in disguise . Please do n't think for an instant that any of this was carefully planned . Such was not the case . It just seemed a natural progression so I defer any credit . I , with the help of my amazing mom procured a kick drum , snare , hat and ride cymbal . I worked with these for several months before adding to the kit . It gave me time to learn slowly without being overwhelmed with more gear than I knew what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention or the kit would have grown bigger sooner . To this day some of the most amazing players I have heard have been on small , minimalist kits . It 's kinda like racing a bicycle it 's not the bike but the motor . I am self-taught . I do n't say this boastfully as it was n't out of choice . In hindsight , I should have done the drum corps thing but thought I was too cool . Could n't get on with the silly hats but I paid later and still do . There was n't a teacher locally that I thought was up to the task . There I go thinking again . I 'll explain as we go along . I learned , essentially by listening to records Beatles , Hendrix , Cream and later on Zep . I often get the form question who were my influences ' and I must say that , truthfully , I do n't really play like anyone I listened to when I was coming up . I do n't think I was influenced by any as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass very early on . Not because of any particular drummer but because I heard parts in my tiny little noggin that I just could n't execute with one . Not to take anything away from Bonham ( thank God he only played one ) or any single bass drummer but there 's really no way you can play on one what can be played with two ( or w/a double pedal ) . It 's simply an obvious matter of physics . If you could then sticks would come one ( 1 ) to the bag , right ? Any drummer that discounts the value of two bass drums ( or two sticks ) is doing himself a great disservice . I started out playing in little clubs , at frat parties and the like . You know all the places you hated . I was playing in a bar in south FL when I received a call from an old friend , Dave Smith who was a sound guy who had just started working for an up and coming band that was looking for a drummer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gig . I knew some of the other drummers there and I also know that there were more accomplished drummers present than yours truly . Just luck , chance , circumstance ? God only knows I toured worldwide and constantly with that band . I was not at all crazy about that music but it was a means to an end . I was trying to establish a name for myself . This all worked out quite well until I decided it was time to move on . I was about to learn my first lesson in the so-called Big Time ' music biz . I wo n't go into all the ridiculous details but suffice it to say that it took about a year to unencumber myself legally . I had never experienced anything like that . My experience had always been that if you did n't want to be in a particular situation or did n't want to work with so and so , no prob . See ya do n't let the door hitcha where the good Lord splitcha . Once all the legal machinations were finalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to move on . I did n't know it at the time but God was just prepping me for the life ahead . I began a several year stint with Pat Travers , which was a real blast . We were essentially starting from scratch but the music was perfect drum music and he and Mars Cowling were cool . The trio format was interesting in theory . Some of my favorite bands , Hendrix , Cream , had been 3-piece . We learned early on however that Pats ' music did n't quite lend itself to the format and Pat Thrall was added . Pat 's an amazing guy and an equally amazing guitarist . He filled things out nicely . We did a few records/tours and had a really great time . I meet so many people today that compliment the band and the music . We made some mistakes but I think it was , for the most part , time well spent . After leaving Travers I moved to England for a time . I had always liked London and wanted to try working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old agent friend of mine and he offer his place . His kindness helped me through this period of transition . I started working with Gary Moore at this time . We did a couple albums and a short tour . I enjoyed working with Gary immensely . He is an amazing guitarist with a great work ethic . It was during these rehearsals that Ozzy and Randy came down . After meeting Randy and hearing him play I was anxious to work with him though my commitments would n't allow this until later . We went out that night in London and got to know one another . He was one of the most courteous people I 've had the privilege of knowing . I miss his playing terribly but miss him even more as a friend . It was n't until I returned to America that I got the call from Ozzy about working together . Well , the call was actually from Sharon who had just become his manager . This call started one of the most adventurous periods of my career . As I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Madman ' : o ) Working with Randy has been the highlight of my career . His playing inspired the best of whoever was in the band . He made us all better musicians . The funny thing is was that he had no idea . He was so humble , almost self-effacing . When I told him for the first time how great of a pleasure it was to be working with him he became actually embarrassed , red-faced . This was Randy . He had no idea just how very cool he was . We had quite an exciting run and I do n't have enough time here to go into detail maybe someday . Suffice it to say that after Randy 's death the fire was gone . I tried as best I could to help Ozzy/Sharon with the daunting task of finding a replacement for Randy but how do you replace the irreplaceable ? It was around this time that Rudy Sarzo and I started toying with taking a shot at putting something together . He had just finished up with Quiet Riot and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers in L.A. After a few months of this our enthusiasm started to wane . There seems to be a large pool of journeyman ' musicians whose lot in life seems to be applying at auditions . We seem to keep seeing and hearing the same guys . We even resorted to flying people in . We were becoming more discouraged with every passing day . We did manage to come across Tony MacAlpine and did a couple records with him but it ended up being a project not the band that we were hoping to build . During this time I was hanging out with John Sykes . He and Dave Coverdale were in town looking for a rhythm section and Rudy and I were looking for a guitarist and singer . I actually met with them to discuss possibilities but they had decided on a bass player and at that point were only interested in my services . I can not say it was n't temping but Rudy and I had a commitment and I am nothing if not loyal . I suppose I made the right decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been a real blast to have played on the ' 87 record . Not that I could have done a better job than Ansley Dunbar , mind you . His drumming is stellar on that record and seriously question that it could be improved upon . I speak mostly to the opportunity missed . Sometimes you get the bear sometimes the bear gets you : o ) I must say that my years with WhiteSnake have been the most exciting . Every show was sold out . We were getting so much exposure on MTV that we sometimes felt what it must be like to be a film star . I had experienced fan appreciation before but this was at a different level . It was a privilege and blessing to be part of it . I am thankful for the preceding years as they prepared me for all the silliness that was part and parcel to this success . Though we had a good run , nothing lasts forever and it was time again to move on . It was n't long after the last WhiteSnake tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had been thinking about for some time . Necessity has a way of bringing things to fruition . I played on a couple of records during this period but have never had the motivation nor vocabulary to do the session thing . I was kinda torn . I felt I wanted to try freelance but was reticent to give up the security of the band concept . It was a leap of faith though I did n't realize it at the time . I have been working on a freelance basis to this day . I sometimes miss the camaraderie and the equal billing ' a band association affords but in life we must take the good with the bad . Anyhoo I 'd be just miserable if I did n't have something to be miserable about : o ) Though only a brief summary of my career it brings us up to the here and now . You are not going to hear me complain too loudly . The business has , for the most part , been very kind to me . I 've enjoyed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is notorious for cutting them short . Even elite athletes usually experience longer careers than musicians in my genre . I feel so very blessed by God to be , among many other things , healthy and busier than ever . I feel a debt of gratitude to you , the fans . Without you guys I 'd still be sitting around somewhere trying to figure what the heck to do with my life : o ) Would I recommend a career in drumming ? For me it has been the vehicle by which I have traveled the world , met a host of incredible , amazingly talented people , and has gratified me in more ways than anyone could ever deserve . I thank God daily for His provision in my life without Him the Son I am nothing . I appreciate your years of support and continued interest .

This breakthrough book examines the use of hand drums in treating at-risk adolescents , stressed-out employees , Vietnam veterans , Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , Multiple Sclerosis , and more. - <p> Following are excerpts from my book : - <p> The hand drum has been used for thousands of years in celebrations , rituals and ceremonies . However , the merging of science with the healing qualities of the hand drum is a relatively new development. - <p> Psychological and Physiological Applications- <p> Some of the psychological applications in which hand drums are being used include assisting veterans to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pent-up anger and negative emotions of " at-risk " adolescents , and promoting health in corporate executives through releasing their day-to-day stress , in addition to many other applications. - <p> In the medical field , the hand drum is being used to help Alzheimer 's patients improve their short-term memory and increase social interaction and to help autistic children increase their attention spans . In some cases , it is not necessarily the hand drum that provides positive changes in an individual , but a rhythmic device such as a metronome or an audiotape which plays specific rhythms . Such tools are being used to aid Parkinson 's patients and stroke victims to regain the control of movement or increase their gaits. - <p> As a drum facilitator and psychotherapist , I have personally witnessed the power of the drum to relax the tense , energize the tired , and heal the emotionally wounded . I have also observed the hand drum 's extraordinary and consistent ability to create states of euphoria , induce light trance , promote play , release anger and promote feelings of community and unity. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work that is available we can realize that the application of rhythm and its ability to heal the body , mind and soul is boundless . Yet much more research is necessary to confirm what many have experienced and studied already-that rhythm in relationship to the body and mind has many benefits-an idea that our society is just beginning to grasp. - <p> In this century , when we seem to be moving farther and farther away from ourselves and our deeper needs , the drum , through its simplicity , effortlessness and naturalism , offers us a link back to that which we knew before technology separated us from our soul. - <p> Through providing a channel back to our deeper nature , the drum concurrently provides those who use it with a link to others . The drum seems to have the capacity to unite all individuals who choose to experience it together . Despite race , religion , color , creed , background , or ideology , all are joined together through this ancient instrument 's calling . The drum , therefore , becomes a vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to an experience of wholeness and community. - <p> Alzheimer 's Disease- <p> As our life spans becomes longer and longer , mental problems such as Alzheimer 's disease and dementia become more common . Many people with these diseases eventually require institutional care . Nursing homes are required to provide activities for residents which enhance the quality of their lives . Playing drums has been found to be the ideal activity for people with diminished physical and mental capacities. - <p> Researchers have found that because rhythm is so intrinsic to our nature , Alzheimer 's patients , even in the latter stages of the disease , can copy simple rhythms played on a drum . This form of interaction takes on great significance when all other forms of communication have been diminished . Drumming seems to focus Alzheimer 's patients for a short time , and they seem momentarily coherent . These interludes , however brief , are priceless to loved ones. - <p> Drumming and Stress Management- <p> Stress is basically a disconnection from the earth , a forgetting of the breath ... It believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Natalie Goldberg- <p> How does the drum help to relieve stress ? There are numerous ways this occurs . When people drum , they are generally having fun . It is difficult to be in a playful mode and be stressed at the same time . Also , as described previously , the drum has the capacity to release negative feelings-of which stress is clearly one . When one hits the drum , he or she is placed squarely in the here and now . Some of our stress is created from past or future thoughts of fear , worry , or regret , but it is very difficult to be stressed and be in the present moment. - <p> In a recent interview , Dr. Barry Quinn , a licensed clinical psychologist , described his results of working with drumming to increase the Alpha brainwaves of his hypervigilant ( highly stressed ) patients. - <p> " What I 've found in my clinical work over the past 11 years is that as least 20% of the population does not have Alpha brainwaves . Alpha waves occur when the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainwave pattern . Most individuals should be producing this brainwave pattern when they close their eyes and relax their mind . In a thirty minute ideal Transcendental Meditation the brain spends approximately 20 minutes in an Alpha state and 10 minutes in the deeper Theta ( 4-8 cps ) mental state. - <p> " There are benefits associated with Alpha waves , such as the ability to relax and keep the mind on idle when it is not focusing on a specific task . Alpha is associated with a general feeling of well-being and euphoria . Individuals who have very high amplitude of Alpha brainwaves have been found to be able to experience more " lucid dreams . " People with lower than normal amounts of Alpha or no Alpha have much more mental stress than other people. - <p> " There is also a category of people who do n't have any Alpha waves and also have low amplitude brainwave activity across all bands . I see this in about 30-40% of the patients I treat . Neurologically , we refer to these people as hypervigilent . The definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her mental activity for any length of time . They must always be thinking or focusing on something . They tend not to be able to let go of emotional issues but rather obsess relentlessly about them . Many with this brain pattern become alcoholics and highly addicted in a way that makes stopping drinking very difficult for them . It 's very hard for them to relax and unwind . Therefore , they generally have a lot of sleep disorders as well . Anything that would increase their Alpha waves would be very beneficial to them. - <p> " In pain patients , the amount of Alpha brainwaves a patient has is also an indicator of how well the patient is managing his or her pain . If patients are not managing their pain well , or are over-focused on it , they will lose Alpha waves . On the other hand , if a pain patient is having a good day , the Alpha will go back up. - <p> " Until recently , I had never found anything that increased Alpha waves in people that needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking specifically of the hypervigilant population . I tried biofeedback , but it tends only to enhance the theta waves of relaxation and did n't really affect Alpha much at all . I even had some hypervigilant patients who were transcendental meditators , a group which typically has a higher amplitude of Alpha than the general population , but these hypervigilent meditators had low to non-existent Alpha. - <p> " It was suggested to me that I do some research with drums and Alpha waves . What first came to my mind were my hypervigilant patients . Not expecting anything really , I went ahead and took four or five people and did an experiment wherein I got an Alpha wave baseline from them , which was , of course , typically low ( below 10 MV ) and had them drum for half an hour . The instructions I gave them were to drum a soft slow heartbeat type of rhythm . Not everyone followed the instructions . A couple did some emotional expressive drumming , and one or two might have had too much pain or felt pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that 50% of the ones I tested got a normal Alpha wave pattern after thirty minutes of drumming , which means that their Alpha waves doubled . They went from 10 microvolts average to 20 microvolts just in the course of one drumming session. - <p> " One of the participants was a friend of mine . I had done 15 neurofeedback sessions with him and gotten him into theta waves but had never been able to get any Alpha waves from him . The drumming was the first and only thing that allowed him to produce Alpha waves . I was quite impressed . I was also impressed by the fact that the Alpha waves occurred in these hypervigilant , high stressed people after only 20-30 minutes . It was n't after five sessions . It was immediately after the first drumming session .

@@24480155 @4480155/ 39083 @qwx239083 <h> resource <h> The Elements of Music Briefly Defined <p> Our emotional reactions to a musical composition are often related to the structure of a melody . Everyone has his or her own personal story . Everyone can relate to a melody in his or her own way . A good melody is one which brings you new insights with every listening . A great melody will create new fears while holding your older fears at bay . Your health can be impacted by melodies in profound ways. - <p> Harmony adds new dimensions to the experience of a melody . Simply stated , harmonies are the joining together of two or more pitches to create sound at the same time . Sing one note , have a friend sing another , and you have harmony . Harmony does not have to be sonorous . That is , if your friend misses the pitch when singing her intended note , there is still harmony . It may not be correct or dulcet , but it still has harmony . Some may argue that harmony need be affable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to further amplify musical ideas. - <p> In the use of music for health , it is not important to know the theory of music , so much as to be aware that there is an order of things . Later , in this chapter , we provide an activity that will ask you to begin to assemble a collection of music for your listening . This activity will ask you to create your own order of things by dividing your music into categories . The idea of one musical thought set against another will prove critical to our development of new imagery and sound shapes. - <p> The speed at which these musical thoughts progress is referred to as the tempo . We instinctively seek out music of varying tempi for different uses in our lives . Composers have used contrasting tempi to bring forth different melodic , harmonic , and thematic ideas . The use of tempo as an arbiter of the emotional content is quite popular. - <p> For instance , contemporary electronic dance music is very regular in tempo . Often an entire composition will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Producers of this genre of music are aware that any music , no matter how devoid of harmonic or melodic content , will excite people to dance if the rhythm and tempo are regular enough . Often , dance music will consist of a regular quarter note pulse in the 123 to 129 beat per minute tempo range . The music has few twists and turns and the emotional content of lyrics are generally primal and visceral in nature . This music becomes at once both predictable and motivating. - <p> There is an element of safety in this predictability . Partially , because there is little intellectual stimulation in the content of the music to tax the listener . There is a strong motivational factor in this type of music . It appears that the repetition can help invoke an altered state of consciousness that in turn envelopes the listener . Evidence of this is found in dancers who are able to focus on continued , long periods of dancing with a pronounced focus on the physical elements of the music. - <p> Frequently , the inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of music . This is true with all genres of music . At times , there is a complementary relationship between words and music . This relationship is at its apex when poetry aspires to musical qualities , and when music strives to be poetic . Lyrics can be the added dimension of poetry to a musical setting . The words contained in the lyrics can elevate the experience of music to a new level of beauty and understanding . Yet , within your own listening experience , you may have encountered times when words alter or obscure the meaning of the music. - <p> You can learn to develop a new awareness of all the elements found in music . As you progress through the activities provided in this book , you will have ample opportunity to increase your ability to listen to music . Your enhanced awareness can include images , phrases , and meditation techniques to enhance the music you have chosen to incorporate into your own daily plan of music listening . Our concern is to find musical experiences with words that inspire unification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each listener. - <p> When all of these elements are combined appropriately , there can be a true experience of pleasure . This awakened sensation of pleasure can be the primary goal of many music listeners . After all , music offers the opportunity for many rich and unique pleasurable experiences . Frequently , we describe these experiences as part of an overall unified experience . The pleasures encountered in a unified musical experience are by far the most arduous of all the musical experiences to define . This unified experience is often an intangible that is beyond definition. - <p> It is intangible because we each rely on our own personal sense of aesthetics and taste when we are experiencing a work of art . The experience of pleasure in a work of music is unique for each of us . We all have different definitions of pleasure . Still , we can take solace in the company of those who share our preferences . It is through these shared experiences that we find common ground . This common ground allows us to understand why certain music leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer at a sporting event. - <p> Within this seemingly intangible world is a viable source of explanation of our common experiences . We can look to our shared experiences when we try to explain why we are frightened at a horror movie or why we danced the way we did at a wedding . There are few , if any , scientific explanations of our shared reactions to our common experiences . Words and science can both fail to explain the beauty we share in this world . Music , on the other hand , provides both the experience and the explanation . Music is not a science in the traditional sense of the word .

While it 's common knowledge that music had been one of the central healing strategies of antiquity , traditional medicine seems almost devoid of sound-- healing sound that is .

Initial attempts to orchestrate recreational music making via the previously tried and proven HealthRHYTHMS drumming protocol went no where to say the least. - <p> It was obvious that no attempt should be made to do the wellness exercise with guided imagery . One would have been more inclined to tether wild horses for a pre-school trail ride . Even rhythmic naming was a challenge . It seemed they spoke another language . Some mumbled , some changed their name mid-sentence , as if revealing their true identity would cause an electric shock . Others refused to look upe their presence seemed to disappear into the floor. - <p> Though the expression of their rhythms on the drums was a cacophony of total frustration laced with obvious anger ; even more concerning was the display of apathy and withdrawal by several participants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sense of hopelessness I knew what was not working but had no real sense of what would ultimately impact their lives. - <p> Thus it all begins if one can only " see " beyond their hopeless expression with a heart sight that is genuine , the process of recreational music making ( RMM ) begins to work its magic. - <p> What were the life stories that had produced these individuals who were unable to trust , to reach out , or even to allow themselves to relax and laugh ? Life 's battles create scars that mutate without warning or explanation . Yet the intrinsic essence of that which lies beneath their battered surface remains unchanged . The language that penetrates and peels the layers of resistance can only be an expressed caring . The ever present need to be recognized as valuable , and the desire to re-discover one 's inner beauty and worth are the innate truths that ultimately afford re-creation. - <p> RMM bridges barriers and births introspection which ultimately builds connection . However , if the facilitator expects to witness immediately measurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the offering and the intent that ultimately matter . It may be as simple as showing up . Yet even showing up can be complicated. - <p> The facilitator does " show up " after spending many moments of concentrated reflection focused on the caveats , characteristics , dynamics and personalities that characterize the challenging group . This investment of genuine commitment is the most essential component of the offering. - <p> Empathy , described by Webster as " identification with and understanding of another 's feelings , situation and motives " opens the door to an experience that affords the potential to make a difference . When empathy is present , it reveals itself through one who chooses to care . True caring coupled with the understanding that each journey is unique , and each journeyman is not only precious but has within their being a special gift is the foundation for enabling positive changes to evolve . RMM is a tool that creates opportunities for genuine self-disclosure that lead to transcendence. - <p> Application of these principles is not always easy . The changes that occurred with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group on more than one occasion , I re-played scenarios and retrospectively imagined handling some situations differently . I made it top priority to actually apologize at a subsequent session if warranted . At least twice , I began the session by stating , " I owe XXX an apology . He made an excellent point last week , and I really was n't tuned in at the time . I now understand what he was saying . " It is impossible to ask the group to be forthright and honest without demonstrating that you will honestly acknowledge an oversight or a mistake. - <p> Several times when responses to Inspirational Beats were lacking , I reiterated that I 'd not ask them to do something I would n't do myself . Then I shared a personal trial . I 've found this to be an extraordinarily effective way not only to demonstrate intention , but to level the field . Under no uncertain terms could I ever allow myself to forget that each person in this group has been deserted , neglected , labeled and abused . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened my heart embraced it as a treasure. - <p> The first of the barriers was finally breached . When one captures even the briefest eye exchange , an opportunity surfaces to see beyond the facade . Following eye contact , sensing when an appropriate gentle touch of the hand or shoulder would be fitting is a next significant step . When they are ready to accept it , a touch speaks volumes. - <p> Frankly I was never fully cognizant of the changes in the moment . They were so subtle that an observer would likely not even notice . However , a time came when a very troubled defiant girl announced , " I know what I can change , it is my attitude . " That statement was uttered during the third session . Later the director of the program shared the nature of some of the challenges the counselors were facing with her . They noted that the short time devoted to RMM accomplished more than 40 hours of one-on-one counseling. - <p> Another participant immediately comes to mind . One of the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawing , to becoming openly defiant throughout the first 3 sessions . A few participants mentioned a song he had recently written . When asked to share it with the group , he could not be coaxed into doing so . By the 4th session , he felt comfortable enough to sing it for the group. - <p> His song surprised all of us . Rather than reflecting utter desolation , failure and despair , his words expressed a dream of the basic elements of life that most of us take for granted . In reality it was n't a song his verse was the breaking of a shell that had not been penetrated before . Filled with hope and expectation that life for him would one day improve , his song resounded in each of us as a tribute to one ? s first realization of true potential. - <p> It was also during the third session that I personally felt comfortable enough to share a song of affirmation with the group . It was one that celebrated inner beauty and worth . Two young women immediately responded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they actually requested to sing it together , and thereafter reported to have sung it daily. - <p> The last session coincided with many participants anticipating a home visit for the holiday . That day the group was no less than exuberant with energetic drumming . For the first time during Inspirational Beats they were able to express appropriate and rational concerns interspersed with anxiety associated with the anticipation of returning home. - <p> The song-writer again shared his song . Hearing it for the second time , I could n't contain my own tears . As a group , our eyes mergede it was a moment of true connection . In just six short weeks , this rag-tag group had evolved from angry , disengaged , apathetic and defiant teens to a supportive empathetic team that could genuinely share deep-seated emotions while demonstrating a needed sense of caring for each other. - <p> During the sixth and last scheduled session , the young man who had two weeks earlier pounded an angry " gun shot " on his drum jumped to his feet and declared , " GROUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Within each of us , beyond struggling , fortresses , competition , hurt , anger , distrust and malevolence , common ground set the stage for true connectione at least in the moment. - <p> Six weeks passed , and I continued to reflect on all of our sessions . I will really never know the true impact of this program on each of their lives , nor do I ever expect to fully understand the personal transformations that never would have occurred without these collective experiences . Yet somehow I wanted to learn moree there was so much more to discover on many levels . I feared that the momentum we had achieved would gradually dissipate into oblivion. - <p> As an update , I 'd like to share that the pilot group had been extended beyond the original six sessions . This week a new and highly significant door opened for the first time . Our first Inspirational Beats question was : " How does it feel to be out of control of your own life ? " - <p> Their frank responses took us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice and pain . We came face to face with a myriad of trials and tribulations , and allowed each person to reveal themselves without judgment . A broken teen recounted a searing court sentence , and drummed a painful dis-empowering emotional response . All participants listened intently and responded with similar stories . Several asked , " Did you cry ? " A quiet participant sitting next to me murmured , " Of course , we ALL cried . " - <p> If that had not been enough to jar each of us , there was no way I could have predicted the responses to the second question : " What one thing can I take control of in order to make my life better today ? " - <p> " I can begin to control my angry reactions . " - <p> " I must learn to control my thoughts . " - <p> " I need to begin by caring about myself . " - <p> " I need to learn better behaviors.

" - <p> Staring at the floor , a fifteen year old uttered , " I have to control my lying . " - <p> As a facilitator , I truly can not analyze what took place in the hearts of each person this week . Yet it was their genuine heart-felt responses coupled with amazing trust and spontaneity that I will always remember . The unraveling of each person 's saga was n't nearly as relevant as the fact that in their own way , they achieved the courage to face their windmills , and were now prepared to move onward. - <p> Reflecting upon what I have learned as a facilitator , it 's apparent that the anticipation of a group 's transformation seems somewhat like waiting for a long cold bitter winter to end .

Harr MSN , MS , RN <p> Rarely do we notice our smelling , for it largely takes place at a subconscious level UNTIL we are offended or assaulted by stench ! This most primitive , yet highly refined sense , is tied to both our memories and our emotions . Because of this , we can draw experiences we 've already had back into memory through smells , and we can likewise structure the eventuality of experiences we desire or anticipate , through smells ! It is in this powerful capacity for evoking something remembered , or intentionally and pleasantly stimulating something anticipated or needed , that the beauty and the unique functionality of the Aroma Drum lies ? <p> Let 's think together for a moment . . .

Once there , not only will odors cause the brain to differentiate and identify the smells ( think of the many and varied smells of Thanksgiving dinner ) , but it will also partner with the memory of the time the smell was perceived ! This latter capability is linked to the limbic brain , sometimes referred to as the " emotional brain " or " smell brain " .

Coming from a musical family where everyone played an instrument , it was noticed as soon as pots , pans , Tupperware and wooden stir spoons were missing and tore up at the l age of 6 . Soon taking lessons from a local drum instructor Greg Tooley , Sean learned all the basics . Reading basic notation and rudiments to simple rock grooves and focus on timekeeping was the agenda . After working the local circuit in various rock and pop cover bands , Sean made the leap to Nashville where he would be the small fish in a big pond of great musicians and drummers . Sean honed in on his craft in downtown Nashville bars and made a name for himself over the course of three years during which he had worked his way into doing many demo recordings for various hit songwriters such as Hilary Lindsey , Dallas Davidson and many more . <p> This is where Sean would meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early stages of Luke 's career and even made it into a couple early videos such as " we rode in trucks " and " all my friends say " .

Although it never made the big time , Sean shared the stage nightly with acts such as saliva , non point , dark new day and hinder to name a few . After vulpine , Sean found himself back in the country world after auditioning for artist Justin Moore . Sean would spend the next 5 years with Justin during which he toured relentlessly sharing big stages with big name acts such as brooks and Dunn , Kenny Chesney , Jason Aldean , Sarah Evans , Blake Shelton , Miranda Lambert , ZZ Top , and Lynyrd Skynyrd . <p> Sean would make the best move of his life after this with pop country sensation Florida Georgia Line .

She 's my confidante and friend - an anchor in every storm , a gentle counselor during any time of personal unsettledness for me . Over the years , I 've begun more and more to see her in me - traits , characteristics , mannerisms and even the sound of our laughter ! This realization , denied in my younger years , brings me uncommon comfort , and in fact , delights me now . For whom better to be like than one 's beautiful and vibrant Mother ? - <p> I remember back a number of years ago experiencing an a-ha moment , while vacuuming my bedroom ! I caught a quick glimpse of myself in the dresser mirror and thought I was seeing Mom ! My heartbeat accelerated , and I stopped to take a closer look . The way my hands gripped the handle of the vacuum , the way I stood and carried my head on my shoulders , even the scrutinizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very etchings of her were , indeed , manifest in me ? - <p> I wrote a simple poem that day entitled Hands . It spoke of the hands that first touched me at birth , the hands that bathed and fed me pincher-finger perfect cheerios and milk ; the hands that taught me patty cake , patty cake Baker 's man ; the hands that crafted cut-out dolls and ornaments , finger-painted with me and taught me to tie my shoelaces . Her hands held me on her knees while reading books to me across time . Her hands folded over mine in prayer by my bedside at night and pushed the hair out of my face each morning for my wake-up kiss . Precious hands - my Mother 's hands. - <p> This past spring , I had the pleasure of purchasing a set of HealthRhythms drums for my niece , who is a music teacher and therapist . Our problem became how to get the drums to my niece , as she lives hundreds of miles from me in the deep South , and I had purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a road trip - to go the distance and deliver rhythmic blue wonder potential right to her doorstep . An advantage of this road trip would be the opportunity to visit with my Mother. - <p> And so , we planned my visit . I had only one requirement , and that was to have a drum circle WITH my niece in her community , and to invite all of our family members , living in the south , to attend ! My niece agreed and became excited about the prospects of drumming with family and friends ! An added benefit unfolded when my son and his wife realized that they would be vacationing at the same time and could plan to be at the family drum circle as well ! Needless to say , my heart was filled with anticipation ! My family would FINALLY get to experience the unifying rhythms of our hearts in a way not known to them before ! - <p> The road trip was relatively uneventful , save for the beauty of the spectacular Shenandoah Valley and the occasional jingle of tambourines or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way through mountain passes and across long stretches of interstate highways . Each time I stopped , I checked the drums to make sure they were secure and not scratching or gouging one another . While I did n't pay any significant attention to it at the time , I realize now that I had respect for the instruments I was hauling . Deeper within me , I had respect for the plans for the forth-coming family drum circle . Deepest within , I carried unspoken dreams for my niece 's work in the world with the musical children and teenagers that had been entrusted to her to teach . . . - <p> Arriving at my destination , the family was , as they always are , warm and welcoming . But something beyond me attracted them this time . Eyes were riveted on the beautiful , blue HealthRhythms drums in the back of the van . I knew the moment I opened the rear doors , noise would begin , and hands would start dancing across the drum heads . Noise ALWAYS begins around drums , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awe . I knew right then , I had to become the story-teller. - <p> Okay , guys . Before I open this door , let me tell you about HealthRhythms drumming . It 's powerful . It 's healing . It 's plain old fun ! I want you to know that drumming can open your heart wider than you meant to open it ; it can reach into your personal bucket of tears and splash you with awareness ; it can bring jiggy-wid-it rhythms out of your very soul ! Drumming will affect you , but it 's all good ! There 's nothing weird about drumming OR the drums . Here 's the thing , though - I want you to have respect for the drums , if for no other reason right now , than that I do - honor them for me , until you have your own respect . They will tell your story without words , once you allow your hands to communicate that story through them . Are we ready to unload them ? - <p> The once anxious-to-unload group stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly when we 're together . It 's more like a merry festival surrounded in a stereophonic cacophony of sound and laughter . One person over-speaks another in excitement to share all that has transpired in the in-between spaces of our lives . I thought for a moment that I had scared them off from drumming and was about to reformulate my words of invitation when my niece spoke , ever so sincerely : - <p> Aunt Bonnie , thank you for bringing the drums all this way to me for the kids . I want you to lead the family group , ok ? It 's right that you lead it . I looked at my niece 's face , and taking her in , I realized how very much she looked like my Mom , too - like me ! While we are not the same people , there 's no denying the genetic etchings on our faces , in our mannerisms and in the embellished expressiveness of our hands .

And we were about the business of taking the entire drum set into my brothers family room that had been rearranged a bit for the drum circle later in the afternoon. - <p> I was told that friends from the Church and the neighborhood had also been invited to this gathering . My brother talked about how excited and interested everyone was - Most of them are genuinely interested , Sis ; a few are skeptical but do n't want to miss it ! You know how that is ! I was about to ask him if he was skeptical when a different scene caught my eye . Mom was seated at a drum . . . - <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tumbled through me and over me watching her there . Her hands , now aged , were tapping out her rhythm - gently , as though she were caressing the drum skin . Her dimpled smile was relaxed and other-worldly . Her family ring sparkled on her left hand . She was not hurried or self-conscious . She was not attempting to bring attention to herself or her drumming . She was within and without , remembering or visioning , it seemed. - <p> As realization of Mother 's drumming swept across each of us , it did n't take long for the room to quiet . Mom remained largely in the serene place , unaffected by either our noise or our quietude . At one point , she stopped the soft flutter-drumming and pounded the heel of her fist into the drum head - a comparative forceful blow for her . I wondered what thought had inspired that singular , powerful thrust . I intuitively sensed that she needed no protection , however for she was clearly on a journey through the landscape of her own life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok ? my son whispered to me . I nodded yes. - <p> We moved slowly in the other room to begin to put dinner on the table . Mother continued to drum . She was n't in a trance ; nor was she detached . She was simply drumming . I watched her on and off . It was n't a show or ploy for attention . Mom was and is clear of mind and spirit . She had simply discovered how the drum speaks . When she was finished with her story , she looked at her watch and heard the sound of dishes in the kitchen . She jumped up and said , I like drumming , Miss Bonnie ! ( the latter being a pet name she has called me for years ) . I nodded . Mom was placing silverware at each place setting and commented on the tinkling forks. - <p> After dinner , once dishes were cleared away , we all clock-watched until the appointed time for the drum circle to begin . As friends and neighbors began to arrive , I could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle and our intent . I will confess here , that it was impressive simply to experience the beauty of the drums in place , in an invitational home environment .

Oh pick a drum or one of the instruments over here&amp; get one that calls your name ! Go ahead ! You 're going to love this ! Oh Jenny , if your hands hurt take one of these " pongers " ! I laughed . Mother had renamed the mallets , already. - <p> While I facilitated a drum circle , the Matriarch , my Mom , led the way . Mother drummed that day with delightful presence and wooing energy . I noticed as the circle went on that she had more and more arm involvement . Soon after , she was rhythmically swaying her upper body . She asked about the strap on the smaller djembes . She decided she needed to try that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did . . . - <p> Every once in a great while , we get a picture of ourselves , in a glance at another .

I gazed across the room at my niece and saw it reflected again - the heritage of living and drumming , three generations ' worth ! - <p> This grand woman , to whom my own heartbeat was once attuned in the womb , continues the rhythms of her life graciously , powerfully and with purpose . The day Mother drummed is not lost on me , nor will it ever be . For in her equipoise she continues to teach me about balance , giving and receiving , living , loving and genuine joy .

I explored different rhythm patterns with him . We then made a cassette of different kinds of African drumming that he seemed to find very stimulating and helped him get moving . Anytime he had to walk across a street , whereas in the past he may freeze , he would put on his headphones and listen to African rhythms to get to the other side without freezing in the middle of rush hour traffic . We know that rhythmic cueing works because we have seen it clinically . The underlying mechanisms of how it works is what we are trying to understand better . Freezing in Parkinson 's disease is when the person ca n't initiate movement and literally stops in his or her place . No matter how much he or she tries , he or she ca n't move . It seems as if the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desire is there , the patient 's body does n't respond to the signal. - <p> " A man who was in our short-term rehabilitation program had a stroke , and he had a left side hemiparesis which means he was n't paralyzed , but he did lose sensation in the left side of the body . He was in our physical rehabilitation program and was going to be discharged to the community , but he was still shuffling his left leg and literally dragging it . His physical therapist felt he would n't be safe walking outside without supervision . The optimal goal for him was to walk independently with a cane . They asked me if there was something we could recommend with music to help him feel his body so he could sway and lift his left side to get a sensation of lifting the leg even though he had limited feeling . I asked his physical therapist to measure his safe walking speed which was the same rhythm as one of Nat King Cole 's songs , " Walking My Baby Back Home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk comfortably to the song , but what he did was interesting . Instead of just walking to it , he did shuffle steps , moving backwards and forwards , almost as if he were dancing. - <p> " He said he felt like , in listening to the music , he needed to move more , telling me he has n't danced since he was a kid . It appeared as if the memory of dancing was still there , and the body wanted to move that way. - <p> " In less than two months he was able to lift his leg on the beat , absolutely coordinated in time . In fact , at the end of two months , he actually got the sensation back again so he could again feel the floor . Some might say this is normal recovery , but our guess is that because he was using his leg differently , activating a muscle memory for dancing , there was indication that there is a different motor schemata in the brain for different muscle activity . When you walk you use one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempo . Perhaps that kicked in . This is hypothetical . We know clinically that this ability exists . We are trying to prove it scientifically . In this case , the rhythm was more important than the melody , since it was the rhythm at the tempo at which he could walk that initiated the change . The melody helped him sing the song himself and helped him to self-integrate those rhythms . " - <p> Drumming and Paralysis- <p> Arthur Hull , a well-known drum circle facilitator , describes an experience involving a woman who used drumming to regain motor function after she was paralyzed. - <p> " I did a program in Mill Valley in a hospital once , and a lady came up to me and told me this story : She had been involved in an accident that paralyzed her .

" Slowly but surely , larger and larger movements occurred to the point that she could wiggle her toes , then move her body , until finally she could sit in a chair and play larger drums . After four years of constant drumming and dancing in this way , she became a dancer again , though now she is a drumming dancer or a dancing drummer depending on her mood . She now has full movement of her body , and she is graceful and beautiful . " -

We had moved the year before from Detroit MI , where I was born . My first lessons were out of the Buddy Rich book . As a typical 7 year old boy , I did not practice that much . I had my little practice pad , but was more interested in banging on the suitcases I set up for a drum set . There was no particular kind of music I liked , but was interested in all kinds . I have memories of the first Monkee 's album that my Dad bought us the minute it came out to Rubber Soul by the Beatles . My parents were listening to Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass and it became a favorite of mine . As time moved on , I was drawn to athletic interests like baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums .

I loved the sound , but we were horrible . <p> " When I was around 12 I got a job at the local music store in San Jose , where I was taking lessons and handing out music flyers in exchange for cymbals . I met many of the guys who worked at the music store and was asked if I wanted to jam with them outside of the store .

As long as I practiced and showed interest , I had my lessons . I actually never had a professional kit until I was 12 . I spent much time with a practice pad . I recall one occasion when I got a snare drum that came with the lessons and became very frustrated so I decided it was cool to plant the sticks through the drum head . Well , this did n't go over very well with my parents and the lessons were put on hold . <p> " For the next few years I played with various cover bands playing a few originals .

We auditioned singers for what seemed like years and could never find our man . We recorded a couple of albums and a self-produced video and things just sort of fell apart . The first album " Deliver Us " was done for $800 . It was an eight-track recording with the two bass drums and the bass merged on to one track . So much for high tech recording .

They were coming off of a serious amount of success with Animotion and when we met , everyone had long hair and the rock look going on . As much as we were coming from different musical places , at least the look was consistent , or so I thought . Then we get together to play for the first time and they had all basically shaved their heads and went for a completely different look .

As a clinical nurse specialist and counseling psychotherapist , I have had the privilege to facilitate well over one hundred such circles in the last few years . From business and industry groups interested in conflict resolution and empowerment training to cancer support groups ; from lovely worship experiences to women 's programs and community diversity initiatives -- each drum circle has had its own character ! The poignant point is simply this " the rhythms of our lives have the power to heal us and to bring us together . Join me in remembering one of the special gatherings. - <p> Mothers ' Day was just around the corner . Our lovely local Inn approached me about hosting a Mothers ' Day HealthRhythms- Drumming Circle to celebrate themes of motherhood . I thought this to be a very fine idea . They promised to embellish this programmatic offering with tea and crumpets served up on Old English china and in a collection of extraordinary Victorian teapots . Lavender and baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen tablecloths . The drum circle would be set up in the center of the large room with the tables on the periphery . The setting was sure to be magnificent ! Of course , I said yes ! Who would n't ? - <p> That day , when the 60 or so individuals gathered , I was struck with the eager uncertainty of the group . When I asked , not one of them had EVER participated in a drum circle prior to the engaging moment they were actually in ! There were four women who were well beyond their seventies , the oldest being 87 ! And there were seven young lasses , the youngest being 8 years old . I realized as I progressively met each group member that something incredible was in place " there were three and four generations represented within singular families ! The spiritual richness and depth of such a gathering was not lost on me. - <p> And so we drummed . I navigated the gathered group through the basic building blocks of the HealthRhythms- protocol . While everyone seemed to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums " tapping out little rhythms and noises here and there ! The air was pregnant with anticipation and readiness . I taught . They learned . We drummed . Entrainment happened ! Faces and hearts fully opened each to the other and all to some greater something that urged us on in the nameless common bonds that drum circles create. - <p> One Grandmother , who accepted mallets because I have arthritis in my hands , put her mallets down midway through the event and picked up a tambourine to dance a bit in the middle of the circle . It was so natural and so fine . Another , four-generation family began a rhythm of eye contact with each other that was mystical and captivated us all . Still another mother-daughter dyad stopped drumming for a while , just to embrace each other . It occurred to me that a great many things were happening in this intergenerational drum circle that Mothers ' Day. - <p> It 's quite easy to allow the rhythms of healing to thrum through a group . One simply has to move out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an uninformed or haphazard moving out of the way , but rather , a well-planned , well thought out protocol of promise . This unspoken promise can be realized when the hearts , souls and minds of gathered individuals are invitationally opened to it , and the facilitator can be the stimulus of all good things , without being or stealing the show ! - <p> At the end of this day , one young mother walked up to me with two older women in tow and the eight year old nipping at the skirts of and embracing the one she called Nana . With tears in her eyes , the young mother reached for me and said , You will never know what you have allowed to happen here today . My Mother has Alzheimer 's disease , and I brought her here thinking it would mean nothing to her at all .

I wonder if this practice reflects our societal problem in talking about grief and loss . Although research has shown that telling one 's story is essential in healing from trauma , the sadness is often so horrific , many are left speechless . Words can not express the experience and emotions that accompany trauma . That is where music plays an essential role in healing after events such as the Columbine High School shooting. - <p> On April 20 , 1999 , many students , parents and family members were speaking on the air through the local AM radio station . In the midst of the fog of unknowns as the death count was being determined , and the shock of the Columbine high school shooting was sinking in , emotions were raw and people needed an outlet . This initial rush of verbal processing was short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known and nearby Clement Park began to house a growing memorial wall of flowers and poems , the Littleton community seemed to fall silent . Those resistant to addressing the issue were driven even more into the silence by the daily hounding of the media at the school and the park. - <p> At this time , music found its way into the grief process on a large scale . Two high school students wrote the song , " Columbine Friend of Mine . " They recorded the song and made it available on the web . They performed it at the memorial and later in Washington D.C. at a hearing on school violence . Their song contained the speechless emotions of so many students , children , and parents felt deep in their hearts. - <p> Although a request for a drum circle had arrived immediately following the shooting , I advised against it . The sound of the drums so soon after the shooting would be counter-therapeutic , potentially triggering the auditory memory of the gunshots heard in the school that day . Instead , music therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many music products companies who co-sponsored the " Music for Littleton " project , directed by Brenda Luksch .

As part of the one-year anniversary memorial event , we were asked by the peace organization , TREACE to hold a community drum circle in Clement Park . Now far enough removed from the actual shooting , it was the perfect use of community music making for emotional expression and relationship repairing. - <p> The event included a closed memorial service for the Columbine students followed by an open day in the park with peers and family . I immediately enlisted the help of my friends and colleagues Bob Anzlovar , a Denver drum circle facilitator , Bob Rupp , owner of the Denver based store , Rupp 's Drums , and Rami Liddle , a community change agent and asset-builder in Colorado who helped organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum circle as four-fold : - <p> 1 .

To increase the morale of the community and re-establish hope. - 4 . To practice through the music experience , the skills needed in rebuilding the community. - <p> We came to think of the drum circle as rainbow-building after the flood. - <p> We chose the instruments wisely , bringing REMO tubanos specially for their more contained , softer tones and supplementing them with many sustaining ambient sounds such as rainsticks , ocean drums , chimes , gongs , and bells . We brought a Brazilian bass drum , the surdo to sound out the deep heartbeat rhythm that underlined the grooves of the day. - <p> In an effort to explain the purpose of the drum circle , we created a bookmark which also listed the six skills for community building practiced through drumming . It read : - <p> HonorRhythms : Honoring the Pulse of Community- <p> We offer this drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and change , resounding in the hearts and souls of all those wanting to remember , heal , and create a better community. - <p> In the silence we honor and remember those taken from the community .

Let 's begin by examining some of the historical pioneering work in this field . In 1985 Gordon Shaw , Dennis Silverman and John Pearson proposed a model of nerve cell firing patterns in the brain specifically thought to be influenced by music and other creative skills . Research later published in the journal , Concepts in Neuroscience ( 1991 ) , by Xiaodan Leng and Gordon Shaw proposed the concept of music as a " pre- language , " and suggested early music training might be useful in exercising the brain for certain higher cognitive functions. - <p> Building upon this concept , additional studies furthered our understanding of the effects of music training on brain function .

Especially suited for creating a visual picture of what 's actually happening , this form of reasoning enables us to better understand mathematical and scientific principles needed to solve complex problems .

Current science has revealed that the human body records all information on a cellular level , imprinting the organism with information for survival . One might inquire then , what messages are stored in a poverty stricken , neglected or abused infant ? - <p> Youth who are at-risk have spent much of their time surviving , not living . They rarely have experiences that enable them to feel , let alone feel alive .

If we are to back up a step in psychology , we find in actuality , that anger comes from fear . It is fear that they are responding to in the initial stages of substance use . Having to carry a knife to walk the ' terf ' of a neighborhood and fulfill the expectations of gang members as a sibling is a terrifying experience for a child who is forced to participate as soon as he/she becomes conversational with those in the community . A young person with virtually no support system , uses substances as a defense mechanism to shut down the pain that seems unbearable . The amygdala , and area of the brain recognized as a major emotional command center that allows us to experience pleasure , can be accessed through cigarettes and other substances. - <p> According to Norman Weinberger in his excerpt , " The Musical Hormone " from MuSICA Research Notes ( Fall 1997 ) : " When the amygdala is particularly active , it is believed emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important , even traumatic , a lot of adrenaline is released which " instructs " the amygdala to help other parts of the brain store stronger memories ...

" <p> When pondering the many causes for addiction , remember that a dose of pleasure reduces our perception of pain ( Goleman , Gurin , Mind Body Medicine , 1993 ) . The body can experience a sense of calm or momentary relief , even amid chaos when using substances that alter the conscious state . It is important to note that the body can also do this when it is engaged in musical activity. - <p> Weinberger explains in " The Neurobiology of Musical Learning and Memory " from MuSICA Research Notes ( Fall , 1997 ) , different studies showed music greatly reduced the levels and duration of cortisol responses to stress. - <p> What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined ?

Active music-making regimen was definitely better at producing stronger long term memory than was passive learning .

Drugs of all types are not only used as a replacement for ritual , but also to fill the emotional void that seems overwhelming. - <p> Why Music Therapy ? - <p> There are both social and physiological reasons why music therapy successfully addresses a young person 's desire for cigarettes and other harmful , but pleasure inducing substances . To understand this , it is helpful to look at the positive opportunities that music therapy can provide in relation to the needs of children who continue to live in poverty , experience neglect , and often endure psychological and/or physical abuse . It is not a mystery that children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a music therapy group not only allows for the development of self-esteem through successful educational and social interactions , it also enables the child to use the group as a support system , a replacement for what has lacked in family structure and rituals .

Also , it is important to remember that toning ( the release of tension and anxiety through the voice ) , is the body 's natural regulation mechanism for healing , both emotionally and physically. - <p> In addition to the use of the voice , drumming and breathing ( in a music relaxation context ) are also effective ways of adjusting the body 's systems on a physical level .

Much of what we see as addictive substance problems in youth , often starts as an attempt to self-medicate as a defense mechanism to preserve the body from trauma . Due to a lack of health care and education level in parental care , these children have emotional issues which result in physical issues . It is common that their issues are not addressed until they are obvious , they have evolved into physical conditions or learning disabilities. - <p> Many pilot projects studying neurological development have recently released word of increased educational abilities in children who participate in music .

The answer : A child who uses substances and carries weapons to survive does n't need to know Mozart 's Sonata Allegro form . In addition , becoming smarter is seen as threatening to their peers and is perceived as endangering their own well being . Their ego is not strong enough to endure the pressures of performance , nor have they ever experienced the type of structure through family interactions that support diligent individual practice of an instrument ( which is what renders satisfying , positive results ) .

The last item mentioned may be the most difficult , yet the most necessary element to obtain . If a child has not been shown unconditional love at birth or shortly after , and has been traumatized by abuse and/or neglect , it is likely that they will be addicted to this pain pattern until something can enter " through the back door " , so to speak. - <p> When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a safe space provides an opportunity to explore the concept of love and self-love through the music . The sound , complexity and simplicity of vibrations , emotions encountered , and the instrument as a safe , inanimate object to practice interaction with , all serve as the vehicle for change . Change occurs after one has experienced repetition of symbolic , then concrete successful transactions . The environment and the musical interactions inherently allow the person to feel love and integrate it on a physical level . This population of children may not regularly experience a personal relationship with the concept of love , and frequently block it , for fear it may feel good and may be taken away . This would be far too painful to endure on top of everything else , so blocking it is a natural defense mechanism . Understanding the concept of love is necessary for engagement in caring and respectful interactions with society , as well as the development of motivation to participate with society in a positive manner. - <p> Another question posed : Why have n't music teachers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population efficiently ? This answer is complicated , and meant in no way to reduce the value of teachers or counselors in the school system who provide crucial roles in education . The first thing to become clear about is that music teachers do not receive training in therapeutic techniques of music in the current music education bachelors or masters degrees offered in universities across our nation. - <p> The other piece to address in this question has to do with a school counselor 's use of verbal therapy . The cultures commonly assisted in this at-risk population are Hispanic , Asain/Pacific Islander , and African-American . The values within these cultures have a tendency to disrespect and/or fear verbal psychotherapy . Generally , high resistance is met when attempts are made through verbal intervention . Another important element to take into account about verbal therapy ; one tends to seek it after a strong sense of self has been developed , and the ego can withstand judgment of societal views about participation. - <p> However , all of these cultures , which represent a large portion of our population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected part of the culture . As a matter of fact , it is such a central focus in some , that musicians are regarded as heroic in their society . Some cultures are identified primarily by their music . Most adolescents consider musical taste as an important element in socializing with each other . As we can see , there is a strong connection between identity and music. - <p> It seems that our society 's perception of music prepares the participant with a low resistance factor from the start . But there is another reason why music is effective in reaching a population with a reputation for having high defenses . When one engages in music , the inner life world of the individual and their social ability to interact comes " out on the table " in the musical group interaction . Defenses are lowered by the music , and the individual usually becomes " softer " or more sensitive in exchanges . Music has a power over the body , a language that possesses an inherent nature to make us feel. - <p> In Closing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child with minimal home life support , it is always wise to offer something in replacement . Substances often serve as the material that exacerbates an illness on one level , but is seen by the young person as an element that plays a part in a feeling of safety and ' holding it all together ' ( mental health ) . Asking this population to give up substances is like taking away the only perceived support , and a sense of personal control in their chaotic environment. - <p> As researchers know , statistics show smokers quitting , alcoholics becoming dry , and crack users becoming clean is a hard battle to fight . Instead of a band-aid approach , with relapses that occur in using , let 's take this one step deeper . Address the fear that transformed the lives of children by providing an alternative that they can relate to and feel heard . In addition , give them a replacement that is also perceived by the body as pleasure. - <p> If we can teach alternatives at a young age , for those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages ( including adolescent females who are pregnant or who are at high risk for pregnancy ) , we have an opportunity to shape the future . It is imperative that in this attempt we provide pleasure for pleasure as an exchange . Aspiring to be ' that artist up on the stage ' only works for those who possess the self-esteem to follow through on dreams . These youth will continue to seek pleasure to reduce pain . Let 's give them a support system , successful experiences , a sense of self-worth , a new place to call home. - <p> Let 's give them the pleasure they were looking for in the first place. -

The group understood . They knew him well . Each was facing cancer in one way or another ; either as a patient or a support person in our Bernie Siegel Cancer Program . His stillness touched us that June afternoon with an emptiness out of sync with the rhythmical energy our leader magically imparted to us. - <p> It was n't an ordinary day at the Mind-Body Wellness Center , and our facilitator was n't an ordinary drumming leader .

He claimed to have been writing an article for a national magazine all morning . Yet I had difficulty believing he could ever sit still for more than a few minutes. - <p> For after announcing his presence ( does a whirlwind ever need an announcement ? ) , he literally stormed into the meeting room-- an open , airy setting where our group was arranged in a circle . A heartfelt discussion of rediscovering meaning and purpose in life was abruptly cut short by a man who could n't contain his enthusiasm to get started . Without the slightest hesitation , he ran over to a collection of colorful Remo hand drums stacked neatly in the corner of the room . Frantically , he set to task placing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He scurried about without a break until all drums were in place-- obviously according to some order he alone had in mind. - <p> We stared at each other in awe .

After adjusting his strange little hat and rearranging his fisherman 's vest , the drummer smiled ear to ear and nonchalantly asked , What is the problem you people have anyway ? - <p> Cancer , our counselor responded in a subdued tone. - <p> Have you all recovered ? he injected. - <p> No , I replied . We 're in the midst of an integrated , whole person treatment approach. - <p> While that answer did n't seem to phase him for more than a fraction of a second , there was a noticeable pause and a gasp before he began a supercharged explanation of the history of drumming . Our group did n't seem to mind . In fact , we were all wondering what would happen next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Within minutes , there was an upbeat resonance that emanated from a group of what he might have described as rhythmically challenged individuals . We were all beginners and everyone seemed to delight in participating-- except for the young man whose cancer paralyzed his painful right arm which was held close to his body in a makeshift sling . Despite a bit of lighthearted coaxing by our earnest drumming guru , a nod followed by a telltale stare at the floor revealed the young man 's sentiment that was understood and accepted by everyone in the room. - <p> While the group played on , deep inside , I wished he 'd join in . I offered him a shaker , a wooden gourd with seeds inside from an assortment of oddly-shaped tools in our arsenal of percussion instruments . He gently waved me off as his young wife continued tapping her drum and nodded thanks with a bittersweet smile-- one that fully conveyed their melancholy plight without a single word . Within minutes our ragtag group of former pencil tappers and knee slappers actually sounded like we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than life , rose from his chair and signaled us for an intensive drum roll finale , our hearts , souls and enthusiasm energized each other and connected us . That crescendo boomed throughout the Center shaking the walls and the windows. - <p> We had become one sound at one moment in time resounding past challenge , past adversity and past cancer . Yet it did n't seem to connect with the spirit of a young man who perhaps needed it the most . More than ever , while I wished he 'd play with us , I fully realized it had to be his choice . As our drum beats were replaced with smiles and applause for our collective sonic boom , my eyes connected with his and the pain of his suffering . I knew the seriousness of his condition and recognized the despair he felt , as well as the courage it took just to sit with us. - <p> Before I could inject a word , there was an unexpected metamorphosis in our drumming facilitator . Unpredictably and out of character , he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sharply with the wild exhilaration we just experienced . He seemed to know something we didn't-- something hidden in a story about the first drum beat each of us had ever heard-- the lub-dub of mother 's heart . And he taught us to re-create it with those amazing , yet simple instruments that minutes before brought us together with incredible resolve , energy and camaraderie . <p> As we played in unison , his gentle words took us back generations to grandmother 's and great grandmother 's heartbeat . He guided us back through time to a place where that sound was first heard-- a place where true balance and harmony existed within each one of us . It was a place where even the threat of cancer could not exist . As his words progressively faded and the only sounds filling the room were the lub-dubs on our drums , something wonderful happened. - <p> Glancing at our teacher as if on cue , we sensed it , we felt it and we heard it . There was a new drum beat amongst ours , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts . Each of us nodded , sighed and welcomed back the young man whose left hand tapped the drum in front of him in synchrony with ours-- an acceptance of the healing connection each one of us extended. - <p> That June day the young man taught us something we will never forget-- music enters where words can not pass . While our rhythmical alchemist , as he sometimes refers to himself , does n't like to admit it , he 's really a talented therapist disguised as a drummer. - <p> Arthur Hull 's real magic is in the energy of the music he teaches us to express-- a symphony of souls that draws us together in mind , body and spirit . As for that brave young man , I 'm confident he will never have to drum again with just one hand . For every time a new group of rhythmically challengedindividuals seeks to synergize their souls at our Center , I sense the vibrations of both his hands leading us-- Mind Over Matter ! - <p> This article is dedicated to Todd Burrows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he touched. -

Due to the non-standardization and variation in manufacturing found in all conga drums the initial fit of the drumhead to each model drum may vary . When installing the drumheads be sure to level and center the drumheads and maintain that balance by adding tension to the drum slowly and evenly .
