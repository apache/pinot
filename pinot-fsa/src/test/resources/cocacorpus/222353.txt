She last appeared on HiFructose.com here . <p> Or as David Zwirner writes , the artist " has developed her own genre of portraiture in which lavish , erotic , vulgar , angelic women ( and more recently men ) are cast within fantastical landscapes or dramatically lit interiors . Seamlessly blending pop cultural imagery , color theory , and psychology , Yuskavage draws on classical and modern painterly techniques and , in particular , marshals color as a conduit for complex psychological constructs . " <p> A Philly native , the artist went to both Tyler School of Art at Temple University and the Yale University School of Art .

Like his subjects , which are equally- beautiful and- haunting- creatures , Heines paintings embody both beauty and feelings of unease . His work has inspired polarizing reactions ; some viewers feeling discomfort , while leaving others entranced . Perhaps this feeling of- discomfort can be attributed to Heines use of tension , as in the way his sirens just barely- reach the surface- to breathe , or linger above it . Although his- premise is- based on mythology , - it is coupled- with a heightened sense of realism . The underwater world- is faithfully reproduced- in- details like- light refractions and ripples , while the rhythms of currents- can be felt in the continuous flowing fabric that his sirens wear .

Mayet was born in Cuba , yet has been living and working in Mallorca , Spain as an expatriate . Despite the circumstances , his sculptures are devoid of any intentional political statement .

Trees look as if they were ripped straight from the earth , while thatched roof houses cling to the patches of land beneath them .

First featured on our blog here , Baugh once compared his unique sense of reality in his paintings to one his first passions , photography , an art form that portrays a parallel universe or a version of reality that is " slightly off . " As seen in his instructional videos at his website , he works like a photographer does in a dark room when it comes to painting , building from values and highly saturated colors until his subjects start to take form . The result is a vivid reality that takes realism to a higher , almost unsettling level with a narrative that taps into our complexities and insecurities . <p> Daniel Adel has a particular fascination with drapery that he expresses in his dynamic oil paintings of sculptures wrapped in cloth .

@@23640475 @3640475/ <p> Beautifully-rendered and atmospheric , Aron Wiesenfeld 's latest body of paintings reminds us how adept the artist is at creating scenes of suspenseful distinction . With the precedent of following the artist 's work set in Hi-Fructose Vol.14 , - Vol. 22 and online , we were invited into his studio to gaze into Wiesenfeld 's progressively mysterious world . His latest suite of paintings , titled " Solstice " will be shown at Arcadia Contemporary- in NYC from September 18 through October 3 . <p> In these new paintings , Wiesenfeld created in a somewhat different manner , allowing the environments to have the primary importance before adding any characters to the scene . Created in his San Diego , CA studio , these new works concentrate on the fragile state of mortality . The artist is mindful of death , with the awareness that one can be reborn into the cycle of life " the evolving symbol of a migrating soul . With words scarcely able to do the work justice , we recommend viewers see the paintings in person or check out Wiesenfeld 's latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . <p> It 's wonderful to see these new paintings , which appear to be paintings focused on seasons , change and some migratory event . It seems that there is some sort of a shift in this body of work from your previous shows in some ways , is that fair to say ? <p> Thanks a lot ! There were some things I did differently this time . My paintings usually start with a sketch of a person , but these started with ink wash drawings I had done of drizzly , foggy scenes with no people . I liked the mood in them , and I wanted the paintings to echo that . The people were added as the paintings progressed , which is probably why the people are generally smaller , and the narratives tend to be about the relationship of the characters to their surroundings . Its one of the things I like about old Chinese paintings , there is so much space and atmosphere that the dramas of the characters seem insignificant . <p> Another thing I did differently this time was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to think about them as a group , and I liked that I could progress on the ones I wanted to on a particular day . The only down side was when the show date was getting closer and I did n't  have anything finished . <p> Preparatory- ink wash study . <p> It appears that the characters are shown facing away from the viewer , away from the work 's edges and into the scene . Is there a specific reason for this separation ? <p> I think that came out of the environments being of primary importance to me . Showing the person from behind was a trope of some of my favorite painters , Friedrich and Hammersh++i . The character becomes a cipher , or a stand-in for the viewer . <p> What does the title " Solstice " mean to you ? Is this a reference to the passage of a season , or some wider meaning attached to the movements of the mysterious characters within the works ? <p> To me it evoked ancient , pre-Christian , even pre-classical religions , like the Druids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I like the mysterious , ritualistic connection with the word . I tried to research it , but there was n't much to be found . I was reading a history of Christmas , which said that probably nobody really knew when Jesus was born , but since there was already a winter solstice holiday in Rome called Saturnalia , the Christians just shoehorned Christmas into that . And the Romans had previously done the same thing with Saturnalia to a pagan December holiday feast that existed because people had to slaughter their animals if they could n't feed them through the winter . Each eras myths and rituals seem to take liberally from the previous ones , so there is this continuity that goes- far back into history. - Its the meaning I get from the title , and something I wanted to express in the paintings . <p> There appears to be a movement , a migration even , occurring in these pieces . Are the paintings representing some sort of exodus , movements of people leaving an area or preparing for an event of some sort ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near. - That was part of the meaning from the title " Solstice " too " that there is death , but then there is rebirth , in a continuous cycle. - I find it comforting to think about death that way , instead of as just an ending. - In answer to the question , I think migrations typify that cyclical nature of life . <p> In many of your works , the characters are looking across a divide , whether its a body of water , a road , a gap , or some other kind of break in the landscape . Is there significance to that ? <p> Those gaps have metaphorical meaning . Its a divide between worldly reality and another place . That place could be called spiritual , or metaphysical , but the most important characteristic is that its not here its there. - And since a painting is static , the girl looking across the river will always be looking across the river . Its an unreachable destination . <p> It also appears that the individuals within these scenarios are fairly oblivious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming over them . To what do you think we owe that effect " are the characters specters of some long-ago residency , dimensional echoes of some parallel universe , or possibly just dreamy inhabitants that are under a spell of some sort ? <p> I like all of those ! It might sound like a cop-out , but all of those ideas are valid . I have my own ideas about the story behind each painting , but I wonder if I say what they are , will it invalidate other peoples stories ? - Paintings and stories should have unanswered questions , as long as they are interesting questions , of course . It allows the viewer to collaborate in the story. - I thought the show " Lost " was great for that reason . Each week it suggested bizarre possibilities , and rarely explained them .

Most ideas seem to work as medium sized paintings . When I had the initial idea for the largest painting in the show The Orchard , I knew it had to be big . There is something that only a very big painting can do , and only when seen in person , which is to give the illusion that one could physically enter the painting . But big paintings take so much time " its a huge commitment . <p> As well as having an entirely new body of paintings and a solo exhibit , you have your first collection of works published recently , is that right ?

A- decade ago , Kitty began using video as a visual means to test the restrictions imposed on women by the media . This idea led to her current series " The Weird Girls Project , " which seeks to empower both the women who take part and those watching . Kittys films have a loose story line that more closely resembles a music video , mixing elements- of performance art , costume design , installation and painting . Her concept exists very much in its process . Played by " real women " volunteers , how her subjects react and transform through costume is part of how Kitty paints a moving picture of strength . Some of her other-worldly- short episodes , such as " The Secret Garden , " serve to illustrate female beauty while also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed as a group unit , there is also an emphasis on unity among women while celebrating their differences .

So , without further ado , let 's take a little closer look at Danny 's upcoming work , his studio process , and what makes his work transcend the typical 3D sculpture formula . <p> Danny starts with a 3D modeling program , where he builds out his sculpture . He does n't  start with a sketch , he just allows his imagination to start fleshing out what 's on the screen . <p> The program allows him to shape and mold the image as if it were clay . <p> Once done to his exacting specifications ( as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture ) he has the image printed by a 3D printer in polyamide , which creates a white sculpture with a slightly grainy texture , and allows for extremely tiny detail to be rendered out . When the sculpture is done and he has prepped it to remove any residual polyamide dust , he begins the painting process . <p> All of his work is painted in black and white monotone , but with incredible , time intensive consideration to detail . <p> The finest of details are worked over multiple times , giving depth and dimension to each piece ( sometimes allowing weeks to get it perfect ) and allowing it to stand out as a work of art , rather than a mass produced object . Because of the labor intensive aspect , only three editions of a design are ever produced . <p> The final touch is the bell jar which he houses the sculptures in . He currently sources antique domes that have extremely thin glass and sometimes decorated bases . These enhance the strange Victorian paranormal vibe of his work , and add to the sideshow curiosity aspect to his characters .

In- his early days as a child in Cuba , his access to art supplies was limited because of the countrys trade restrictions . As a result , Travieso has a deep appreciation for color and takes advantage of the hues available to him with his- full-spectrum palette . His oil and acrylic paintings on canvas often feature geometric forms interacting with birds and other animals . Travieso uses this juxtaposition of realism and design- to draw attention to the adverse effects human activity has had on nature . He- views each painting as a chance to give voice to the powerless and endangered species on our planet. - We spoke to Travieso about the ideas behind his paintings , as well as his artistic evolution . <p> We 'd love to hear a little about you . Where is your studio and where are you from ? - <p> My studio is located in the heart of- Wynwood- in Miami , Florida . I was born in Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come from Cuba to live in Miami ? How did that affect you as an artist or influence your work ? <p> Coming from Cuba was a struggle at first . I originally moved to Boston . It was a great culture shock at first not knowing the language . It was also very cold , and for somebody that had lived in tropical weather- his whole life , it was tough . I moved to Miami after a year of being in Boston because of the weather . Living in Miami- definitely- influenced me in many ways. - I loved being outside as a kid and exploring my natural surroundings . That passion developed into my appreciation for nature , which is now the core component of my work. - I have also done a series of paintings based on my political views of communism , and living in Miami helped nurture my understanding of it . I used a comparative method for both countries and determined that Cubas socialist- political system will never work or- benefit its people . <p> Tell us a little about your artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with designs- with such a bright and vivid palette ? <p> I have always loved color . I learned to appreciate color by having a lack of options growing up . I never had a full set of crayons or color pencils until I was ten years old . This was due to the " Special Period " in Cuba . The- early nineties was a time when very few things were being imported into the island . Due to the limitations of color choices as a child , using the full color spectrum excites me as an artist till this day. - Color is another language for me . I- use color as symbols all of the time in my work . <p> As a part of nature , I am aware- of- the fact that we are trying so hard as a species to disconnect ourselves from what we are. - I feel that it is my responsibility as an artist and as a citizen of the world to give voice to the powerless species on this earth . Therefore , I have been focusing on endangered species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to paint all of the endangered birds in the world . I am constantly discovering and educating myself on the environmental issues at hand . It is a necessity for me to communicate these issues with others through my paintings . <p> Was there an- influence that inspired you to put so much energy and time into focusing on- working as a professional- artist ? - <p> The first influence artistically was my father . He used to draw characters for me all of the time . I would cut them out and make figurines to play with . Those were my first action figures . My dad also used to make me toys out of wood and found materials . For example , he used to make me these wooden robots that had the top of metal cans attached to their chest . He is still one of my biggest inspirations . My mother and two sisters also have played an incredible supporting role . Their encouragement has been vital to my success as an artist . They form- the greater part of my motivation . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the origin of producing this particular marriage of thoughts ? Where did this style begin ? <p> The ideas come from narratives from all over the world . History and research play a key role in the conversation with my audience. - The appropriation of different motifs and compositions- are my way of adopting the language that already exists and combine it with new possibilities . Painting is like making a soup . My goal is just to make my soup with the most interesting set of ingredients possible . I play with the arrangement and the juxtaposition to achieve new solutions . My style and my subject matter are distinct elements and will hopefully differentiate me from every other painter before me , and those that will come after me . <p> These paintings , as well as your previous works , seem to belong to a large body of work " perhaps a series of- thoughts on the subject of nature being affected- by encroaching human influence . We are curious what your thoughts are on this , what message is being presented ? - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My work is always done in series because of this approach . Working on a series allows me to make mistakes , learn from those mistakes , and become immersed in the subject matter . This helps me understand what I am saying better . For example , in my ongoing series of " Endangered Birds , " I realized after two years of painting that the message- of these pieces would be expressed through power in numbers . The more different species I painted , the more the audience would understand the great value of their loss . One of my dreams is to have a retrospective with all of my bird paintings under the same roof . It would be a grand statement on the toll we have taken on- nature . <p> What is life like in your studio ? - We 're curious- if- you work in solitude or around other artists . Do you enjoy music or some type of entertainment going on in the background , or even perhaps- silence while you create ? <p> Life at the studio is very intense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends : Reinier- Gamboa , David- Olivera , and Leo Castaneda . They keep me sane and inspire me to keep painting . They- add to my conversation by constantly critiquing my work . Having a positive creative atmosphere is very important . I love music . Music like art has- enticing qualities and the two together- offer me the stamina to connect with my work. - I barely make art without listening to music . With good music available it 's like having the greatest concentration of raw elements and senses available- in the world . The music ranges from Thom Yorke to the Little Mermaid soundtrack . All music comes with a gift . When aligned , the painting experience is perfect . <p> So what do you do when you 're not creating ? - Is there something that you spend your time doing to recharge or gain new inspirations to bring back to the studio ? <p> When I am not creating , I am researching and trying to brew a new idea that will inspire a painting . I love spending time with nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an emotional connection with the subject matter I am researching . When- an article or story makes me feel something , then- the narrative becomes- worthy of my time . I invest in it and ultimately it becomes a piece . <p> Do you think in terms of scale , the size of the work , when you start a new painting ? - How do you feel that the dimensions of a finished work affect the idea itself ? <p> Scale can play a major role in how we perceive an image . Usually when something is very large it has dominance just by its ability to capture our attention . However , that does not mean that it states an idea more clearly than any of the smaller pieces. - Size can be secondary to the content embedded in a painting . <p> Where might viewers find you in the near future ? - Please tell us a little about- what you have coming up and where people- can see- your work ? - <p> I have a show coming up in Los Angeles at Giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given the honor of being the honorary print for an upcoming event- at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston .

They gave me alot of iconography but ultimately the Anticon dudes just trusted mewhich is great . But its still making their thingsso now I 'm much more interested in doing things for myself . I did a book with Tim ( Sole ) , and that was more a collaborative project between us . <p> Do you find your use of language- is that something that consciously goes into a piece ? Do you start with a certain passage that gives you ideas , or is that something that comes in later ? <p> Yeah it goes back and forth . Itll start with text or a passage that somebody else has writtenit hits me . Itll be something I want to recreateIll want to interact with them and create images with it . With the Pyre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then hed look at some of my images and respond to those . Then sometimes I 'll just react to my own work too , I 'll think of text thatd work . I love including language as another dimension to art Its great how much you can do with languagei really love it . <p> So with thatdo you think music plays a part with what you 're doing , do you respond to it ? <p> Oh yeah , I 'll listen to rap constantly . Rap is the only music I listen to mostlyits the best . Its all i needtheres so muchthere , its all language . Its intellectual and powerful at the same time . There 's so much I can get from it . I often bite from rappers alot , with their language . Ill take passage from rappers and maybe fuck them up just so <p> You always know its good language when you get that reaction . When you get a visual cue or vision .

( of Outkast ) Anything by him has suchhes the best artist for giving me that fullness of imagery . Him and David Byrne are so strong for that . But I 'll listen to lots of gangster rap too , and even mainstream poppy stuff lately , like Lupe Fiasco . <p> I 've always seen a strong nod to indigenous cultures ( something near and dear to my own art making ) , and an allusion to more sinister times-- what are you saying with this iconography ? <p> I love art so much .

I do n't  think of the images as referring to sinister times . In some ways maybe , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows a lot of violence and hardship . I do use modern weapons in my art but to me that 's just a way of staying aware of my own time . <p> So you feel you 're just continuing in that tradition . What drives you to create , what do you feel you 're saying ? <p> Its less an explicit message , and more experiencesthats how I respond to art . I have really strong immediate visceral responses to art and then I 'll want to recreate that for other people and show them what I get from art . Its more a matter of a central experience . I want to bring that to them Its weird . I think most art.its really popular to say its subjectivebut I think for the most part there is a very clear shared experience . Just that we all live in the same world . If you see an image of a flower , everybody makes roughly the same association with flowers , we all have a shared idea of what a flower is .

I remember making movies or music videos , and if there was a blue object somewhere in the frame , I 'd have to reframe it to make sure it did n't  show.I just fucking hated it . I 'm not totally sure why , maybe it has to do with the artificial feeling of it . I was really ( really ) drawn to earth tones back then . Blue is n't really in that spectrum . Then I figured out a way to do it , that I like , and now I use it so much . <p> I always have borders on everything , I always contain a piece .

So the specific work in this show is lots of images of the human body , anatomical illustration which is a way of an immediate physical way of describing human needs .

Two of the Citys three major art fairs disappeared last spring , galleries are getting evicted and artists are leaving due to unimpressive sales and rising rents . Curators- from San Francisco and Oakland alike are racking their brains about how to appeal to the growing class of Twitterati . There is a disconnect between the Bay Areas influx of wealth and its art . Tucked away in suburban San Mateo , just south of SF , Art Silicon Valley was envisioned as a fair that would entice the tech elite . With Maserati as a sponsor and only high-end galleries allowed , this was the glitzy answer to DIY endeavors that have been popping up recently ( like Art Beats , covered here ) . <p> Regardless of ones stance on the Bay Areas rapid gentrification , its clear that a new approach is needed to keep the arts viable .

Since Banksys October 2013 " Better Out Than In " street art " residency " in New York , the gallery has been taking several of the notable pieces ( the cement sphinx , a snarky tag from- the back of a truck ) around to various fairs across the country . Though the gallery claims to be displaying ( and selling ) them under the guise of preservation , its dubious whether Banksy condoned the sale of these works or will be profiting from them . <p> Art Silicon Valley brought an unexpected experience to its suburban setting , and it seemed admittedly out of place to view Kehinde Wiley paintings or Andy Warhol originals in a convention center set amid strip malls . But its broad selection of experimental works and big-name pieces set the fair apart from other efforts to put San Francisco on the art map once again .
