It is quickly becoming one of my favorites , as it is a catalog of lessons I learned from a mentor of mine who first groomed me in the ways of the Game . <p> Now , I understand that this book is n't a catch-all . In fact , my favorite quality of this book is that it includes " reversal " additions to each chapter that serve to calibrate the law in varying circumstances . Obviously , 48 is an arbitrary number and the book 's value would not be diminished , had Greene decided to go with 37 ( or 50 , as he did with the book 's sequel ) . <p> My question is , which " laws " would you add to this book 's list ? And which ones do you think can be reduced to corollaries of other laws ? <p> I would take it more as an inspiration than as fact . Learn from his examples rather than his laws . Ultimately every situation is different which is why I like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All of the laws consolidate into these <p> 1 . General Awareness ( That girl looks bomb ) 2 . Knowledge of tools ( Different day game approaches ) 3 . Know your enemies/allies ( So ... Shes Muslim , Let me switch it up to be a bit more reserved ) 4 . Take action ( get her number , take her to gyros and smash in your car ) <p> For example law 31 , Control the options : get others to play the cards you deal . law 9 , Win through your actions , never through argument . law 20 , Do not commit to anyone . law 21 , Play a sucker to catch a sucker . <p> law 31 - Your girl wants to create drama , instead play ignorant and bide time law 9 - You know she 's beefing so you next time you see her you bring flowers and play extra nice . law 20 - If all goes bad , well your good , 500 million other options . law 21 - Dress well , look nice , smell good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good .

It focuses more on the general principles of seduction and why they work , rather than just a " to-do " list of tips and tricks to try . <p> 2 . It goes beyond just " seducing women " and explains the concepts in a more well-rounded context , and how they can be applicable to meeting friends , success in the business world , etc . <p> 3 . Plus it uses actual historical anecdotes to back it up , rather than just a bunch of pieces of ' advice ' that could have been plagiarized or made up entirely by some guy living in his basement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compiled from various concepts presented other by men throughout history is one thing , but on the subject of relations with women one should seek out the words of men who 've had an extensive and relatively successful history with them , and who speak from a personal experience standpoint . I do n't get the impression this is the case with Greene <p> When there are writings by other men who are sharing real experiences , there 's less of reason to bother with the men who are merely relaying concepts rather than sharing personal experience . <p> A guy can spend years reading concepts and it will do him little actual , practical good because he will never understand relations with women until he 's gone out and interacted with a bunch of them , banged a bunch of them , fought with them , and prevailed with them . <p> Reading posts by WIA , Giovonny , and many many other men here will put you in better position to have practical and real success with women than anything Robert Greene is regurgitating . His books do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in men , but they largely do n't get you closer to a real understanding . <p> Many times posts in here are just become a broken record , guys write the same stuff over and over just in different wording . I 'll read the book and then get back to tell you what I think . Did you read the book yourself GlobalMan ? Your post seems to be mostly about what the book should and should not be about , more than what 's actually written in the book . <p> Of course , you should read and decide for yourself what value it brings for you . <p> Yes I 've read some of it- never finished it . All stuff that I 've seen in different forms in various places many times . <p> What I said is of course my opinion on the matter of writings on seduction- other people may have different ideas obviously . <p> Though , it should n't be controversial to say it 's theory , not first hand lessons from a man in the trenches , and that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing little to enhance or change or give practical understanding to real life relations with women . <p> Something I 've been reading have thought me a lot , 48 laws of power for exempel , even though it is n't a book about game it still teaches a lot of things that are valuable when chasing girls . Models is a book which changed a lot in how I approach girls . Some shit have been a waste of time . Of course it does n't do much if one stays at home wanking , I agree with you on that too . <p> So this book has been recommended to me , but I personally know two people at the office who love this book and Machiavelli and get juicy at the concept of making power plays and they are the most unlikable people around . People are generally glad when these people leave teams and they tend to fit the classic " buddy fukker " mentality , where they 'll screw over their friends if they think they can leverage it into looking good , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's well written . Made me feel very smart reading it like I was in on a big secret . <p> Can I distill the laws as the Op asked ? Not so much .. I 've sat in book shops and watched people sit down and read it and no shit , without fail they start looking around the room over the book cover with this sly grin . Like they are the smartest motherfuckers ever . It had that effect on me as well but it is quite comical to watch . <p> Greene himself obviously thinks of himself as a modern day Machiavelli and basically states as much in one of his books . <p> The book did open my eyes to things I had n't understood properly before . I was involved in organised religion and could n't understand why and how things were going so drastically wrong for me within the organisation : this book explained it all and turned me on to red pill thinking . <p> Seduction is a very different book . I am very much not a lover/ seducer more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ) so I found his 33 strategies of war easiest to understand . Seduction the least , but there is gold there especially in terms of understanding seduction on a societal level . Advertising etc . Pretty rubbish from a gaming point of view IMO . <p> One thing about Greene he likes to bend the facts to suit his stories/ laws . In the war book he pitted smart Churchill against the Nazis to underline his points . But while Churchill was an inspirational leader he was also a bstshit warmonger who practiced self defence in advance of the day when the Germans ' came for him ' , which was impractical to say the least .. A big difference between the allies and the Nazis was that the allied General staff could safely ignore Churchill whilst Hitler appointed himself above more experienced and capable generals thus hamstringing his own army ... which was by far the best army in the war . Greene is way off in having Churchill outwitting the Germans - allied intelligence outwitted the Germans on D day . Churchill was an irrelevance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the Pyrenees .. Churchill wanted Auschwitz bombed the moment he knew about it . A noble sentiment and wish . The fact that anti Semitic elements of the foreign office managed to bury that plan shows how irrelevant Churchill really was to allied strategic manoeuvres . The fact that Greene plays fast and loose with his examples and their meaning calls his ' wisdom ' into question . He and the reader may not be as smart as they think . Hence perhaps the dipshit guys at work other posters mention . There is much much gold to be found though . .. The 50th Law seemed such a ludicrous cash in I never bothered reading it . Likewise mastery ... Hope this little review helps .. <p> Okay re read the original OP . The law I 'd add is this ... Quote from Kung Fu Series " Monkey Magic " ===='Evil requires Good in order to survive , once it has exhausted the good around it , it destroys itself " One of Grreenes quotes in 48 Laws on deception says something like " If he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simulate saintliness and devotion " Real virtue can be dismissed by the likes of Machiavelli but Sun Tzu had it down : a virtuous man is truly brave , and a truly calm man apprehends what a schemer is blind to .. <p> By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility .

@@96058858 @258858/ <p> I have been searching for a book like this for a long time . Donovan really breaks down masculinity to definable terms . He cites the difference between a " good man " and " being good at being a man . " It is very refreshing , given how many articles are floating with feminists trying to define masculinity . <p> Got the Kindle edition last week . It 's been at the top of my recommendations list for months , but I never bit b/c i thought it was another self-help type book . It 's not ! <p> Some of my highlights : <p> " Another problem with the complete intellectualization of masculinity is that intellectualized masculinity is pretty much equally accessible to women . Demonstrating your manliness to other men does n't mean much if women are doing all of the same things that men are doing . " <p> " Until you can function as a competent member of the group and carry your own weight , you are a supplicant and a drag on the collective . A child is a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Even today , many men will jump at the opportunity to harm a man who harms a female stranger . Because of this , many women can be assertive or make displays of gameness with relative impunity , and some become delusional about their ability to make good on their threats or defend themselves if their taunts result in violence . " <p> " Accepting the nature of men as it is and offering them equivalents to war is no longer acceptable to women or globalists . Their shared agenda has become the complete repudiation of the idea that men should want to do the things they 've been selected to do . " <p> I 'd second the recommendation for this book . It really gets down to the root of what makes men men .

He also notes how men will not take back their masculinity like women took control of enacting the 19th Amendment ... the reason is because we have alternative sources that make many men lazy while feeding our desires . These things are fake , but entertain many men 's brains into believing it is real : porn ( sexual desire ) , video games ( hunting/killing ) , sports ( allegiance to a tribe ) . <p> By the end of the book , I was simply more motivated to become a better man , not by the definition of feminists today , but rather the definition of the Way of Men .

Since Roosh does n't go into long-term relationships in Bang , I reckon its a decent follow-up for those that are looking into going long-term while staying IN control of the relationship . <p> I read it and enjoyed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or patterns to run or anything like that . But it can add to your overall portfolio of knowledge , which to me makes it worthwhile . <p> Greene 's book is about broader seduction - how ideas , personalities , and political movements seduce us . If you were trying to slowly turn a longtime friend into a lover , the advice is n't bad . If you were a celebrity trying to craft a new image , the ideas are n't bad . And if you want to read a lot of interesting history and stories , it 's a great book . <p> If you 're looking to bang a girl in under an hour , this is n't the book . If you want to slowly LTR someone , might be some good advice .

Your place will always be more comfortable/luxurious than theirs . <p> 2 . Possible opportunity to rob you of your valuables ( if they are short-term thinkers , need to leave the town , or if they believe there 's no serious chance between you two ) <p> 3 . Getting extra benefits ( waking up with someone in the same bed is intimate ; the longer they spend with you the more time they have to connect with you and game you for freebies , favors , later dates , full relationship , baby , marriage etc . ) <p> Denying them the full opportunity is denying them one of the main reasons they choose to have fun with you .

@@96058861 @258861/ <p> I do n't think that our American members fully realize the gravity of the migrant crisis unfolding in Europe in 2015 . <p> Here is brief recap : <p> 1 . So-called " migrants " from third world countries are storming Europe in historically unprecedented numbers . The number is in thousands daily . Most of them are from Syria , Iraq , Iran , Libya , Afghanistan , Albania/Kosovo ( all Islamic countries ) . Then there are those from sub-Saharan Africa ( Congo , Mali , Nigeria , etc. etc . ) <p> 2 . The original entry points were via Mediterranean sea towards Italy and Spain , but in the last few months there was a notable shift towards the quickest overland route : Turkey &gt; Greece &gt; Macedonia &gt; Serbia &gt; Hungary &gt; EU countries deemed rich/with open multiculturalist policies/with good welfare ... so vast majorities eventually end up in Austria , Germany , Scandinavia , Netherlands/Belgium , France/Italy/Spain , and the UK . <p> 3 . In typical EU fashion governments are unable to do much except to watch things unfold while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the EU leader , claimed that it will receive over 800,000 asylum claimants in this year alone . A few days after that statement , Germany issued a jarring new policy saying that all claimants from Syria will now be processed as legit ... basically inviting the entire country of Syria to move into Germany . Angela Merkel followed that with the statement that " Islam belongs in Germany " . <p> Schenghen rules ( Lisboa rules ) out of window , free for all . <p> Gates of Vienna , apparently , are now wide open with a stroke of vassal pen . <p> 4 . One notable characteristic of this crisis is that most migrants are able-bodied men 18-50 . And they are arrogant ( and at times very hostile ) bunch with immediate entitlement issues as soon as they step on the European soil . Again , this is not a typical refugee fleeing the war ... this is smart-phone enabled migrant looking for the biggest tite to suck . <p> Another characteristic is that none are moving into Turkey and other Islamic countries . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Because images of hordes of unwashed masses ending up in your neighborhoods overnight is a tough pill to swallow for many current Europeans ( even if subconsciously ) , the Cathedral is busy crafting comical PR campaigns . <p> Here are three basic examples : <p> a ) The image of drowned Syrian boy ( false flag ? ) who washed ashore the Turkish beach is overused as a symbol of migrants struggle . Even if that event was not manufactured purposefully , we are manipulated to cry for one lost boy ( this coming largely from pro-choice liberals ) while ignoring a million ( millions ) of adults finding their way . <p> b ) Recent NPR ( PR ? ) report featured a story of a middle-aged ( being middle aged is deemed safe/non-aggressive , at par with teddy bears ) Syrian ( read : legit ) dude who worked in high tech in Dubai ( notice the ' white collar work in another Islamic country ' angle ) but who could n't have his family join him there ( bring on the violins ) because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Germany to re-unite with them ( again , more strings ) . The report ends with a story of a Syrian woman ( legit ) and her babies ( aww , lil darlings ) struggling to get to EU after losing everything ( oooh , poor things ) . <p> Consequences of these events will be wide-reaching and all-encompassing for the future of Europe . As they gather strength through numbers and power , ideologically suspect and sexually frustrated imports will increasingly be resorting to terrorist acts to air their misplaced grievances . The Europe of future will resemble third world ( low economic opportunities , crime-infested , corruption/bribery , daily violence ... ) Some things will change practically overnight . Some will change with time . Intermingling and intermarrying will become " new normal " , what 's left of pure will be diluted , and the new European will be a mongrel without roots and sense of singular history and tradition , just like the Zionists masters devised it . <p> And if you think this is n't a part of the bigger plan , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 20 years ago . <p> The EU 's leaders ( mostly leftist " progressives " with lots of " feminists " too ) are acting criminally and directly against what is actually good for the native inhabitants and have been doing it for many decades now . <p> In my opinion they should be accused of committing a form of genocide and/or " ethnic cleansing " of their own native inhabitants . If you did what they are doing in other third world countries that 's what it would be called , no matter the method employed in effecting the change . In my honest opinion its somewhat of a crime against humanity . <p> Meanwhile these bureaucrats in the EU pat themselves on the back and cry for more of the destruction they have already wrought on their people , economicly , socially and culturally ( ! ) . <p> Never looked more forward to moving out of the UK than now .

During travel sometimes we get sick , have diarrhea and what not , but do n't think much of it . I know my biggest concerns traveling is some sort of STD but again they are curable for the most part . Something like this however , at least initially to me prior to realizing it is not that serious was shocking to me . Essentially , I had no idea whatsoever I had a tapeworm growing inside me , for really who knows what period of time . <p> About a week ago I started having some stomach pains and nausea , but no diarrhea or vomiting or other effects . It was a cramping , knotting feeling that would come and go at random times . I constantly had the feeling I wanted to throw up , including a watery mouth but never did .

I go take a shit , and when I 'm done I start to wipe and notice a foot long string or noodle hanging out of my asshole . What the fuck I think . I try to wipe it out and it is stuck . I think I may have ingested some rope or maybe some noodle from the night before as I had pad thai ? So I pull it , and it keeps coming . And coming . It 's fucking endless and it is the weirdest feeling pulling something out of your asshole . Then I realize ... it 's a fucking tapeworm ! I keep pulling and get about 4-5 feet out ( I 'm not exaggerating ) , start sweating out of nervousness and call a relative who is in med school and my doctor . They calm me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally pull it to a point where it breaks and I clean up and exit the bathroom , saving a piece of the tapeworm ( about a foot 's length ) to take into the doc . <p> Eventually I get the doc on the phone and am told not to worry too much , to bring in the tapeworm sample , and given it 's description it is likely from eating undercooked or raw fish from Scandanavia , the Baltics or Western Russia . When I do google research the tapeworm that came out of me matches the fish kind and coincides with those regions . Well I was just in Estonia in August ... <p> But then I realized I have had a hard time putting on any weight whatsoever in a few years . How long have I had this thing ? ? ? I was in Russia the year before and in Scandinavia and Russia the year before that . I just pulled 4+ feet out of myself before it broke off , so who knows how much more is in there and thus how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doc today and they took stool samples to confirm , but looking at it they were almost certain it was the fish kind from the areas mentioned .

Overall though , not a big deal since it does n't seem to have any long lasting effects going forward ... now that I found out about it . <p> I 'll keep you guys updated , but just wanted to give you guys a heads up . This is hardly anything to really worry about , but at the same time should not be glanced over . If you 've been traveling and have had stomach issues , keep this in mind .

His career takes him all over the world from Munich , Germany to the UK and finally to his permanent home , Los Angeles California . <p> This book is extremely inspiring . The most valuable part about this book is the way Arnold clearly lays down his mindset . <p> When you read it , you feel inspired , not just to lift heavy weights at the gym , but to work your ass off in whatever goal or endeavor that you may be pursuing . The relentless dedication and fierce ambition that Arnold had is simply unmatched .

Always seek pain in what you do , because pain leads to pleasure . That 's true of life inside the weight room and outside of the weight room .

One of these was my self-confidence , which grew as I saw how much control I was gaining over my body . In two or three years I had actually been able to change my body entirely .

I wanted to learn from them , to get more information and - ultimately - to beat them It was a fact that up until then America had produced most of the best bodybuilders in the world . Since the percentage had been so high , I thought there must be a reason . Perhaps it was knowledge , or better food , or better drugs .

With acting , now , I am determined to work as hard as removing my accent as i was on improving my poor calves.The same with business I 'm so determined to make millions of dollars that I can not fail . In my mind I 've already made the millions ; now it 's just a matter of going through the motions . " <p> WORKOUT AND DIET The workouts outlined in this book are tough . Fitting , as the intensity of these workouts fit Arnold 's intense personality .

You should not be dabbling in the more advanced workout routines or else risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Training <p> Give your full concentration to each exercise . <p> Good form is more important than the number of repetitions . Add more resistance as you get stronger , but never at the expense of good exercise form . <p> After your workout , stand in front of the mirror and check your body - make an honest assessment of your training . <p> Maintain a positive mental attitude at all times . <p> You must eat well and get adequate sleep when you are on a serious bodybuilding program . <p> Bodyweight Workout This is meant to be a foundational workout program that you do before you hit the barbells- you can work all the muscles in the body with simple bodyweight exercises . Moreover , you can build a decent body with these basic exercises and never enter the gym . <p> Cardio - Jogging and/or Swimming Beginner 's Barbell Workout Even though Arnold 's workouts are famous for being long and grueling , this basic workout is relatively low volume . Each workout lasts 45-60 minutes . It is very similar to Reg Park 's ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In my opinion , the volume and number of sets could be lowered in most of the exercises for more optimal gains . <p> Accelerated Six Days a WeekAn important note : This routine should not be done by natural , drug-free athletes .

@@96058866 @258866/ <p> I was having a disagreement with a buddy of mine on how the laws of age of consent impact US Citizens in foreign countries , so I 'd like some help from the board to make sure I am clear on this law . <p> Here is the law : <p> " The Protect Act of 2003 prohibits U.S. citizens and legal residents from illicit sexual conduct including commercial sex with anyone under 18 , and non-commercial sex with persons under 16 when there is at least a four-year age difference or the person is under 12 years of age . The law applies even if the country in which the sexual acts take place has a lower age of consent . " <p> Now , my understanding form above is this : <p> 1 . No US Citizen can have commercial sex ( aka P4P sex ) with anyone under 18 -- anywhere in the world ! <p> 2 . When the girl is NOT A PRO ( P4P ) , like a normal girl working as a hairstylist , even if the local age of consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizen who is 21+ older , can not have sex with her , or he risks being charged with statutory rape - even though teh local law is 15 for age of consent ! <p> 2a . A US citizen 21+ CAN LEGALLY HAVE SEX with a 16 year old if the age of consent of that country is at least 16 . So , a 30 year-old man can have sex with a 16 year old girl so long as she is not a hooker , AND the local law of consent is at least 16 . <p> Based on the letter of the law as you posted it I would say that you are correct . Non-commercial sex means not P4P so if you 're not paying for it it 's legal to have sex with a 16 year-old as long as you 're not violating any local age-of-consent laws . <p> My impression , based on the reading I 've done on this topic , is that 2a is correct as written-if she is 16 or older , you 're home-free . This does , in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen abroad 16 ( assuming local laws do not specify a higher age ) . <p> What exactly are the viewpoints we 're talking about here , though ?

@@96058872 @258872/ <p> While 99.9% of TV these days is complete garbage , I recently stumbled upon a rare gem . The show is called House of Cards . It is put out exclusively by Netflix . Kevin Spacey is the lead and he plays Francis Underwood , the U.S. House Majority Whip . <p> The show opens with the scene of a dog getting hit by a hit and run driver . Spacey goes up to the dog and then looks to the camera and in monologue says , " There are two kinds of pain . The sort of pain that makes you strong , or useless pain . The sort of pain that is only suffering . I have no patience for useless things . " He then proceeds by strangling the dog . <p> The setting takes place in Washington D.C. , minutes after a new President-elect has been decided . Spacey 's character is slated to be the new Secretary of State , but as you will see , things take a dramatic for the worse . This is where Spacey is faced with a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to take control of the situation and seize power . <p> I had done a forum search and I found that only one poster had referenced Francis Underwood ( as being alpha ) , but I would strongly consider everyone to look deeper into this show . Seemingly every episode offers a glimpse into the Machiavellian madness of Spacey 's character . <p> There are many great characters worth analyzing , but Spacey 's wife , Claire , probably provides the best example of your contemporary woman . There is a very powerful scene in episode 6 , where a man who used to be their body guard , is on his death bed and he professes his undying love for her while he begins to openly hate on her husband at the same time . Since many might not see this show , let me quote what she says to this guy while on his death bed ... <p> " You know what Francis said to me when he proposed ? I remember his exact words . He said , ' Claire , if all you want is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a couple of kids and count the days until retirement . I promise you freedom from that , I promise ... you 'll never be bored . ' And you know ... he was the only man , and there were a lot of others who proposed , but he was the only one , who understood me . He did n't put me on some pedestal . He knew that I did n't want to be adored or coddled . So he took my hand , and he put a ring on it , because he knew I 'd say yes . He 's a man who knows how to take what he wants . " <p> This was just one memorable scene , but damn , the whole show is littered with practical applications of Red Pill wisdom . I strongly recommend you to check it out . I could go on with pages of great quotes I 've gotten from the show , but I will leave that for you to decide for yourself . <p> " Despite their numbers , their pussyness means I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , no big deal .

@@96058876 @258876/ <p> This is something i 'm struggling with . I feel like I 've met the right girl . But I wonder if I 'm with her will I get bored ? Guys who have been or are in a serious long term relationship please chime in . <p> The French model , people get and stay married , and discreetly fuck around if they need to . <p> Realistic disciplined and orderly without being puritanical . Also , the French birt rate is not in the toilet like white America as far as I know . Capitalist economies are designed to keep men AND women working unless you are a 1%-er , and having kids with one parent has proven bad outcomes except maybe in Scandinavia where they really have their socialist shit together . <p> The problem in America is the worship of total honesty . If a 50 YO guy who still loves the 40 YO wife who gave him three kids wants to fuck an 18 year old , maybe for money , evey couple weeks , why should n't he ? It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stifling office paying for all that for 35 years straight with 2 weeks a year off . <p> However , it 's also unrealistic to expect the 40 year old wife to accept him coming home and telling her how hot the 18 year old was . <p> === <p> As for the question of whether you 'd be satisfied with one-- sometimes it 's not " What do you WANT ? " but what can you GET . Postive thinking is great but I 'll bet you you wo n't be banging blond teen American cheerleaders at 75 . And please do n't reason from the exception like women do ! ! ( Jack Nicholson for instance ) <p> I 'm realizing the guys reading this forum who are hopping from one hot chick to the next are pretty extreme outliers , maybe the top fraction of 1% of young men , and even they have to learn special social skills such as are discussed here .

Do any of you guys who 've been with a lot of girls feel the same way , that sometimes you and a girl just connect on another level ? <p> The most dangerous statement in the English language is " THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT " ---it never is . You are most likely being fooled by your biology--which is playing tricks on you right now . When people " fall in love " the brain produces special chemicals which produce extreme pleasure . This usually lasts 6 months to 2 years . From an evolutionary biology perspective this is to get the male and female to mate , produce offspring , and raise them together . <p> That is why people far hard in love--then as time passes and the brain gets bored it stops producing these love chemicals at the same high levels . It is natural . The brain needs stimulation ( different women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same person day after day year after year gets old no matter how much you try to spice things up . <p> SOLUTION . Keep the girl you currently like/love whatever . Never marry her . Never move in with her . See her 1-2 times a week and see other women a few times a month . You will have the steady supply of sex with the girl you really like/love and the occasional fling with a new hamster which keeps your sex life exciting and game intact . <p> Eventually she will demand a formal **32;0;TOOLONG and want to move in and you will have to refuse . It will be hard , but then you move on to a new girl . There is all ways another one . <p> That seems to be my future . I have been in an 19 month relationship with an older woman .

Does she cook , clean , have a decent job to support herself , make you feel good about yourself , really care for you , support your goals/dreams ? <p> Would she still love/like you if you lost your job and were destitute , or terminally i 'll ? It is great to like people when things are good ( and you can take her places , buy her stuff , etc ) , but most people do n't stay around during the bad times ( except family ) .

There are no magic pills , buttons to push or How-To guides . Activities , surprises , creating larger social circles , this all can contribute to giving you a CHANCE .

@@96058879 @258879/ <p> This podcast explores the decline of nightlife ( bars and clubs ) from 2001 to 2017 . I first establish a baseline of the absurdly low level of game you needed in the past to succeed compared to what you need now , followed by an analysis of 15 observations that show how we have objectively suffered a decline . I close out the podcast by discussing how to solve the problems posed by a declining nightlife to still maintain a healthy sex life , which include being industrious and open-minded to alternate forms of game .

Night game is still possible , but the ROI is generally lower . <p> Everything is connected to the smartphone , where the smartphone goes bad stuff happens . <p> I have always been better at night game as I am a night owl , there is just so much lost on apps like tinder , you do n't  get an opportunity to sell yourself if she does n't  give you the chance to talk and even then text is nothing like being there in person . <p> I did try tinder for a while and had moderate success , however a lot of the girls showed up looking totally different to their pictures , yet these same girls will have requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie their ass off to you . <p> I really miss the good old days of 90 's and early 00 's , I too did the crotch dance and it worked , women were turned on by it for the most part .

In the touristic places , simply there is not many tourist girls , and there is an excedentary number of thirsty tourist guys , burning the oxygen of these places .

@@96058890 @258890/ <p> The week around Easter I spent in the south of Europe , more specifically the small mediterranean island country Malta . With roughly 415,000 inhabitants it is not one of Europe 's most prominent and well-known , but if one takes into account geographic location , architecture , language ( English is official language in parallel with Maltese ) , scenery and modern versus traditional layers of culture , then it is indeed one of the best locations that the Western hemisphere has to offer . My five main observations may indicate why I make that assertion . <h> 1 . It is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing <p> After visiting around 45- countries around the world ( including more than 20 in Europe ) I have seen a lot , and it does not take much of an effort to compare hard data , talk to several locals , and keep your eyes open and digest your impressions before you make value judgments about a particular location 's general quality . Especially if it is a smaller one . <p> Overall Malta is visually speaking quite impressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , Italy and Spain in that regard . From the baroque-esque Old Town ( Medina and Rabat are closely intertwined ) , to the capital Valletta 's imposing framing and manifold Catholic churches , viewpoints and gardens , to the Blue lagoon on Comino Island , and the majestic cliffs of Gozo , a variety of archaic eye candy manifests itself . The cloudless sky and temperatures well above 20 degrees Celsius , which emerge in April , serve to magnify this effect . <p> It is not hard to understand why the producers behind Game of Thrones chose Malta as one of the main shooting spots for the first season . Unfortunately the famous Azure Window has recently fallen , but the area in its entirety is nevertheless as impressive as ever before . <h> 2 . It is cheap for being a wealthy European country <p> Just as there are palpable differences between countries , there are also striking ditto within them . For being a first-world country " Malta 's economy has grown rapidly since the early 1990 's and it has been part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels in a European context . Prices are roughly 50 percent of those of Norway and Switzerland , and about 60 percent in comparison to for instance U.K. France , Spain , Italy , Germany and Sweden . Perhaps Poland is its closest equivalent in this respect . <p> These differences will be mostly emphasized in transportation , accommodation , price- of clothes and shoes , and consumption of local foodstuffs . <p> For example , a Tallinja card costs only 20 Euros for one week of bus travel , which is a very reasonable price , although of course many other countries or cities likewise offer reduced prices for seven- days of local transportation . To travel with bus is not as pleasant as in Sweden or Germany , but overall it is safe and largely reliable . <h> 3. - The girls are beautiful <p> During my four days in Malta , I could not walk for more than 10 minutes before I saw 8s , and occasionally 9s , walking down the street or whatever location they popped up at . Anecdotal evidence is what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be that slim olive-skinned Sicilian waitress at the pizza restaurant , the 20-something Spanish girl who looked like a younger version of Scarlett Johansson swimming in the Blue lagoon , the stunningly beautiful young Maltese girl with dark long hair , the busty Arab in her late teens , the married ones with an elegant conservative penchant , and occasionally some Scandinavian talent as well . The rare combination of a slim body and big breasts were particularly widespread . <p> Whether local or not , Malta is seriously brimming with hotties between 18 " 30 years old . Here one finds the quintessence of the Euro girl ( 90 percent of people , whether local or visitor , are European , while the rest consists mainly of Middle Eastern , Asian and black people ) . <p> Only better , being a moderately modern country ( or in other words a hybrid of traditional and modern elements ) , it is one of those places where you see both younger and older men with better looking women at their side . The same short and out of shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income , who struggles to land a 6 in the U.S. or UK , is calmly sauntering around with his hard 8 of a wife or girlfriend in the streets of Valletta or St. Julians . <p> During Easter , the celebration of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ took place as most shops and stores were closing down . Both older and younger people assembled in the beatific , even ethereal St. Paul 's cathedral , and watched the recurrent Via Dolorosa parade along the narrow streets of the capital . <p> If one is a Christian , Roman Catholic in particular , Malta could be a place to raise a more traditional family , while at the same time using the fertile soil for worldly success too . Regardless , just for the sake of cultural experience it is worth a visit around this time of the year . <h> In Summary <p> Overall Malta appears to be a quite good country in many significant ways . Like with all locations there are upsides and downsides , but if one makes a list of them the totality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young or experienced player , or an older male who disregards game , one should seriously consider a temporary or permanent relocation here .

External organs are not influenced by body size or height , whereas internal organs are . <p> RE : Guess which race of women scientifically have the smallest , strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrote : 1st post and 1st thread , and its on race . <p> Bold move 49874 @qwx909874 49877 @qwx909877 <p> RE : Guess which race of women scientifically have the smallest , strongest &amp; tighte ... <p> ( 07-13-2016 08:48 PM ) nomadbrah Wrote : I do n't know about that , theoretically perhaps but Asian women are smaller and a 5 ' foot girl is going to be tight .

@@96058907 @258907/ <p> We originally met at the beginning of the year . Since then we 've flirted when seeing each other ( occasionally ) in the workspace , but nothing outside of that . This changed a little over a month ago . <p> Long story short - She invited me out to drink with another co-worker after hours and ended up coming back to my apartment with me after the other co-worker left . I should mention that she initiated all of this . When we got back to the apartment , we made out heavily on the bed and got to second base . She then excused herself out since it was getting late . <p> A follow up happened yet again two nights ago . She invited me out to drink with her alone . Yet again , she initiated and asked if we could go back to my apartment . This time we got all of the clothes off I fingered her/gave her oral . No reciprocation though from her other than some dick rubbing when we made out . Yet again , she excused herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kicker is that she has admitted that she had ONS 's from a Vegas trip and another from a random guy on a night out . I do n't care that she has ONS 's . What does get me is that she has not gone all the way , even after we 've known each other for a bit and on top of that she has been with me two times in a sexual context . She also puts up a bit of resistance when trying to escalate to the next bases as well . <p> What do I need to do to get the bang next time ? Any advice ? <p> Also thought I would mention : <p> -She has initiated the heavy make out sessions with me in public on our times out as well . <p> -She constantly likes to tell me how much other guys hate it when I talk to her or roll by at work . She brings this up quite a bit and gets off on it pretty well . <p> -Her being a co-worker is nothing to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not commit and references me being with other women , especially when she is in my apartment and we are hooking up . <p> ( 04-29-2017 08:55 PM ) kaotic Wrote : WHEN IN DOUBT WHIP IT OUT , take that bad boy out and have her play with it . <p> Agreed .

I 've only invited her out once and she flaked . I can understand why she did though because it was not a 1 on 1 and she might have felt uncomfortable since there were other co-workers there who she had not drank with before . <p> 2 ) Exactly . While she 's initiated the meetings and hook ups , it does feel like she just wants to be wanted when she might not be getting chased/fucked at the moment . She 's at least getting ONS 's and tons of attention from the thirsty-ass married guy " competition " in the workspace at a bare minimum . It would n't be surprising if she 's also getting consistent fucking from someone who has n't been mentioned too . While I do n't care if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting it and am on the lower rung of the totem . Especially since I 'm a pretty good looking and personable guy as well . <p> The unknown variable is how unaggressive I 've been with her in general . Especially with setting up future dates and also initiating texting conversations outside of work . I will say the times she invited me out in were when we were already texting and she took might have taken advantage of that . <p> At this point , I 'm split on what to do . <p> I could take a(nother) shot , be aggressive , invite her out , and escalate the fuck out of it and go for broke . Or maybe I should soft next/flake on her and if she persists , try again and give her a hard next if she does n't give it up one last time . <p> Look , you came pretty close to banging her and it did n't happen . It 's easy to put the pussy on a pedestal at that point because you got so close and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably her game . Do n't play that game . <p> Turn your attention to the other women that walk this earth . Forget this one . She had her chance with you . She blew it ( by not blowing it , if you 're looking for a pun ) . <p> " ' FWB ' wo n't do anything with me other than an unenthusiastic rub .... " Seems like you 're missing the " Benefits " part of that equation . The Vegas guy was interesting enough to warrant a ONS--have you friendzoned yourself ? Maybe give it another shot <p> When it comes to girls , I 'm of the mind it 's better to blow yourself out going for it than wasting your time waiting around for something to happen . Cast a wide net , talk to as many girls as possible , be bold , and you 're bound to bang one of them sooner or later .

@@96058913 @258913/ <p> Currently , I have two 1920x1080 , 24 " monitors in dual screen setup . I use it for my day job , but I 've had my eye on upgrading my PC rig to 4K for the sole purpose of grabbing a single large screen , and getting rid of my dual screens , as the bezel in the middle of the setup is annoying when you 're dragging windows around . <p> I 'm not a huge PC gamer , so refresh rate is n't the biggest thing for me , as I 'm going to be a larger monitor or TV for productivity or occasional movie watching . Has anyone here bought a 40 " or larger monitor ( or TV ) and used it for their PC rig ? What 's your experience been using a bigger screen ? Is it 4k ? Thoughts ? <p> For work it might not be worth the extra expense of a 4k monitor unless it reduces eye strain or you work with video , perhaps . It 's probably geared more towards video watching . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I seriously hope you are not ) or have a game which requires it , you may find more than two monitors a bit of overkill . Everyone I know who 's tried going from one monitor to two loves it , but beyond that it reaches a point of diminishing returns . I just sold one of mine after using three monitors for a while - took up too much desk space anyway . I could never go back to just one big one . Two helps organize things a bit , I find . <p> Nope , not into day trading . I work in content creation , web development and other areas where extra screen real estate can simplify workflows and speed up your process . You 're running a two monitor setup , do you have any particular software that keeps things sorted , or just the standard graphics card drivers/monitor software ? <p> If you like the versatility and real estate of having multiple displays , then having one large one is not going to be an adequite replacement . The reason being this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albeit a larger one . If you like having multiple windows open at the same time , you will have to manually adjust the window size to fit next to eachother on a single desktop display , and they will have to be a sort of portrait orientation ( taller than they are wide ) . <p> The only good a 4k screen will do you is having higher resolution . This will give you sharper picture , but if you are trying to read small font , the higher resolution will just make it look a lot smaller unless you are sitting close . <p> Multi-monitor setups are great for coding . I got a 4K thinking I 'd switch to a single monitor but now I use the 4K and a 1920x1280 side by side . I do my coding on the 4k monitor and do command line tasks on the 1920x1280 . <p> Windows 10 has built-in quadrant control , so the need to manually drag and re-size windows should n't be an issue .

But then again , some people just like the " cool factor " , so there 's always that . <p> A 24 " 1920X monitor has about perfect pixel pitch . Larger monitors in 1920 are n't ideal .

Once you are used to it , it is difficult to go back . <p> Eye strain considerations are paramount for me , and using a flicker free monitor is non-negotiable at this point .

Though , I can manage multitasking two things at once with this setup . It 's just a fit that is a little tighter than maybe I would like . I 'd rather have two tasks full-screen on two monitors . <p> It 's fine for watching videos full screen at a distance of perhaps 2.5 to 3 feet where my desk chair sits , but I find myself wanting to eventually scale up in size for that purpose ( who does n't like a larger TV ) . I have a 50 inch television in the living room that I do n't currently use because of how much of a difference that I recently realized that flicker free monitors make to how I feel and sleep . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get around to replacing and scaling up with other flicker free monitors/televisions .

I play when my nephews come over and I only wish for more size when playing a driving sim because these games are invariably more immersive as the screen gets larger . <p> I 'll probably look at one or two 27 inch higher resolution monitors next , but if there is n't anything available that fits my needs within a reasonable price ( maybe equal to or below around $550 ) then I 'll likely pick up an additional 24 inch that meets my needs ( and a larger flicker free television for the living area ) .

It just seems like an attempt to slander him further. , during a Powerpoint presentation about the alleged academic misconduct . <p> In all , five women came forward with complaints about Hoyle , which included claims he inappropriately touched and tried to kiss them . <p> Hoyle ' took advantage ' of students <p> Each of the meetings were set up after UC staff noticed an essay question from the curriculum posted to an essay purchasing site . Still no word on whether they actually plagiarized . This should be answered , as any plagiarism would indicate a very strong motive for them all falsely accusing him . <p> One student claimed Hoyle had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when he raised the concerns about plagiarism he said " we can make this go away " . <p> Hoyle maintained the porn sites appeared when the woman 's assignment was tested for plagiarism , and he had shown her the presentation he was preparing to show his boss in making the case about students cheating . <p> Prosecutor Trent Hickey told the court Hoyle had exploited the students ' concerns about failing and compromising their studies , as well as their vulnerability because of poor English language skills . <p> She was cross-examined ( how they still allow this in ++ber-leftwing Canberra is beyond me , but thankfully they do ) and admitted her parents had spent squillions on her education . Presumably Asian student with bad English , huge pressure from mom and dad back home , and she had failed the subject three times . Then she 's picked up for possible plagiarism. 
@@96058917 @258917/ <p> Hey everyone , I 'm on my fifth day in Bucharest and I have some initial impressions and insights and those familiar with this country and its girls , hopefully you can chime in with helpful suggestions . There 's good news and some bad news , but first about myself : <p> I 'm in my mid 30 's , decent looking Asian guy who looks 25 . People always think I 'm a college student . I 've spent a lot of time in Poland , with some brief stints in Ukraine , Czech Republic , and Iceland . I dabble a bit in day game , night game and some internet dating sites as well as social circle if I can get some good integration . Just to see what works best . I have a full time remote job , so a week of me staying in a place equals to about 2 days devoted to gaming . Anyways , here goes : <p> Pros <p> - Romanian girls look pretty good . Romania is as close as you can get to brunette paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even tall . Kind of like a blend of east europe and latin look . Some girls will look more Mediterranean and others more east european . There are a few real blondes here and there , and while most girls wo n't have the striking aesthetic pop of light hair and blue eyes , I do n't have any complaints really . <p> - For a capital city in a large sized european country , there are n't many foreigners at all . I feel quite exotic and girls do give me prolonged glances quite often , almost on par with what I get in a smaller city in Poland . For some reason , Bucharest is this major city yet it gets overlooked and its great . The girls even smile at me and they seem pretty sweet overall . <p> - People are really into partying . I was in old town on weekdays and even on a Sunday , there were clubs and good sized crowds . You can pretty much get nightlife action and see lots of hotties any night of the week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . <p> - I 'm getting better looking prospects than I did in Poland .

Poland just does't have that many solid cuties , mostly decent , kind of cute girls . The hot polish girls take some effort it seems . <p> Cons <p> - Bucharest is a seriously dirty city . There 's dog shit , bird shit and decaying infrastructure . It can be a pretty nice city if the caretakers put in some effort .

Yet at the same time they wo n't do much to help out a stranger . And seem kind of pissy when you want them to just provide basic service . Whereas in Poland , people will go out of their way to help you and make sure everything is ok . But poles wo n't touch your arm or your back when you 're introduced or getting acquainted . Kind of a weird contrast . <p> - OK , so here 's the big hitch about Romania : there 's a huge degree of slut shaming pervasive in their culture .

And even though they are eastern orthodox , it seems to have the same effect as what you see in Catholic countries . Tight social groups and one night stands do n't really happen . You 're going to have to get the girl on a date and take it from there . <p> Roosh 's travel data sheet on Romania is pretty spot on and helped me recognize the patterns and what i had to do . I literally had to stand around and wait for an opening , like when a girl goes for a drink by herself or to the restroom . Separating her from her gal pal group is nearly impossible when her social circle is entrenched in partying and socializing . <p> - On the flip side , there is a benefit . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief moment and getting her number is basically worthless since other guys will be able to deepen their rapport , so you 'll easily be forgotten . <p> But since a Romanian girl really ca n't go full seduction with you upon first meeting you , you can just talk 5 minutes , get her number and follow up . A lot of times , the girl will respond and go out with you . Kind of amazing actually . That happened with the first cutie I met , we barely chatted for like 2 minutes . And like Roosh mentioned , she made an excuse for us to exchange contacts . We 've chatted and have a date set up later this week . <p> My huge fail <p> Even with that knowledge I still utterly messed up a few hours ago . I had this cutie eyeing me and we danced close , she touched me very affectionately , and she seemed into it for like 40 minutes .

Usually in Poland one thing can lead to another and so its worth a shot at least . <p> Instead , the initial positive energy began to wane and eventually petered out .

I knew I screwed up when I asked her what her plans were for tomorrow and she replied " You have my Facebook and you can message me , I do n't know yet . " Basically , it was her way of saying , let 's just pick up where we left off tomorrow or at another time . I should have just left right there , while I was still kind of on a high note .

Your pros and cons seem right on . <p> Yes , there are n't that many tourists in that city , yet , I did n't feel like girls saw me as unique or exotic . However , you 're Asian and I 'm Middle Eastern . You definitely will stand out more in that country . <p> Regarding the clubs being in old town . Yes , majority of the bars are located in this old town . I guess they also call that area " Lipscani " . But the major clubs , some being even crazier than clubs in Vegas , can be outside of that small 1 mile diameter .

One of the highlights of my life so far . Planned on staying for a week , ended up there for close to 3 months . I think my experience greatly differed from those I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went there as a 21 year old by myself b ) I was a bit of a loose unit <p> Before I entered the country I read up on all the venues in Bucharest in Roosh 's datasheet pack . I thought I had Romanian women ' solved ' before I already got there . I did n't . Here are a few things I learned in my stay in Romania that I carry to this day 2+ years later : <p> 1 . Romanian girls are among some of the most beautiful in the whole worldFresh off a plane from London ( and never before travelled to EE ) , I was gobsmacked at the sheer beauty of Romanian women . Walking around the day I 'd regularly see tall , thin girls with long hair and curves in the right places . <p> 2 . If you want to fuck local girls while travelling ... stay at an airbnb rather than a hostelFor most guys on the forum , this seems like basic knowledge if searching around the forum . I was travelling on a budget and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying at hostels in my 6 weeks of travelling through London and Bangkok . While this was n't a ' fluke ' ... relying on going back to the girl 's place or taking them back to a hostel bed to fuck is n't a high percentage play . <p> Getting laid in high volume is in good part logistics . How are you supposed to get laid in high volume if you do n't even have your own room ? <p> 3 . Hone-in your first and second date strategiesFor my first week in Bucharest , I was regularly hitting up the forum for advice on girls that I was taking out on dates . Looking back at it now , my problem was simple : my ' date game ' was absolute horseshit . <p> By this time I 'd bedded around 30 girls total after a couple of years learning game . However besides a few LTRs - none of these were from traditional dating . I was n't confident in my strategy for dates and girls sensed this and lost interest . <p> In saying this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where I really learned there is n't one cookie-cutter method for getting laid - whether overseas , or back home in the West . I started reading Roosh when I was 19 , so when I saw he mentioned there being ' no one-night stand culture ' in Romania ... I followed his advice to a T. <p> After I got my apartment via airbnb in order after a week in hostels , I was certain I was going to get my Romanian flag . First night , after I settle in , I hit the town and meet a fun Romanian 7 with a slim yet curvy body and big brown eyes . We spend around 2 hours with each other after meeting early at El Dictador earlier in the evening . I say I 'm a bit tired and we walk past my apartment in the Old Town . <p> Me ( after a few too many beers with the idea of there being no ' one-night-stand culture ' in Romania firmly in my head ) : " Alright , I guess I 'll see you around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains are running to my place " Me : " Hurr durr something something - I 'll see you later " Her : *confused as fuck* " Um , alright bye " <p> Thankfully , I did end up fucking this girl ( who ended up being my first Romanian mini-relationship ) ... but the next day I was thinking of why I acted like such a chode . Very funny looking back over 2 years later . <p> The next night I met a 25 year old at Control Club who invited me back to her place . The night after I met two 19 year olds at Goblin who I invited back to mine . My Romanian flag was more than retrieved and my stay in Romania greatly improved once I removed this limiting belief . <p> 5 . Do n't go to student towns in the summer holiday periodMy trips to Cluj and Brasov , although my stays were both very nice and somewhat short in duration , resulted in zero lays in my time here . <p> 6 . Costinesti and Vama Veche are goldmines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( beach on the black sea ) for about 3 weeks toward the end of summer and it 's the closest thing I 've come to pussy paradise . Comparable to a Romanian version of spring break . One big BYO beach party . <p> Competition is low because mostly hipster dudes but the girls were great . The first 8+ girl I 've banged was during my time spent here . <p> Word of warning : a lot of the girls that come to these beach parties are quite young ( many still in high school ) . Double check ages of girls before doing anything dumb . Even as a 21 year old I felt a bit strange when I found out a girl I slept with was 17 ( eventually found out age of consent in Romania is 15 luckily ) . <p> <p> There 's much more of Eastern Europe I 'm yet to see ( currently saving towards a trip over there for next year ) , but Romania was a great starting point and eye opener as a young man . 
@@96058920 @258920/ <p> I 've noticed with some girls that they do this thing where they say things to kind of mess with you or say something and want you to do the opposite . This gets confusing for someone like me because not all girls do this and it can cause me to me miss out on a lay or mess up on ever getting that lay for being over zealous . How do you tell when a girl wants you to do the opposite of what they mean . For example , I am a very touchy and personable person , I always shake hands or hug my friends . This one girl acted put off whenever I tried to hug her and always hugged me with one arm . Eventually , I found out from her friends that she loved it when I hugged her and I then would tease her and always grab her second arm and make her hug me with that both . Because of how long it took me to figure that out it almost cost me the lay . Another example , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the verge of breaking up and I was waiting for it to happen . A friend of mine knew her boyfriend and tried to get me to promise not to do anything to break them up . The next day I jokingly told her all of that and said that I promised him that I would not hit on her . She replied with " good " . I gave it up and a week later I found out she wanted me to try something so I did and sealed the deal . The problem is if I did n't have inside information I would have potentially missed these girls . So how do I tell when they are serious and when they are just toying with me to see if I take charge and go for them . 
@@96058924 @258924/ <p> How do you guys usually arrange the meeting place of the first date from daygame if it 's a day or more ahead ? In a huge city like London , same day meets are rarely possible , so usually have to plan a date in advance , sometimes up to a week or so . <p> Several years ago , I 'd always have a first date in a bar , but nowdays I try to streamline the process and bring chicks to my place straight away . <p> What I usually notice is that if I meet a chick in daytime , and I pitch a meet over text directly at my place in advance , it tends to generate cold feet / flakiness , unless she 's super down in the first place . I am thinking of circumventing this by arranging the day / approximate time of the place , but putting off the precise pitch of " drinks at my place " till the day of the date . So for example , today I had the following text exchange : <p> Normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place directly ; she might go for it , or she might decline completely . But the extra lag of over a day is n't too favourable unless she 's already made up her mind to fuck ( and I have no way of knowing since my initial interaction with her was too brief ) . <p> So tomorrow I intend to send her something like " Hey , so tonight at 9 is on . Let 's have a drink at my place ? I can meet you by X " . <p> If I get that sense I might scare the cat , I 've had better luck just giving the address/ place to meet and being intentionally vague about what the plan is . <p> Seems shady but also seems to get their curiosities up . " i 've got something planned " or " we 'll figure it out from there " <p> Sometimes then a walk around the block , to the store , or smoking weed and then girls who would n't originally come upstairs are up for it . <p> As for timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a decent percentage that drop off for whatever reason . <p> I might be off base , but your last text at least , and textbook style .. in general ... might be coming across a little too routine/player or even try hard . <p> not sure if this is just because of the fact it is an example ... <p> if possible , try to throw something brief but playful in there . " callback humor " to the time you met her would be ideal . maybe " v-man " in your case is enough .. <p> It 's a fine line between leading the interaction and saying too much . If you are sticking to just straight logistics , I would try to leave it with her having said the last message , without the confirmation on your part ( if at all possible ) , OR drop some bait in that last text so she responds , or at least gets curious . " Great , I 've got something special planned " " Great , wear a dress " ( love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks/ shit tests are priceless when she realizes you 're not planning to take her out ) " Great , just picked up ingredients for " or something like that <p> I usually go for the first meet at a bar or a coffee place . Make sure you sit next to her so you can escalate . <p> Roosh , on his world tour , described how to get the lay by talking about something in your home at the beginning of the date , and after a bounce , mention it to bounce to your place . This way the cat is n't scared . <p> As for logistics - schedule the meetup place near your home ( including the bounce if you need it ) . This way logistic is out of the way . <p> " I love a fulfilling and sexual relationship .

It 's true that they do n't smell as much as cotton but they 're definitely hotter than cotton ... much hotter . I was sweating like a pig so I had to wash them more often than I wanted to which defeat the purpose of not having to wash them as much . <p> The 2nd bad thing is that the material get scratchy after a while . I washed by hand most of the time but the colors and stain are hard to remove so I had to be more rough with it and put it in the washing machine . After awhile they became uncomfortable to wear . <p> The 3rd , is that they shrink like crazy . I threw away 3 shirt because they wo n't fit anymore . They shrunk about 1.5 sizes . I suspect because I wear them in the summer , the heat and sweat accelerate the shrinking . <p> I only recommend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and you do n't have to wash them much since you wo n't sweat and they most likely shrink a lot less . <p> What I do like is the T shirts though , the t shirts are really awesome . They used a new material in their T 's that it does n't shrink and it does n't get scratchy . It 's due to the 22% nylon and because it 's a t shirt , it has airflow and wo n't get hot . <p> So in conclusion , definitely buy the T shirt and skip the collared shirt unless you 're travelling to a colder climate .

@@96058953 @258953/ <p> Georgia and The Caucasus are still quite an unknown travel destination , but are slowly beginning to gain more recognition as more and more tourists make their way to this up and coming destination . Untouched nature , wine and cuisine that rivals the likes of Italian , Spanish , and French cuisine , along with a large population of young women who still have their femininity intact are only a few of the reasons Georgia tops the charts . Below are the top reasons why you should include Georgia in your next travel itinerary : <h> 1 . Costs Of Living Remains Low <p> After the collapse of the Soviet Union , Georgia 's GDP fell sharply , as with the rest of the FSU countries . Recovery started in the early 2000 's , and GDP has continue to grow each year since economic reforms have been brought in to place . Prices for goods inside of Georgia 's capital , Tbilisi , remain low for foreigners , and monthly rentals with great logistics can be had for only a few hundred dollars per month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fresh local baked goods such as chachapuri ( fresh bread with cheese baked inside ) can be had a euro or less . There are a few large supermarkets that will contain many products imported from Germany and Europe , and of course since Russia is its largest trade partner , you wo n't have any issue finding imported goods from The Motherland . <p> Once you get outside of the capital , prices are even cheaper , and taxis can be rented to drive long distances for as cheap as $40 to $50 a day ( roughly 460km " 300mi miles ) , depending on your bargaining skills . Public transportation is even cheaper , and you can the true local experience by jumping in a marshutka ( public van ) and drive long distances for as cheap as a few dollars per ride . <p> Overall , you do n't even need to really watch your wallet too much while in Georgia . It 's pretty easy to keep spending low , while seeing the country and taking everything in it has to offer . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgian nature is some of the most raw- and pristine that you will find left on earth . In the West you 'll have access to the Black Sea by visiting Batumi and other close cities . This is a great summer spot , where Georgian , Russians and other tourists flock to bask in the warm summer sun , swim in the warm sea , and take part in local festivals and music events that take place . <p> In the North and the East , you 'll find very mountainous regions to hike and explore , with cathedrals spread throughout dating back to as early as the 6th century . Visiting the Georgian Military highway along with hiking or driving to the top of Kazbegi , combined with a tour of the Tusheti region compares to no other trip you can take . Tbilisi itself boasts unique architecture that you will not find in any other place in the world , combined with excellent and easy to reach mountaintop views via the cities funicular ( going back to price " less than $1 roundtrip ! ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Azerbaijan where your exploration of The Caucasus can continue . <h> 3 . Traditional Women And Family Values Are Alive And Well <p> Over 80 percent of the Georgian population practices Eastern Orthodox Christianity . The women of Georgia are very traditional in their thinking , in that they want to raise a family , cook , clean and take care of their man " the same thinking that you will find throughout all of the FSU countries . It 's not uncommon for women in their mid to late twenties to still live at home with their family , only to move out once they get married . <p> Overall , the women are much more casually dressed when compared to other countries located in the Caucasus , especially in comparison with Armenia . Public affection in the form of kissing and hand holding does n't seem to be all that big , and you 'll normally find local parks loaded up with young couples hiding under the private coverage of foliage , being more intimate with one another . <p> Ratios in the nightclubs are generally not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll most likely be after in most cases anyway . Day game is the way to go , especially in Tbilisi , and most women have probably never been approached before in their lives . Younger generations are quite educated , interested in Western culture somewhat and can speak some English , while still maintaining their traditional values . The women of Georgia are most definitely more geared towards LTRs , making Georgia a great location to find quality women who have the highly sought after traditional mindset. <h> 4 . Food And- Wine That Rivals Western Countries <p> Georgia is the oldest wine making country in the world , and its production dates back as far as 8,000 years . Georgians take a deep pride in their wine production , and a tasting of the many varieties of grapes that each region offers is a must . Tbilisi offers a selection of wine bars , offering wines from all over the country including hard to get bottles from smaller wineries . The best way to experience Georgian wine is to either get invited to a Georgian 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning feast ) , or stop along your way while driving throughout the country to visit one of the many small roadside huts offering tastings and the option to purchase wine to go . <p> To go with the wine , Georgians have an extensive cuisines that focuses around baked goods as well as meat dishes paired with different herbs and spices . Being located at the crossroads of the ancient trade routes between the East and the West , Georgian cuisine takes a large influence from both spheres of the world . Walnuts , pomegranates , kidney beans , and cilantro are all staples that are blended in to the local dishes . Khachapuri Adjaruli ( baked dough with a large stick of butter and an egg on top ) , Khinkhali ( dumplings with meat , mushrooms , cheese , among other varieties ) , and Kharcho ( a stew , with beef falling off the bone , combined with cilantro ) are just a few of the many choices you 'll have . <p> The food is hearty , original , and will leave you coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reason to even cook at home while in Georgia , with the selection of great food at hand and the relatively cheap prices to boot . <h> Conclusion <p> Georgia is a combination of many unique factors that are hard to find in today 's world .

I 've asked around , read related sheets on the forum and looks like Montpellier will be fairly quiet during June , Cannes would be way to expensive and not my scene , Nice and Saint-Tropez do n't start getting popping until July .

During the festivals in late June its a fun town and there are a lot of foreigners for you French players to feast on . AirBnB 's are super cheap on and near the croisette . In late June its a fun time to go . Club 55 is a pretty amazing spot in St Tropez . I love it there and would live up in the hills above Cannes , Mougins has to be one of the most picturesque and interesting places in the world . I always say I would retire there . For the young bucks this might not be your cup of tea though .

@@96058958 @258958/ <p> If there is a secret sauce to game , something close to what the shysters and the scam artists promise when they talk of making you irresistible to women , then it is closely affiliated with the dark triad characteristics ( narcissism , Machiavellianism and psychopathy ) and the consequent state they beget , that of drama . <p> The very best players that I have observed , those whose actions have moistened panties from London to Las Vegas and back again , have all had these characteristics in spades . And just look at famous examples of criminals like Jeremy Meeks who women flock to . <p> As such " -and because we are by now all more than aware that nice guys finish last ' " -an important ethical question stands out , namely , is it actually possible to be a good guy who is also supremely good with women ?

Is that because I am a cruel and heartless individual who does n't care a toss for the feelings of others ? No , it is simply because , having studied pickup and male-female sexual dynamics for many years , both from my own perspective and by observing others , I have a pretty good idea of what works and what does n't . <p> My own personal experience is not atypical for a pick-up writer . While I would argue that I was never entirely blue pill ' ( it is hard to live through your parents ' divorce and then observe your stepmother 's ' mistreatment and eventual divorcing of your father and hold all your dreams of the wonders of romance intact ) , I was nonetheless a basic nice guy who did n't see any action with girls all the way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid with that first girl ( a decent blonde who has since been marred by the birth of her two children , divorce and a Botox addiction ) , it was because I developed a strongly cocky funny sense of humour almost combative in its intensity . I would like to say that it was because I had suddenly become game-aware and had figured out for myself what worked . In fact it was by default , a by-product of strong antidepressant medication that sent me off the charts loopy for a while swigged down with a liberal dose of alcohol . <p> While this is certainly not a method that I would recommend to anyone reading this at home , the physiological ravages that were taking place in my mind as a result of various battling chemicals had one pant-wettingly happy consequence : they made me really not give a fuck what anyone thought of me . And even more than that , they spurred me on to flaunt my quirks at others in a bid to provoke them . <p> Having always been somewhat analytical and therefore possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conscious strategy of my own , ticking the narcissistic ' and psychopathic ' boxes as well . Perhaps unsurprisingly , this bonfire of my vanities presaged what was to be the most sexually bountiful season of my life . <p> I should underline the point that all of this was entirely untutored and unplanned . It was before the manosphere , the red pill , even before I 'd read a single book on pickup . Things turned out the way they did due to my somewhat liberal doctors and my burgeoning taste for hard liquor , and I was fortunate enough to reap the benefits of a righteous pussy harvest . <p> Of course , things soon calmed down . My medication was changed , and I later gave up drinking as well . But due to a narcotic interval that likely most men do not experience I was able to see for myself the way in which unbridled arrogance , rudeness , sottishness and bad behaviour , far from repulsing women in fact turned them into quivering and grateful recipients of the errant manboy 's love gloop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and became elemental in the framework that was only strengthened and bolstered by my subsequent study of manosphere texts and my adventures in the field of pickup . <h> My Thoughts On The Dark Triad Now <p> Many years later and I am an infinitely more responsible , together and organised person than at that time . But the lessons I learned back them about the effectiveness of the dark triad have not gone to waste since I can now playact them at will . They are simply different colours on my pickup artists palette that I employ to colour my interactions with as and when the time is right . <p> Wherever you are in the game , whether a newbie or an experienced player I recommend that you do the same . You do n't have to kick down the doors of perception to alter your behaviours around women . These days there are a great many helpful resources out there that discuss the dark triad characteristics in great detail , and show how their application can be beneficial to the committed poon hound . <p> While it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking to want to go full on dark triad in a kind of fuck bitches , I 'll show them ' manner , not only is this supremely butthurt but it is also effectively impossible as you ca n't just acquire these traits , particularly psychopathy which is clearly a very distinct mental condition . <p> Far better for the average guy to be aware of the impact that these characteristics can have on his game and sprinkle them liberally on his interactions where appropriate , but retaining enough self-control to pull back when they no longer serve his purposes . As with most things in life you want to find balance , that sweet spot where equilibrium supports rather than destabilises your dreams .

@@96058967 @258967/ <p> So I 'm still in Split , using this target-rich environment to really study game more efficiently than usual . Last night I was at Ghetto Bar with two girls when we decided to get some fresh air . Being Saturday night it was jam-packed and a challenge to make our way out . One of the girls , or both of them , grabbed onto my back as I led the way out , squirming through hordes of people . That was good , they automatically assigned me a leadership role and I took it . I 'm not one of those assholes who knocks people over as I 'm trying to navigate through a crowded bar/club , so I 'm being as polite as possible , doing whatever I can not to push people , touch them , even though they 're all in my way . So it 's challenging . Finally after fighting through hundreds of people and down multiple stairwells and through passages and doorways , I was nearly out . The girls were still hanging on - we were on the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Before getting to the point , I need to explain something . You can skip down to the bolded text if you do n't have time . I 've been doing a confidence-building exercise for almost a year . It involves something very simple , which most people probably take for granted - walking down the street . Nothing could be easier , right ? You would think so . Except it 's actually very complicated . You are constantly making split-second decisions on how much of the sidewalk you 're going to give up to the people approaching from the other direction . Sometimes you give up the whole sidewalk and go into the road or onto the grass , especially when you 're passing a group of people . Other times you sense the approaching person is weaker than you so you give up nothing . It 's not a matter of being an asshole , it 's just that you ca n't give up the entire sidewalk to every single person who passes you . Sometimes you get the sidewalk and they do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both make a minor adjustment so you can both pass each other with dignity intact . <p> I used to jump out of the way of other people . All of them . Men , women , kids , groups of people , single people . I would always give them all the room they needed to pass me comfortably . They would not have to make an adjustment - they would just keep walking in a straight line right through where I had been without acknowledging me . Many times , I started noticing , even after I had politely moved to the very edge of the sidewalk , or even off of it , they would continue matching my movement , trying to push me even further off my path . The more I would try to get out of their way , the more space they would take . They probably were n't doing this on purpose , but they just did n't notice me , and my automatically moving out of their way did n't give them any reason to notice I was there , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly vacated for them . I never received any thanks for politely giving space to people , for stepping into the road so other people could walk in a straight line , etc . As time went on , I realized that other people were not doing this for me . <p> Around the time I started thinking about this , I had also started to realize there was something called game , and was learning a bit about how important confidence is . I also became aware of how feminism is not a benign force , but is actually a tool designed to destroy male confidence . I started noticing that women were most unlikely to give me enough room to pass them . Men would usually make a minor adjustment so we could both pass each other , but women almost never would . They would just keep walking straight through me , forcing me to squeeze past them or move completely out of their way , like I was n't even there . <p> I would usually cross the street to avoid these confrontations which were starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sidewalks so you ca n't escape them . <p> Then one day I was walking down the sidewalk near my home when a guy turned the corner and started walking towards me . As he approached I saw he was a lot younger and was only maybe 5 ' tall . I decided I was going to not give him any room , because I did n't feel like it . If he wanted , he could squeeze past me on my left - I was in the centre of the sidewalk . So I was doing to this guy what other people were doing to me . That was my split-second decision . His split-second decision , right after mine , was to divert himself into the street , on my right , completely walking around me , leaving the entire sidewalk to me . <p> As he passed me I sensed fear . I had discovered something . I do n't want to scare people , but it turns out you have to scare them a little if you want to maintain your dignity walking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other areas of your life , you require at least a little bit of dignity . You need to feel good about yourself , like you 're worth something . You 're not going to feel like you 're worth something if women and kids are walking right through you without even looking at you . <p> This directly affects your ability to have game . <p> For nearly a year I have been putting this into practice . I have been to several cities and countries over the last year and have been carefully building my confidence level by not jumping out of peoples ' way , especially girls , when they approach me on a sidewalk . I sense if the approaching person is weaker than me and therefore more likely to move out of my way . It 's not all about male vs. female and physical body strength , although that does have some importance . Women do n't get a pass any more . I see them pretending not to see me so I 'll move out of their way , but they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep walking and make women go around me . Even when it 's two of them walking side by side , taking up the entire path , and pretending I 'm not there - I pretend they 're not there and do the same thing to them until they move . I 'll even veer right into the middle of a group , when they 're selfishly taking up the entire path and refusing to make room for me . They scatter when I do that . I would have walked on their right , but if they wo n't leave room for me , I have to confront them like that . I usually try to stick to the right of the sidewalk because if I was in the centre , it would look like I was moving for approaching people as I moved to the right . I do n't want to look like I 'm moving out of their way . If I have to move , I do n't jump out of their way , I gradually shift to the right , or sometimes the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge I 'm there so they have to move a little as well . People do n't get to walk right through me any more . <p> The final straw was last fall in Montreal , I had been doing this for a few weeks but was still being too polite about it . Then this militant lesbian was walking toward me , listening to an ipod and waving her arms , like she was rapping or something . She saw me , then started making boxing moves which caused me to give her most of the sidewalk . I was insulted . I should have stood my ground and not let her get away with that . Since then I just stop if somebody does n't look like they 're going to get out of my way . I make them go around me . Because if they 're not going to give me a little room so we can both pass each other with dignity , then they do n't respect me and I 'm going to stand there and make them walk all the way around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to . <p> After several months I feel the results are good . This is n't the only confidence-building exercise I 've been doing , but it 's an important one . I find myself more capable interacting with women now - and people in general . <p> Now back to Ghetto Bar . <p> I 'm on the last step of a narrow stairwell with two girls hanging onto my back . I have very little room to manoeuver - there are still people all over the place . I 've just fought through a few hundred people to get to this step . I can see open space ! Just then , someone steps in front of me . It 's a woman , and she looks angry . She 's just standing there , in my way , looking at me . So I stop and look back at her . She shouts at me , in a posh English accent : " In THIS country , we treat women with respect ! " Then she shoves past me on my left . I let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so rude and I was too shocked to say anything at first . Then I stepped into the open space and was finally out of there . The two girls asked , " what did she say to you ? " I shouted up the stairs , " you fucking cunt ! " The girls were like " what 's going on ? " Everyone was staring at me , like I was the bad guy , like I had done something . <p> Which country did that English cunt think she was in ? We 're in Croatia . And I do treat women with respect . Way too much , in fact , which is why they have so little respect for me . I 've been treating women with the utmost respect all my life and have gotten precisely nowhere with that . <p> Women like that English cunt are one of the reasons why I had so little confidence to begin with . They feel entitled to things they have n't earned . They do n't think ; they do n't care . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first without having to make any adjustments and assumed that since I was n't jumping out of her way with a smile on my face , that I was some kind of misogynist asshole . Well , I 'm becoming a misogynist asshole , precisely because of women like her . <p> What can you do in that situation ? Follow her , grab her arm , and explain the moral bankruptcy of her " I want it all " **26;118;TOOLONG philosophy ? Slap her ? Break a bottle over her head ? Anything I would have done would have gotten me jumped by at least a dozen white knights . You 're always the bad guy when a woman creates a scene , even if you were just standing there . I did go back to Ghetto Bar later that night , recognized the English cunt sitting with some Doogie Howser lookalike , stared her down , she looked away . I had too much to say to her so said nothing because I know it would have ended with me being attacked , thrown out and banned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 02:00 AM ) Stitch Wrote : Eh , I 'm old-fashioned .

Anderson reported directly to Ard at the time , but Liberman only allegedly shared her termination plan with him right before she carried it out . <p> Anderson filed a lawsuit against Yahoo in February 2016 , alleging he was fired because of his gender .

@@96058972 @258972/ <p> I read in a few places that being proficient with Microsoft Excel is helpful for your career . I came across the term pivot tables a lot . I would link to them , but it was several discussions in different places . <p> The reasons given are that a lot of senior management do n't know it , so if you can put together data to present to them , you will be useful . <p> Also , it is apparently used a lot in corporate culture . I know a lot of people here are against being desk jockeys , but you could likely use these skills on a freelance consultant basis . <p> One argument given was that it is only useful if you have something to use it for . Most people who learned it or became good at it , did so because they had to do it for a particular project . And a lot of people who tried to learn it and did not have any way to apply it did not really find it useful . <p> There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it would be another skill set someone could develop . <p> Although I am not too knowledgeable with the importance of Excel , I can definitely agree that its understanding is desirable . I have yet to apply for a job in any field ( finance , administrative , TV/Film ) that did not require some knowledge of excel . <p> I 'm sure other users can vouch for its specific importance , or its necessity in different professions , but I know for sure it 's helpful to have on a resume . It 's interesting , because whenever I hear " Excel " and " Powerpoint , " I figure those programs would be outdated -- but knowledge of these programs is needed by moneymakers like i-bankers . <p> I work in a company that is broadly pretty old and not heavily tech-savvy .

Now , looking at your body stats , I think you are doing OK. 5lbs of actual muscle in 6 months is great . <p> Keep lifting ( and do n't deviate from 5x5 for now , it 's good ) , and you will be golden . <p> I would n't say I have unrealistic expectations - I really do n't have enough knowledge to form any real expectations . I would figured I 'd see some sort of noticeable difference at this point , but if that 's unrealistic then so be it and thanks for letting me know . When I read things in the popular magazines that say " Add 10 lbs of muscle to your arms in 4 weeks with this SUPER SHREDDING PROGRAM ! ! ! ! " I know enough to not take that seriously . <p> I do n't know the people you named , but I do n't ever expect to look like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to juice either . I once saw something that showed a range of 6 body types ranging from the extreme ectomorph to endomorph - it said to pick your body type ( for me extreme ectomorph ) and then realistically you can expect to go 2 in either direction so that seemed reasonable to me . Who really knows if Charles Atlas ' story is actually true , right ? <p> So far one vote for 12-15 reps , one vote for 5x5 . It seems like this is the eternal debate and I imagine the answer is something along the lines of it 's different for each individual ... <p> What matters is that over the YEARS you turn that 10 many reps with 135lbs to 10 reps with 505 lbs . <p> I guarantee you , the day you incline press 405 for 25 reps on a rest pause set , your chest will have a grand canyon groove down the middle . <p> Quit looking at the small picture , and reverse engineer the problem . All the big fucking guys are moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few inches . So you know you got ta get yourself to that point . So find your way to gradually lift heavier and heavier in whatever rep range , and make those increases as fast and as often as possible . <p> Steelex is correct . Focus on getting stronger in any rep range , and spend years doing that . I averaged out my muscle gains over the past 7 years , and it works out at about 4-5 lbs/year . It 's not always been a priority ( I boxed a lot during that time ) , but the point is that over time you can make good progress and transform how you look , within the limitations imposed by your frame and genes . <p> Everything works so long as you continue to add weight to the bar . What does n't work is to change rep ranges and movements every time you stall for a week or two . You go from 12-15 down to 5 rep sets , life a bunch more weight for a while , and feel you 've got stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps with some moderate strength gain ) . <p> I did not say that you MUST do 5x5 . I have mentioned that regimen because it 's the oldest , and most popular ( many professionals such as Arnold use(d) it ) . Of course , you will not look like him ( you obviously do n't have his genetics and you are unwilling to go on gear ) , but still , you will look better than 90+% of people your age when naked . You will look younger too ( take a look at Chuck Norris - he is almost 80 , but looks like someone half his age ) . <p> The most important thing , like the posters above me said , is to continue to add weight to the bar . It does not really matter if you do 5x5 , 3x8 , 12-13 reps etc . There are many paths to victory . <p> As I have said earlier , you have the correct attitude , which many lack . You can do it , and I wish you the best .

In fact , it 's good for the ego/confidence --- she must have liked the sex . I try to only go after girls that I find attractive and want to fuck regularly , so her getting attached gives me more control over when and how I take her sexually . But many girls have a lot of ugly drama going on in their lives that you either do n't hear about or simply ignore in the beginning when your attention is focused on seducing your cock into her pussy . <p> Women are emotional creatures ( which is how we get them to spread their legs when she barely knows us ) , but the drama is usually what pushes me away , not the clinginess . <p> The con is sometimes its not that easy to completly cut off someone u been with for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad relationships that is likely to go nowhere . Its not easy but u got ta do it . <p> It 's how they get attached to you . There 's wanting to invest in a relationship with you in a healthy way progressively , and there 's the unstable drama bitch . With the latter , you get all sorts of wonderful things , too much too soon . Imagine you getting to meet all her friends and all the future " in-laws " within the first couple of weeks because she 's so in loooooooove . The wall of TXTs you get every other hour on your phone . Call you at 2am on a week night because you make her feel so wonderful that she 's got ta know right now at this moment , while you are getting a good night sleep , if you feel the same way . Find out where your mother lives all on her own because she wants to meet her future MIL ... Or try to insert herself into every part of your life rapidly , and question why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already loves you the way you are ( no bitch , it takes hard work to get this hard bod that you like so much ) . <p> But do n't you worry , these days attractive girls have way less attention span than that . You get to be The Guy for a few weeks to a couple of months top , then she 'll find someone else just as awesome to focus on . <p> If you have fucked a girl multiple times and she is not getting emotionally attached to you , then she is psychologically broken and you should avoid her . <p> I know some want to be super players , devoid of any emotion , who use women as nothing more than decoration , sex toys and maids . However , I think that it is natural to develop some sort of attachment to a person with whom you 're regularly sharing the most intimate experience . I am far less experienced than most of you and I 've been in only one fuck buddy arrangement . Since then I 'm not looking any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl a couple of times and never see her again , or I want to try to build a relationship with her . <p> The fuck buddy sex felt hollow and cold . It felt like a transaction . It felt no different than the interactions I have with my colleagues , my boss or the cashier at the shop . A purely conditional interaction , where each party is looking to invest the smallest amount of effort and to extract the maximum amount of profit . An interaction where appearances are only kept up because there is something to gain . <p> I understand that emotional attachment is not unconditional , and that it is build through providing value to people , be it to your friends , to your girlfriend , to your family . And it can be lost as well , once you stop providing value . However , people who fail to develop any emotional attachment to you even though you regularly provide them with valuable , intimate experiences , are not worth to be a part of your life . <p> ( 06-10-2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get attached to you .

Clinginess = too much emotional attachment , too soon . A clingy girl is completely controlled by her emotions , which are a rollercoaster . She does n't care about rationality and she certainly does n't care about you . This is the type of girl that will stalk you ( or worse ) when you break up with her . And this is also the type of girl that will drop you like a brick all of a sudden . <p> I have been in an ltr with such a girl . The relationship lasted three months , and it that timeframe I met all her friends , her entire family and I even went on holiday together with her and her family . She was texting me all the time , and went crazy when I did n't respond for a couple of hours . She was even talking about marrying one day . Her mood swings were terrible . One moment she could be the most pleasant person in the world , and 5 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit suicide . Out of the blue she dumped me to hop on the next shiny cock . In the years after she had multiple boyfriends and every single one of her relationships followed the same pattern . I am very happy that I managed to cut her out of my life . <p> My take on it : both the girl that fails to develop an emotional attachment to you and the girl that develops too much attachment too soon , are psychologically damaged and should be cut out of your life . I see no downsides to a healthy attachment , unless you are purely looking for sex and absolutely nothing else . 
@@96058988 @258988/ <p> I remember that years ago , a guy who worked at the airport in one of brazillian cities found 10.000 euros in a wallet . He was a toilet cleaner and he returned the wallet to the airport security team and it was latter given to the owner of it . I remember that my nephew was proper mad at him , ' ' what an idiot , finds 10.000 euros and gives it back ' ' . <p> I just saw another story on youtube where a taxi driver finds 300.000 dollars worth of cash and he returns it to the owner . His taxi company compensated him with 1000 dollars ( 1000 dollars you know ) . <p> One time I was on the train going home and I looked under the seat I was sitting and I found a wallet that had 200 euros plus 100 pounds . The guy also left his documents . I thought fuck it , I am keeping the money . But because his driving license had his address on it and I understand the stress of getting another license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I kept the money . My other friend was trying to convince me to send the money back , I was like ' ' fuck outta here , If he found my money , I am damn sure he would n't give it back ' ' . <p> Now If I see someone dropping his wallet , I would let him know that he just dropped his wallet , I did this several times before . I remember one time this lady was withdrawing cash and she took her card and left the 50 pounds on the atm that she just withdrew , I called her and told her that she forgot her money on the atm , the woman behind me was super impressed and said ' ' you are a honest guy ' ' . <p> However , my policy totally changes when I find the money in the streets , public transport or any other pubic place . If I lose a wallet full of cash , I assume that is gone for good , If I find in the streets , I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not returning it , unless the money is insubstantial for me . <p> I have never robbed from another human being and probably never will . However when comes to this I do n't think I will change my attitude . <p> This is a good question and when I lived in London , I had that fcuk you , it 's mine attitude . If you lose something in London , it 's gone .. fcuking bastards . <p> Living in Nigeria , you better return that shyt because if they find out ( and somehow they do ) , they will flog you and your fam ca n't do shyt to resist . <p> But living in Canada , I gained more of a benign nature and started giving back shyt I found . Once I lost my smartphone in the cinema .. the one near Warden and Eglinton and lo and behold , when I went back to enquire , the cleaners had found it and returned it to the front . <p> If that happened in London , trust me , it 's curtains on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of the cartons . I returned that also . <p> I would probably return cash in Toronto . I felt that people were generally nice there and so I wanted to give back . <p> At this present point in time , I am not sure , I 'd probably give it back but the thing is , the person you return it i.e. the security guard might pocket the money and not give it to the rightful owner . <p> A few years ago I was walking down the street when I came across a wallet on the sidewalk . It was open with a few hundred dollars in cash . The I 'd was also still inside . I could see that it belonged to an old man in his 70s who lived in the area . <p> I looked down the street . Far off , I could see an old man walking along with a cane .

I do n't think I 'd feel right spending it as my own , especially when I had the rightful owner 's I 'd in my possession , making it easy for me to return . <p> I have never found a wallet , but I have found other items that I have returned . If I found a wallet with a lot of money , I would return everything without a doubt . I grew up in the Midwest and I believe it 's right thing to do . <p> Finding a 20 dollar bill or something on the street is fair game though . <p> I have and would again .

Taking it would have been theft and would have been wrong even if I had never been caught . <p> It 's a sign of a civilised human being in a civilised society that social trust can occur .

Of course , there 's a disconnect between kids and adults , because quite a few adults here are pretty hard-nosed when it comes to money . <p> Honestly , I would go to the bank and get a check made out to a decent charity/ies once I fucking screen the shit out of them . <p> I 've been blessed with more than just two hands , eyes and legs and I 've been proud of what I 've earned with just that . <p> I do n't need to take more when there are people that do n't have the opportunities I 've had . <p> What causes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . <p> Edit : I believe the person that lost that much cash has a better ability to earn it than the people I would contribute it to on his/her anonymous behalf ; and yes I would take it upon myself to make this decision for them . <p> I lost a wallet with $400 in it . The guy who found it drove an hour away to my old address to return it .

@@96058989 @258989/ <p> This paper has often been obliquely referenced here for pointing out that the rise of women in national politics often correlates with the fall of empires . It 's available here for free , a 24-page PDF . The paper is worth reading in full , and his final summary ( spoiler alert ) gives a great overview of what his paper is about . Here it is : <p> Quote:An increase in the influence of women in public life has often been associated with national decline . The later Romans complained that , although Rome ruled the world , women ruled Rome . In the tenth century , a similar tendency was observable in the Arab Empire , the women demanding admission to the professions hitherto monopolised by men . What , ' wrote the contemporary historian , Ibn Bessam , have the professions of clerk , tax-collector or preacher to do with women ? These occupations have always been limited to men alone . ' Many women practised law , while others obtained posts as university professors . There was an agitation for the appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have succeeded . Soon after this period , government and public order collapsed , and foreign invaders overran the country . The resulting increase in confusion and violence made it unsafe for women to move unescorted in the streets , with the result that this feminist movement collapsed . <p> The disorders following the military takeover in 861 , and the loss of the empire , had played havoc with the economy . At such a moment , it might have been expected that everyone would redouble their efforts to save the country from bankruptcy , but nothing of the kind occurred . Instead , at this moment of declining trade and financial stringency , the people of Baghdad introduced a five-day week . When I first read these contemporary descriptions of tenth-century Baghdad , I could scarcely believe my eyes . I told myself that this must be a joke ! The descriptions might have been taken out of The Times today . The resemblance of all the details was especially breathtaking " the break-up of the empire , the abandonment of sexual morality , the pop ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professions , the five-day week . I would not venture to attempt an explanation ! There are so many mysteries about human life which are far beyond our comprehension . <p> I just finished reading this paper , and it come with my highest recommendation . I do n't have snow to quote specific relevant sections from the paper , but I will do so tomorrow . <p> This was published some time ago and it 's refreshing to read the thoughts of an academic who is unencumbered by political correctness . He merely states facts and draws logical conclusions from those facts . This paper is a product of an era where reason superceded emotion . <p> Another bit from Glubb on how intellectualism seems to flourish just as an empire is collapsing : <p> Quote:There are so many things in human life which are not dreamt of in our popular philosophy . The spread of knowledge seems to be the most beneficial of human activities , and yet every period of decline is characterrised by this expansion of intellectual activity . All the Athenians and strangers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to tell or to hear some new thing ' is the description given in the Acts of the Apostles of the decline of Greek intellectualism . <p> The Age of Intellect is accompanied by surprising advances in natural science . In the ninth century , for example , in the age of Mamun , the Arabs measured the circumference of the earth with remarkable accuracy . Seven centuries were to pass before Western Europe discovered that the world was not flat . Less than fifty years after the amazing scientific discoveries under Mamun , the Arab Empire collapsed . Wonderful and beneficent as was the progress of science , it did not save the empire from chaos . <p> The full flowering of Arab and Persian intellectualism did not occur until after their imperial and political collapse . Thereafter the intellectuals attained fresh triumphs in the academic field , but politically they became the abject servants of the often illiterate rulers . When the Mongols conquered Persia in the thirteenth century , they were themselves entirely uneducated and were obliged to depend wholly on native Persian officials to administer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wazeer , or Prime Minister , one Rashid alDin , a historian of international repute .

If the Khan were in a good mood , he occasionally passed his wazeer a piece of food over his shoulder . <p> It 's a brilliant book , supported by historical reality . It also gives a succinct explanation of what exactly is going on around us . I 'm surprised it has n't been mentioned on this forum earlier , especially since the United States is 239 years old , very well within the range of 230-270 year lifetime of empires he mentions . <p> ( 06-29-2015 12:47 PM ) Sonsowey Wrote : This paper has often been obliquely referenced here for pointing out that the rise of women in national politics often correlates with the fall of empires . <p> In " Empires of the word : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small mention of the correlation between women obtaining power and the civilisation falling from grace almost immediately thereafter .

We 're all different , so making a program one 's own is invaluable . <p> I am by no means a health and diet/lifting expert , but I have no idea how anyone could ever be capable of doing hundreds of push-ups and sit-ups , along with 1,500 pull-ups a day while only eating dinner .

@@96058992 @258992/ <p> I love that photo . I can smell the June night sun , and crispness in the air and the cider buzz . <p> One thing a lot of people might not know is that Swedes are very drawn to their forests and lakes . They all have summer homes far away from the cities that they spend huge portions of summers at . Big long table dinners and generations of family celebrating life . <p> The more Swedes have to put up with unpredictable cities , the more that they will just leave to the countryside . Whether they fight from the forests or just carry on as best as possible only time will tell . <p> But to think that Sweden is lost is crazy . Cities are vulnerable , just ask the Norwegians . When the Nazis came , most of the people were already gone into the forest . This is a viking tactic , and it works . <p> Exactly right , Swedes/Fins/Norwegian are usually hardy people who cherish their natural habitat . Sweden has a lot of hunters with guns too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard to be completely controlled by an outside force of migrants . Its cold , its inhospitable to the uneducated , and if its inhabited by snipers it wo n't be a pleasant place . I have ancestors from there . The Swedish blood inside of me is disappointed and enraged . All the work of the forefathers thrown to the wind . <p> With all this talk it has made me think about my current surroundings and which places would be easy to defend or flee too . I 've already found where I can get fresh water and where I can set up areas to oversee some kinds of routes for vehicles and pedestrians . I also know where I can fish and find small game as well as places to grow food . <p> I think it may be a good idea for some of the people on this forum to learn how to grow their own food , and to stock up on supplies for a long period of civil unrest . Better to be a warrior in a garden , than a gardener in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in shops . If the happening occurs be prepared . I feel so bad for Europeans like the Swedes and Germans . The vast majority may not be prepared for what may be coming . It 's rather sad . <p> Well let 's not pretend they 're an entirely different species that suddenly topples over as soon as the temperature drops below 0 . They 've been living in European countries for long enough and the average metrosexual European city dweller is n't any better equipped for some sort of hypothetical winter war . Neither climate nor random skirmishes in the countryside would play a significant role in any of this , if anything it 's the degree of overall military organization and combat skills and how many Europeans would be willing to pull together when push comes to shove . <p> The genetics absolutely play a role , as do cultural traditions when living through hard times . <p> The africans are n't suddenly going to evolve european fat distribution or decrease the melanin content of their skin to generate enough vitamin D during winter . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for firewood or which berries are safe to eat or how to fish in a frozen lake . <p> The battle for Stalingrad was a prime example of what happens when you engage in a dirty war in the height of a northern winter . Many froze to death or died of conditions aggravated by extreme cold , and they were all biologically and culturally adapted to that weather . Africans and Arabs will not keel over and die on day one , but they will fare extremely poorly in comparison to the natives . <p> I do n't think climate will play a huge role . But clearly the invaders will not be making the countryside and mountains their strongholds , getting to know every nook and cranny and setting up booby traps and choke points . They 'll be restricted to the cities and vulnerable . <p> Light pigmentation of the skin was to allow more sunlight in because it was reduced the further north you went . Its opposite the further south you go . <p> Climate is the biggest factor here . Northern Europe can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply that we have now . We design buildings to combat the cold because of this and the Nordic countries have perfected it . <p> When southerners come up they rely on the towns and cities to be functioning and even then they hate the cold . Plonk anyone from warm climates in the middle of a darkened forest 30 below and they will lose their minds . <p> Heck indeed it does . As most know here I 'm from Portugal , I 'm very pale and ca n't even tan . When it gets below 15 degrees or so here I 'm already bothered , I 've committed the mistake of going to North Europe while it was n't summer and the effects were very noticed . <p> " The reasoning man who scorns the prejudices of simpletons necessarily becomes the enemy of simpletons ; he must expect as much , and laugh at the inevitable .

With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerating cold but in high heat they drop like flies while I prance like a satyr . <p> I would say that amongst south men too , there is a marked difference between raw survival capacity of urban and rural people which leads me to my next reflection . <p> ( 04-27-2017 10:46 AM ) nomadbrah Wrote : Exactly right , Swedes/Fins/Norwegian are usually hardy people who cherish their natural habitat .

@@96058993 @258993/ <p> This book had been sitting on my Amazon wish list for a few months , and I finally decided it was time to pick it up , in hopes of helping out my writing . <p> It cost a mere $11 , but is also pretty short at 165 pages . The short length of the book was good because I do n't usually enjoy self-help books enough to read one that is very long . <p> I 'm going to break down the book and give a summary first , and then give my closing thoughts at the end of the post . <p> The central concept of the War of Art , is that by sitting yourself down everyday , and doing the work of writing , music , or whatever , you are setting the stage for inspiration . In other words , to fulfill your dreams you have to incorporate them into your daily life . <p> He wants to steer you away from the fantasy that you can keep living your life , going to your 9-5 , then suddenly pull a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead he is telling you that you have to sit down everyday and struggle with it . <p> Resistance is the word Pressfield uses to describe what " stands between the lives we live , and the unlived lives within us . " <p> The first " book " deals with identifying this " resistance " in our lives , which consists of things like procrastination , fear , fantasy , friends/family , etc . There are no chapters . Instead , each page identifies a different manifestation of resistance . For me this made it easier to read because you can stop anywhere , and pick up without missing anything . <p> Here are some of the phrases I tagged from the first book to add to my commonplace book . <p> " There never was a moment , and never will be , when we are without the power to alter our destiny ... This second , we can sit down and do our work . " <p> The above applies to procrastination . <p> " Self-Doubt can be an ally ... because it serves as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real one is scared to death . " <p> This quote can also be helpful for those new to game . When they start approaching for the first time they are scared , but that fear indicates that what they are doing is worth-while . <p> " The professional has learned that success , like happiness , comes as a by-product of work . " <p> The most important line in the book . If there is anything I will take away from this book it is the concept of doing the work . <p> The second book , Combating Resistance : Turning Pro , is focused on making the transition into a professional . <p> This quote sums it up nicely , " To the amateur , the game is his advocation . To the professional , the game is his vocation . " <p> It 's all about weening you off the fantasy and glamour of the creative life . He talks about how people get caught up in the fantasy too much , and are in turn unprepared to deal with reality . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time treat art realistically , like a job . You have to act like a professional . You have to actually work . This book is where he talks about setting the stage for creativity . <p> Here 's a line I wrote into my commonplace : <p> " The pro stands at one remove from her instrument . " <p> The above is about distancing yourself from your art . He says you should n't identify with it . I 've seen this a lot in the real world , where the people who fervently identify themselves as " writers " or " musicians " usually work the lunch shift at Starbucks , and do no actual writing at all . The real studs are usually laid back and do n't see themselves as writers at all . <p> Finally , the third book : Beyond Resistance , is very abstract . It deals a lot with gods , angels , and " the muse . " I burned through it just to finish the book , but it was n't nearly as good as the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my commonplace : <p> " When we sit down day after day and keep grinding , something mysterious starts to happen . A process is set into motion by which , inevitably and infallibly , heaven comes to our aid . " <p> This basically serves to reinforce the concept of treating art as work . This is what the whole third book is about , that once you start on the grind that good things will eventually happen . I 've seen similar stuff discussed on the forum , the whole concept of paying your dues . Once you start doing something everyday , once you have put in enough hours , you will eventually get to that point where the game slows down . <p> Closing thoughts : <p> Overall I would recommend the book to people who are just finally waking up . <p> Did it change my life ? No . I 've heard almost everything in here in one form or another , but I 've been at this for a while now . <p> If you are more advanced as a person , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It just did n't give me a huge kick in the ass , but not many things do . Instead , it gave me a few good pieces of advice that I can take with me , which is really all I can ask of a book . <p> One thing I have noticed is that I have been writing a lot more frequently . I usually sit down to write everyday at 10AM , which is a concept that I used to fervently denounce . So I could say that $11 bought me some consistency . <p> Another thing I noticed is that this book could be applied to game . The concept of resistance could be replaced with approach anxiety . Turning professional could be where you treat game as a job . Etc . <p> I ca n't help but notice that most self-help books are the same content , but they all use different keywords . After you have read enough of them there is nothing that is going to rock your world , which is why I usually stick to biographies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to accept that you will always be pushing against something . You have to dump the fantasies and just start grinding , start working a little bit everyday . <p> Read this last week . Was a little bit of an emotional struggle to wade through all the annoying religious shit , but I 'm glad I persevered . Good book with some important ideas . Also very short ; it can easily be knocked out in a day <p> Refused - New Noise Wrote:How can we expect anyone to listen if we 're using the same old voice ? We need new noise , new art for real people <p> I would definitely agree that it is a book not everyone can use , especially if you have already read a lot of self-help type stuff . I think we forget that these books are mostly motivational tools rather than clear cut guides to life . <p> It is a very easy read , as others have said , but there have been many great thinkers who expressed profound thoughts simply . <p> I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the messages based on the comments , but I did n't find it that distracting . Even the foreword offers a different perspective from which to approach the ideas presented . <p> Awesome summary General Mayhem . I was going to write a summary but found yours through the search function . <p> I have wrote down my favorite passages , taken from my beat up and dog-eared paperback copy . <p> Quote:The Unlived Life Most of us have two lives . The life we live and the unlived life within us . Between the two stands Resistance . Have you ever brought home a treadmill and let it gather dust in the attic ? Ever quit a diet , a course of yoga , a meditation practice ? Have you ever bailed out on a call to embark upon a spiritual practice , dedicate yourself to a humanitarian calling , commit your life to the service of others ? Have you ever wanted to be a mother , a doctor , an advocate for the weak and helpless ; to run for public office , crusade for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment ? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become , the work you could accomplish , the realized being you were meant to be ? Are you a writer who does n't write ? A painter who does n't paint , an entrepreneur who never starts a venture ? Then you know what Resistance is . <p> One night I was layin ' down , I heard Papa talkin ' to Mama . I heard Papa say , to let that boy boogie-woogie . ' Cause it 's in him and it 's got to come out . John Lee Hooker , " Boogie Children " <p> Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet . It is the root of more unhappiness than poverty , disease , and erectile dysfunction . To yield to Resistance deforms our spirit . It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be . If you believe in God ( and I do ) you must declare Resistance evil , for it prevents us from achieving the life God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique genius . Genius is a Latin word ; the Romans used it to denote an inner spirit , holy and inviolable , which watches over us , guiding us to our calling . A writer writes with his genius , an artist paints with hers ; everyone who creates operates from this sacramental center . It is our soul 's seat , the vessel that holds our being-in-potential , our star 's beacon , and Polaris . <p> Every sun casts a shadow , and genius 's shadow is Resistance . As powerful as is our soul 's call to realization , so potent are the forces of Resistance arrayed against it . Resistance is faster than a speeding bullet , more powerful than a locomotive , harder to kick than crack cocaine . We are not alone if we 've been mowed down by Resistance ; millions of good men and women have bitten the dust before us . And here 's the biggest bitch : We do n't even know what hit us . I never did . From age 24 to 32 Resistance kicked my ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I never know it existed . I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face . <p> Have you heard this story : Woman learns she has cancer , six months to live . Within days she quits her job , resumes the dream of writing Tex-Mex songs she gave up to raise a family ( or studying classical Greek , or moves to the inner city and devotes herself to tending babies with AIDS ) . Woman 's friends think she 's crazy ; she herself has never been happier . There 's a postscript . Woman 's cancer goes into remission . Is that what it takes ? Do we have to stare death in the face to make us stand up and confront Resistance ? Does Resistance have to cripple and disfigure our lives before we wake up to its existence ? How many of us have become drunks and drug addicts , developed tumors and neuroses , succumbed to painkillers , gossip , and compulsive cell phone use , simply because we do n't do that thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? Resistance defeats us . If tomorrow morning by some stroke of magic every dazed and benighted soul woke up with the power to take the first step towards pursuing his or her dreams , every shrink in the directory would be out of business . Prisons would stand empty . The alcohol and tobacco industries would collapse , along with junk food , cosmetic surgery , and infotainment businesses , not to mention pharmaceutical companies , hospitals , and the medical profession from top to bottom . Domestic abuse would become extinct , as would addiction , obesity , migraine headaches , road rage and dandruff . <p> Look in your own heart . Uness I 'm crazy right now a still small voice is piping up , telling you as it has ten thousand times , the calling that is yours and yours alone . You know it . No one has to tell you . And unless I 'm crazy , you 're no closer to taking action on it than you were yesterday or will be tomorrow . You think Resistance is n't real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler wanted to be an artist . At eighteen he took his inheritance , seven hundred kronen , and moved to Vienna to live and study . He applied to the Academy of Fine Arts and later to the School of Architecture . Ever see one of his paintings ? Neither have I. Resistance beat him . Call it overstatement but I 'll say it anyway : it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas . <p> Quote:Resistance Is Most Powerful at The Finish Line Odysseus almost got home years before his actual homecoming . Ithaca was in sight , close enough that the sailors could see the smoke of their families ' fires on shore . Odysseus was so certain he was safe , he actually lay down for a snooze . It was then his men , believing there was gold in an ox-hide sack among their commander 's possessions , snatched this prize and cut it open . The bag contained the adverse winds , which King Aeolus had bottled up for Odysseys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The winds burst forth now in one mad blow , driving Odysseus ' ships back across every league of ocean they had with such difficulty traversed , making him endure further trials and sufferings before , at last and alone , he reached home for good . <p> The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight . At this point , Resistance knows we 're about to beat it . It hits the panic button . It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it 's got . <p> The professional must be alert for this counterattack . Be wary of the end . Do n't open that bag of wind . <p> Quote:Resistance and Procrastination Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it 's easiest to rationalize . We do n't tell ourselves , " I 'm never going to write my symphony . " Instead we say , " I am going to write my symphony tomorrow . " <p> What makes it tricky is that we live in a consumer culture that 's acutely aware of this unhappiness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By selling us a product , a drug , a distraction . John Lennon once wrote : <p> Well , you think you 're so clever and classless and free But you 're all fucking peasants As far as I can see . <p> As artists and professionals it is our obligation to enact our own internal revolution , a private insurrection inside our own skulls . In this uprising we free ourselves from the tyranny of consumer culture . We overthrow the the programming of advertising , movies , videogames , magazines , TV , and MTV by which we have been hypnotized from the cradle . We unplug ourselves from the grid by recognizing that we will never cure our restlessness by contributing our disposable income to the bottom line of Bullshit , Inc. , but only by doing our work . <p> Quote:How to Be Miserable In my younger days dodging the draft , I somehow wound up in the Marine Corps . There 's a myth that Marine training turns baby-faced recruits into bloodthirsty killers . Trust me , the Marine Corps is not that efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more useful . <p> The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable . <p> That is invaluable for an artist . <p> Marines love to be miserable . Marines derive a perverse satisfaction in having colder chows , crappier equipment , and higher casualty rates than any outfit of dogfaces , swab jockeys , or flyboys , all of whom they despise . Why ? Because these candy-asses do n't know how to be miserable . <p> The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell , whether he knows it or not . He will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation , rejection , self-doubt , despair , ridicule , contempt and humiliation . <p> The artist must be like the Marine . He has to know how to be miserable . He has to love being miserable . He has to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier or swab jockey . Because this war , baby . And war is hell . <p> Quote:We 're All Pros Already All of us are pros in one area : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for money . We are professionals . <p> Now : Are there principles we can take from what we 're already successfully doing in our workaday life and apply to our artistic aspirations ? What exactly are the qualities that define us as professionals ? <p> We show up every day We might do it only because we have to , to keep from getting fired . But we do it . We show up every day . <p> We show up no matter what . In sickness and in health , come hell or highwater , we stagger into the factory . We might do it only so as not to let down our co-workers , or for other , less noble reasons . But we do it . We show up no matter what . <p> We stay on the job all day . Our minds may wander . But our bodies remain at the wheel . We pick up the phone when it rings , we assist the customer when he seeks our help . We do n't go home until the whistle blows . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may go to another job , another company , another country . But we 'll still be working . Until we hit the lottery , we are part of the labor force . <p> The stakes for us are high and real . This is about survival , feeding our families , educating our children . <p> We accept remuneration for our labor . We 're not here for fun . We work for money . <p> We do not overidentify with our jobs . We may take pride in our work , we may stay late and come in on weekends , but we recognize that we are not our job descriptions . The amateur , on the other hand , over-identifies himself with his avocation , his artistic aspiration . He defines himself by it . He is a musician , painter , playwright . Resistance loves this . Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because he is overly invested in its success and over-terrified by its failure . The amateur takes it so seriously it paralyzes him . <p> We master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor about our jobs . <p> We receive praise or blame in the real world . <p> Now consider the amateur . The aspiring painter , the wannabe playwright . How does he pursue his calling ? <p> One , he does n't show up every day . Two , he does n't show up no matter what . Three , he does n't stay on the job all day . He is not committed over the long haul ; the stakes for him are illusory and fake . He does not get money . And he over-identifies with his art . He does not have a sense of humor about failure . You do n't hear him bitching , " This fucking trilogy is killing me ! " Instead , he does n't write his trilogy at all . <p> The amateur has not mastered the technique of his art . Nor does he expose himself to judgment in the real world . If we show our poem to our friend our friend says " It 's wonderful , I love it , " that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Nothing is as empowering as real-world validation , even if it 's for failure <p> The first professional writing job I ever had , after 17 years of trying , was on the movie called King Kong Lives . I and my partner-at-the-time , Ron Schusett ( a brilliant writer and producer who also did Alien and Total Recall ) hammered out the screenplay for Dino DeLaurentiis . We loved it ; we were sure we had a hit . Even after we 'd seen the finished film , we were certain it was a blockbuster . We invited everyone we knew to the premiere , even rented out the joint next door for a post-triumphant blowout . Get there early , we warned our friends , the place will be mobbed . <p> Nobody showed . There was only one guy in line beside our guests and he was muttering something about spare change . In the theatre , our friends endured the movie in mute stupefaction . When the lights came up , they fled like cockroaches into the night . <p> Next day came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pressfield ; we hope these are not their real names , for their partners ' sake . " When the first week 's grosses came in , the flick barely registered . Still I clung to hope . Maybe it 's only tanking in urban areas , maybe it 's playing better in the burbs . I motored to an Edge City multiplex . A youth manned the popcorn booth . " How 's King Kong Lives ? " I asked . He flashed thumbs-down . " Miss it man , it sucks . " <p> I was crushed . Here I was , forty-two years old , divorced , childless , having given up all normal human pursuits to chase the dream of being a writer ; now I 've finally got my name on a big time Hollywood production starring Linda Hamilton , and what happens ? I 'm a loser , a phony ; my life is worthless , and so am I. <p> My friend Tony Keppelman snapped me out of it by asking if I was gon na quit . Hell , no ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , are n't you ? So you 're taking a few blows . That 's the price for being in the arena and not on the sidelines . Stop complaining and be grateful . " <p> That was when I realized I had become a pro . I had not yet had a success . But I had had a real failure . <p> Quote:A Professional is Patient Resistance outwits the amateur with the oldest trick in the book : It uses his own enthusiasm against him . Resistance gets us to plunge into a project with an over ambitious and unrealistic timetable for its completion . It knows we ca n't sustain that level of intensity . We will hit the wall . We will crash . <p> The professional , on the other hand , understands delayed gratification . He is the ant , not the grasshopper ; the tortoise , not the hare . Have you heard the legend of Sylvester Stallone staying up three nights straight to churn out the screenplay for Rocky ? I do n't know , it may even be true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set before the awakening writer , because it seduces him into believing he can pull off the big score without pain and without persistence <p> The professional arms himself with patience , not only to give the stars time to align in his career , but to keep himself from flaming out in each individual work . He knows that any job , whether it 's a novel or a kitchen remodel , takes twice a slong as he thinks and costs twice as much . He accepts that . He recognizes it as reality . <p> The professional steels himself at the start of a project , reminding himself it is the Iditarod , not the sixty-yard dash . He conserves his energy . He prepares his mind for the long haul . He sustains himself with the knowledge that if he can just keep those huskies mushing , sooner or later the sled will pull in to Nome . <p> Quote:A Professional Plays it as It Lays My friend Hawk and I were playing the first hole at Prestwick in Scotland ; the wind was howling out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windward , but the gale caught it ; I watched in dismay as the ball sailed hard right , hit the screen going sideways , and bounded off into the cabbage . " Sonofabitch ! " I turned to our caddie . " Did you see the wind take that shot ? " <p> He gave that look that only Scottish caddies can give . " Well , ye 've got t ' play th'wind , do n't ye ? " <p> The professional conducts his business in the real world . Adversity , injustice , bad hops and rotten calls , even good breaks and lucky bounces all comprise the ground over which the campaign must be waged . The field is level , the professional understands , only in heaven . <p> Quote:The Ego and The Self Here 's what I think . I think angels make their home in the Self , while Resistance has its seat in the Ego . <p> The fight is between the two . <p> The Self wishes to create , to evolve . The Ego likes things just the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is my book , I 'll define it my way . <p> The Ego is that part of the psyche that believes in material existence . <p> The Ego 's job is to take care of business in the real world . It 's an important job . We could n't last a day without it . But there are world other than the real world , and this is where the Ego runs into trouble . <p> Here 's what the Ego believes : <p> Death is real . The Ego believes that our existence is defined by our physical flesh When the body dies , we die . There is no life beyond life . <p> Time and space are real . The Ego is analog . It believes that to get from A to Z we have to pass through B , C , and D. To get from breakfast to supper we have to live the whole day . <p> Every individual is different and separate from every other . The Ego believes that I am distinct from you . The twain can not meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> The predominant impulse of life is self-preservation . Because our existence is physical and thus vulnerable to innumerable evils , we live and act out of fear in all we do . it is wise , he Ego believes , to have children carry on our line when we die , to achieve great things that will live after us , and to buckle our seat belts . <p> There is no God . No sphere exists except the physical and no rules apply except those of the material world . <p> These are the principles the Ego lives by . They are sound solid principles . Here 's what the Self believes : <p> Death is an illusion . The soul endures and evolves through infinite manifestations . <p> Time and space are illusions . Time and space operate only in the physical sphere , and even here , do n't apply to dreams , visions and transports . In other dimensions we move " swift as thought " and inhabit multiple planes simultaneously . <p> All beings are one . If I hurt you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union and mutual assistance are the imperatives of life . We are all in this together . <p> God is all there is . Everything that is , is God in one form or another . God , the divine ground , is that in which we live and move and have our being . Infinite planes of reality exist , all created by , sustained by and infused by the spirit of God . <p> Fear of the consequences of following our heart . Fear of bankruptcy , fear of poverty , fear of insolvency . Fear of groveling when we try to make it on our own , and of groveling when we give up and come crawling back to where we started . Fear of being selfish , of being rotten wives or disloyal husbands ; fear of failing to support our families , of sacrificing their dreams for ours . Fear of betraying our race , our hood , our homies . Fear of failure . Fear of being ridiculous . Fear of throwing away the education , the training , the preparation that those we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked our butts off for . fear of launching into the void , of hurtling too far out there ; fear of passing some point of no return , beyond which we can not recant , can not reverse , can not rescind , but must live with this cocked-up choice for the rest of our lives . fear of madness . Fear of death . <p> These are serious fears . But they 're not the real fear . Not the Master Fear . the Mother of all Fears that 's close to us that even when we verbalize it we do n't believe it . <p> Fear that We Will Succeed . <p> That we can access powers we secretly know we possess . That we can become the person we sense in our hearts we truly are . That is the most terrifying prospect a human being can face , because it ejects him at one go ( he imagines ) from all the tribal inclusions his psyche is wired for and has been for fifty million years . <p> We know that if we embrace our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scares the hell out of us . What will become of us ? We will lose our friends and family , who will no longer recognize us . We will wind up alone , in the cold void of starry space , with nothing and noone to hold on to . Of course that is exactly what happens . But here 's the trick . We wind up in space but not alone . Instead we are tapped into an unquenchable , undepletable , inexhaustible source of wisdom , consciousness , companionship . Yeah , we lose friends . But we find friends too , in places we never thought to look . And they 're better friends , truer friends . And we 're better and truer to them . <p> Do you believe me ? <p> Quote:The Definition of a Hack I learned this from Robert McKee . A hack , he says , is a writer who second-guesses his audience . When the hack sits down to work , he does n't ask himself what 's in his own heart . He asks what the market is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thinks he 's superior to them . The truth is , he 's scared to death of them or , more accurately , scared of being authentic in front of them , scared of writing what he really thinks and believes , what he himself thinks is interesting . He 's afraid it wo n't sell . So he tries to anticipate what the market ( a telling word ) wants , the gives it to them . <p> In other words , the hack writes hierarchically . He writes what he imagines will play well in the eyes of others . He does not ask himself , What do I myself want to write ? What do I think is important ? Instead he asks , What 's hot , what can I make a deal for ? <p> The hack is like the politician who consuls the polls before he takes a position . He 's a demagogue . He panders . <p> It can pay off , being a hack . Given the depraved state of American culture , a slick dude can make millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose , because you 've sold out you Muse , and your Muse is you , the best part of yourself , where your finest and only true work comes from . <p> I was starving as a screenwriter when the idea for The Legend of Bagger Vance came to me . I met with my agent to give him the bad news . We both knew that first novels take forever and sell for nothing . Worse , a novel about golf , even if we could find a publisher , is a straight shot for the remainder bin . <p> But the Muse had me . I had to do it . To my amazement , the book succeeded critically and commercially better than anything I 'd ever done , and others since have been lucky too . Why ? My best guess is this : I trusted what I wanted , not what I thought would work . I did what I myself thought was interesting and left its reception to the Gods . <p> The artist ca n't do his work hierarchically . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hierarchy How can we tell if our orientation is territorial or hierarchical ? <p> One way is to ask ourselves , If I were feeling really anxious , what should I do ? If we would pick up the phone and call six friends , one after the other , with the aim of hearing their voices and reassuring ourselves that they still love us , we 're operating hierarchically . <p> We 're seeking the opinion of others . <p> What would Arnold Schwarzenegger do on a freaky day ? He would n't phone his buddies ; he 'd head for the gym . He would n't care if the place was empty , if he did n't say a word to a soul . He knows that working out , all by itself , is enough to bring him back to his center . <p> His orientation is territorial . <p> Here 's another test . Of any activity you do ask yourself : If I were the last person on earth , would I still do it ? <p> If you 're alone on the planet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to impress . So , if you 'd still pursue that activity , congratulations . You 're doing it territorially . <p> If Arnold Schwarzenegger were the last man on earth , he 'd still go to the gym . Stevie Wonder would still pound the piano . The sustenance they get comes from the act itself , not from the impression it makes on others . I have a friend who is nuts for clothes . If she were the last woman on earth , she would shoot straight to Givenchy or St. Laurent , smash her way in , and start pillaging . In her case , it would n't be to impress others . She just loves clothes . That 's her territory . <p> Now : What about ourselves as artists ? How do we do our work ? Hierarchically or territorially ? If we were freaked out , would we go there first ? If we were the last person on earth , would we still show up at the studio , the rehearsal hall , the laboratory ? <p> Quote:The Fruits of Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our labor but not the fruits of our labor , he was counseling the warrior to act territorially , not hierarchically . We must do our work for its own sake , not for fortune or attention or applause . <p> Then there 's the third way proffered by the Lord of Discipline , which is beyond both hierarchy and territory . That is to do the work and give it to Him . Do it as an offering to God <p> Give the act to me Purged of hope and ego , Fix your attention on the soul Act and do for me . <p> The work comes from heaven anyway . Why not give it back ? <p> To labor this way , The Bhagavad-Gita tells us , is a form of meditation and a supreme species of spiritual devotion . It also , I believe , conforms most closely to Higher Reality . In fact , we are servants of the Mystery . We were put here on this earth to act as agents of the Infinite , , to bring into existence that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Every breath we take , every heartbeat , every evolution of every cell comes from God and is sustained by God every second , just as every creation , invention , every bar of music or line of verse , every thought , vison , fantasy , every dumb-ass flop and stroke of genius comes from that infinite intelligence that created us and the universe in all its dimensions , out of the Void , the field of infinite potential , primal chaos , the Muse . To acknowledge that reality , to efface all ego , to let the work come through us and give it back freely to its source , that , in my opinion , is as true to reality as it gets . 
@@96058995 @258995/ <p> I think the game was released before 2004 but was way ahead of its time . <p> I remember reading this article in 2002 when I tried to understand the game , I did n't like it at first . <p> LONG ... Read all parts and keep in mind the game was released before facebook . This article focuses first on the post-modern elements of the game , the game is kind of whacky in a sense and received a lot of criticism but after reading it it made me appreciate it for what it was . <p> Then the 3rd game was released and a lot more people got to appreciate MGS2 . <p> I 'm really surprised at how this post-modern game meshes well with the red-pillway of thinking . Actually thinking about it most of the recent culture war stuff and red-pill thinking was already in my mind way before , experienced in this game . <p> Metal Gear was a weapon designed to launch nuclear missiles in the first game from anywhere on the planet , it was a mech equipped with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had simple gameplay , the goal of the game was clear yet the dialogues and the plot was extremely well executed and made you question who exactly were the bad guys and why you were performing your duty as a soldier . The game went ahead and criticized nuclear weapons and genetic engineering . <p> Notably , with the fake news stories that we are seeing today and how there is a need to control information for governements with so much data released today , the Metal Gear of the second game was a giant server hidden under an oil offshore station ( Big hell ) capable of processing any information on the planet in order for the Patriots to keep control of what is going on and releasing the news , the science discoveries and the propaganda they want . The main character is also different from the first game , Raiden is supposed to represent the player , you are not Snake anymore , you are a nobody and you experience MGS2 as a character with no backstory . Raiden represents the player . The Big Shell mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do - the Patriots , who control the AI system , made the sequel the fans wanted . The impression it leaves on the gamer is unforgettable , but I will always remember this quote from the game : <p> " In the current , digitized world , trivial information is accumulating every second , preserved in all its triteness . Never fading , always accessible . Rumors about petty issues , misinterpretations , slander ... All this junk data preserved in an unfiltered state , growing at an alarming rate . It will only slow down social progress , reduce the rate of evolution . " <p> MGS2 is a game that makes you question everything . <p> Anyone else played this great game and feel with the current state of the world it was way ahead of its time and has to be considered a masterpiece ? <p> Played this game about 11 years ago . One of the best games ever , and really got me thinking about the true purpose of humanity at a young age , and that purpose was to pass on our genes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time , a masterpiece for sure . As a game , I 'd take MGS1 over MGS2 though . <p> The Codec conversation you mention reminds me of some posts on rooshv.com , The Hegelian Dialectic , Nationalism is a Trap , and the Future of The USA , Russia , and The New World Order posts in particular . <p> There is so much information that is preserved now thanks to digitization . The " Patriots " are trying to control the context of this excess information build-up ; taking the truth about humans , and the meanings of those truths , to be used for future generations . It 's all about having power over humanity 's thoughts and behaviour . <p> They do make an interesting point about how people will tell them selves " truths " to make themselves feel better , even if they are not true - " body-positive " people for example . <p> Here 's the ending of MGS2 through an " red-pill " lens ; how it relates to us on the forum and it 's practical use to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We are a copy , or combination , of someone else 's DNA . Our initial place in the world and initial role in society is undetermined by us , and the memories we have before being , " red-pilled " , are burdens we all have to carry , but we make choices to decide who we are by interpreting the world . <p> Our brain is really what interprets " reality " as real or fiction . We make our choices by looking at the meaning behind the words ( instead of taking words as truth alone ) . Most of what is told to us that 's real , is actually fiction ( fake news ? our " blue-pill " mindset ) . <p> Our choices should help us cultivate the person we want to see passed on to future generations - through our genes/DNA and through the culture and teachings of life we pass on as well . We must both build the future , and keep the past alive . <p> The last few hours of that game was the only time I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to play it again , now that I know what to expect and what to look out for story wise . It was a great game . <p> Amazing game even though I liked the first one more . These two have all I ever wanted , swords , cyborg ninjas , badass characters and guns , amazing plot , etc . Hideo Kojima was and still is a God of games . <p> The one question from the end ing the the game that always stick with related to popular trends . I 'm paraphrasing from 15 year old memories at this point , but it raises the question of how do songs or movies become top hits .

In our unnatural , culturally marxist , feminist society , knowledge of game can truly save a mans life . 49880 @qwx909880 <p> I do n't think I 've ever read anything that hit so close to home like that piece did . At several points I actually had to stop reading because memories from high school were vividly coming back to me ( minus thoughts of suicide , which I never even came close to considering ) .

He lost me at the point where he went from biggest loser of all times to a guy suddenly picking up strippers just because he lost it at one time and went to a stripclub where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( LOL ) sexual touching he has seen in Euro-porn movies .

Not one conversation about it in years . Either he 's bullshitting about having such " friends " or he is overall bullshitting . <p> I had a rough time also being a shy introverted unsocial guy before I swallowed the blue pill at 31 years old but at least I had banged about a dozen of girls and had relationships ( long and very short ) in between . I knew my mistake was within me and not the feminists/white knight/disney fairytale/nice guy world . I knew I had to get worldly and popular and get out of the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true and has too many plotholes . It will probably follow up with some sort of ( PUA ) product in a while . <p> I used to work with a guy who never had a girlfriend at 30 .

I 've read the piece several times and though my dry spell was n't as long as his , this piece really hit close to the chest for me as well . A big point to it is that sex is really nothing to chicks , and in many ways , it 's everything to us dudes ( very depedestalizing ) , among others . Many brilliant comments on the blog 's page as well . <p> Disclaimer : tl , dr - the math does add up , his wording is just a little clumsy at points . <p> To address the math discrepancies y'all are seeing , lemme clear it up : the author is 37 at the time of the posting . His high school girlfriend and his ex-wife are the same person . He lost his virginity to her when they were both 17ish , and they broke up afterwards ( ' cuz he was too beta ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice guy and obviously not getting laid . He then attends the 30th birthday party of the woman who will soon be his wife ( they 're not yet " together " at this point ) and then ex-wife , which is where he leaves and commences banging strippers ( I know , sounds fishy , but the author seems quite intelligent , and he essentially decided to do the exact opposite of everything he 'd done before , so I 'll buy it ) . He marries the girl he banged in high school ( she was obviously looking to hop off the carousel ) , because he 's banging strippers and it gets her steamy , and he , being the beta at heart , starts the ever familiar slide into betatude , and *bingo , bango , bongo* , they get divorced ( which I believe happened this past year ) . But , he was more savvy this time , and started working on his game just a couple months after . Hope this helps y'all , I had to read through a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other posts , he 's a pretty funny guy , and thanks to the original author , M3. 49880 @qwx909880 <p> The stripper seduction part does n't seem entirely truthful . It 's possible that he paid her for it and simply omitted that part---but even if he did , that does n't detract anything from the narrative arc . 49880 @qwx909880 <p> It is more likely that he ended a dryspell using an escort . He would have to have been very skilled or lucky to land a stripper , going from zeroe game to that all of a sudden . I like what he is doing and the way he is reaching out to other guys , I can relate and I know other guys who can as well . 49880 @qwx909880 <p> My dry spell was a lot longer than this guys but for some reason I never developed the rage and cynicism that seems so common for guys in similar situations . Sure I feel some contempt when I see some chick whining about not having had a cock in 2 weeks but not rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a shy introverted unsocial guy before I swallowed the blue pill at 31 years old but at least I had banged about a dozen of girls and had relationships ( long and very short ) in between . <p> If you had such great results , why did you feel as if you were having a rough time ? 12 or so girls is already quite above the average . If that 's what being shy , introverted and unsocial brings you , there should be no rationale for game at all . Were you unusually tall , muscled , rich , popular or something ? <p> I was involuntarily celibate until age 22 , and by that I mean not just that I was a virgin , but that I could literally not score a single date . No kiss either , ever . The furthest I got during those seven years ( if we assume that real sexual urges start at about 15 ) was a few numbers .

But make no mistake , the 7-year dry spell was HELL . I do n't think most people really understand how unimaginably cruel the sexual market can be . It 's no wonder that I get enraged at this kind of people - particularly clueless women , white knights or naturals - who think that someone would actually choose to undergo so much pain , that he deserves it , or that it 's easy to fix . 49880 @qwx909880 <p> While I agree M3 's math for his timeline is off and the stripper part seemed weird , I get the feeling that it 's just because M3 writes in a very raw style that puts emotion ahead of complete accuracy . As far as his emotions are concerned , they correspond exactly to mine . 49880 @qwx909880 <p> That article hurts to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a period of incel in my life ( though nowhere near that long ) that was very difficult and felt a lot of those things myself . It 's angering that everything that is told to you by the people you trust ( yes , that includes media ) is just so wrong . <p> And then one day it occurred to me -- I 'm a fucking hypocrite and so is pretty much everyone else who goes through this . <p> I have in the past lamented , " why are the hottest chicks such bitches and care only about how good a guy looks , how much money he makes , etc ... ? ? ? Shallow cunts . Fucking shallow cunts . If they just got to know me , they 'd be in love with me . I 'm really quite an interesting and funny guy . Girls who do know me well very often fall for me but they 're not very hot . Some are fat , some ugly , some OK , some a little cute but none of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be such a shallow cunt . " <p> I 've thought along these line myself and I 've heard it said more than enough times . Movies are built around this premise . The unpopular guy who is in love with the cheerleader while his average-looking geeky female friend idly pines for him secretly . For years , the irony and hypocrisy did n't occur to me . <p> And then I got it . I 'm no better than the hot bitches who passed me over for Mr. Hot Stud , or Mr. Jerk , or whoever . <p> So the guy that wrote that article , if he is sincere - not just trying to set up a PUA sell - I ca n't help but wonder how many fat , ugly chicks he hit on and got rejected by in all that time that he was " just looking for someone to love " . He wants to pour acid over the faces of the bitches that ignored him while they went on to have ONS 's with a more studly dude but how many girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and he did n't cuz they were n't hot enough for him ? So much for altruism . <p> We are all the same this way . Every person in the world is hypergamous to the extent that they will trade up if they feel the benefit outweighs the costs . That is n't to say that every single guy will dump a 6 in looks for the 7 in looks because there 's more to it than that . But when you take all the other stuff that goes along with it , the security of a stable relationship vs the risk of a new one , the trouble to having a high-maintenance girl vs a low-maintenance one -- when you take everything into consideration , everybody will trade up if a better deal is to be had . <p> Once you realize this - and that for as much a " nice guy " you consider yourself to be , you 're really not as nice as you thought - you start to be more objective about it and fully understand why it 's important to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might not be born with the best genes or be the tallest guy or have a big bank account , but there are plenty of things you can do to bring yourself up from the 30th percentile to the 70th or 80th percentile of women 's choices . <p> So does this guy , or any of us that have felt that way at one time or another , have the right to feel sorry for himself ?

He has gone to great effort to improve himself , he has developed a descent body either during incel or not , he is a quality bloke .

LOL <p> I agree with your point , but only now with the luxury of some hindsight . Is it really possible for guys stuck within the matrix to even know what women find attractive ? <p> Although I had my first girlfriend at age three and had a romantic girlfriend nearly every year since then , I 've had some long dry spells myself . And it was n't for lack of effort - I worked out , remained social , put myself out there and tried to play the game as I understood it . And how was I to understand any better ? <p> I think the message of the incel post is that society ( meaning women ) conspires to keep men in the dark about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; about what is attractive to women . <p> And it 's getting even more dark lately - women conspire to create the beta class of men , and are getting openly snide towards them . It 's not just that they are hypergamous , they openly sneer at a class of undesireables that they willfully create . It 's as if their group sexual strategy relied on betas to be hungry for pussy , in order to garner attention and favors and provisioning . Which it does . Biology and evolution and the resulting socio-biology are all sick motherfucking cock suckers . <p> During the horrible , horrible times lean of sex or female attention , how was I to learn ? There is no feedback for betas that can positively re-enforce attractive behavior . The positive enforcement comes when you change your circumstances such that you are deemed more attractive , and only then can you naturally begin to take on new traits . Or nowadays we can learn a bit from our peers to kickstart the process . <p> One of my many entrepreneurial venture hit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was my first introduction to success . Suddenly I was dating three girls at once . That taught me a mindset of assuming attraction , and was an introduction to a new approach . I know some people downplay money , but for me at that time having it made a night and day difference to my dating life - and everything in my experience and all my analytical ability says that it was absolutely NOT all down to confidence . The money was my local fame , my peackocking , my way of standing out . It opened doors faster than anything I 'd ever experienced . Throwing around a few hundred bucks on a date because it made no difference to me ; the days income was in excess of 1000 , that kind of thing made girls tell me what " a great personality " I 'd suddenly acquired . <p> Women willfully create the beta class of men , and willfully keep them in the dark about there even being another class , and work hard to deny class mobility .

@@96058999 @258999/ <p> I 've been getting heavily into direct game over the past month and it 's clear that it suits my personality much more than skulking around the girl indirectly , both in terms of how I feel about myself but also in terms of getting numbers infield . Up until yesterday , I was averaging around 25% of girls responding positively , but ultimately admitting they 've got a boyfriend or - as happened today - admitting they are single but that they think I 'm too old for me ( I do n't look old in my face but I do have quite a few grey hairs for my age , it 's true ) . However , today I seemed to step up a gear and had the experience of getting at least half the girls I opened react positively and stick around to hear my story , including two 8s , one of whom I managed to get her contact details . Furthermore , today was my best day in terms of approaches on a workday , given that I managed to open 20 sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny and warm all day here in Leipzig for the first time in quite a while - but I also noticed as I was approaching that I was much more sure about the way I was going about it , whether it was from getting right in front of the girl and doing a policeman 's stop with my hand , to my tone of voice , to holding solid eye contact , as well as my general not giving much of a fuck attitude as to how the interactions might pan out . I was really vibing with quite a few of these women and it was clear from their body language that they were enjoying the interaction , judging from how some of the sets were constantly playing with their hair and coming in very close as the interaction progressed . However , the same problem kept occurring , almost every girl I opened admitted to either having a husband ( usually these are the women who are late 20s or early 30s ) or they tell me they have a boyfriend . <p> Anyway , aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , which surely affects nearly every guy on here whenever he 's running daygame , I had a rather interesting experience along the way which I was very interested in getting an opinion on from RVFers : <p> After getting a visual IOI on the street from a cute , tall , curvy and nerdy-looking German girl , mid-20s , I run up to her without hesitation and instantly stop her from the front . Although somewhat shocked , she still breaks out into a big smile and she hooks pretty much immediately , asking me about what I 'm doing here , et.c . After about 5 minutes of chatting , I go for the number close and she drops the boyfriend bomb . I look her up and down and say to her , " No , please do n't tell me this is true " and she starts to get a bit flushed in the face and embarassed as I tell her that I still want to go out on a date with her . It 's clear from her tone of voice and body language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she does n't sound very convinced when I ask her again . At this point , I take her hand and say to her , OK , no worries , I 'll be on my way then , but something weird happens at this point : I just keep holding her hand saying and I eye her up and down and stare into her eyes , " My God , I really do n't care you 've got a boyfriend , I just want you " . She blushes even more and makes some various mock protestations , but I can tell that she 's getting hot under the collar as well , sexually-speaking . When I pressed her about how serious the relationship with her BF was , she mentioned that she 'd been with him for 6 years , but I know from experience that women who 've been in relationships this long are often looking to monkey branch at this juncture . In any case , I 've learned to discard what women say during the interaction and focus solely on the body language and judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction and that it was quite strong . It was n't just clear from this , the sexual vibe was palpable and it was extremely frustrating not being able to act on it . <p> Incidentally , a very similar thing also happened in one of my other sets today , with the girl telling me that she would have dated me had she not had a BF ( she was also showing quite strong IOIs through her body language ) , so I was inclined to treat her utterance as perhaps not just a polite brush-off . But here 's the deal : the thing that was common to both of these sets was that when I persisted after they 'd dropped the BF bomb , I could feel a spike in the sexual temperature of the interaction go up significantly . With this second girl , when she dropped the BF bomb on me , I simply told her flat out , " I do n't care , I still want to meet up with you " looking her very seductively in the eye and then giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in her assets . I could tell from how hesitant she was in answering me with another no and from the fact that she did n't seem in any hurry to either move away from me ( she had already come in quite close as the interaction progressed ) that she was - like the nerdy girl - at least tempted and intrigued . <p> I had n't intended to inject any sexual tension strategically into these interactions by responding in the way I did , it simply happened spontaneously as a result of how I was feeling at the time . But on the way home , feeling on the one hand quite pleased with myself but , on the other hand , very frustrated - not least sexually - that I had n't been able to progress these sets to their natural conclusion , I started to become vexed over how to proceed in the future . Given that it was precisely in those moments when I really made it clear that I wanted these girls sexually , the response from the girls was clearly the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no for the sake of having a BF - I was wondering whether I can use this tactic in the future , but in a more consistent and forthright manner to finally get the lay from my direct approaches . I feel like I 'm getting closer and closer to cracking the code in my interactions , in terms of how many women are responding positively to me , but I keep stopping short of the goal by having to march my troops back down the hill again when the BF bomb gets dropped on me . As I sat on the tram tonight going home , I found myself thinking , " Fuck it , next time I 'm just going to tell them I want to bang them there and then and see how they respond . " Yes , this is pretty crass , I know , but whenever I 've really pushed the boundaries to the point where I thought the woman would take offence , I 've actually found she 's responded even more positively , as paradoxical as that might sound to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here about this idea ? When I feel that a girl is sexually attracted enough , although her words coming out of her mouth are formally , " I ca n't , I 've got a BF " , should I just go for broke and offer to lay her there and then ? I really need to end a multi-year dry spell ( 3 years and 1 month now ) and so I really do n't care very much what I need to do here , and I can sense that there 's definitely a subset of girls that I 'm attracted to who are tempted , but for whom I might just need to adopt an even more persistent approach . Or is my thinking way off base here ? I 'd really appreciate the input of some more experienced guys on here , since all I 've got at the moment is the fishbowl of my own head to bounce these thoughts around in , which really is n't helping much . <p> 1 ) She 's actually got a bf/husband and has no intention of straying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd respect that and leave her be . It 's an ethical boundary I choose not to cross - I doubt you 'd like it if some guy kept pursuing your girl even after she had mentioned you to him ? <p> 2 ) She 's not into you and is using that as an excuse to get you to leave . <p> If boyfriend , get that instagram ( easier ) or number , say message me if it does n't work out . I 'd probably just walk away if its husband during day game , maybe grab Instagram ... <p> A few notes though if you want to push it that day : " No , please do n't tell me this is true " sounds a bit beta to me . I 'd probably say something like " that 's unfortunate . " <p> At that point personally I would not speak of the boyfriend and trying to convince her out of it . I 'd focus more on getting her somewhere for a drink without expectations . Every time you bring up the BF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get her focused on you and having a coffee or a beer , she does n't have to get as guilty . <p> Also , it 's possible many of these girls who say they have a boyfriend are lying to prevent further conversation due to a lack of body language , eye contact , bad opener , etc . <p> But holy shit , 3 years dry : / " My God , I really do n't care you 've got a boyfriend , I just want you , " is an aggressive move and you got ta say that with the confidence of someone who get 's it in weekly . Also , download some apps . And hit a party town or SEA and end that streak. 3 days and I start getting antsy haha . <p> Lots of threads about " IHAB " . Should have gone looking for one of those , and as Darkwing said , this should be in the newbie section . <p> Short Answer : treat it like any other shit test and see what happens . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you or you have n't made a good enough impression , it will still go nowhere . If she does n't , or does n't give a shit and is using it as resistance while still being into you , then you can keep moving towards the payoff like any other approach . <p> I 'd say as a general rule if it 's one of the very first things they say , that it wo n't be worth your time to keep at it even if it is possible , but if it comes up as a sort of middle or last minute resistance , then you still could have a chance . <p> Agreed -- I used to hammer away at trying to counter this kind of shit , but I have yet to find the point to it . And on top of that , it seems to thwart the abundance mentality we should always be adhering to . <p> I 'd say you 're coming across as quite intimidating - do n't ramp it up even further . Easier said than done , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference , and do n't labour the point . <p> ( 05-03-2017 03:58 PM ) Feldeinsamkeit Wrote : What do you guys think on here about this idea ?

You may have an in there , assuming you do n't mind that she 's got a boyfriend or is married . <p> A fun thing to say that I 've used when confronted with this ( I stole it ) is " Are you happy ? " <p> Say it somewhat mockingly and jovially so you have plausible deniability . Watch and listen to her reaction . <p> The interaction is probably still at and end , but I did have that work once . <p> ( 05-03-2017 03:58 PM ) Feldeinsamkeit Wrote : What do you guys think on here about this idea ?

I have been reading up on this a bit lately and find that it reinforces my observation that men ( myself definitely included ) routinely UNDERESTIMATE how far we can push a seduction . It also seems like the logical next step in your direct game development . <p> First of all , thanks to everybody that 's chipped in on here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> @JackSmith : I think you 've dispensed some really useful advice there , because it chimes in so well with my actual experiences at the coalface of my interactions with women in public . One simple example which backs this up is as follows : When I started going direct on the street , I used to open women by ambling up beside them and saying in a relatively low , almost apologetic tone of voice , " Excuse me , could I just ... " . The result was that nearly even girl would n't even stop , let alone grace me with a Teutonic brush-off . However , yesterday , when I was running up to women , swinging around in a cartwheel and putting my hand flat out to their chest to bring them to a quick halt , it was working an absolute treat , judging by the expressions on their faces and the fact that they stuck around to banter with me . Before I got the idea to do this , I believed that women would have been terrified of this tactic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was almost as if the respect that you gain from doing this as a man outweighs any hesitation they would otherwise have to interact with you . Again , this is n't me pontificating about theory from behind the keyboard , it 's consistent infield experience that I can point to from having opened almost 200 sets directly in the last 5 weeks . <p> It 's the same story with the reactions of some of the women that I 've opened . Although they 've protested that they 've got a boyfriend , they 've started to crumble and completely lose frame , mumbling things like , " I ca n't do this , no , I ca n't ... " but I can see in their body language that they 're bloody tempted and are hugely conflicted in that moment . I 've had about 4 girls do this up to now and it 's a clear pattern that I 'm starting to see , but it took a while for the reality of what was happening to sink in . The first time it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very randy and approached a young , tall and very cute blond , a clear 8 , in a hardware store and at first she gave me the ice queen brush-off , but I simply backed off , said no worries to her and kept on looking at the stationery , fully expecting that she 'd move away and that would be the end of that interaction . Instead , she starts looking back over at me ( she was about 2 meters away at that point ) and comes back up to me , saying , " I ca n't do this , but ... inaudible words " and does n't even seem sure about what she 's saying , even though her English was excellent . I then just go back into game mode and she falls totally into my frame . After several minutes of vibeing with her , I try to instadate her and she tells me that she 's moving to Switzerland in the next few days and that she needs to pack her gear the same night , in addition to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that she 's getting hot and bothered , i.e. she 's visibly flushed the more I flirt with her , her words are becoming less coherent the longer we 're talking , et.c. , suggest that she 's thinking about my offer . Incidentally , if I 'd had this experience with only one young woman , I could have just written it off as a fluke , but I 've had it happen at least a couple of times since , so it seems that there was at least the potential to make something out of this situation if I 'd only have had a better idea in real time of what was happening and so could have responded appropriately . <p> As for those guys on here who argue that you should just walk away when a woman plays the BF card . Well , in many cases , you 're surely right , since the woman will be genuinely committed to the guy and I would n't want to interfere with that . But there 's a subset of women who are half-in , half-out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at least open to my approach and it would seem completely unreasonable for me to rule them out , especially since nearly every girl that is attractive has some guy in their lives . If I was to wait for a girl to come along who did n't mention the BF , I 'd wait forever . And therein lies the rub with the suggestion that I should simply bail as soon as the BF is brought up : I simply do n't have the luxury of doing that , especially as I 'm trying to break an epic dry spell . <p> Anyway , thanks very much , JackSmith , for the link to the video on rapid escalation . This is EXACTLY the medicine that I 've been looking for and really look forward to digesting it when I get the time to watch it in full . <p> I know I ca n't be the only one who remembers what Mystery used to say about this sort of thing . Sometimes a girl will tell you she has a boyfriend not because she is n't interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what her situation is . She may not be available for dating or a relationship , but if you continue gaming her , pushing through her resistance/overcoming her objections , ( in her mind ) she is n't to blame if you hookup . After all , you 're the one who seduced her , not the other way around . <p> Sometimes girls will use lines like " I ca n't , I 've got a boyfriend " and really mean it . But she might just be telling you ( in her own indirect female way ) that the possibility of sex is still on the table if your game is tight enough . <p> Yea , a lot of guys here are forgetting that " I have a BF " is usually a fundamental shit test . Even if she has a BF , it 's a shit test . If you 're very attracted to the girl , keep going and treat it as if she said " the weather is nice today " . A few off the cuff responses you can use : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I ask for your life story ? " ( say it with a smirk so it does n't come off as mean ) " I 'm married " ( say it deadpan and then just keep on talking ) " Cool , do you love him ? " ( bold ! especially within the first few seconds of a convo ) <p> The reality is most anywhere near attractive girls have a boyfriend , husband , or some other guy(s) in her life . So it really depends . She could be lying , she could be telling the truth , she could be telling half truth ( e.g. she has a few orbiters or FBs ) , you never know . <p> You can be moral about it and say you 're not going to bother with any girls who have any type of man in their life . But then you are removing 90% of the female population . You can believe the BF thing and say it 's not worth it and again remove 90% of the female population . <p> Sometimes girls say it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it to not look bad . I 'm not that big on the shit test theory . Not everything a girl says or does is a test . Sometimes a relationship is genuinely serious and she will not leave it for a random guy she met in a grocery store . You never know . <p> Just go for the number and the meet like any other number . Do n't treat it with excessive time and effort , she has to be responsive at least . When you get a lot of numbers , keep pinging them quickly , because you never know which ones may come through . Daygame is hard man , more than skill it is just emotional endurance , you pound the pavement and hustle your ass off for a bunch of numbers , then you have to get dates , then you have to close . You will get a huge flake rate which takes a steaming piss all over your hard work you did to get those numbers . But within those numbers should be a prospect that will come through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single interactions . Attempt to get contact details for meet , move on . Who knows her life story and who the hell cares . All you care about is the bang . To get that it takes a lot of numbers . <p> Other than that , If you 're in a 3+ year drought , I would second DigitalNomad 's advice and go to SEA for a month or something . Desire is good especially to persevere in daygame , but 3 years ? Man that is not right . <p> Truth is you can not know . A girl can say that for many different reasons . So you can either carry on or bail . Your choice . <p> Better way to see what is up is to talk hypothethically about what you can both do together next time you see each other and watch how she reacts to that . She might want it despite having a BF . That tells more than words . <p> Doing daygame , my average of girls with boyfriends is quite high . These girls will meet me ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boyfriend line . I get the impression they 're prospecting . <p> Now I 'm going indirect , but the circumstances make it obvious what 's going down " at least I like to think so . In case of doubt , I make the situation clear during the date . <p> Thing is " how much time does one spend pseudo-dating these girls ? Is it really worth the effort ? <p> In a way it 's heartening to hear that these girls can be converted . I do think it 's possible . But I find myself wondering : is it worth the effort ? Is my return on investment not better on a fresh girl ? <p> Reading over my own post , I think I know what the answer is . <p> What do you guys think about the typical black guy routine " just ask ' em outright if " they have a boyfriend " . I thought it was crude before , but maybe there 's actually some wisdom to it . <p> I am not sure why you would want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You did a great thing by talking to women on street which is hard for any guys . You feel like you overcame the first step but you are stuck with this I have a bf roadblock . <p> So you want the solution to demolish that roadblock . There is no such thing . <p> In sales , the most common excuse is Let me think about it or Let me talk to my wife . I told sales person Let me think about it and he came back with ' What exactly do you want to think about ' <p> It was a great comeback question but sounded rude too . I was speechless for a bit . But I did n't care whether he said something clever . I was n't just convinced with the product enough and wanted to go home . <p> So instead of focusing on BF answer , focus on your whole presentation . ( looks , talking , eye contacts etc ) then there will be less roadblocks . <p> If you hear BF answer , something already went wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whether it 's true or not is irrelevant - she 's turning you down . Next . <p> If she really had a boyfriend but was interested in you , she would n't even mention it at all . Just like when I game girls - I do n't tell them that I 'm married . <p> So she 's shooting you down . Eject . <p> Optimist : " The glass is half full . " Pessimist : " The glass is half empty .

@@96059003 @259003/ <p> For you bald gents out there , i 'm pretty sure you 'll find your angle just fine . For cats like myself who never had direction in their life regarding hair this is very important and can amp up your notches in the same way a good suit can . <p> I used to get a princeton cut ( think near buzz ) for most of my life . Until recently , i started growing my hair out . I discovered the power of a left part of hair . <p> I found a good barber in town and asked him what i should do when it grows out . He said , push it to the left and tease it up for a prince charming poof . <p> I bought some Brylcreem ( great product ) and let it grow out . After 3 months of playing and testing , i 've found my sweet spot . <p> I 've noticed girls staring and looking so much more often at me . Lots of doe eyes and it makes cold opening women significantly easier . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slick my hair , and still pull chicks . The hair is so massively helpful . <p> If you 've been getting the same cut for awhile try something different . Have a short cut ? Grow it out and do a left part a la Don Draper . Do what I did and poof it up for a more charming look . <p> The key is to find a good barber . Get a guy that has been in the game awhile so her knows how to cut hair like they did back in the day . Once you find one , stick to him for as long as you can . <p> I grew my hair out wild last year , kind of like the guy from Hell on Wheels . <p> Never looked back . I 've had girls on campus stop me in my tracks and ask if they can touch my hair . Its insane how much more power and sexuality I convey with the long hair . Its got so much more danger and mystery now . The fact that I 'm an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started dousing it lightly with Almond oil for shine and strength . Eventually I threw out my shitty Axe pomade and invested in some Redken Rewind #6 . If you have near shoulder-length hair this stuff is amazing . You can keep reworking it throughout the day and girls can run their fingers through it without getting grossed out by the texture . <p> Hair makes all the difference in the world . When guys say that older cats can pull college girls well into their late 40 's or whatever - that 's mostly true if they have a full head of hair . In fact - a 40 year old man with hair beats a 30 year old dude who 's visibly balding every single time . <p> Having said all that , my hair 's thinning out pretty quick and my game is better than ever . <p> I totally feel this thread ! I went with the short buzz cut ( 1/2 " guard/guide ) until last year . Finally let it grow out a bit and damn do the women dig it ! Highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . Thankfully I 'm blessed with hair in my mid-30 's , unlike my father and grandfather . May a higher power help you fine folks who are cursed with pattern baldness ! <p> For the last six years I was buzz cut , till my machine broke down . A friend refer me to his barber , and I see some positive change after ditching the buzz cut . There is still room for improvement in this department , but I can safely say that this is something to take into consideration . Experiment with it , and find your sweet spot . Same goes for beard/clothing/style . <p> ( 10-10-2013 08:39 PM ) MaleDefined Wrote : Hair is key .

I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , but I 've got broad shoulders and a big chest , so I think I pull it off . Imagine a cross between Mr. Clean and the Brawny Man . I do think it looks a whole lot better than a regular " balding-guy " hair cut . I 've never really noticed much difference with women as for totally bald vs full head of hair , but that 's just me . <p> ( 10-18-2013 10:45 PM ) houston Wrote : Scarface more info on oil ?

One other thing is , although long hair in Serbia is synonymous with rock and metal music ( which I certainly am into ) , I never really dressed in that fashion , sot there was always a juxtaposition in my looks which can be intriguing to a lot of girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very short buzz cut with no. 1 guard . So know its short hair , and earrings punk look , but still dressing stylish , usually aiming for that High/Low look . Got ta keep ' em guessing ! <p> Yeah , I think hair is important . There 's this trend going around with Black people , the fade . Since I got this cut I 'm getting better results with my approaches . So yeah , it has something to do with it . <p> I have long hair and it makes my otherwise average face and weak chin stand out a lot in a good way . I love it , and women do too . However , I 'm afraid that it will look very bad when I start balding , which is already happening . <p> James Matador goes around wearing a wig - why ? Because he pulls more girls wearing it than he would if he showed off his shiny head . <p> Guys losing their hair is not so different than girls packing on twenty pounds . Unless you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , you 'll have dropped a couple of notches on the looks scale . <p> Sometimes I wonder if guys marry their girlfriends when they start seeing too much hair in their sinks . <p> My hair went years ago . Given my genetic background that was hardly surprising . <p> Really the best thing is not to care . Confidence out-trumps everything . <p> Having said that I was in a Bangkok gogo bar and a guy walks in who has a white beard as long as Santa Clauses 's . Suffice to say the Thai chicks go wild over him , even if he is old enough to be their grandfather ! <p> I apply about two nickels worth to damp hair after a shower . My hair is almost shoulder length so adjust amount as necessary . You will have that slick sheen like Manolo in no time ! <p> I like the other posters idea with all the extra stuff , just do n't know if I 'd have the time or patience to find and mix all that . Also check out some nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gon na be your go-to style . <p> John Hamm used some Redken Grip Tight medium hold hair gel when he played Don Draper . I 've used it in conjunction with the AO and it looked fantastic although it felt gross to the hands .

Unless you 're in the minority of guys who look good with a shaved head , you 'll have dropped a couple of notches on the looks scale . <p> Sometimes I wonder if guys marry their girlfriends when they start seeing too much hair in their sinks . <p> Yeah but I doubt whether it really makes that much of a difference . As another poster said , if you 're confident , dress well , and have something going for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of notches on the looks scale , but is that really that important for girls ? I have heard from female models that they 're not really that into male models - they said that they think they 're boring . Looking dominant - i.e. pumped up , confident and imposing is probably more important than looking " handsome " . <p> Houston I actually sport a short fade as well . One of my friends is my stylist and she was the one who nudged me in the direction of that oil elixir i previously mentioned . It only takes 1 trip to the store ( whole foods usually has cute aisle wanderers searching for random oils too so it 's not a TOTAL waste of time , just game them too ) and maybe 2 minutes tops to mix it all up @ home . It was worth the shot for me , you never know ... <p> Scarface , does that AO control frizzy hair ? Do you put the AO then the pomade right after ? I 'm thinking of sleeping with a skull cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic for keeping frizz down and just making your hair look more lustrous and shiny . More pleasant on the hands . <p> Here is my routine : <p> 1 . Shower with sulfate free conditioner only ( no shampoo ! Sodium Lauryll Sulfate is nasty shit and dries your hair out badly ) . I like to get my hair wet first thing and massage conditioner in it right at the beginning of the shower and leave the conditioner in for the duration of the rest of the shower as a wash my body . You do n't have to buy some expensive shit , I use the 78 cent bottles of VO5 from Wal Mart and they are awesome . Just check the ingredients and avoid sulfates as they are the most damaging . Wash conditioner out at the end of shower . <p> 2 . Dry my hair after shower until it is damp but not " shiny " wet . Apply almond oil and " rake " into my hair using fingers . Concentrate on the tips rather than the roots as they need the moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in your hair while you get ready for the next 10 mins <p> 3 . Apply your choice of pomade/gel/styling paste . Gels feel gross after a few hours and do n't get along with the AO . Pomades are better and more pliable but also feel kind of gunky . I 've had the best luck with Redken Rewind #06 pliable styling paste . Smells great , feels light , allows me to constantly comb my fingers through my hair during the day and reshape my hair randomly . <p> This is the stuff : $17-20 and will last about a month for moderate-length hair . <p> And this is sort of the hairstyle I employ with it : <p> without the gun and cowboy getup , of course . If your hair is way short then maybe look into some bumble &amp; bumble pomades as they have some of the nicer stuff but quite pricey at something like $27 . As an overall product line I really like the redken , however . <p> Do n't sleep with a skullcap , you will damage the way your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise when your hair is constricted like that . At least that 's the old Afghan folk shit I was told in my youth . Back when I wore my hair down one thing I would do that may help you ( if that 's the style you want ) is to dry your hair till its damp and then wear a beanie around over your damp hair for like 30-45 mins . After you take it off your hair typically stays down for the rest of that day , even several hours later . 
@@96059005 @259005/ <p> Many people think the majority of women do n't like beards and yes , if you ask them and listen to their answers this might be true . So if you have a nice shaped face , that means a masculine chin and jawline , there is no need to bother yourself with the annoyance that comes with maintaining a well groomed beard . A shorter and easy to maintain beard could still be worth it , but that is more about your personal preference and how your facial hair is growing than anything else . <p> Let 's talk about the guys like me , who have a cute face with nice eyes on the upside , but a small chin and a rounded and soft jawline on the downside . Having a beard with more or less the shape you see in the picture above , length and details of the beard can vary in different ways , let 's your jawline and your chin look way more masculine and distinctive . It also let 's a double chin disappear . Let 's break the shape down : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - The hair on the downside/under the jaw and chin have to be longer - From the side view , your beard has to follow a straight downward line from your throat to your chin and the hair should get longer to the chin and shorter to your throat . <p> I personally keep the lines at my cheeks as straight downward as possible and not rounded like it is in the picture . I also keep my mustache in shorter length so my chin seems to be bigger in comparison and I want to show my lips and my mouth in general . Something else girls like about my face . I 'm not one of these proud beard lovers which declared their beard as one of their biggest hobbies . I have this beard , because it makes me look better , so I keep my beard as short as possible while still maintaining that shape to have the benefits and avoid the annoyances as far as possible . <p> So far it sounds pretty easy right ? Let 's get to the annoyances ... - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care , that there is no food in it after eating . Of course around your mouth but also in the hair under your chin if you eat something that drips or something with crumbs . - The time until your facial hair have been grown long enough to finally go to a barber and get a decent cut , can be hard . - Your facial hair grows faster than the hair on your head . That means you have to visit a barber more often if you want to keep them as well groomed as the hair on your head . - If you are in a society where a beard like this is n't common , you will hear stupid comments . Especially at the beginning . Most of them meant to be funny or are shittests ... whatever . In South East Asia for example , there where a lot of girls that asked me why I have this beard or told me straight in my face that I would look better without ( I 'm sure they would instantly change their mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fit in their social conditioning ) . Of course they forgot about it when I wiped those sentences away and fucked them afterwards , but it was quite a disadvantage when I cam chatted with them before meeting . On the other side I ca n't say what would have been without a beard . <p> Let 's get to my personal sticking point and since the leader of the board Roosh himself also has a full beard , I hope there are some guys that can give advice . <p> I tried to cut my beard by myself two days ago and of course it looks awful right now . I did this because I wanted to see if I can handle my beard when I 'm on a journey for several months . I can handle my beard if I travel for four up to six weeks but in my opinion it 's nearly impossible to find a decent barber in Asia for example . Is it possible to learn how to bring your beard in a good shape by yourself or how do you guys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a similar problem in Taiwan right now . I planned a 7-week vacation and got my bear trimmed by a US barber one week before I left the states . The problem was I knew my beard would start to look a little too unorganized in about 4-5 weeks . I 'm 5 weeks in now and have been trying to find a good barber in Taiwan but all of them want $30 just for a beard trim since they 're not use to that request . Unfortunately I seem to be stuck going to clubs with a longer and less-neat beard than I desire . <p> ( 04-16-2017 05:35 AM ) yankeetravels Wrote : I 'm actually having a similar problem in Taiwan right now .

No matter if will be in the Philippines or in Taiwan . <p> I 'm not sure if it 's just me in general but I would say too long/messy of a beard is a disadvantage in Taiwan at least . Do n't think it matters in the Philippines as much . I 'm saying this because I have gotten some cold rejections in the clubs this weekend without saying a word to some girls . Seriously this was like western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really get last year in Taipei so I 'm thinking I may have let my beard grow out too much here . I will be trimming it when I get back to the Philippines though so hopefully I have better luck in Boracay and Tokyo . <p> As for Cheetah 's other questions , I would say a barber has more tools and skills to make my beard look very neat after a fresh cut that I simply can not do myself . The problem is this takes a lot of maintenance if you want to maintain that and in the states I usually do n't need to go through that kind of effort for girls like I do here because I 'm not as motivated . So I guess this means I 'm too lazy and/or cheap . Not to mention I have too much pride to just shave off my beard completely which I think would 've been better for Taipei than going out with as thick of a beard as I currently have . <p> Bongo I plan to get a cut in Palawan or Boracay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two how that goes . <p> Just learn how to maintain your beard yourself . Personally I just use a hair trimmer with a #6 extension . The best length I 've found so far is using a #6 and letting it grow for another 2-3 weeks . My beard begins to look like pubic hairs if it grows too long . Having a long/messy beard and looking like a caveman wo n't help you get laid .

They look like they are made of some very light and comfortable material . I am guessing there might be one or more companies that have delivered clothes for the film , so somewhere it might be stated - but do not know where to look . <p> I saw some H&amp;M henleys that were nice but the $15 ones were shit . The $20 ones were slightly better . Du n no if JCP et al have better ones . For something so basic , they sure are n't cheap for decent quality . 
@@96059012 @259012/ <p> Best countries with a low percentage of men who lift/with little ' fitness ' culture ? <p> May sound like a bit of a daft question but with the fitness craze getting a lot of followers in many countries in the past few years and with more and more men going to the gym to lift , have any of you guys been to any specific country where the percentage of men being built/lifting is significantly less than most Western countries/US ? Could be a good idea to compile a data sheet of some sorts on this as it could allow to play niche lifter game . <p> Main reason I am asking is that in the past 3/4 years a LOT of guys have started lifting in my area and everyday I 'm seeing the gym getting busier and busier . <p> RE : Best countries with a low percentage of men who lift/with little ' fitness ' culture ? <p> It does n't seem very big in Colombia , there are good gyms there but it seems to be an upper class thing there , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacked guys unlike in most English speaking countries . <p> I 'm ready to help Scheer put Trudeau back in the cuckshed where he belongs . HSLD <p> RE : Best countries with a low percentage of men who lift/with little ' fitness ' culture ? <p> Well having been to Mexico so many times i 'll say Mexico . <p> Gym culture is not strong there . They see it as a waste of time that could be used to work instead . I 've never seen a dude be jacked up , maybe a guy here or there but not many . Contrast that with the U.S. where it seems like every guy is jacked up . <p> RE : Best countries with a low percentage of men who lift/with little ' fitness ' culture ? <p> France - just straight up skinny dudes over there .

And again , Russian women do n't place that much value on looks , so that may have something to do with it . <p> RE : Best countries with a low percentage of men who lift/with little ' fitness ' culture ? <p> Gym culture has become so ingrained in large parts of the Anglosphere for guys I feel you now have to lift a lot to just remain average , nevermind get ahead . If you 're in bars with middle class people who 're mostly under 30 it seems like at least 50% of guys look like they lift decently these days . More in certain parts of Australia or the UK . Go to a beach party location like Cancun or Ibiza and I 'd say closer to 80-90% of guys are in very good shape . <p> I 've gotten lots of muscle related attention in Asia ( China / Japan / Thailand ) but you can get similar attention from just being white in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In more westernised countries , Spain , Italy and France do n't really have the gym rat culture in my experience . The guys there play football , if they do any exercise . They see going to the gym 3+ days a week to lift weights by yourself as ' pointless ' , in my conversations with them . As a result if you 're in decent shape you 'll get lots of attention from curious local girls , as long as you 're in local bars where you 'll stand out . <p> RE : Best countries with a low percentage of men who lift/with little ' fitness ' culture ? <p> Latin America can be like this . Although , to be fair , there are also places in Latin America where people do n't lift but are in amazing shape ( Brazil especially comes to mind ) . There is actually a much bigger outdoor gym culture in LA , you will see a lot of jacked guys working out in parks or on beach public gyms . Either that , or you will just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really fit because of that .

Most of the rest have alright muscle mass ( though most are n't jacked by any means ) or are fat . If you go to a run of the mill pleb tier club it 'll seem like every single guy is muscular and tattooed while the girls are fatter then average too , it 's a total shit show yet this is what most pickup guys even subject themselves to .

My gym has all the bags you need to get a good boxing work out and also a boxing ring . <p> And it 's pretty widely known how big lifting culture is in Aussie land , but thanks to the guys for reaffirming this as I had only heard through online BB forums report . Seems like Zyzz and the ' aesthetics ' crew really did leave a lasting impact there . <p> Here in the UK from what I 've seen the middle/upper class guys are into fitness but not actual weight lifting but rather stuff like cycling/cross country/running . <p> In the area I live in , where there are a lot of ethnic guys , my gym is mostly filled with Pakistani guys , black guys and Eastern European guys and a lot of them are proper jacked .

The middle class rugby-training bodies do n't  exist either . What you will find is a decent number of guys who have the powerlifter build - strong , but a bit fat . This is more common in Poland . <p> RE : Best countries with a low percentage of men who lift/with little ' fitness ' culture ? <p> I 've spent four or five years living abroad , and of the places I 've lived not one has had as many big guys ( combination of height and size ) as I regularly see walking around in the States . Not to say these places did n't have " fitness cultures " , just that fitness to a Latin American and fitness to a American might mean different things . A quick breakdown of the places I 've spent the most time : <p> -China : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . I attribute it to a combination of lack of interest in lifting and shitty eating habits ( too many carbs , not enough protein ) . I felt like a giant amongst men over there , and got tons of interest there for my size - above and beyond my smaller white friends - but without language ability it was very hard to close . <p> -Colombia : You 'll see the occasional super cut/ripped guy walking around Medellin , but they 're almost always lower class , doing their workouts in the outdoor prison-style gyms ( which I love , by the way , although the sexy girls are always in the nice gyms ) . Once you move into the clubs and richer neighborhoods the number goes down drastically , and you hardly ever see a bodybuilder looking type anywhere . Bogota has even less of an emphasis on gym culture in my experience . Guys are also generally pretty short . <p> -Brazil : Surprisingly I did n't see as many big guys here as I was expecting , although granted I lived in Sao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a lot of very in shape guys , but not that much of an emphasis on building big muscles like there is in the States . Like someone said earlier , think soccer player types . Just different priorities . <p> West Africa : Guys here are just naturally built , like nowhere else I 've ever been . I 'd regularly see dudes giving haircuts out of shacks with upper bodies as big as mine or bigger , with no gym around for miles . Do n't go to Nigeria/Ghana/Togo/etc expecting to impress people with your muscles . East Africa is another story however . <p> My experience in Eastern Europe was that lifting is less common overall than in Anglo countries . The tanned , relatively built and low bf% ' aesthetics ' style guys you 'll see in working class areas of the UK or across Oz do n't really exist . The middle class rugby-training bodies do n't  exist either . What you will find is a decent number of guys who have the powerlifter build - strong , but a bit fat . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've noticed with well-off girls is Oz is that although they mainly date within their own group ( as most people in any income bracket do ) when they do fuck " down " , it 's almost always with a jacked tattooed dude . Their male counterparts usually have alright mass from football/rowing in private school but virtually none are truly big . Also I 've noticed the 8+ local born Asian girls almost exclusively date jacked Asian guys , of which there 's a lot of .

@@96059024 @259024/ <p> The reason I did n't vote for completely gay is because there could be times that riding on the back of a motorcycle could be absolutely necessary . <p> Imagine you 're stuck in the desert or woods and the only person to get you out is on a motorcycle . Would you rather starve ? Or if someone is chasing you and your buddy pulls up on a bike . You see my logic . <p> We have to separate motorcycle and scooters . In the states , I 've seen another man on a man 's sportsbike or cruiser once . In Mexico , it 's more common seeing two dudes on a scooter than a dude and a lizard . I probably seen 10 sportsbikes and 1000 scooters in GDL . Maybe 10 riders with helmets .

I do n't  like it as I have been riding since I was 5 and find it hard to give up control to another . <p> Once I sat backwards on the back of a sportbike to film a friend try and break the speed record on a street luge . One of the scariest things I have ever done . He hit 131km/hr ( not the record , but close ) . <p> I concur with Laner .

Or you can say showering naked in the presence of a next man is gay . You can say that spit roasting a lizard with your buddy is gay etc . <p> It could be cool or gay but the bottom line is when you want to get someplace fast and hopping on the back of the bike is the only way to get there you do what you have to .

I saw this post today and thought it was worth sharing . <p> What I got the most out of this that really challenges the way I think is the possibility of women having a stronger moral compass than men and being able to and being able to warn and dissuade other tribe members when we start to lose sight of right vs wrong . What are your thoughts ? <p> The " cremation of care " ceremony is an elite ceremony held at the Bohemian Grove , just North of San Francisco , where ruling members of government and industry congregate to watch this ceremony , where the effigy of a child is set a blaze ( on fire ) and placed onto a man made lake . This ceremony recreates the original and ancient cremation of care ceremony where live children were once used , and sacrificed in public centers , to the bull God Molech , the dark deity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today this cult still operates inside our society , hidden in plain sight . For example the wedding ring , the ear ring etc are " gang signs " of this Cult , the symbols the cult members wear as a vow to EL or Saturn , the " rings " of the planet . Even our word " vowel " , literally means " a vow to el " . How our vowels are interchangeable for sounds in our words is how our society still makes a vow to EL ( vowel ) , the letter E and the sound E meaning EL . How many teachers know that ? The cremation of care ceremony is meant to signify what 's needed to destroy the part of the mind , where care is housed , so immorality can blanket the earth without resistance . <p> There are many rituals today , which mimic the cremation of care , and they are by themselves representative of the burning or destruction of the part of the mind ( or consciousness ) that 's historically known as " female " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral , the weak , the ethical , the children etc . This ancient cult understood the extreme power of this female part of humanity and its ' ability to instantly know moral from immoral and ethical from unethical . This programmed protective female force , is in all living things , but is strongest in the female . The female , is also strong enough to cast white magic over males , to make males fight for what 's right and to teach the males of the tribe when danger is near and when fighting is necessary , if evil is present and an immediate threat . This ancient cult ( The Cult of Saturn , with its ' origins out of ancient Babylon , Sumeria and Egypt ) has intentions for the earth that were and are unethical , immoral , unjust and illegal . A satanic agenda ( Satan , just another word for Saturn ) , that 's self serving , shallow , self centered and psychopathic . The best thinkers of this cult understood that the female power had to be destroyed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda could roll forward without resistance . They tried killing women outright like in the Spanish Inquisitions and witch hunts etc , always manufacturing lies to execute their dark agenda , but that just made the female force fight back even stronger at times . The cremation of care is their most effective weapon against the female , the gradual draining of the actual caring force of the female , without anyone recognizing that it 's happening . The literal destruction of a person 's ability to care about anything ...... period . <p> The way this works is simple . Destroy the caring part of the mind without the female knowing it 's happening , by using rituals that force a female to sit and watch horrific events , while making the female view the horror and then shut down their cosmic protective intelligence , allowing the horror to occur without her interference . This is called the activation/inhibition cycle , a dark magic spell cast against the female . Activate the female 's innate intelligence regarding what 's moral and ethical but inhibit her from taking action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the female shut the entire process down , with invisible pressures the female ca n't see or recognize . Do it so many times that anytime a female wants to speak or take action on morality or ethics , she just shuts that impulse down because that " shut down " pathway is already a paved and well lubricated road in the mind . <p> Here 's two examples and there are thousands . Circumcision and vaccination . The female , the protector , the strongest moral force of the two genders , the warrior energy for morality in our Universe , is conditioned through hidden cues to become more male , to seek shallow acceptance from the tribe , for doing what everyone else is doing . The female is cosmically charged by the creator to be the judge of what 's truly moral and immoral ....... and circumcising an infant is extremely immoral and evil but that 's why this cult invented circumcision , vaccination , cigarette campaigns directed toward females and nearly 1000 other situations where a female is pressured to sit through what 's immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit through one evil and immoral incident , doing it again becomes easier and easier . In psychology , that 's called the law of facilitation . <p> Women are n't even really permitted today to speak their mind at all ( other than about fashion or make up or on other superficial matters ) , and that 's another cremation of care ritual because if the female is forced to sit and watch immorality , under the public pressure not to act because people wo n't like her as much , it literally cremates her care and cremates the caring female force that has been sent here to protect the children of earth and the planet itself . When an evil instrument of this cult grabs a child and wants to cut them or inject poisons into them , a woman is programmed genetically to fight to the death , to make sure that does n't happen and is also programmed to teach the strong males that they should also fight to the death but today ( because of the cremation or care agenda ) the female sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child for sacrifice , which in turn cremates the care that 's inherent in the child as well . So the sinister cycle plows forward . The protector sits , conditioned to beg for dog treats of positive re-enforcement from the dark rulers of our society , as opposed to protecting the child , as she is solely charged to do . The female watches the child mutilated and poisoned , in order to get along with the tribe . As the female sits , the world burns around her , the cremation of all care . <p> If the female can reconnect with her ferocious caring spirit , and start to teach the strong males the difference between moral and immoral behavior , this nightmare will come to an end and the Cult of Saturn will be no more . Until then the strongest force in the entire Universe , sits on the sidelines , watching evil destroy the children and mother earth , while being afraid to speak up or take action because the cult has gutted her like a fish , making the most ferocious of warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head down , hoping someone else will solve the problems , not remembering she is the one who carries the strength of the cosmos inside of her . Female warriors its time to do what 's right , as opposed to what 's easy .

@@96059027 @259027/ <p> I was skimming through some of the more active old threads and ran across this one . I did n't want to resurrect the old thread , but there is so much misinformation there , I felt compelled to post . As guys who go out chasing tail , we should be armed with some knowledge of the risks . Credit to oldnemesis in that old thread - he gave some accurate facts . <p> Here are a whole bunch of herpes facts : - HPV is not herpes . Herpes is HSV - herpes simplex virus <p> - Unlike HPV , HSV is for life . There is no cure and no vaccine ( yet ; and maybe never - it 's a whole lot more profitable to keep people on antivirals than it is to sell a lot of one-time vaccines ) <p> - HSV is part of the human herpes virus ( HHV ) family <p> - But do n't be fooled by people who tell you that chickenpox is ' herpes ' , and thus everyone has herpes . Chickenpox is caused by VZV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has VZV ( like HSV , it never goes away , and if it reactivates , it 's called shingles ) . When people say ' herpes ' , they are referring to herpes simplex . <p> - Cold sores ( oral herpes ) are usually caused by HSV1 ( most infected persons got it when they were little kids , from parents or other relatives kissing them ) , but oral HSV2 infection can happen . <p> - It used to be that genital herpes was almost always caused by HSV2 . This is not the case anymore . Lots of new genital herpes cases are caused by HSV1 ( typically , the person gets it from receptive oral sex ) . <p> - Condoms are no guarantee against herpes because it is a skin to skin infection . As someone pointed out in the old thread , men and women shaving their genital area is a bad idea because it creates more skin to skin friction . Evolution put hair there for a reason . <p> - The best data on condom effectiveness against HSV transmission indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're reading that correctly - it reduces the risk of transmission by a mere 30% . Compare that to fluid-borne STDs , where condoms reduce risk by &gt;99% . <p> - Asymptomatic viral shedding is not a mere guess , as was alleged in that old thread . We know it happens because we can pick up virus off intact ( non-outbreak ) skin . There are lots of shedding studies out there . <p> - We know how prevalent herpes is b/c there are studies that blood test for HSV antibodies . <p> - Here 's the data from a study published in JAMA in 2006 ( I 'll post the link if anyone wants to see it ) . This is US data : <p> - Overall HSV2 infection rate is 17% ( this is for people aged 14-49 , the rate goes up for each older age bracket , so for 40-49 , it 's 26% ) . <p> - For males , it is 11% ( again , males aged 14-49 ) . <p> - For females , it is 23% . And remember this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of HSV1 that is genital . So the overall rate of genital herpes ( genital HSV1 + genital HSV2 ) amongst women is higher than 23% . <p> - Most of the people with genital herpes are unaware they have it . I 've seen different estimates for this , but it 's usually 80-90% . So for all the people who have genital herpes , only 10-20% know they have it . <p> - The biggest behavioral risk factor for genital herpes is . . . number of sex partners . So guess which guys are at the highest risk ? You got it - players - natural or self-made . Sucks , but it is what it is . Now that you know , you can take steps to protect yourself . <p> - A couple of posters in the old thread mentioned that the women they knew with genital herpes were pretty attractive . This does n't surprise me in the least . The hottest chicks go for the most alpha guys . And the alpha guys ( race-adjusted ) , should be most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . <p> - OK , on to HSV1 : <p> - Overall HSV1 infection rate ( people aged 14-49 ) : 58% <p> - Males : 56% . Females : 60% . <p> - Whites : 50% . Blacks : 68% . <p> - Back to viral shedding . So this happens in two ways " one is the classic outbreak . Lots of virus there . So sex is a bad idea if you or your partner has an outbreak . Problem for the pussy sleuths is that most outbreaks are not of the medical textbook horrorshow variety . And if it was a really , really bad outbreak , she would n't be having sex with you anyway because her vag would be in too much pain . The other way shedding happens is asymptomatically " i.e. , virus is being shed through unbroken skin . So there 's no way you 're going to detect this unless you have a lab in your home . And the infection can be spread via this asymptomatic viral shedding . <p> - It 's not all bad news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have it is because they do n't get outbreaks or only get very minor outbreaks that are easily mistaken for other things , like ingrowns or razor burns or cuts . And while infection can occur during asymptomatic shedding , infected persons are not always shedding . High levels of asymptomatic shedding happen during a small percentage of days . And the odds of getting herpes even from an infected partner are fairly low on a per sex act basis ( I 'd have to look this up to recall accurate figures ) " the problem is you never know when your number will come up . <p> - Someone made a point in the old thread about herpes being overhyped because if it was so widespread , many more women would be having c-section deliveries . The baby typically only gets infected if the mother is having an internal outbreak that the baby would come in contact with during delivery . So there is no inconsistency between the HSV prevalence data and the relatively low number of c-sections . And by the way , if they know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antivirals during the last several weeks of pregnancy . It 's really no big deal , which is why there are so few cases of neonatal herpes . <p> - Testing : Most clinics and physicians wo n't test you for herpes unless you show up with symptoms OR you specifically ask to get tested for it . Even saying test me for everything doc ! ' will NOT get you tested for HSV . Yeah , the system is that fucked up . If you want to get tested for it ( and are not having any symptoms ) , ask for HSV type-specific IgG antibody testing ( the older IgM test is nearly worthless ) . And make sure you see HSV1 and HSV2 listed on your lab results . If those buggers are n't listed in the lab report , you did n't get tested for it . Note - this is for the US . Outside the US , you may find it even harder to test for HSV . <p> - This is why when a girl tells me she is ' clean ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least the precautions I take . Even if she did get tested for STDs recently ( unlikely ) , the odds that she knew enough to get tested for HSV are close to zero . <p> - Precautions . You can read the usual medical info on this ( wear a condom , do n't have sex if you or your partner is having an outbreak , etc . ) . Here 's what I do : I trim , but never shave . I always always always wear a condom . I liberally apply lube to the areas that wo n't be covered by the condom " base of penis , pubes , balls , inner thighs . The idea is to reduce friction . When taking her underwear off , I 'll try to get a whiff of the vag . If it stinks even a little , I wo n't give oral ( of course , smell does n't mean herpes , but it might mean something is happening down there , and I do n't want to take any chances , whether it 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection ) . I try to visually inspect the vag before oral or penetration . If I see sores , I 'll get a blowjob and finish that way . And I always shower after sex . Of course , none of this is any guarantee , but there are no guarantees ( short of total abstinence including no kissing or oral sex ) and all you can do is try to reduce risk in ways that do n't take all the joy out of sex for you . <p> ON a positive note , I have a doctor in my family who loves my player lifestyle . He gives me regular checkups every 3 months w/o fail and a diet to make my immune system as strong as it can ever be . Also , from travelling the world , I have had vaccinations for diseases I can not even pronounce . <p> I have banged 100 's of women in the last 10 years . Thankfully , I am still strong as an ox , and 100% disease free . So , it can be prevented , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never completely shave to the point of being smoother than a babies ass around the base of my penis .

Unless you have specifically requested HSV testing ( and seen HSV listed in your lab report ) , the odds that you have been tested for it are extremely low . I have been told by many women over the years that they are 100% clean . Not a single one of them has ever been HSV tested . <p> ( 02-27-2011 11:22 AM ) MiXX Wrote : So , it can be prevented , even as a full-time player . <p> I do n't think there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstinence .

Great post , it wakes me up to never be careless about casual sex . <p> No , I " m not an MD . But I have read up a lot on this stuff when I started working on my game . Even your typical general practitioners and internists are pretty clueless about herpes ( not an indictment of the profession , just a reality when a GP has to be familiar with a wide range of medical issues , he/she simply does n't have the bandwidth to drill deeply on one condition ) and most would n't be familiar with all the facts I listed above . Some of them still order IgM tests for their patients , which is ridiculous considering how long the far superior IgG tests have been commercially available . <p> And thanks for not taking my prior comment defensively . That highlights one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can take a comment objectively , while a woman would perceive the same comment as an attack . When I told women the same thing ( i.e. , that they most likely have never tested for HSV ) , most insisted that they were tested ( not that they ever looked at the lab reports themselves , they just heard the doc say ' you 're all clear ' ) and lashed out at me . <p> Good information man , I must admitt it 's very scary though specially because it can be passed without even having sex . I always shave completely , I think it looks better . But after reading I guess trimming would be a better idea . <p> ( 02-27-2011 04:56 PM ) speakeasy Wrote : They should invent a herpes condom .

I do n't think I know any women who do n't have a psychologist . And I 'm sure most single women over 25 are on some kind of psychoactive medication . <p> As for the valtrex bottle , the reality is that a woman who knows she has herpes and is on antivirals poses a lower risk to you than a woman who does n't know she has it ( and therefore takes no precautions ) . In fact , given the high prevalence of herpes , you could make the argument that a woman on valtrex poses a lower risk than a woman of unknown status . <p> while the reduction from rubbers is n't the greatest .. it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In couples that are discordant ( one has genital herpes , other does not ) .... the rate of transmission after Fn for one year without rubbers ( so you could guess 3X/week X 52 = 150 or around there ) is ... <p> 5 % ( 1/20 ) ( from around 150 acts of RUBBERLESS sex ) <p> ... meaning the chance per act is very very low .... like hitting the jackpot <p> which is why Sir Mixx can put up Guiness book of world record type figures and likely correct on being free of anything . and if there are no outbreaks ... there really is no point in bloodwork. for what ? <p> mind you , having said all that and knowing the low risk , getting hsv-2 scares the shit out of me. try bringing that up if you 're lucky enough to meet someone you 'd like more that a ONS with&gt; <p> Yeah , I think I said it 's possible , but you 're right , it 's rare .

But yes , the per act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive caveat here is this risk figure is only relevant to couples that are already together and now we 're measuring the risk of transmission over the next year . <p> IMHO , that is very different for the risk of a new couple , having sex for the first time or the first handful of times . I believe the transmission risk is highly nonlinear . Unfortunately there is n't good data on this , but there is reason to believe that transmission risk is nonlinear . I could get into this if anyone is interested . But the bottom line is that I suspect the per act risk for a ONS ( or short fling ) with a HSV+ partner is low , but considerably higher than the very low per act risk for existing discordant couples ( keep in mind that a multiple of a very small number ( &lt;&lt;1 ) , is still a very small number ) .

You probably also got tested for syphilis ; that 's the standard 4 that get tested for by most clinics . <p> First , you have to find a clinic that will antibody test for HSV ( not all will , some will only test if you have symptoms ) . You could also ask to get tested for hepatitis , but that 's very low risk for straight guys who are n't using IV drugs . <p> I 'd say one must test for HIV and syphilis . Those are infections which may go without obvious symptoms for a while , wasting the time to cure it completely ( syphilis ) or taking the suppressant medicine ( HIV ) . They 're also both typically require blood sample . <p> As for gonorrhea and chlamydias , if you have no symptoms like discharge from your dick , urinating pain/discomfort and so on , it is very unlikely you have one . Those are done by taking a sample from inside the urethra . <p> HSV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can really do if the test is positive . There is no cure or suppressant therapy , only symptomatic ( acyclovir-based ) , and for this one you typically do n't need tests . <p> Hep B test should be useless for any responsible mofo - there is a fucking Hep A/B vaccine ! If you have n't got vaccinated yet , do n't be a moron and do it now . The world has enough crappy ( and even deadly ) stuff which you can not get vaccinated against , so give your liver a favor and get a shot . <p> And when you go vaccinated , get your TDap boost if it is time ( ask your doctor first ) . Tetanus is very ugly shit , which is much , much worse than HIV ( mortality rate around the world is still around 50% ) , and it is not that difficult to get it . <p> Actually I went through a few of your posts in other threads and am now pretty sure you are indeed a woman .

@@96059035 @259035/ <p> This idea has been thrown around for quite some time . If you Google it you 'll be presented with inspirational speeches preaching the mantra and even step by step guides on how to go about doing it . The first person I heard to really drive this idea was Joe Rogan on his podcast . It 's something he will bring up from time to time applying it to both men and women . Usually he 'll talk about shitty friends who always let you down , tell you this is the last time they fuck you over only to do it again . And crazy women who you always end up arguing with but also have incredible sex with . <p> Most recently I 've heard Mike from Danger and Play talk about this on his podcast . He discusses situations in his life where he realized he was in a toxic relationship so he cut that person off . His examples are on the extreme of this , he cut off communication to his close family , his Mother and two Brothers . Which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not possess . Personally for me I could not cut my Brothers or parents out of my life no matter the indiscretion . <p> However , I think this is a great frame of mind to approach life with and will lead to success more often than not . I think we 've all been in those situations when we feel as though we 're carrying the weight of others , and it feels good for the most part for me at least to be the person people rely on . The problem occurs when people take advantage of this knowing that your dependable , that you 'll get it done , that they can always rely on you . That 's when this idea of cutting these people out of your life can be put to use . <p> My problem with this idea is that it works great for creatures dictated by logic but that is not our species . I know that the women I 've had the worst relationships with I 've also had the best sex with . My last relationship for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued too much , I found her boring , she found me strange , but she was one of the best fucks I 've ever had . My relationships with male friends is where I find it hardest to implement this idea as the most fun men I 've ever met are usually complete fuck ups . I 've had more laughs with what most people on this forum would consider losers ' then I 've ever had with friends I 've looked up to . <p> That 's what I believe is the catch 22 with this idea , great in practice but in reality hard to implement and you might end up losing something . I think of these bad relationships with women and men to be like fast food and drugs . It 's all well and good to say cut that shit out of your life it has no benefits , its detrimental to your health , but fuck me if staying up for two days doing cocaine and MDMA with your unemployed waster friends is n't fun . <p> I 've given this a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of value in this idea . My approach to the shit heads in my life is gon na be the same as my approach to fast food , drugs and alcohol which is not to cut it off it off completely , but to limit my exposure . What do the rest of you think ? Can you achieve your full potential while occasionally associating with the dregs of society or are the two incompatible ? <p> " You see a mouse trap , I see free cheese and a fucking challenge " Scroobius Pip <p> Do n't just cut the losers , cut the in-between too . Associate with winners , people better than you at something in particular . Realize many people will be winners in only some aspects of life . Some people will be winners in some aspects of life and losers in others . Use discretion in these cases - learn what you need to learn from these people and ignore what you need to ignore . <p> Anyway , it is not about cutting off losers out of your life , it is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have one or two friends who do n't have shit going on in their lives , completely losers in a success point of view , but when we are together , it is all super fun . They make me laugh , I value a lot my emotional state , so they bring value to my life in that sense , that means I wo n't cut them off . However , I do n't hang out with these people everyday , neither I want to see them everyday . <p> I have no problems cutting off toxic , negative people , people who are always looking to criticize something about me , I do n't care if they have 10 million in the bank , you are toxic to my life in any way , you are a loser to me , i cut you off . Watch out for emotional draining people , sometimes they tend to be fun to be around too but if they are really emotional draining people , cut them off . <p> If I feel the same about a family member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them go . I do n't have that in my family right now because they know I do n't need them in any way , I am in a position of strength , why would they be toxic to me ? But if they were , I would cut them off . <p> To be honest as a redpill man you should expect this is gon na be a lonely road . Your happiness should radiate from the inside and both men or women are simply the cherry on the cake . At one point you wont have to think about what people you need to cut , because you are making so good use of your time and energy that the people who do n't contribute to it are automatically filtered out . <p> You cut people out when 1 ) they contribute nothing to your life while wasting your time 2 ) they lower the quality of your life . A guy who is fun to hang out with but keep cockblocking you is out by the window . A guy who does n't  do you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also out . In your case your friends contribute to your mood , there 's no need to cut them out . If you cut out all losers , you will also cut out a lot of potential wings . Lots of players are losers on papers but alpha when it comes to pussy . <p> I take a somewhat different approach in that I wo n't cut people out if they are just merely losers or do n't have their shit together at the moment . I 'm usually in another country anyways so it does n't hurt to keep in touch via the internet . People in different places update me on things that are going on . Some people are just down and out and have n't quite figured things out yet . <p> I 'm forgiving because i 've been at a low point in the past and i 'm very thankful for the people that did n't just abandon or try to kick me while i 'm down . Being loyal to a friend or having a friend show this type of loyalty is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more to life in my opinion than playing people as chess pieces like a sociopath would to gain money and status . I like some authenticity in my social circle . <p> If someone is outright toxic or is obviously harming you then by all means crush them and cut them out . <p> I look at it in a similar way to a couple of others in this thread . I wo n't cut somebody off for being a " loser " in the traditional sense , i.e a bum , does n't have a job currently , etc , as long as they 're a good person . I do n't see how anyone who 's been there themselves could . What I have cut off in the past , and will cut off in the future , are fake friends , overly negative ones , people that have let me down , used me and stole from me , and so on . <p> I have to agree with this strongly . Many people throw around the saying ' you are the 5 people closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent . <p> It can be a kind of self-sustaining system : losers attract loser friends , and when they try and move up , their friends lack the same impetus and hold them back . Your friends are n't going to change - you have to displace them with new acquaintances and friends . Having ambitions to improve , and being surrounded by lifeless , ' chilling-out ' type friends , is like wading in molasses . <p> The same applies to family , especially since you do n't choose them . If your family saps your strength , holds you back , levies backward and unhelpful beliefs , advice , or ways of living upon you , then you have a responsibility to yourself - you must cut them off . You only get one life , and you should n't allow feelings such as ' easiness ' , ' familiarity ' , or ideas of duty to limiting-minded family members to damage your future . <p> There was a guy i knew from university and he was a decent guy but a loser at life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stuck his dick in . Refused to learn the pullout method and did n't wear a condom . <p> He went on a date with a skinny 4.5 and knocked her up the first night he met her . Then she 's been staying with him ever since ... 12 years later . He marries her and they have another kid . Keep in mind he still lives at home with his parents ... He " breaks up " with his wife and starts dating a fat 17yr old girl . she has one glass eye and is just an overall horrible person . Back in 2009 , His dad , his best friend and myself stage an intervention to get him to dump this toxic girl but he is n't ready yo leave her ... A few weeks later he finally mans up and breaks up with her . She says she 's gon na commit suicide so he calls 911 . They hold her for observation and find out she 's pregnant . If you do a little bit of math you 'll realize that day we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she got knocked up .... <p> He is cursed . <p> I do n't roll with him or chill with him anymore simply because he 's always asking to borrow money from me . Then it 's like chasing a fugitive to get the money back from him and it 's never the whole amount that was originally loaned out . <p> My roommates last year and people I spent the most time with by extension were total pieces of shit . I did n't notice for about 9 months , but they were dragging me down more than I even knew . When I started using some of the same phrases they were using I knew something had to change . Their stupid shit was rubbing off on me . <p> You have to surround yourself with talent , so that their good attributes can rub off on you . I have a buddy now who is a legitimate genius and just hanging around him increases my vocabulary and knowledge . I have another buddy who is obsessed with fitness , and by extension that is rubbing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around just to fuck , and while the sex is great it 's a huge time waste overall . I gotten to the point where I do n't want anything to do with girls or anyone who are n't going to bring me up . It 's not worth it . <p> Anyway , it is not about cutting off losers out of your life , it is about cutting people who do n't bring value to your life . I have one or two friends who do n't have shit going on in their lives , completely losers in a success point of view , but when we are together , it is all super fun .

Sometimes you ca n't be too quick to judge others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are all fighting our own respective battles in life . <p> None of us our perfect and we 've all handled situations poorly at one point in our lives . <p> Now if there is somebody with no interest whatsoever in turning the corner while constantly negging you out of passive aggression ? Then that means good riddance . The appropriate type of farewell will vary depending on the individual whether it 's a slow fadeaway or GTFO . <p> Chances are at one point in your life you were exactly like the people you want to cut off . That 's what made you bond in the first place . <p> The difficultly occurs when you start on a path to change and they stay stuck in their ways . Fast forward 5 or 10 years and you 're an entirely different person , while they are the same . <p> There is also a dynamic between friends and family where they do n't want you to rise above their level . They try to keep you down and influence your actions with their words . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> You think about relocating and switching jobs and your girlfriend tells you : " But my family is here ... " You then give up a chance to make more money to please her . Month 's later you 'll probably be broken up anyway . <p> Your boss tells you " Just keep working hard and you will be rewarded . " 6 months go by and your pay has not increased . <p> " I was at my friends and her grandkids are so cute ! " Your mom tells you because she wants you to settle down and get married . <p> I can go on and on . <p> While the examples above are not necessarily from ' losers ' they have a similar effect . They affect your decision making process , you feel guilty and you stop going after what you want . <p> It takes a strong man to go against all these influences , but it 's possible . I rarely tell anyone my true goals anymore . I just keep them inside . It 's not like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself . <p> I say if you have a strong mind and are firm in your resolve , you do n't have to cut people out of your life . If they 're truly toxic and blatantly sabotaging your efforts sure . Otherwise , keep that vision in your mind , push on , and fuck everybody else . They 're criticism will turn to praise once you succeed . <p> This is an interesting topic to me . I kind of went overboard and wound up cutting all my friends out of my life . I think there 's a balance betwee cutting truly toxic people out of your life vs taking some people for what they are . I always kind of wished I had one of those friends who have your back no matter what would drive out to pick you up at 4am without a quesiton asked , etc . I felt like I had drinking buddies and poker friends but no true friendships . My friends were all kind of selfish in my mind as well , I felt like I put a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really kind of pride myself on being a loyal always there friend and never really felt that returned . I think I 've given this exaple before but after a DUI called a good buddy of mine to help me pick my car up from impound and he was busy playing call of duty and could n't come get me . This after I 've driven him to get his car from teh shop and done him all types of favors in the past . It was at that point I was like fuckit , anyone who 's not totally down for me is just getting cut out . I went from having a phonebook with dozens of friends to now basically my business partner and a buddy who is more of a phone friend than anything . <p> One of my friends had a lot of trouble with the same thing putting more effort into friendshisp than others and getting screwed over by friends he loaned money to . He has recently reconnected with some of these friends and he said his attitude is this , if you cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody left so he basically takes people for what they are . Me and him are friends and would probably go out on a limb for each other or loan each other money but some of these other guys he sayd they 're cool , they are fun to grab a beer with but I know I ca n't count on them for anything important and I know know I ca n't loan them money so I 'll be friends with them to an extent . <p> One of the most valuable , if not the most valuable thing in life I 've learned is the value of having good people in your life . And getting rid of the losers , leaches , phonies and general " born with a permanent black cloud over them " types helps you understand and appreciate good people even more . <p> I 'm blessed to have a core of great friends , confidants and mentors . Actually , one of them died this past Tuesday and I 'm still in a complete state of shock , as his death was sudden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my grief is reflecting on the wisdom he taught me . That 's a tribute to him . <p> I 've cut out family , aquaintances and pseudo-friends with impunity . It 's easy for me . Why ? I ask myself a very basic question : " Does this person add value to my life ? " <p> If the answer is " no " , then they 're gone . And by " value " , I 'm not talking in terms of financial worth , but in terms of everyday life events that come up . And I 'm sure that my core group of friends would answer my question above about me in the affirmative ; that 's why we 've been there for each other for decades in many cases . <p> Identify who the assholes are and avoid them ; you will live a much better and rewarding life .

Mice bother me as well so I would probably opt for roaches as the least troublesome . In Florida they are called " palm beetles " and can get huge ... they are everywhere I ever went in the south ( luckily just outside ) but they would not make me spaz out like rats or bedbugs . <p> Roaches are everywhere here .

Thankfully I 've dealt with very few bedbugs over the years . I inspect my mattress every week , and on the few occasions I 've found ' em , I sprayed the mattress casing in rubbing alcohol , and washed my sheets and blankets .

I 'm sure we all remember the famous Seinfeld episode where Georges Fiance becomes friends with Elaine and Jerry and them . Now granted that 's a bit different in that its your gf or in his case fiance joining the group but even in general do you invite different groups of friends to the same parties , events or activities ? <p> I'ts always made me a bit uneasy , not really sure why I guess maybe I act a little different with different people and it kinds throws you off when you have them together , also its never fun if two groups do n't get along and you wind up in the middle or having to mediate . <p> Just curious overall if you guys like bringing together different groups or if it 's something you avoid ? <p> For communal , mainstream events such as a barbie I 'll invite anyone and everyone . <p> I would feel awkward discussing certain things that I discuss with one set of friends with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , if we 're going to get stoned and talk red pill , that 's one group only . <p> They who would give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety- Benjamin Franklin , as if you did n't know ... <p> Mixing friend groups , if you 're not a bore , is difficult . My friend groups do n't mix well at all . Same reason why you do n't bring your girl around your friends . She has her space with you and your friends have theirs with you as well . <p> One of the very important qualities of most of my friends is that they are respectful and pretty easy going . Because of this , I rarely get uneasy mixing my friend groups . In fact , I 've had big parties where very diverse friend groups have mixed without any real issues . <p> I like it this way , I do n't want to have to babysit/coddle my different friend groups or act as a mediator/translator . <p> Now women ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , but otherwise it 's not a big deal . <p> For me , I do n't really care if my friends get along with each other or not and I have no problem integrating them in whatever I do or inviting them when they come out .

Ther is some value in being that common element with two parties not knowing each other .

Obviously that is more in terms of business than friendship but those two worlds do collide business and friendship sometimes . <p> I could n't find the clip online , but in one of Jim Gaffigan 's stand up specials he had a bit about mixing group of friends .

' " <p> Otherwise , the few times I 've mixed different friend groups it has gone over successfully . <p> I 've always had friends from all walks of life , many of them complete opposites . Mixing some of the crowds I roll with would be a nightmare - in fact , I 've had it blow up in my face plenty of times in the past . <p> I think it 's a solid character trait to be able to hang with drastically different people who are n't anything like you . It fosters personal growth , forces you to consider new paradigms , and leads to some really interesting experiences . <p> But be careful about forcing other people to do the same . We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your views on others . <p> That said , you can mix groups of very different people if you select people consciously and only invite those who know how to play well with others and have enough tact to be aware of what to say in front of whom . 49876 @qwx909876

But that 's true for just about any business . <p> I 'm just getting out of an Army aviation unit near N++rnberg Germany , I 'm an enlisted medic so it was n't that great for me , but the pilots have a great life . Also , if you already have a bachelors degree you 'll be able to go in as an officer and have a better shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft . Warrent officers usually fly Apaches , which while a lot more badass , do n't give you as many job opportunities for when you get out . <p> The major problem is ( at least in the Australian military ) is that the aviation regiments are in the middle of fucking nowhere . Then you go abroad ....... and guess what ? You are station in the middle of fucking nowhere . <p> The reason why I did n't go for it when I joined the military is that you have to become an officer first , before they even let you look at a multi-million dollar piece of machinery . That 's 2 years of intense yes sir no sir training before you even start to learn about your job role . <p> As the guys above said , the flying as a Warrant Officer in the Army is a good deal , better pay than enlisted , not as high as the O 's , but at least as a Warrant you will be flying your entire career . Eventually the officers are going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the best places to be stationed ...

Reasonably competitive , but the Coast Guard takes a lot of their pilots from other services . <p> As for the " constantly on the move , " you 'll have your tours that can be around 4 years a pop , and deployments depending on the service you chose . Will certainly result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperwork .... never thought I 'd have so much to do . Especially if you go the officer route . Also the constant " do n't rape " trainings and " diversity is good because diversity is good " lectures are about as awesome as AIDS . <p> As for your degree .... You just need one to be an officer , English is fine , they do n't care what it 's in . <p> Talking to people who have gotten out , there are a few decent paying jobs , usually for Oil and Gas .... taking people to and from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico , or Medevac/air ambulance jobs .... my understanding is that pay will start around $55k and should ramp up from there ( some jobs considerably so ) , depending on the helicopter you fly and the mission you 'd be doing ( the big boys that are certified for instrument flying getting more than the smaller , **25;376;TOOLONG helos ) .

Warrant officers fly more than officers who have command duties which increase with time and service . Your training will be in Alabama for almost two years i think . The Army has the most helicopters , more than any other branch . They have a pretty good life with the military because their work hours are limited even in combat zones . I 'm sure it is sure stressful while they are out there . Us infantry dudes definitely did n't have the conditions they had . I suggest talking to a national guard recruiter and finding a unit in a state with multiple aviation slots open .

Marine Corps aviators go through Navy flight school . All Naval Aviators get their instrument ratings in flight school and maintain them while flying in the fleet . It is an OK life , decent pay , interesting work at times . I ca n't say exactly what the routine is like now , but back in the day in peacetime a Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron is working on readiness for the next big deployment . Night operations on night vision goggles was a big thing back then . Squadrons on the East Coast ( MC Air Station New River , North Carolina ) were in a rotation of going on 6 month Mediterranean cruises on a helicopter carrier . It was pretty interesting because we trained like hell as a part of a big team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that period of time we were at the absolute pointy end of the spear . <p> Overall , life in a squadron can be a bit more relaxed than in the USMC ground units . Captains and Lieutenants were on a first name basis . Many of our enlisted men were bright people and we had a crew chief and a first mech ( like an assistant crew chief ) who flew with us and made sure that everything was being done right in the back of the bird . Crew coordination is tremendously important so you need good communication and teamwork . <p> My problem with the Marine Corps was that it is important to me to own my time . If you are in the military they own you , and that is not comfortable for me . Some people love that life . <p> The photo below is of a CH-46 loading troops on a carrier . Marine CH-46 's have been replaced by the tilt-rotor Osprey . <p> One thing to add - In 2008 I met a CW5 flying Blackhawks in Iraq who flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch . National Guard guy . So you can fly helicopters a long time in the Army . <p> I forget if this is the job title my infantry buddy told me but you may want to look up being a warrant officer . <p> They are basically the same as a military officer but your helicopter would be usable under your discretion . So if you feel you are being asked to go somewhere that would put your helicopter in danger your health not as important of course .

It stopped . Do n't put up with that shit . But be more specific than " dumb behavior . " <p> I feel like if you act phased by it and confront her that way she 'll spin it into you being jealous and her " just having fun " and play the victim . If it was you and your girls first time hanging out with your friends together its probably a shit test by her to see how you 'd react to some flirting with your friend . <p> I 'd play it cool this time . But if it happens again , swiftly drop the hammer and let her know that shit wont be tolerated . <p> You are going to have to let her know that that 's not going to slide with you and keep her in check . <p> Of course its a shit test . Girls do shit like this even in relationships . Flirting with other guys in front of you is extremely disrespectful and should not be tolerated . <p> But then again if you let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys , then it essentially means its almost over for you two . It means that you have not passed all the shit tests she had for you before and you probably let them all slide . In a relationship , girls test you to see how much they can get away with you , and if you do n't pass them , she ups it even more the next time until she eventually cheats on you because she has no respect for you in the end . <p> You have to have the heart of a player and be almost brutal with it . I try to end the relationship on the spot when that happens to me . I say " bitch , if you are going to act that way in front of me and disrespect me like that , then its time to end it here , I 'm not the type of cat to tolerate that bullshit " <p> You have to be willing to end it and not be a victim of her vagina by kissing her ass all the time . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get it elsewhere . I know its hard at first , but it has to be done . You 'll be surprised the reaction you get from that . I 've had a girl cry once and begged me for forgiveness . <p> By doing this , it will shift the power onto you . That 's the true heart of being a player . Your priority should be your self-respect not her pussy . There are guys who are willing to stay in fucked up relationships and take it all just because they think they wo n't get any pussy later or are afraid to lose the big ass they have . <p> Basically -be willing to walk out of the relationship -if she cries , promise she wo n't do it again etc etc , and you wish her to stay with you , have some awesome make-up sex . - Make her do anal or gtfo . <p> This sounds like kid shit . I 'm assuming you 're in high school , am I right ? 49876 @qwx909876 <p> If my girl sits down next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are both trolling me and it 's funny . <p> Does n't sound like that 's the case with you . <p> Sounds like it 's a test . You leaving and ignoring her can have her thinking two things . First , the illogical immature female thought is , that you do n't care about her . Second more logical thought is , that you are hurt by this . <p> Neither work in your favor . <p> What to do in this situation ? A few things . Grow up . Get a new girl . Or keep her and spin some other plates . Do n't show anger . Smirk at it . Maybe even give her a kiss goodbye in front of everyone next time then keep it mysterious as to where you 're going . <p> Do the same back .

I ended up running out of condoms .. I had bought 2-3 packs at the gas station . Epic night and breakfast was delicious . <p> I only remember this happening to me when I was younger . This chick loved attention and one night she was out grinding on some guy on the dancefloor and I got up from the table , put on my coat and one of her friends says " Doc Howard where are you going ?

C especially <p> Cautionary note : This action did not prevent it from happening again , this bitch loved drama and probably looked forward to the makeup sex that would ensue when i called her out on her actions . <p> In case there are other chicks in the vicinity , you go and flirt with them . Do n't call her out , do n't make a scene . Also , change your friends . If your friends were true friends , they would n't fuck around like that , or at least they would make it seem like actual good humour . Maybe you just understood the situation all wrong and drew wrong conclusions ? Either way , if you do n't show emotion and act aloof , it 's her turn to act . If she does n't , next her . If she sees you flirting with other chicks and comes to protect , bang on . <p> ( 11-04-2014 10:35 AM ) Dr. Howard Wrote : ...

That 's why I do n't get when redpill guys get all tossed up over marriage issues etc . It 's good that we point out that marriage is dead , but it 's time to move on . <p> There are a lot of players and alphas on that show . <p> The whole show is a framing war .

If she gets fat , then it 's not Redpill . <p> Off the top of my head , some quick thoughts on the Alpha aspects of some characters . There 's certainly some stuff to takeaway from them if you analyze them in this way . <p> Ned Stark - Alpha . Probably the most well rounded embodiment of the traits . Has a code , sticks to it , owns all his responsibilities . <p> Robert - Alpha in regards to his own pleasure , to the point of being self-destructive . Definitely lacking in a lot of areas . <p> Stannis - Alpha about justice and ruling , but his at-all-costs mentality is questionable . <p> Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword ( before he lost his hand ) , he 's Alpha . But he 's got serious oneitis with his bitch sister . <p> Tywin - Alpha , but he cares too much about how others view his family . <p> Tyrion - He derives too much of his status from his family name and money , but he demonstrates the necessity for men to focus on improving what they have ( his mind ) over lamenting what they do n't have ( good looks , a normal body , etc ) Alpha in that sense . <p> I 've done a few mini red pill comments of the show and books in other posts . <p> My main problem in the show is with the portrayal of Stannis and Dany . <p> Stannis : He may not be attractive to many here looking for the wild life , and bedding many attractive women , but personally I do not think that is all there is for every life though I want it for my own life . His life is driven by duty - to the extent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even want to do , but HAS to out of honor . In the show he is made to look greedy , unattractive , and a puppet and bitch to the red woman . He is not . He is unsmiling , and unbreaking . His unwavering sense of honor might be his breaking point , but he is not going to go down like Ned Stark , because he is honorable in a psychotic way , as opposed to Ned who was honorable in a very nice guy/non confrontational way . <p> My crazy theory : The red woman says he is the hero Azor Ahai reborn , and she has seen him in her fires , battling with the White Walkers Others . Funny thing though , she never sees which side he fights FOR . Stannis learns the secret of the White Walkers , and leads their army south of the wall , and fights Dany 's dragons . Boom . <p> Dany : A spoiled bitch with a very rough childhood and a history of molestation while young , from her own brother . Loves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to be a liberator , but is nothing but a spoiled girl , with tons of beta orbiters , in way over her head . She will still get out of her mess because she has Dragons , but more importantly because of three experienced and intelligent men : Tyrion , Barristan , Victarion Greyjoy , Jorah . <p> She is possibly a pawn in the plans of the ultimate wildcard : Euron Greyjoy : The ultimate dark triad alpha . He is too " bad " to become the ultimate victor , even in a red pill book series as this . <p> Favorite characters knowing the books : <p> Petyr Baelish - classic oneitis/beta to red pill/alpha story . Also the mother fucked him over ... so he 's gon na bone the much younger and hotter daughter . And this time without the oneitis . Fuck yeah . He also reminds me of one of my best friends ... yes a machiavellian . Jaime Lannister - he is actually not a conventional " alpha " . Even though all the girls want him , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is the misunderstood man , with honor in his own way . Tyrion : probably the character with the most plot armor in the series , being Martin 's favorite . Many book reading nerds accuse Tyrion of being a rapist because he will get really wasted in book 5 ? and bone an actual Prostitute in Essos under " sketchy " circumstances . He 's a fucking black out drunk DWARF fucking a whore ... please . He does go down into the mental dumps for a while , but he rises out . Has not let all his physical disadvantages stop him , and though he self medicates with alcohol , I think we can allow him that . Varys : I do n't even want to spoil the long game he 's playing . The mysterious Varys plot starts much before the first book . I 'll give a little away on my theory : He 's been plotting with Illyrio Mopatis from Pentos . He is a secret Targaryan/ Blackfyre . Arya : She 's a psycho killer child , and joins an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragons is my theory . After all she 's gone through , she does n't mope , she goes and does something . If feminists could take even 5% advice from her , they 'd be worth something . <p> ----------------- <p> Other comments : <p> Jorah : The show portrayal does n't work because Ian Glenn is attractive , and tall , and has a deep voice girls would go crazy for . He is an averagely attractive hairy bear man in the books , and has always been a sucker for women . His whole troubles started when he spent all his money on his first wife , who left him . He seems to not have learned , because he gave up his only chance of returning home by saving Dany . Hopefully his time spent with Tyrion will teach him something . But after being a white knight for so long .. he 'll probably die an " honorable death " for his bitch Queen . <p> Bran Stark and The three eyed crow aka Brendyn Rivers , aka Bloddraven - the 120 year old Targaryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe ... or the closest to them . Please read the short stories -Tales of Dunk and Egg , set 100 years before the first book . <p> Also , Tywin Lannister : Best book to show transfer . Charles Dance is an alpha IRL too . All the young hotties from the show talk about how they swoon every time he enters the room . <p> Much and more to say . <p> I 'll end the rambling with a quote from another wild psycho , Ramsay Bolton : " If you think this has a happy ending , you have n't been paying attention . " <p> Anyways , total psychos never truly win , it 's the calm cold ones , like Tywin Lannister , or Roose Bolton , who control things . <p> ( 04-09-2014 09:18 AM ) Osiris Wrote : Tyrion a good guy ?

I am only 31 years old and definitely over 100 girls in the last few years . <p> I live in Las Vegas and it seems so damn easy here at times just to go out to nightclub or bar and grab some girl and bang her out . I get kind of tired of it honestly . <p> I have n't been able to do too much day game in general because of work related stuff . <p> One of my strongest beliefs is that " whatever you focus on you get .. " and my focus has not been there . I 've been focusing living abroad , becoming financially independent and I think women are on the back burner right now . <p> Hopefully its just a phase but honestly probably just a sign of maturity for me and you . <p> I 'm 20 and I have no desire to build a large notch count or an extensive history of lays to look back on when I 'm older . I rather enjoy experiences when they come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach if I want to get laid . But I 'm starting to see more and more that girls come and go . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I love variety and I love getting a new lay , but whenever I do I 'm satisfied and can go a month or two comfortably without having a new girl . I 'm also exploring ' mini-relationships ' for the first time . <p> Last year was a big ' game ' year for me , really . This year so far has been more of a lifestyle focus and overall self-improvement . I wonder where this will take me .. <p> I 've been experiencing the same issue for the past 3 months so I definitely feel you . I 'm lacking the motivation to push myself to game girls . I only started seriously doing this October of last year so I 'm not anywhere experienced in game like you guys on the forum . But I did get a few bangs during my journey but they all ended early this year . <p> That might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wtf am I doing with my life . Before I would just go to work and day game ( plus no-fap , working out ) . It was fun because I thought I was progressing toward becoming better with women and hitting the goals I set for myself . I guess the stress from work and the 2 girls I was with left me got to me . I was depressed . I quit my job and did n't really have an aim in life . I thought about what is the meaning of life along other with complicated questions . I was having an existential crisis as well . <p> I did some research and found Ayahuasca . After reading about it and other people 's life changing experiences , I saw Ayahuasca as hope for me . I booked a retreat in Peru which I 'm about to go in June . Hopefully , it will clear up some of my first world problems for me and give me some guidance in life . <p> Nomad77 started a couple of threads about how man is now nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good clown , resonated with me well because that 's how I felt when I 'm with a woman looking back . I feel like I 'm masking my true self by putting on a show . It 's funny how after I did my 100 approach challenge , I was confident and way more social with everyone . Now I 'm back where I 'm started and I think I 've even regressed beyond that because I 'm thinking what 's the point anyways . Also , I 'm way less social because of smoking/dealing weed which made me super paranoid but that 's another story . <p> Another forum member said " the juice is n't worth the squeeze " . That 's how I feel about dating girls in America now . The MGTOW philosophy appealed to me in that regard but I still wan na get my sexual needs met though . It 's like the saying " Women ca n't live with them . Ca n't live without them . " That 's the conflict I 'm having with my inner self . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@96059070 @259070/ <p> Love and hate are the strongest emotions a human can feel . Covering a wide spectrum of intensity these two emotions can account for some of the most important decisions one will make in their lifetime . A couple deep in love will marry and reproduce , a man gets revenge through murder , a tumblr feminist becomes indignant at words on a screen . These emotions and their motivations are usually crystal clear . More often than not these passions are our will acted upon the world . Everybody thinks they are important , everyone wants acceptance , everyone needs the love of another , and so on . When these conditions are not met we act out ; we manifest hate . When these needs are met we manifest love . Why is it though that is so much easier to hate than to love ? <p> A friend was recently raving about the new HBO breakout hit : True Detective .

Hart understands that there is more to the truth than what is rational or what can be easily explained . <p> A great example of the two characters interplay is in the following scene . They visit a traveling tent sermon to follow a possible lead . Rust believes religion is a fraud , that logically it makes no sense , therefore its followers are stupid and worthless .

Rust Cohle is not the man any of us would want to be friends with , but the man which lives inside our heads . The one which tells us that our displeasure with the world is really truth . This pessimistic notion of truth is more often than not just a facade for anger or self-loathing . Real , objective , truth is hard to find even in the internet age . Charlatans can peddle their snake oil promises of eternal happiness in the space right next to the man who uses not only facts , but the broader implication of these facts to help others with their lives .

Why is it so much easier to accept something negative as truthful than admire the inherent beauty of the world ?

@@96059073 @259073/ <p> One of the side-discussions in the " Am I Sociopath " thread made it clear that we 're in desperate need of a catalog of the various forms of trolls that loiter in the hallowed halls of the RVF . I could n't resist and punched some of it out straight-away . <p> Needless to say , this is n't a comprehensive list and there 's considerable overlap in the types . Often , a troll will display the characteristics of two or more types . <p> I figure this little intro will get us started . Please add , correct , or troll my descriptions . <p> 1 . Bad-Grammar Troll Writes meandering , unintelligible posts--often in the form of worthless pondering and musings--that add zero value to the forum . Even a teenage girl with three iPhones would n't understand the arcane abbreviations and transpositions in their masterpieces . Even after repeated warnings--and proclamations he will make an effort to improve--he continues to write with near-illiterate impunity . Posts are either super-short one-liners or tortuously long--nothing in between . <p> 2 . Race Troll Does everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ethnicity and race . Write endless tomes trying to determine ( from the comfort of his computer desk ) whether a guy of his race can get a girl from another race ( white girl ) , or rambling on about how unfortunate he is to have been born into his brown skin in some specific region of the world . No matter what others tell him , he finds some excuse for why his situation is different and therefore worse . He stubbornly refuses to actually try working any game until someone can somehow guarantee he can score the type of girl he seeks . In most cases , his goal is to keep you talking about race , not to solve an actual problem . But there also seem to be genuine specimens that are such permanently damaged goods , crippled with racial insecurity to such an extent , that even placing a white-girl on their erection would n't cure them . <p> 3 . Big-Baller Troll Even if you have a topless Scarlett Johansson currently grinding against your cock , while lavishing you with syrupy praise--making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more game than you . It 's interesting that a guy who lays down so much pipe invariably makes retarded remarks about game or asks very elementary questions . Still , he will often excoriate and brow-beat others--with impressive Internet Courage--with bold assertions about his championship-level game , with little proof or indicator that it actually exists . <p> 4 . Game-Denier , Apocalypse Troll Is the equivalent of the Catholic Church during the Renaissance , denying exciting , irrefutable science while the world around them embraces it and implements it successfully . Questions the efficacy of basic techniques that guys like me use on a daily basis just on the way to pick up the paper from the front lawn ( I do n't read the paper or have a front lawn , but you know what I mean ) . Pessimistically proclaims the death knell of entire branches of game ( college game , night game ) that are so massive that it is near-impossible for them to die . <p> 5 . Feminist ( Jezebel ) /Female-Apologist Troll Links to articles , without a tinge of irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup artists " are the scum of the Earth . Finds the one exception to the rule for some game commandment and submits it as proof that our lifestyle is oh-so-wrong . Obliquely suggests--through " scientific articles " or their own assertions--that older guys should n't pursue younger women , that monogamy is the only way to go , or other feminist talking points we reject collectively as a matter of routine . <p> 6 . STD Troll Has an unreasonable fear of contracting an STD , even when he 's not getting laid . Presents an array of suspect " scientific evidence , " for why some conventional , accepted notion about STDs is incorrect . Wants to have a drawn out discussion on how be a player , raw-dog girls , but run absolutely no risk . <p> 7 . Immortal , Shape-Shifter Troll Like a bad case of the genital herpes , this troll never really dies , flaring up when you least expect him . Despite being banned repeatedly for his annoying behavior , this troll emerges--from short or extended dormant stages--with a new handle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over and over again . Since his only goal is to trap a few unsuspecting guys into his **26;444;TOOLONG threads , he keeps coming back because he invariably fools a guy or two every time . An insidious--and often subtle--specimen , sometimes the only way to detect him is to analyze his IP address . <p> 8 . Roid-Rage Asshole Troll A guy who , from all outward appearances , has competent game and makes occasionally valuable contributions to the community . The problem is the dude takes about as much as gives , unpredictably snapping at other members of the community in episodes of massive rage , making bombastic Big-Baller statements , and lambasting women in sizzling screeds . Even on his best behavior , the guy often comes across as a snide , arrogant turd who thinks he 's entitled to immediate , thorough answers to his elementary questions or easy lays in the countries he visits . Much of his bitterness is borne from poor travel planning , sanctimonious views of propriety he shoves down your throat , or serial-killer like hatred for women--well beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us harbor . <p> 9 . Self-Promoting Entrepreneur Troll After an extended hiatus , suddenly materializes out of thin air to " share " some sort of " article " or website that you can bet your bottom dollar he 's somehow affiliated with or , worse , to pump up his sagging blog-traffic numbers--often bumping ancient threads in the process . Has been a member since jump street , but still has only 37 posts and zero rep . Transparently and lazily copies and pastes hyped-up , early 2000s-style , tacky " PUA " advice from another website or source , with the sole aim of redirecting traffic to his shit--as evidenced by his elaborate signature with 13 embedded links . <p> 10 . Player-Hater Troll Even though he only has a couple of dozen posts to his name--most of them lame , noob comments and questions--Player-Hater Troll still sees fit to zero in on the most senior , respected members of the forum , and abruptly call them out on their " phoniness " or " stupidity . " To make matters worse , he himself has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> 11 . Junk-Thread Starter Troll / Played-Out Thread Troll ( Subtle Troll ) Repeatedly starts new threads--invariably of the lowest order--about well-worn and obnoxious , or simply irrelevant and so-the-fuck-what , topics . The forum 's two ( very ) effective search functions are meaningless to this guy , because the urgency of assuring us , for the 2,000th time , that money or looks trump game simply renders them irrelevant . This is a difficult troll to smoke out , since he often cloaks himself behind the plausible excuse of being a newb--and because just starting a thread on an old , or simply uninteresting , topic does n't necessarily rise to the level of trolling . But , some combination of : poor grammar , a strain of game-denial , a ridiculously low post-count , or excessively personal revelations without a request for advice ( especially when no one knows or cares about them yet ) , is often a tell-tale symptom . <p> 12 . One-itis Troll* There 's a fine line between seeking advice on a certain type of situation you encountered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice for one particular girl . The former is just part of the process of learning game--a process we all have gone , and continue to go , through--the former is often a One-itis Troll . Not only does this troll start several threads about the same exact girl , he nick-picks and nay-says all of the responses he gets with " but " and " what-if " statements and other provisos , all with the sole aim of extending the discussion about his fantasy girl--who may or may not even exist . Once some of the guys he 's managed to lure into his obsessive vortex call him out on his trolling , he 'll often concede that he 's " just being paranoid " or hides behind newbie status , but proceeds as usual . Like other insecurity-based trolling ( e.g. , race trolls ) , one-itis trolls are quite plausibly well-intentioned newbies , but given their drain on forum resources and the equally plausible likelihood that they 're simply trolling , they need to be dispensed with surgically . <p> *Sometimes subtle . Not to be confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troll** A seemingly competent , normal member of the community whose contributions are just a little too far-fetched . We 've all done things and been in situations that stretch the boundaries of plausibility , but Fiction Troll 's narratives go just a little further--displaying odd incongruities or elaborate literary devices that , upon close examination , smell obviously fabricated . What 's more , they 've often compiled little or no credibility on the board ( through rep or a long history of posts ) for their stories to be actually believable . The dead-giveaways tend to be bragadocious threads that trumpet his " alpha " cred or ultra-polished Dear-Journal threads that read like Skinimax-like voice-overs . The combination of a group of men whose lifestlyes are predicated on continual , impressive conquests--and the ease of stretching the truth behind the anonymity curtain of the Internet--makes small amounts of fish-story trolling almost inevitable . But egregious cases of outright lying , that take away from the mission of the forum , need to be called out . <p> ( 07-17-2011 05:53 PM ) Roosh Wrote : Hilarious and informative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even funnier is that this list applies to my blog trolls too .

I have witnessed a few occasions where people were applauded by those around them for standing up to someone behaving rudely . In one case , I was at a football game . A fan of the opposing team and his family were sitting in our section . This drunk dude in front of us started talking shit to the guy , cursing him out in front of his kids . Before the dad could say anything , about five different people told the drunk guy to shut up and sit down . Those people were backed up by others , and the drunk dude , thinking he would be supported by all of us because we cheered for the same team , sat his ass down , shell-shocked , and quit talking . <p> Based on this woman 's reaction and subsequent tirade , I have a feeling that she 's the type who gets in multiple public confrontations . I may be wrong on this one , but I have personally experienced plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down . Usually , they 'll start with a little passive-aggressive out loud bitching : " Did y'all see that ? That bitch cut in line ! " Nobody responds the way they want , so they amplify : " Those stupid Mexicans are taking our tax dollars and leeching off the welfare system . " Most of these types want their complaints both heard and validated by those surrounding them . They take any subtle nod of the head as confirmation that they 're in the right , even if they 're wrong . <p> She may very well have had a point , or she may have been in the wrong . It could have been a simple misunderstanding for all we know , but that does n't matter because she resorted to insults instead of sticking to the complaint : people cut in line . If those people were in the wrong and did cut in line , they are n't the only ones who should catch any flack . The employees behind the counter should as well for allowing them to do so . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading up to this , so most of what we can say about this remains in the realm of speculation . Most of what I gathered is based on past experiences with people who resorted to similar derogatory comments when things did n't go their way , and in the vast majority of the cases , those people were either wrong or were ignorant of the situation . <p> RE : Old white lady confronts Mexican women who cut line in front of her <p> Man that 's what happens when you poke the Bear for too long ! White people are starting to get upset ... and with good reasons ! Here in one of our free newspaper in Toronto , every other day you have on the front cover about how women or minority are oppressed by white for these 100K+ jobs bla bla bla . One can only tolerate so much , and that 's the reason I do n't blame this old fat bitch for this . <p> I do n't know about the States , but the sense entitlement that some of these minority women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Notice that shit like this is mostly happening between women because in their core they believe the world to be revolving around them . Great women have learned to override that feeling by being taught to trump it . <p> Both these Bitches stink , but there 's no way these Hoes should feel that entitled to cut the line , especially in front of a fat bitch ! Fat White Bitches are just a notch below Fat Black Bitches in the " Oh no You Did n't Scale " . That 's the type of shit that makes it worse for all of us minority people !

You ca n't play it nearly as " cool " , you have to really actively engage her mind and body , to such an extent that time flies away from her perspective . Where you might make her laugh on Type A date , you want her sides to split and wine to come out of her nose on a Type B date . Bolder and bigger , more fireworks , more action . <p> Overall these are your options1 ) Stand Firm - insist on meeting at your place , risk losing the shot because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction and rest of the relationship <p> 2 ) It 'll be worth it but make it sound like it 's going to be worth it . - I.E I had something special planned . 3 ) Reschedule - Similar to the Stand firm - " I had something special planned , but if you ca n't make it , we 'll just have to meet again . " - and then use that opportunity to get on other broads , but leaving the door open for this one , and she 's no notice that your time is valuable <p> 4 ) Counter Offer - If this is a matter of convenience , a ) different time that night , b ) different venue , but closer to your original venue ( which is close to your spot ) <p> 5 ) Agree - and trust that you have the ability to overcome any of her objections to fast sex . <p> In your shoes , I 'm most likely to agree and I would assume that it 's not convenience but ambivalence . So I 'd go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard and as powerful as I could . <p> I would make whatever the activity you have planned as atypical as possible . <p> So if you 're meeting for drinks and it 's just an exchange of biographical information , spots of humor , spots of " awe " , a few brilliant insights , touches , and glances ( which is typically all you need in a lot of cases ) - then the drinks date would transition to pool/shuffle board , karaoke , dancing ... or something much more active and physical and prone to crack her world view . <p> A lot of the game is getting her off of her predetermined script . So you ca n't just play your role as normal , you have to improvise . <p> WIA <p> Nice breakdown with different motives WIA . I like this thread in general because I and I 'm sure others , have this happen . <p> For the particular girl in question , I agreed to a location " near down town " as she put it . However I qualified it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to where I 'll be ( not really true ) . Let 's start there at 730 . <p> Bottom line texts went back and forth . I could see the direction it was going so I lined up another girl at 830 . <p> The girl in question cancels but I really think it was a matter of inconvenience with her which was one of your scenarios . She sent a very long text explaining she 'd been buying stuff for her parents all day at Costco and her aunt 's family showed up for mother 's day today , etc . She asked to meet tomorrow and when I took a while to text back ... even sent a picture of her aunt 's family at the house ( as proof I guess ) saying " lol are n't they cute though ? " <p> Told her I 'd let her know details of the date tomorrow . <p> So ... tomorrow , I think I 'm going to try to get her back to my original , logistically superior , venue to meet . <p> One planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Billions of galaxies in the universe . Approach . <p> Does she live close to this bar ? Does she live with friends ? If you do n't have answers to these questions I would n't bother meeting her somewhere more " convenient " for her sake or in the middle ( which really does n't suit either logistics ) . <p> If you ca n't get answers to those questions or sexualise enough before the date on potential for whether she might be DTF I genuinely would n't bother with it from a perspective of sex . If you want potentially something longer term and willing to be patient over a few dates then go ahead . I would n't bother myself . I would tell her " this place is good , trust me " or try rescheduling . <p> I 've had this happen only once ! The girl was Russian , very sexy and smart . She knew what she was doing . I like to be in control always ... i give her credit for what she did . <p> I later found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something in her favor , chose the location and also a venue that she liked . The location was a spot in Yorkville in downtown Toronto ... that explained a lot . I normally would have stopped this but went along to observe her " game " . She was really good . <p> Lesson Learned ? Hell yes ! If on a first date , if a girl is not cool enough to even let the man take full control then that to me is more of a yellow flag if anything and just proceed with caution . <p> I just next them . it 's just a taste of more to come . she 's telling you that she does n't give a shit about your time and/or convenience . in my experience girls who did this always either flaked in the end , or if they did show up they were such cunts that there was no sex nor second date . <p> Propose a compromise : Offer to pay for her taxi and she should come over to your place , because it 's much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better place and I take care of your cab fare . Deal ? " <p> Usually it 's a push of frame - the probability that it 's not is low - some real reason . In poorer countries it is often based on the fact that she must take bus , drive long hours etc. - is a big hindrance . <p> I know that we have a hesitation to pay for things here and it is a correct choice - still paying for her transportation closer to your sex-lair and paying for drinks to let go of her inhibitions are good exceptions . <p> Subtext : " You should have a good reason to change the date location , otherwise why would you ? " <p> Step 2 : Concede or RescheduleIf she offers a legitimate logistical excuse for shifting the date location ( maybe her car is broken , she ca n't get to your area at the original time , etc ) , accommodate her logistics by going to her or altering the meeting time . <p> If she has no good excuse , say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can then shore up your case by promising a specific fun date venue , near your house , naturally . <p> Subtext : " If you do n't abide by our original agreement , I do n't want to meet . " <p> If she still tries to cajole you into meeting up by her , and she strikes you as very DTF , go for it - you might even test this by offering to meet her at her place , at least to start off the date . Otherwise , next her - she is going to drink on your dime and nothing more . <p> Changing the date setup ( aside from a minor delay ) the day of the date is an arrogant power move that 's unacceptable without a solid logistical excuse . What 's more , a girl who pulls it probably is n't DTF for you , unless she 's just extremely lazy . <p> ( 05-09-2015 03:01 PM ) robreke Wrote : Assume she 's hot . She still wants to meet .

I had one girl who basically refused to do the drive to my chosen spot and she really wanted me at her town ( she refused to drink and drive ... even 2 drinks ) . I agreed , the bar was near her apartment and she invited back to her place that night so you never really know . You do n't want to cut off your nose to spite your face . If she has a legit reason i 'd accommodate her but if she 's doing it for compliance I would simple ask to reschedule that way you are doing it on your terms . <p> Here 's what 's going down text wise now : I hit her up today and said " drinks at 7.30 ? " <p> She responded an hour later : Would 8 be cool ? And at the xyz bar ? ( xyz bar being the bar I agreed to change to yesterday from my original spot . I picked xyz because it was closer to down town .... but it was because she said she preferred downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... as I 've got nothing to do tonight or saying " let 's do 8.15 at ABC bar .

Approach . <p> Bumping this thread since it rears its ugly head from time to time . There are some golden nuggets in here . I think I used to think DC had fewer attractive women . But when I am networking out the ass every week , I meet an early 20s 8 at least once every week . Getting them to commit to anything has been a chore . So I am often direct at the venue and suggest more insta venue changes to get a feel on their DTF vibe . Not a lot different than before , but I think I am going to state my intent more . Let 's get out of here does n't appear to be working for me as it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I did n't care if I skipped it right to the close . Aside from this approach , we sometimes have to settle for a business card exchange to follow up on a meet one on one . And when you see more than once that a new girl you do n't know very well tries to switch the venue last minute or says anything like it 's not convenient for her , then I just go with Basil 's advice to say another time and move on to others to maintain frame and to continue serving your abundance mentality . <p> I find that I 'm running into this issue quite often , especially this shit where the girl latches onto a place , literally in her neighborhood - but 25 miles from mine .

Try to make them meet you at your local venues that you take dates to . Typically cheaper for you if you know the bartenders , adds SMV if their are other cuties there , build better relations with locals , bartenders , etc . <p> EX : " Hey , I 'm driving up from X ( a city in the opposite direction ) beacuse of work . Would you mind meet me at Y ( Your city ) - it 'd help me out alot . I 'll even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to be the exact wording . <p> I ca n't tell you how many times it 's worked and the girl ends up coming my way , I 've had a girl come get banged by me first date from over 75 miles away ! <p> 3 . If local is n't possible , have her meet near your work IF it 's halfway in between or near her . You should have some venues locked down local to work for dates and know the bartenders decently . I have 2 I go to less than 5 miles from work . <p> EX : " Hey I 'll be running a bit late , how about we meet at X bar ( near work , near her ) and we can grab a drink there , I 'll get ready after the gym , and meet you there " - once again you do n't need to use this exact line , but you get the idea . <p> This gets them out of their comfort zone and home base . <p> I 've done this plenty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Bitches love excitement . <p> 4 . Do n't got to them unless they 're inviting you over to their pad . UNLESS you have a pretty strong gut feeling that they 're down to fuck . As in sexting , nudes , hinting at banging , or they invite you over , etc . <p> One thing to note is you do n't want to scare the cat , so this would be my last option with a girl worth driving for . <p> ( 04-29-2017 03:08 PM ) Steelex Wrote : IMO , Whether or not you fuck her is usually decided more before the date than during the date . If she 's making a change , it 's to accommodate what is probably going to happen . <p> Atleast that 's my opinion . Most of my dates that ended in sex had a distinct vibe from the start . I could just tell that one way or the other we were going to fuck . <p> Cosign with Steelex , usually a chick 's made up her mind that she wants to bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining the thought in her head . <p> It 's on you to help convince her she was right . <p> You get a gut feeling , especially when chatting her up , you look at her body language , how she talks to you , how she stares at you . <p> Almost every single date that I banged that same night started out with some key factors : <p> -She was enthusiastic -She was shy and opened up and was warm -She kept drinking with me -She did n't mind anywhere we went -She took the bait suggesting movies , collections , etc . <p> The ones that want it do n't make it too much of a hassle . Maybe she wants to fuck at her place cause she feels safer there . Who fuckin knows . <p> IMO , intra-date strategy is overrated . Stick to the basics . Chill , drink a bit , go to the house , get it in . <p> Maybe I 'm quick to give up , but I have found that most any resistance except last minute resistance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not worth my time , cause I 've been down that road 100 times before and 9/10 it ends shitty . <p> Part of the excitement for women is to go to a guy 's place , check it out and in her mind " whatever happens happens " . Most mid 20s women have been to dozens and dozens of guys places , like a dog observing and sniffing around trying to see what the guy is really about , she does n't fuck all of them but she does fuck some of them . <p> I definitely agree with Kaotic that you should only go to her 's if she 's clearly down to fuck . In bigger cities this is quite unlikely as she 's usually sharing with flatmates and so on , not many girls live by themselves . Why would I invest more than her ( by going out of my way ) to meet her ? I actually did that once and there turned out to be no logistics to bang ( always check before the date if you do this , turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I went all the way there to see her even though she invited me . Logistics is a man 's responsibility , and if you fuck it up it 's your fault and they may even call you out on it especially if they 're interested . <p> I can count in one hand the number of women who invited me to theirs or close to their place and we sealed the deal . I would need many hands for the number of her coming to me or a few minutes away . <p> The general rule is to meet as close as possible to where you have logistics . Failing that you would need very good reasons ( she 's as close as possible as DTF as you can get etc ) to do anything else . <p> I am with WIA on this one . The OP says first date . So i will assume you do n't  really have much of an upper hand in the relationship . If its someone you have communicated with a long time , then sometimes you have the dynamic where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you do n't  really know eachother yet , you do n't  have the attraction built up enough to do that . <p> Getting into a lengthy tug of war over location and logistics is n't very productive at this stage . I usually do n't  sweat the logistics/timing issues , the priority is getting her on the date now . You can establish the vibe and dynamic there . <p> I do n't  see a FLUID way to argue and stand your ground on this if she insists . It can often degrade into a vibe killer . Unless the girl is already a bit weak in her frame . <p> No offence but that 's some terrible advice : turning down a date if she 's not DTF . This shit might work in North America where girls go on dates for sport but some of the best girls I 've dated took at least 2-3 dates to seal the deal . On the first date I do n't stick to one location , I like to bounce between venues : 2 bars , a coffee shop then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the city . Restaurants and other places where you have to sit face to face interview style are a no go . If she suggests a restaurant then say you just finished eating , how about a drink instead ?

Its the nature of the beast and today 's society changes the rules of the game bc pimpslapping a hoe will get you locked up , even if on a primal level , its what they want . <p> My advice : Let the bitch play , but have a clear line established . If she crosses the line , ( metaphorically ) pimpslap her . If she keeps doing it break up with her . You 're not showing jealousy by protecting your investment , you show jealousy by over-valuing it . <p> Along the theme of jealous .... is it okay to tell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good for the guy she 's with . <p> I hit up a girl a while back and was real persistent . I know I come across as alpha basically letting her know that I wanted her . I 'm a " relatively " alpha looking guy . 6 ' 2 . Full head of hair . Semi athletic looking . <p> She would n't give me her number cause she said she 'd been going out with this guy for a while . She said if something happens she would let me know if she saw me though . <p> I saw her a few times since then , and she was always rubber necking looking at me . Doing double takes so I know I made some kind of impression . One time , she was driving by in the grocery parking lot and slowed down to make sure it was me she was seeing . <p> This is also kind of funny , but I saw her like a week ago at the store and she was with her mom . Her mom kept looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine upstanding young man , I wish my daughter would date someone like you " The girl looked a little nervous and kind of avoided eye contact . I think on a count of how aggressive I was the first time I made the impression . I just left with my food . <p> I saw her today at the grocery with ... I presume her guy ..... I could n't fucking believe it ! He was like a short , beta looking , skinny ass hipster . I could literally kill him with one or two punches . Now , I know looks are n't the main thing for women ... but my God , seeing her fine ( high 8 to 9 ) ass standing next to him just did n't look right . It looked almost un natural . He could not protect her proper if it came to it . I know I 'm biased , but I think I could possibly seduce her away from him . It really threw me for a loop seeing her with such a beta looking dude . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re seduce her , and if need be , telling her , in a non-angry way , that she 's just too good for that guy . At least someone has to plant this seed . There 's no way such a beta looking dude could be fucking her proper ..... like I would . <p> One planet orbiting a star . Billions of stars in the galaxy . Billions of galaxies in the universe . Approach . <p> Absolutely , NO ! Do n't show any indication of weakness - I know this sounds cruel and heartless , but the best way to keep her , is the I do n't give a fuck attitude . The moment you start showing any indication , that you are jealous , is the moment pandora 's panties will be dropping , in front of some other dude , because she KNOWS you are HER bitch , and that she has emotional control - you may as well just wear a chastity belt , let her lock your cock up , and give her the key - you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar situation , a few months back . <p> She is playing with you , it might not seem that way , but the majority of women get off , on seeing us men suffer like this - especially beta 's , she might be at the store with that hipster , but my guess is , he is being her emotional tampon , and manservant most of the time . What do I suggest ? <p> 1 . Do n't give a fuck , if your woman is loyal , it will be unspoken , and unquestionable ; remember , reacting quickly to her actions and opening up emotionally , shows you are NOT just weak , but also needy too , and it tells her , she is the only pussy you have on tap , and gives her leverage to manipulate you - do n't put yourself in that position , once you do , it 's hard to dig yourself out <p> 2 . Do n't buy into her " emotionless " bullshit , every good man , that profits from anything , schemes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the clutch , until you know for certain , which gear you want to shift to , for this " relationship " <p> Anyways , treat her like anything else , do n't put her on a pedestal , and adopt the mentality that , she is LUCKY to even spend time with you , otherwise , discard accordingly , rinse , and move onto the next hoe . <p> I have been messing around with this a lot lately . It depends on how into you she is right now . If she is on the fence , then never show jealousy . If she is deep into you then showing jealousy will let her think that she is OK ( not going to get her heart broken ) to fall even deeper . <p> Ive been dating this girl for 2 months ... about once to twice a week . Been raw dogging her . I 'm thinking of asking her if she is seeing other men and framing the main reason as because we have been having unprotected sex and I just want to know for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way but I do want to know . Is this approach okay ? <p> for what its worth ... we have both told each other we like each other and she calls me " love " alot . But no " I love you " yet . <p> One planet orbiting a star .

@@96059083 @259083/ <p> I 'm writing this post because the other day I was discussing with a couple of my buddies what they think a girl does to show attraction to you , whether it be during the day or at night . If everybody could put in their two cents it would be greatly appreciated seeing as I am also having a hard time figuring this out . <p> Preliminary IOI 's ... Proximity ( she hangs out around you and is chilling in your vicinity ) , this is especially poignant if it 's obvious she 's gone out of her way to stand there . <p> Next would be strong eye contact , she obviously is looking at you from across the room , she holds the eye contact when you look back at her . It 's especially a good signal if smiles at you while maintaining eye contact . <p> Shit my last lay from NYE was almost all initiated based on strong body language , and my properly reading the IOI 's from the chick . <p> After proximity and eye contact , it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you is interested , you 'd have to have your head up your ass to not know that . <p> Once you are into a conversation , I 'd say the woman asking questions about you is a clear sign of interest and attraction , as well as how much she contributes to conversation . Generally speaking interest equals attraction , and if a woman is not that interested in you she wo n't ask you questions or make effort to forward the convo . <p> Perhaps even more important than her asking questions and contributing to conversation is body language , facial gesturing , eye contact , and kino . If the woman initiates kino by touching you any where , but especially your arms or chest , you have attraction . Beyond that you have to read her body language , does she lean into you , does she move closer , stare deeply into your eyes , do her pupils dilate ever so slightly , does she smile a lot , does she stare at your lips . If she does all these things you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way more deep into this stuff , but for now , this is good advice . <p> They say that 90% of communication is non-verbal , as the guys have said it has a lot to do about body language . If a girl is playing with her hair is a pretty tell-tale sign , if you are having a group conversation and she glances your way even when you are n't speaking is another one . <p> Interesting question cause I have n't seen this in a while , but a HUGE key to game . Being able to read people will make you stand out from a LOT of the other guys , cause a lot of men have NO clue how to read women-when the womans nonverbals are SCREAMING for him to approach . Women are MUCH more subtle with their nonverbals and use them much more then men do , so people able to read those and know how/what she 's feeling without her saying will help you a LOT . I know there are other threads for this on here , including a video of a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program ) out to meet people ( look for a date ) set in the UK that goes over a lot of this . I 'd look it up for you buttt .... that 's your job . <p> Ok so big signs-as stated : <p> -Playing with their hair -Touching their neck -Reciprocating touch -Holding your hand ( I read this on here , and believe this law to an ABSOLUTE T now ... any time you can hold a girls hand , I pretty much guarantee you can kiss her or the kiss will be coming soon . I 'll do something like get her to give me a high five , and then I will lock her fingers inbetween mine and end up holding her hand . I 'm touchy feely as fuck , so it usually works .... and again , if you can hold a girls hand like that or while walking around or talking ( or whatever you 're doing ) -the kiss is on the way , just a matter of eta ) -Open body language ( legs/arms uncrossed ) -Feet/body pointed towards you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will dilate and that 's a fact , however I have almost NO idea how you would be able to tell that unless you 're WAY too close to the girl or somewhere with plenty of light which most night time places do n't have . Eventually/hopefully with enough experience , you 'll be able to tell the difference between when a girl is just looking at you and when a girl has that interested/checking the guy out look . I laugh for joy like a schoolboy on the inside when I 'm looking around and I catch a girl checking me out . Hahahaha . BUSTED BITCH ! ! -Any girl who looks at you/eye contact twice is pretty much interested and open to approach -Also , do n't just learn how to read the girl herself but also any of her friends or the group dynamic . One of my wings can check out sets and immediately ( or quickly ) tell which one is the alpha female , which is the one you MUST befriend or get on your side as soon as you approach/open-if you do things will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things WAY harder then they need to be . -Also , conversely-if you can read other peoples body language I hope you know how to present good body language yourself . <p> -Im a HUGE stickler for body language and being able to read people well , it will/can help you immensely in game as well as other parts of life or just walking around/meeting people .... and hey , never know who you might run into or what fine ladies they could know . <p> I agree that following is huge . I always venue change to establish that she 'll follow and also it 's ( not to sound gay ) a " little adventure " . You and your girl met here , now you 're going together here . You get to guide the small of her back with your hand , walk on the proper side of the street , pop a piece of gum in your mouth and offer her one to get her thinking about an eventual kiss , etc . <p> " I 'm still kinda new to the city and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar across the street . " " I 'm kinda ADHD - I love new atmospheres and spaces . Let 's hit up . " " This bar is cool but they do n't have fresh mint here . Let 's go to I want you to taste this vodka/water with fresh mint . It 's so crisp . " <p> When it comes to girls checking you out , they are very sneaky . If walking past a girl or if you are sat and she is walking past you do not look at her until just as you are about to pass . In the UK at least , a girl who 's into you will likely sneak you a sideways glance at the last minute , its great if you catch them do it because they will know that the attraction is mutual . And it is completely undeniable - there 's no reason to sneak a sideways glance at someone unless they are checking you out so if a girl does this you know 100% that they like you . <p> In such a situation do n't  make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking past , women are much less sexually aggressive in this respect - they will sense your eyes on them and not look back at you . ( except in Germany , where I 've found girls have no qualms about bogging you out as you approach them , its great ) . <p> ( 01-05-2013 05:36 PM ) OGNorCal707 Wrote : Preliminary IOI 's ...

@@96059084 @259084/ <p> Have n't been on the forum in a while ... but after the week I just had I had to share something with the manosphere to see if I could help out a few of my brothers ... <p> After reading on article last week on how mega dosing zinc raised the testestone levels of athletes by 40% I started a little zinc experiment . Taking around 150- 200 mg of a zinc a day . One day I even took 250mg ... <p> All I can say is WOW . What I have noticed in just the past week from this : <p> -Wake up with morning wood like I am 18 again . Great indicator of good test levels . <p> -My armpits do n't smell anymore ... long story short but between not using anti perspirant and eating paleo I started to get a real manly arm pit funk by the end of the day ... that 's gone . Thank god because I was about to give up the whole paleo thing thinking it was from eating to much meat . <p> - This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been having a lot more girls smile at me in the streets , at work or wherever ! I 'm noticing a lot more positive indicators from the females ... it 's like they smell the testosterone on me . It is pretty crazy . Even had one girl look away while blushing and playing with her hair at the same time ... I can just see/feel a different response from women when I look at them . Yesterday at a little music festival a friend of a friend who is a " lesbian " took a liking to me . After heavy kino and smiles got the number . Nice cute little spanish chic from the bronx with the fatty . Side note - I 'm thinking she is not a lesbian at all and just sick of betas . <p> Has any one else tried supplementing with zinc and seen results ? I was obviously deficient in zinc as are most the population but interested to see if anyone else had good results with zinc supplementation . I do n't plan on doing this mega dose for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels checked with a blood test and after the four weeks are done go back to about 50mg a day . <p> BTW I am taking L opti zinc which has the right ratio of zinc to copper . Taking to much zinc can mess up your copper levels and after all the research I 've done it seems it is better to take them together . <p> I tried Zma and did not like it . And it did not yield the same results as this recent protocol . At first zma was cool but after a few days it had me sleeping way to long and really groggy during the day . Now I just use a magnesium spray , take epsom salt baths , or drink natural calm at night time . Also I take a b complex in the morn . Plus zma only had 30 mg of zinc in it .

As a bar/club owner i 'll tell you guys first hand that myspace/facebook/texting changed the game drastically . RARELY do I see a one night stand hookup happen between strangers .

There 's less of a " you 're only trying to fuck me " frame attached than when you 're at a bar . Plus it 's fun to once in a while pick up a not completely wasted slut . Carry on , gentlemen .

Before doing anything , soak a wash cloth under a hot faucet and apply a " hot wrap " to your testicles for about five minutes .

After the hot wrap is complete , apply some baby oil or another massage oil into your palms and really rub it into the skin of your scrotum , covering all visible areas with oil . <p> Next , begin to massage all the areas surrounding your testicles , but not the testicles directly .

Billions of stars in the galaxy . Billions of galaxies in the universe . Approach . <p> I find that most women are poor at massaging your balls . They may touch them a bit and lick them a bit or slobber on them slightly , but because none of them have balls , they do n't really know what to do .

ONS for example involve too much stress , fatigue and can be fumbling encounters . You need to be very relaxed . But girlfriends can not give optimal ball massage .

I opened my account over the internet and made my deposits by mail . The bank gave me a debit card so I could make most purchases with that and could access cash when needed . the most cost-effective way to do that is the " cash-back " option when making a debit card purchase - no fee for the cash taken . If you must use an ATM take enough cash to lasta t least a week so that the fees have minimal impact . The ATM fees are the same for a $200 withdrawal as they are for a $20 withdrawal . How does this work ? Creditors and CA 's tend to look for bank accounts near where you live or work . Most people do their banking that way . By banking far away - at least several states away - you make it much harder for them to find your bank account . <p> OPTION 2 - Use Option 1 but park your idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give youa debit card and actually credits your account with 1.5% of each use of the debit card ( use it like a credit card without entering a PIN ) ! ! And as of the writing of this article ( 10/10/2005 ) they pay 3% interest at least double what the brick-and-mortar banks pay . How i 'd this added safety ? Simple - paypal has a Maters Account at Bank One ( or Chase - B1 and Chase recently merged ) . Your Paypal account is a sub-account in that bank . Even if Chase or B-1 is a creditor of yours your money is safe from them because the Account Holder is Paypal . You can park your excess funds in Paypal and wire them to your brick-and-mortar bank ( free ) when you need to cover a check you wrote . You can not write checks against your Paypal account . <p> OPTION 3 : Another option is to become a signatory on an account that is not titled in your name . This is usually done by establishing a separate legal entity ( Trust Corporation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that this option is best done by people with a legitimate business of their own even if it is part time .

There are legal steps taht must be taken to establish the entity and those steps vary from state to state .

Only 1% of UK land is productive and the nation that pioneered the Industrial Revolution has given all this power to the Far East . <p> The UK economy is highly dependent on non-productive financial services and property . Because of this , successive governments will seek to ensure that the property prices of some of the poorest quality , worst damp-infested dwellings in Western Europe will keep rising until Kingdom Come .

This amount of money for 1 hour 's work would : - Buy sausages for 3.5GBP , x 6 apples for 1.75GBP and one or two cheap items like broccoli / bananas . No steaks . Only enough food for a day or two . - Not pay for a meal anywhere unless it was fast food like McDonalds . - Not pay for a single gourmet burger anywhere which costs around 9-10GBP. - Not pay for a movie ticket anywhere . - Pay monthly rent after around 75 hours at basic pay . <p> In fact , x 2 short trips on the tube would cost a London Tesco worker 4.60GBP which would be 65% of an hour 's work .

To put it bluntly , there is not much money in Canada . Canada will give you a good life , with a slower pace , and many options for stability , but because of that the opportunities to light a rocket up to the sky in success or wealth are limited . <p> When I sit down and think how I can make it rich here in Canada not a lot of ideas pop into my head . In America I could eventually whore myself out and be a contractor and make good money off the largess of USA Government , or you can go into the self-made route where money exists to chase any idea that you can flip into revenue stream . While , in the UK I could leverage being in a gateway between Europe and Africa and make International deals happen more easily . Its not impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist here . The people lack productive output and our creative capital has been waning more and more as the years go on . Canada used to be a nation of people who cut down trees and invented things . Blue Collar workers and White coat nerds but over time those jobs have been vanishing and being replaced with Sr. paper pushers in Government , Nurse , or you being a Pharmacist or Bank Branch Manager . Nothing wrong with those , but those positions are capped in potential , they offer good pay but that 's all that your getting . <p> I am far from casting shade on Canada , it has a lot of good things going for it , but there are many limits to how big you can grow your pie here without very specific or finite targets towards certain skills and nieches to exploit . Sometimes though you just want a comfortable place to rest your head each day with low drama and bullshit . Canada can offer you that and depending on what other things you value in your life it can offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors and open space being in a city such as Calgary or Vancouver would beat out anything that would be a equivalent in the UK . <p> But the OP in regards to cross pollination of our people are Visa laws are not equal .

I suspect many Canadians who are landed there are high level workers or have family ties to get them in . Even just to travel they are no nice to Canadians and boot us out very quickly . <p> Still related to travel the UK puts you more central and cheaply to escape places . In Canada air travel is fucking expensive . Every place is ' far ' from here , the only cheap flights from Toronto are to : Montreal , Chicago , Detroit , Boston , NYC . Contrast that to the UK where I could be in Croatia for the same price as a flight to NYC here in Toronto . <p> RE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK ( in terms of making money ) ? <p> People on here are comparing the London and outer areas to places in the world which have no right to be compared too . <p> It also makes out that the UK is an utter shithole ....

I also do n't recall losing power or utilities as a result for days and weeks on end unless there was industrial action . <p> Let 's not forget the serious crime figures are restricted to the inner city slums and the occasional rare occurrence elsewhere . We have no towns or cities here that could equal a drastic downturn in economic ability like the USA . Australia etc . <p> Let 's compare shall we ? <p> Canada : Home to Toronto . Enough said . <p> It is also home to a massive oil industry which is poisoning its beautiful countryside , rivers and forests . Do I also need to point out the amount of snow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wildlife than humans . <p> If I wanted French sophistication , snobbery and nice wine/beer and good weather I would go to the south of France . <p> If I wanted to earn a few years salary , see as few women as possible and get a trade under my belt then Canada would be my choice . <p> If you 're a smart bastard with money go to London . London is the Number one place to be as a young-middle aged guy who is single , can game and can earn money . Do n't moan about the cost because if you do you 're not the type who knows how to ball . <p> People earning money in London know how to hide their wealth . Its a basic requirement there and if you do n't know how to then you will be chewed up . <p> London , mainly the City is the reason the UK is what it is .

@@96059107 @259107/ <p> I 've had good results over the past few months using an intermediate program based on daily undulating periodization . I believe this is a lower stress method to training if you are an intermediate and routines like the Texas Method are a bit too grueling for you . I 'm in my 40 's , so a Texas Method volume day would probably wipe me out . <p> Greg Nuckols Wrote:In one of the classic studies in this area , two groups of subjects that had been training for an average of about 5 years prior to the study ( not elite athletes by any stretch of the imagination , but they at least had some time under the bar ) used either a linear periodization , or a DUP training plan . <p> The results ? Mindboggling . These two groups had put in essentially the exact same work over 12 weeks . The workouts were the same , the order and structure were just different . <p> Several other studies have shown similar results , but the study groups were n't large enough to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of course , to be honest about the data , there is one study showing that block periodization may be slightly better than DUP under certain circumstances . <p> However , the fact remains , DUP is a better setup than most of the popular programs out there . <p> And in another article he explains the mental aspect : <p> Quote:Let 's start by looking at the various beginner routines out there . When you look at the Starting Strength program , or Stronglifts 5+5 , or any of the other LP programs , what do you see ? <p> Basically the exact same workout every time you walk into the gym . The same exercises , with the same volume and intensity , in the same rep ranges , 5 pounds heavier than last time . I 'm not saying it ca n't work , but for many people it 'll be just as much a test of their patience as it will be a test of their strength . Why not keep the latter while dispensing with the former ? <p> When you move past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's Sheiko with vanilla exercise selection and the same general intensities , with weekly fluctuations in volume . There 's Westside with a load of exercise variation , but similar volume and intensity week to week . There 's the Cube and 5/3/1 that have more weekly variation in loading , with the Cube having a broader array of exercises than 5/3/1 . There 's Madcow and the Texas Method with variations in volume and intensity workout to workout , but the same training setup week to week . Going back to the Rhea DUP study from earlier in this article , the same principles apply . Some things change ( volume and intensity with each session ) , while others remain constant ( exercise selection and the structure of the training week ) . In all these examples , there 's variety of some sort or another to keep the training fresh , while retaining enough consistency for you to gauge progress . <p> The great thing about this scenario ? They all work . Plenty of people have gotten good results with all of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are they ADD , lacking diligence and motivation ? Or are they simply trying to find the type of training that clicks with them ? <p> Motivation comes from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources . Your choice of training plan can substantially affect your extrinsic motivation . The more you enjoy your training , the more extrinsically motivating it is . It 's the whole behaviorist idea of reinforcement . The more you enjoy going to the gym and training , the more that reinforces the behavior . The more apt you are to continue lifting , and the more effort you 'll put into your training . Conversely , if you 're intrinsically motivated to train , but your training plan bores you to tears and you stop looking forward to going to the gym to carry out the training you have planned , it starts setting up a more aversive relationship with training . <p> When you like what you do , it sets up a positive feedback loop . You enjoy training , so you 're more motivated to train harder , so you get better 're more motivated to train harder , so you get better results , etc . Worst case scenario is that , even if the training is psychologically appropriate , it 's not physiologically appropriate . In that case , you can retain the training structure that you enjoy , and make some changes within that framework to get the results to start coming again . <p> If you search the web you can find various programs which incorporate the DUP principles . I 'll describe the one I used . If you are interested in following it , and have an iOS device , I would highly recommend downloading the MultiYear Weight Training App : <p> This app by Robert Frederick is excellent and probably deserves it 's own thread . <p> The program I followed is called " Phase II " and it cost a few bucks to download . <p> Basically it 's similar to many other full-body programs in that you have two full body workouts that you alternate between : A and B. Workout A is Squat , Bench , and Rows plus accessories of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pulldowns/Pull-Ups plus accessories . <p> For instance , suppose your 1RM on the bench press is 270 lbs . Then on a day you are doing 8 rep sets , you will attempt to lift .82 x 270 = 221 lbs . ( Round that down to 220 lbs . ) If you lift 220 eight times your new 1RM is 273 lbs . And so forth . You can increase the weight lifted by a weekly percentage increase , or a fixed increment . I have personally found that I am stronger in some rep ranges than others , so things will fluctuate depending on the workout , as one would expect , but overall your 1RM moves upwards over time . As the weight gets heavier I prefer using fixed increments . ( That is , if the last time I lifted 215x8 , then next time I do sets of 8 , I will attempt 217.5x8 or 220x8 ) <p> The app program also incorporates reverse pyramids , so for example , the second set is only 90% of the first set 's weight . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding volume , depending on how you feel that day ( some auto-regulation ) . The goal is to hit the rep target for the day as a minimum if fatigued , but generally you attempt to go higher . If you are doing sets of 5 , then the sets will usually look like : 5 reps , ( lower weight ) 6 reps , ( lower weight again ) 8 reps . <p> Again , if you are interested in following the exact program , I highly recommend downloading the app . It does all the math for you . <p> Robert Frederic Wrote:The first prominent feature in this program is the reverse pyramid set structure . There are three basic set structures : pyramid , straight sets , and the reverse pyramid . With the pyramid , you increase the weight every set . That means you use the heaviest weight when you are tired . With straight sets , you keep the weight the same between sets and try to reach your rep targets . In order for this to work you need a weight you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tired and on your last set . That means the first sets were n't too hard . Finally , with reverse pyramid sets , you do the heaviest weight you can handle while you are fresh , then lower weight to accommodate fatigue and get some additional volume in with the remaining sets . <p> The next feature in this program is the daily undulating load . This is the current best model of periodization for strength development known . Concurrently training the muscle throughout the intensity spectrum leads to rational hypertrophy as all components of strength are developed in parallel . Due to the needs of this phase , the ratio between hypertrophy and strength work is 2:1 . <p> Another feature of this program is the organization into monthly blocks . During the course of the month , the mean volume will decrease while mean intensity rises . The practical utility of this organization is that effort is first directed into building muscle before it is made more efficient . <p> In my opinion this program should take you up to the point where your lifts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffer and it 's time to think about doing one big lift per day , as in 5/3/1 or something similar .

@@96059110 @259110/ <p> Theanine as it seems , does not completely stop anxiety , but only numbs it , and if you have underlying psychological triggers or fears that result in anxiety , you will still feel it , but it will be dulled . With that being said , theanine IS a good crutch for getting over your fears , but wo n't handle them completely ( like fear of approaching ) like some would like to posit . <p> Second , beyond the mid range , i 'm not certain of the science , but theanine once your body is used to it , does not seem to do anything at a full gram than it does at a 500 - 600 mgs . I could be wrong , but from me alternating between random dosages , it appears that 500 - 600 mgs is most effective and anything more is just wasting your money . <p> In addition , I 've found for getting things done physically in a focused manner ( I work a stressfull as a fuck construction job ) , theanine with caffeine does best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theanine plus panax ginseng seems to have effects on me similar to piracetam , but not as long lasting . Again , try at your own risk as I do n't know the exact science or if they 're only effecting me this way , but I 've found for myself personally 200 mgs of panax ginseng plus 500-600 mgs of theanine does wonders for studying and relaxation . <p> I just started taking gaba . It is good stuff . Studies show it actually inhibits growth hormone secretion as well . In another study it eliminated peoples fear of heights . It 's good stuff . It 's just an amino-acid . And in this over stressed world we live in today it 's a good addition to a lot of peoples health protocol . I have my girl take it and it helps with her anxiety . <p> I 'm pretty low on sleep today , but I had coffee in the morning . L-theanine definately seems to make you more relaxed/chill but comes at the cost of increased drowsiness . Seems like it 'd be a winning combo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had decent sleep . I 'm at home so I ca n't verify whether it helps you improve your game at all but I 'll give that a test soon . <p> So far I 've taken 200 mg and can not say that I 've noticed much effect . I 'm gon na take another 200mg in an hour and see . <p> Cost wise , I spent $11 for 50 100mg caps . Should I be looking into the powders ? <p> Moma and bojangles , could you share more about your experiences and if you are sill using it . <p> I 'm not using it currently , I am pretty relaxed by nature . I have n't gone out in yonks for cold hunting , just working off of lizard residuals .

It also made my work day much less stressful - it has this calming effect and everything seems to be not a big deal .

I have tried many other supliments to help me with anxiety and stress but nothing worked at all ! Even phenibut had no effect !

Why ? It has to do with the tunnel vision it gives you . See , theanine is fucking excellent for school if you are INTERESTED but as it turns , this years course selection was n't too interesting , but had to be done for me to advance to my next year . I popped about 400 - 600 mg 's of theanine a day , and while I got the tunnel vision , it did n't help me with school , it helped me focus on my computer and reading non-related articles on there . <p> Theanine also made pick up worse , and maybe this is due to the higher dosages , but when I was out and about on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't care enough to go actually talk to women because I got into this self-focus bubble and focused only on me . In addition , when I drank , again , I did n't give a fuck about anyone else , I just wanted to drink and chill . However , because I was always taking larger doses , I feel like maybe pick up might have been boosted a bit if I took smaller doses . <p> Lastly , the shittiest effect was irritability , and again , this comes with the tunnel vision . I work with a lot of musicians , and if all I wanted to do was mix music , it would piss me off if they asked to do other shit because all I wanted to do was focus on what I was doing . In addition , this extended to people calling or whatever , once I got into that tunnel vision mode , what I was interested in was all that mattered . <p> The GOOD : <p> Theanine is fucking awesome for creativity . I found myself taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on music , art or whatever fascinated me at the time . Theanine works BEST if you 're into your task at hand , and for that , it still has a place in my supplement stacks . However , like listed above , if you do n't find the thing you 're doing that interesting , I find it near impossible to focus on shit . <p> Hangovers . Now , I know alot of academic papers seem to conclude there are no true hangover cures , stacking Theanine , Calcium , Vitamin D and Ginseng together seems to kill any hangover symptoms I have . I consistently use theanine for this , and even yesterday after waking up with a horrible hangover , this stack seemed to have completely destroyed the issues I was having . <p> Anxiety . The theanine and caffiene combo are excellent combatants of anxiety . It works absolutely well , and if you have to a do a presentation that does n't go beyond reading some paper , this shit will do you damn well . I think this is why many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So gentlemen , I know this thread is half dead , but I thought I 'd give my more balanced opinion of theanine . I still enjoy the substance and recommend it to anyone who wants to just fuck around and chill and get creative projects done , but there are minor issues I encountered . Nothing serious or life threatening , but things that may or may not kill your motivation in some respects . <p> Quote:Cost wise , I spent $11 for 50 100mg caps .

Do not answer that question with your boastful words . Show me the truth within you with habits . To quote Baltasar Gracian , The truth is generally seen , rarely heard ' .

Do not be disappointed with your shortcomings . Instead , be pleased for your failings for you have found within you a journey that is ready to be undertaken . Let that journey be known as self-improvement . I shake my head in pity at the many souls who can see their self-perceived beauty in their reflections but do not see the blemishes in their characters . Many mistakes you have made so far in life and many more you shall make in the near and distant future . With every person that is alive , I hold a chain that is wrapped around each of you . Without warning , I will pull these chains and drag you for an untold amount of time and I will drag you deep into terrifying depths . How far are you willing to go for a chance with my dear sister Success ? Will the efforts you make be enough to resist the pulls of my chains ? Will you be able to climb out of the depths I drag you through ? <p> In any competition , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , we are present elsewhere . I adore my dear sister Success like a good brother should but I can not be biased with her . I will say this : She is no different than any other woman . Within her is a hypergamous trait which causes her to bless only the best contestants with her presence . Other contestants feel their hearts drop at their losses and their hearts turn bitter within my presence . My dear sister Success has often been complimented for her stunning good looks and many have fantasized about her . Other men envy a man with an attractive woman by his side . Similarly , other men envy a man with success . However , listen to what I have to say next . A word of warning to all who listens to my words : My dear sister Success is fickle and gets bored very easily . One day , she is with this person . Another day , she is with another . Many dream of overnight successes . Some reach the peaks of the mountains they climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laurels ! If you do not continue your efforts after achieving success , if you get too comfortable with my dear sister Success ' presence , she will leave you for another . <p> Listeners , <p> For my closing words , let it be remembered of all that I have said to you today . Have hope in all that you do . Without hope , what other reason would there be to live ? Learn from experience . I am harsh and I am strict . To be honest , I understand if you do not like me . I am not a fan of myself either . Despite that , I know my presence is a necessity to all of you . My advice to everyone : Be a better man than the day before whether stronger , faster , smarter or wiser . If you choose the easy way out of all the hardships placed before you , if I see that your souls have admitted defeat before me , then I will not show a single drop of sympathy for you . However , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see the fire of determination burning deep within your souls , then perhaps I might make a mention of your name and efforts to my dear sister Success . If you interest her enough and spark her curiosity , then my dear sister Success shall visit you . Godspeed.

Oneitis is quite simply put , an emotional reaction to a relationship with a girl , whether real or imagined . <p> I included imagined in the definition because some men grow attached and put a certain girl on a pedestal who theyve never even been in a relationship with . Remember that special girl in high school who you fawned over ? You thought she was the most pretty and unique woman in the world and you grew infatuated with having the chance to be with her ?

This is dangerous territory to be in and I 'll explain why . <p> As you are increasingly with a girl spending time together , having sex and living life , you get dopamine hits in your brain in the early stages of the relationship . This can lead to feelings of falling in love and a bond is created , whether a real bond or imagined . A man can start to rely on the woman for those happy feelings ( i.e. dopamine hits ) . There have been studies done that show sex and infatuation can provide hits much like doing hard drugs . Once you get hooked on the girl , guess what ? Yep , you guessed it .

While the girl could be getting addicted to you as well ( there have been studies showing after frequent sex with the same man , a girls body will actually crave that same man sexually ) , the reality is that the average mans behavior becomes needy and dependent , both of which turn a girl off sexually and emotionally . <p> In my case , I invested so much time , energy , money and emotions into a girl who was n't even worthy , nor ready for a LTR , that when she dumped me , it crumbled my world . <p> This is my point : slow down , get to know the girl slowly , think with your cranium and not your cock , limit your time with her , and make her invest more into it than you. - While there 's no magic formula that I 'm going to drop on you , because time is the greatest healer , I am going to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get over your ex diminish . <h> Getting Over Your Ex : What The Hell To Do ? <p> There are multiple steps involved with this process and every single one of them are necessary .

@@96059123 @259123/ <p> While trying to work on some bar/night club ' game ' this weekend , I used my lack of good body language to an advantage .. it was working quite well for a while . <p> See , I have a problem getting out of work mode ( as a cop ) ... so I 'll often(always) stand around like I 'm surveying the place for problems , trouble makers , etc . Generally its a turn off to the women , but I 'm working on catching when women are eyeballing me and trying to make approaches out of my situation . <p> So , I see a couple of cute women looking me over &amp; doing some texting &amp; taking pictures of each other on their cell phones . This continued a few minutes , then I read " bouncer " on the lips of one to another as they had another glance and a smile or two in my direction . <p> I mustered up the balls to approach , using this ' stand off-ish ' body language of mine to tell them something along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce the ' no cell phone on the dance floor ' policy ( in a more humorous way that that , lol ) . I gave her a stern warning about it ... and went back to ' watching ' .... the two of them made their way back to where I was and started dancing close - the short girl stepped on my toes , so she got in trouble for that one too ... I told her that was #2 warning and not to " push her luck , or she 's in trouble " ... her response was " I 'm not afraid of you " with a cute smile &amp; glimmer in her eye .. I smiled back at her .. but my mind went blank for some return banter . <p> Damn . <p> Needless to say , the conversation went downhill ( read : tame/lame/typical ) from there ... I ended up having some less than witty conversation with a couple of married ladies instead .... <p> Thoughts ? <p> ---- update ---- <p> As I finished reading some other emails from various ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came in today that answered my question above -- rather than ' continue ' the banter and risk running into a dead end like I did , end the banter ... and change up the situation a bit : <p> " You know , this banter is pretty fun ... Still , I 'm wondering if you 're just another one of " those " girls - or if you 've got something else going on in there . I suspect you do ... I 'd really like to know what it is . " <p> How do women react when you tell them you 're a cop . Some women love that sort of thing whilst others would n't be so hot on the idea . <p> Anyway ... I thought the natural progression would have been to dance with the girl who liked you most and then worked your way into a position where you two could kiss ... if she 's willing of course .

Pressure is not on . You do n't need to be the wittiest guy out there . No perfect banter line is going to do it . <p> You simply have to continue the conversation in a way that 's really honest , because you 've created some tension there , and the fact is she wants to know you 're not a creep .

The cool banter can only come for so long . Push and pull .

@@96059130 @259130/ <p> While Dale Carnegie 's most famous and enduring book is How to Win Friends and Influence People ( check out this excellent summary ) this somewhat overlooked gem is one of his most important works . <p> Life inevitably brings with it problems and stress . When this book was written , Carnegie 's generation had been through the Great Depression , World War II , and the post-war boom . Nowadays in these advanced times people still go through , much like before , times of business setbacks , illness , family troubles , and many other hardships . <p> This book 's ultimate message is that the worry and anxiety created by all of life 's challenges can be controlled . Not only that , worry is optional . If we wish to live with happiness , and peace of mind , we must first deal with worry before we tackle our problems . <p> I have to admit , I was constantly cracking up while reading this book . If there is one drawback , it 's that it is written in a very old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the advice in the book is n't good , it is , but even when Dale Carnegie recounts experiences from people who have been through war , illness , and economic hardship , his language comes through as overly peppy and platitudinous . I think that the Looney Tunes and Tex Avery were making fun of the way this guy wrote and spoke ! : tongue : <p> The following is a chapter-by-chapter summary . While I have written this summary in a way that it succinctly summarizes the main ideas , I recommend reading the entire book because it contains so many more stories and situations and tiny nuances : <p> PART ONE : FUNDAMENTAL FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT WORRY <p> Rule 1 : Live in Day-Tight Compartments Twenty-one words written by Thomas Carlyle over 200 years ago : " Our main business is not to see what lies dimly in the distance , but to do what is clearly at hand . " <p> Sir William Osler , a famous physician who help found the John Hopkins School of Medicine , would share this wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best possible way to prepare for tomorrow is to concentrate with all your intelligence , all your enthusiasm , on doing today 's work superbly today . That is the only possible way you can prepare for the future . <p> Ted Bengermino , a man who worked at the Graves Registration in the US Army during World War II , was always nervous and worried during his job . He was so worried that , out of extreme pain in his stomach caused by the stress , he lost weight and had to be hospitalized . An army doctor gave him this advice : " I want you to think of your life as an hourglass . You know there are thousands of grains of sand in the top of the hourglass ; and they all pass slowly and evenly through the narrow neck in the middle . Nothing you or I could do would make more than one grain of sand pass through this narrow neck without impairing the hourglass . You and I and everyone else are like this hourglass . When we start in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must accomplish that day , but if we do not take them one at a time and let them pass through the day slowly and evenly , as do the grains of sand passing through the narrow neck of the hourglass , then we are bound to break our own physical and mental structure . One grain of sand at a time , one task at a time . " <p> You and I are standing this very second at the meeting place of two eternities : the vast past that has endured forever , and the future that is plunging on to the last syllable of recorded time . We ca n't possibly live in either of those eternities . <p> The French philosopher Montaigne summed up the worries of his life : " My life has been full of terrible misfortunes , most of which never happened . " <p> From Jesus Christ 's Sermon of the Mount : " Take therefore no is the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mentally Prepare Yourself William H. Carrier was an engineer who began the entire air-conditioning industry . When he was a young man , he had to install a gas-cleaning device at a plate-glass plant . Since this was a new and relatively untested device , difficulties arose and the machine did n't work well enough . His job was in jeopardy . Since he was also extremely worried , his health was also in jeopardy . This is the magic formula William H. Carrier came up with to solve his worry problems : <p> Ask yourself " What is the worst that can possibly happen if I do n't solve my problem ? ' <p> Prepare yourself mentally to accept the worst - if necessary <p> Calmly try to improve upon the worst - which you have already mentally agreed to accept . <p> These were his answers to this gas-cleaning dilemma : <p> The worst that could have happened , was that he could lose his job . <p> Even though this could make him lose his job , he could always get another position . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by this untested device would cost his employers twenty thousand dollars Confronting this reality brought Carrier a peace of mind that he had not felt in days . <p> Now that he knew the worst , he focused his energies on improving upon the worst . He came to the conclusion that his employers had to spend some more money to make the gas-cleaning device work properly . Instead of losing money , his employers made profit . <p> Carrier used this same formula for the rest of his life every time a stressful problem came up . The reason , Carrier explains , this simple three-step formula worked so well : " Be willing to have it so , because acceptance of what has happened is the first step in overcoming the consequence of any misfortune . When we have accepted the worst , we have nothing more to lose . And that automatically means - we have everything to gain ! " <p> Rule 3 : Learn to Handle Worry for Your Health 's Sake Extreme worry and nervous stress affects us physiologically - especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will experience is stomach ulcers . Worry is also indirectly linked to high blood pressure , swings in blood sugar , the common cold , high blood pressure , arthritis , heart disease and many other ailments . <p> Dr. Israel Bram , who specialized in thyroid conditions , gave this advice/prescription to his patients : " Relaxation and Recreation - The Most relaxing recreating forces are a healthy religion , sleep , music , and laughter , Have faith in God - learn to sleep well - love good music - see the funny side of life - and health and happiness will be yours . <p> Dr. Alexis Carrel , a specialist in heart disease , had this to say : " Businessmen who do not know how to fight worry die young . " <p> Olga K. Jarvey from Idaho was able to conquer life-threatening cancer by first conquering worry . When she first got got cancer , all she could do was cry . How could she not ? This was a death sentence . She eventually decided , with some encouraging words from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . That doctor gave her these words of encouragement : " face the facts : quit worrying then do something about it . " When circumstances seemed to be at their bleakest , she forced herself to smile . By deciding to carry a cheerful mental attitude Olga eventually and miraculously beat cancer . <p> PART TWO : BASIC TECHNIQUES IN ANALYZING WORRY Rule 1 : Get the Facts The following 3-step formula is used to solve worries by using logic and objective analysis to solve problems : <p> Get the facts <p> Analyze the facts <p> Arrive at a decision - and then act on that decision <p> Oftentimes , many of our worries come from ignorance and confusion . Sometimes they come from delusion , or from holding on to beliefs or attitudes that are best dropped - Google " sunken cost fallacy " for examples of foolish consistency and persistence . <p> Herbert E. Hawks , one of the deans of Columbia University , had this to say : " If a man will devote his time to securing facts in an impartial , objective way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . " <p> Thomas Edison : " There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the labor of thinking . " <p> Here is a great video by Aaron Clarey who advocates a similar method : <p> Rule 2 : After Carefully Weighing All the Facts , Come to a Decision Galen Litchfield , who worked as the manager for the Asia Life Insurance Company in Shanghai during WWII , had to assist the Japanese during the invasion . He had to assists a Japanese admiral liquidate assets . Litchfield left out a block of securities worth 750k by mistake . The Japanese admiral was told this and was furious . Litchfield was at risk of being sent to " the Bridgehouse " - a notorious torture chamber where several of his colleagues died . In response , he did what he always did in whenever he was worried . He took out his typewriter and wrote down these two questions and the two steps that followed : <p> What am I worrying about ? <p> What can I do about it ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision <p> These are the answers he came up with : <p> I 'm afraid I will be thrown into the Bridgehouse . <p> He thought of several things such as escaping from Shanghai , explain to the Japanese admiral , stay in his room or show up to work as if nothing happened . <p> He decided to show up to work as if nothing happened . <p> When he came in the Japanese admiral was kind of shocked to see him , but did nothing . The admiral soon left to Tokyo and Litchfield got through the war unscathed . <p> Instead of letting worry get to him , Litchfield acted immediately on his worries and probably saved his own life , both in the short-term and long-term . He used this same 4-step formula for the rest of his life and it kept him mostly free of worry . <p> Rule 3 : Once a Decision is Carefully Reached , ACT ! Litchfield on making prompt decisions : " Experience has proved to me , time after time , the enormous value at arriving at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , the inability to stop going around and round in maddening circles , that drives men to nervous breakdowns and living hells . I find that fifty percent of my worries vanishes once I arrive at a clear , definite decision ; and another forty percent usually vanishes once I start to carry out the decision . " <p> Rule 4 : A Simple Set of Questions to Eliminate Worry Frank Bettger , one of the top insurance salesmen in America , reduced his worries and multiplied his income . Early in his career he began to despise his work and felt discouraged . He was working too much and was burning out . He was always in meetings and interviews with prospects . He wrote down and answered these questions : <p> What is the problem ? <p> What is the cause of the problem ? <p> What are all the possible solutions ? <p> What is the best solution ? <p> His answers : <p> With prospects , he was wasting too much time and energy on interviews and follow-up phone calls that went nowhere . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures of his job . <p> He discovered that seventy percent of his sales sales were closed within the first interview . Twenty-three-percent had been closed on the second interview . Even fewer were closed on subsequent interviews . He was wasting half of his time on business that accounted for less than seven percent of all sales . <p> Cut all visits past the second interview . <p> The results ? He doubled his income and eventually became the best insurance salesman in the country . It was only by objectively analyzing his problems that he was able to conquer them . <p> PART THREE : HOW TO BREAK THE WORRY HABIT BEFORE IT BREAKS YOU <p> Rule 1 : Get Busy Winston Churchill during WWII : " I 'm too busy . I have no time for worry . " <p> How does keeping busy drive out worry and anxiety ? It is utterly impossible for the human mind , no matter how brilliant , to think of more than one thing at any given time . <p> During WWII , soldiers came back shell-shocked and nervous wrecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " occupational therapy . " In other words they kept them busy to cure them . Every hour of every day was filled with activity - fishing , hunting , sports , arts and crafts , and dancing - to crowd out worry from their minds . <p> If you are not busy when worried then thoughts of worry , fear , jealousy , hate and envy will crowd your mind and will crowd out thoughts of peaceful and happy thoughts . Keep busy . The worried person must lose himself in action , lest he wither in despair . <p> Admiral Byrd discovered this principle when he had to live in Antarctica . He spent five months in bitter cold and darkness . Out of necessity , he became an anal-retentive neurotic . He would fix and tinker with things around his station for hours on end . It was the only way to keep sane . Byrd said this about his habits during that time : " It brought an extraordinary sense of command over myself without that the days would have been without purpose ; and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , in disintegration . " <p> Rudyard Kipling , author of The Jungle Book and the man who wrote " if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs " , forgot his own advice when he had a long , petty feud with his brother-in-law , Beatty Balestier . He was his wife 's brother and he and Kipling had been best friends . The Kiplings bought an estate from Balestier in Vermont , with the understanding that Balestier would be allowed to cut hay off each season . One day , Balestier found Kipling lying in the flower garden in this hay field . It was this tiny little transgression that led to one of the most famous and long-lasting feuds in Vermont 's history . Rudyard Kipling and his wife eventually abandoned the property , and never spoke with Balestier ever again . <p> Let 's not allow ourselves to be upset by small things we should despise and forget . Remember " Life is too short to be little . " <p> Rule 3 : Use the Law of Averages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution company in New York , worried himself sick with stomach ulcers over unlikely events . Every day , train carts loaded with oranges and grapefruit would depart from Florida and head to New York . Jim Grant worried for each and every single cartload . He worried that the cars would break down , a train wreck , or a bridge collapsing . The reality was that in the many years he had been in business only five out of twenty-five thousand cars had been wrecked . To be clear , Grant worried about something that had a one-in-five-thousand chance of actually occurring . When he figured out how silly he was to worry over extremely unlikely occurrences , he stopped worrying and also stopped having stomach ulcers . " Let 's examine the record . " Let 's ask ourselves : What are the chances , that this event I am worrying about will ever occur ? " <p> Rule 4 : Co-operate with the Inevitable Elizabeth Connley from Portland , Oregon , had a nephew who was killed at the very end of the war . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner and die of sadness . While clearing out her desk , she found an old letter from her nephew . In the letter , the nephew wrote to Connely after her mother died . The nephew wrote about how Connley 's positive attitude inspired him to " smile and take whatever comes , like a man . " Inspired by that old letter , Connley decided to move on and carry on . She knew and fully accepted that the circumstance was beyond her power to change or revise . She went on to live a fuller and more complete life . She learned that we must learn to cooperate with the inevitable . " It is so ; it can not be otherwise . " <p> King George V of England framed these words on the wall of his library of Buckingham Palace : " Teach me neither to cry for the moon nor over spilt milk . " <p> The late Schopenhauer : " A good supply of resignation is of first importance in providing for the journey of life . " <p> The famous prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serenity To accept the things I can not change , The courage to change the things I can ; And the wisdom to know the difference <p> Rule 5 : Put a " Stop-Loss Order " on Your Worries A stop-loss order as defined by Investopedia : " An order placed with a broker to sell a security when it reaches a certain price . A stop-loss order is designed to limit an investor 's loss on a position in a security . Although most investors associate a stop-loss order only with a long position , it can also be used for a short position , in which case the security would be bought if it trades above a defined price . A stop-loss order takes the emotion out of trading decisions and can be especially handy when one is on vacation or can not watch his/her position For example , if you own shares of ABC Co. , which is currently trading at $50 , and want to hedge against a big decline , you could enter a stop-loss order to sell your ABC holdings at $48 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If ABC trades below $48 , your stop-loss order is triggered and converts into a market order to sell ABC at the next available price . If the next price if $47.90 , your ABC shares would be sold at $47.90 . " <p> Stop-loss orders do n't just apply to stocks and bonds . We should place stop-loss on all kinds of things and circumstances in life . <p> A game example : any a time a girl picks up her smartphone or starts texting during a date , get up and walk away . If a girl has n't had sex with you by the third date , drop her completely . <p> Henry David Thoreau in Walden : " The cost of a thing is the amount of what I call life , which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run . " To put it another way : " we are fools when we overpay for a thing in terms of what it takes out of our very existence . " <p> Abraham Lincoln , when some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have more of a feeling of resentment than I have . Perhaps I have too little of it ; but I never thought it paid . A man does n't have the time to spend half his life in quarrels . If any man ceases to attack me , I never remember the past against him . " <p> When Dale Carnegie was in his thirties , he decided he wanted to be a novelist . He spent two years living cheaply in Europe writing his novel . It was a failure ; the reception for it was cold and indifferent . His literary agent told him that he had no talent for fiction . Carnegie was heartbroken and worried about what to do next . After weeks of thinking it over he decided to see those two years as nothing more than a noble experiment . He returned to his old job of organizing and teaching adult education classes . He wrote non-fiction in his spare time . <p> Decide just how much anxiety a thing may be worth - and refuse to give it anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Paul Brandwine , a high school teacher in New York , taught his students a valuable lesson about worrying about things that have already happened . One day in the science lab put a bottle of milk at the edge of a sink . His class looked at it with anticipation . Brandwine swept the bottle and made it crash in the sink . He shouted : " Do n't cry over spilt milk ! Take a good look because I want you to remember this lesson for the rest of your lives . The milk is gone - you can see it 's down in the drain ; and all the ussing and hair-pulling in the world wo n't bring back a drop of it . With a little thought and prevention , that milk might have been saved . But it 's too late now - all we can do is write off , forget it , and go on to the next thing . " <p> Fred Fuller Shedd , editor of the Philadelphia Bulletin said the following when speaking to a college graduating class : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of you have ever sawed sawdust ? Of course , you ca n't saw sawdust ! It 's already sawed ! Same with the past . When you start worrying about things that are over and done with , you 're merely trying to saw sawdust . " <p> William Shakespeare : " Wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss , but cheerily seek how to redress their harms . " <p> So why waste tears ? Of course , we have been guilty of blunders and absurdities ! And so what ? Who has n't ? Even Napoleon lost one third of all the important battles he fought . Perhaps our batting average is no worse than Napoleon 's . Who knows ? <p> Rule 1 : Fill Your Mind With Thoughts of Peace , Courage , Health , and Hope Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius : " Our life is what our thoughts make of it . " <p> One student of Carnegie 's , who goes unnamed , was eaten by insecurities . He worried that he was too thin , that no girl would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . Because of all his worries , he had a nervous breakdown . He then decided to take a trip to Florida . He thought that a change of scenery and environment would be the solution to his problems . His loving father gave him a letter in an enclosed envelope , ordering him not to open it until he was in Florida . His life in Florida was just as bad , if not worse , than it was back at home . Holding on to his Father 's letter , he opened it and this what his Father wrote : " Son , you are 1500 miles from home , and you do n't feel any different , do you ? I knew you would n't , because you took with you the one thing that is the cause of all your trouble , that is , yourself . There is nothing wrong with either your body or your mind . It is not the situations you have met with that have thrown you ; it is what you think of these situations . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you realize that , son , come home , for you will be cured . " <p> The son resisted his father 's words of wisdom for a while , but eventually returned home and went back to his old job . Months later , he was finally married and did well in his work , going from a night foreman of a small department to becoming a superintendent of a carton manufacturer in charge of over four hundred and fifty people . The only thing he changed was " the focus of the lens of the camera which was my mind . " <p> English author/poet , John Milton : " The mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heaven of Hell , a hell of Heaven . " Develop a mental attitude that will bring you peace and happiness . Think and act cheerfully and you will feel cheerful <p> Rule 2 : Do n't Waste Time Thinking About People You Do n't Like We may not be saintly enough to love our enemies , but , for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive them and forget them . <p> Confucius : " To be wrong or robbed is nothing unless you continue to remember it . " <p> General Eisenhower 's son , John , on his father 's resentments : " He never wastes a minute thinking about people he does n't like . " <p> Laurence Jones , a black preacher and teacher who taught in the poorest most backward parts of Mississippi in 1918 , was once threatened with being lynched . He came down to this part of the country to teach poor and illiterate black men who wanted to get ahead in life . Since this was toward the end of the First World War , there was a rumor that spread that said German were inciting blacks into rebellion . The white locals thought that Laurence Jones was a traitor or spy who tried to incite rebellion in his black students . Then one day an angry mob of white men decided they wanted to lynch him and burn him alive . They dragged him up the town 's road to a spot where they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did , and in the process gave a rousing speech , recounting his life story . Fortunately for Jones , the white men decided to let him off the hook . He continued teaching . When asked afterward if he was resentful toward the men who wanted to hang and burn him , he answered : " I have no time to quarrel , no time for regrets , and no man can force me stoop low enough to hate him . " He was too busy with his cause to hate - too absorbed in something bigger than himself and persecute you . " <p> Let 's never try to get even with our enemies , because if we do we will hurt ourselves far more than we hurt them . Rule 3 : Do n't Worry About Ingratitude Instead of worrying about ingratitude , let 's expect it . If we go around expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartaches . <p> Marcus Aurelius : " I am going to meet people today who talk too much - people who are selfish , egotistical , ungrateful . But I wo n't be surprised or disturbed , for I could n't imagine a world without such people . <p> Jesus healed ten lepers in one day - and only one thanked him . Why should we expect more gratitude than Jesus ? <p> The only way to find happiness is not to expect gratitude - but to give for the joy of giving . There are thousands of people who are i 'll from ingratitude , loneliness , and neglect . They long to be loved ; but the only way in this world that they can ever hope to be loved is to stop asking for it and to start pouring out love without hope of return . <p> Let 's remember that gratitude is a " cultivated " trait ; if we want our children to be grateful , we must train them to be grateful . <p> Rule 4 : Count Your Blessings Harold Abbott , Dale Carnegie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . He ran a grocery store in Webb City which closed . He was also in a huge amount of debt that would take years to pay off . One day while walking to the bank for a loan , full of worries , grievances and self-pity , he came across a man without legs who was otherwise cheerful and confident . This brief meeting made him realize how lucky he was and how he was amazingly wealthy . Abbott pasted the following words on his bathroom mirror : " I had the blues because I had no shoes , until upon the street , I met a man who had no feet . " <p> The words " Think and Thank " are inscribed in many of the Cromwellian churches of England . Think of all we have to be grateful for , and thank God for all our boons and bounties . <p> Dr. Samuel Johnson : " The habit of looking on the best side of every event is worth more than a thousand pounds a year .

" <p> Rule 5 : Do n't Imitate Others ; Be Yourself Angelo Petri , an expert on child training , says : " Nobody is so miserable as he who longs to be somebody and something other than the person he is in body and mind . " <p> When Dale Carnegie first came to New York from Missouri he enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts . He had a plan for success : study some of the best actors of his day and try and imitate their best points . This plan failed . Years later when writing his first book on public speaking , he tried to copy a whole bunch of writers . He tossed that manuscript - a year 's worth of work - into the trash and started from scratch with the intention of being himself in his writing .

" <p> And now for a musical intermission . Check out Gershwin 's " Rhapsody in Blue " if you have n't already : <p> Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in Self-Reliance : " There is a time in every man 's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance ; that imitation is suicide ; that he must take himself for better , for worse , as his portion ; that though the wide universe is full of good , no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till . The power which resides in him is new in nature , and none but he knows what that is which he can do , nor does he know until he has tried .

" <p> Napoleon Hill : " Every adversity , every failure , every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit . " <p> The author Harry Emerson Fosdick in his book , The Power to See It Through wrote : " The north wind made the Vikings .

" <p> Doing a good deed every day will cause us to stop being so wrapped up in ourselves : the very thing that produces worry , fear , and melancholia . <p> William Lyon Phelps , a professor at Yale University , had a few habits that brightened the lives of the people in his life : " I never go into a hotel or barbershop or a store without saying something agreeable to everyone I meet .

When the steward finally got around to handing me a menu , I said : ' the boys back there cooking in that hot kitchen certainly must be suffering today . ' The steward began to curse .. ' Good God Almighty , ' he exclaimed , ' people come in here and complain about the food . They kick about the slow service and growl about the heat and prices . I have listened to their criticisms for nineteen years and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sympathy for the cooks back there in the boiling kitchen . I wish to God we had more passengers like you . ' The steward was astounded because I had thought of the cooks as human beings and not merely as a cog in the organization of a great railway . What people want is a little attention as human beings . " <p> Chinese proverb : " A bit of fragrance always clings to the hand that gives you roes . " <p> Benjamin Franklin : " When you are good to other you are best to yourself . " Forget yourself by becoming interested in others . Every day do a good deed that will put a smile of joy on someone 's face . <p> PART 5 : THE PERFECT WAY TO CONQUER WORRY Dale Carnegie 's parents were always struggling . Money was always tight , debts were ever-accumulating , and worst of all their endeavors were always met with bad luck . Carnegie 's father , after ten years of all this torment , was seriously considering suicide . What kept him alive was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if they kept a steady faith in God that everything would turn out alright . In the end , everything eventually did . Carnegie 's father lived to the ripe old age of eighty-nine . <p> Some of you might be a little annoyed with this section . Believe me , I am no fan of organized religion . Nonetheless , I do believe in a greater power . It can go by any name - God , Divine Providence , the Universe , the Tao , Presence . Carnegie in all honesty is quite reasonable with his faith : " No man has ever been able to explain the mysteries of the universe - the mystery of life . We are surrounded by mysteries .. The fact that I do n't understand the mysteries of prayer and religion no longer keeps me from enjoying the richer , happier life that religion brings . " <p> Automobile tycoon Henry Ford , when asked if he ever worried : " No . I believe God is managing affairs and that He does n't need any advice from me . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for the best in the end . So what is there to worry about ? " <p> John Baillie , a distinguished theology professor at the University of Edinburgh , on what makes a good Christian : " What makes a man a Christian is neither his intellectual acceptance of certain idea , nor his conformity to a certain rule , but his possession of a certain spirit , and his participation in a certain Life . " <p> Dr. Carl Jung : " During the past thirty years , people from all the civilized countries of the earth have consulted me . I have treated hundreds of patients . Among all my patients in the second half of life - that is to say , over thirty-five - there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life . It is safe to say that every one of them fell i 'll because he had lost that which the living religions of every age have given to their followers , and none of them has been really healed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the non-religious can benefit from prayer in a practical way . <p> Davis Aurini made this interesting video about prayer : <p> PART 6 : HOW TO KEEP FROM WORRYING ABOUT CRITICISM <p> Rule 1 : Unjust Criticism is Often a Disguised Compliment . Many great men have had their fair number of bitter critics . Men like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson had men who practically denounced them as the devil 's representatives . <p> Ulysses S Grant , a general who fought for the Northern States in the American Civil War , was one of the key men behind the victory of the North . In 1862 , Grant won a decisive battle that ended the war . Six weeks after , Grant was arrested and his army was taken from him . He was arrested mostly because of the envy of his colleagues and superiors . <p> Schopenhauer : " Vulgar people take huge delight in the faults and follies of great men . " <p> Unjust criticism often means that you have aroused jealousy and envy . Remember that no one ever kicks a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Criticism Eleanor Roosevelt , the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt , had to learn how to handle unjust criticism . Early in her career , she was terrified of criticism . She asked Theodore Roosevelt 's sister for advice , and this is what she said : " Never be bothered by what people say , as long as you know in your heart you are right - for you 'll be criticized anyway . You 'll be damned if you do , damned if you do n't . " <p> Abraham Lincoln , on unjust criticism : " If I were to try and read , much less to answer , all the attacks made of me , this shop might as well be closed for any other business . I do the very best I know how - the very best I can ; and I mean to keep on doing so until the end . If the end brings me out all right , then what is said against me wo n't matter . If the end brings me out wrong , then ten angels swearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best you can ; and then put up your old umbrella and keep the rain of criticism from running down the back of your neck . <p> Rule 3 : Criticize Yourself First ; Keep a Record of All the Foolish Things You 've Done Elbert Hubbard : " Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day . Wisdom consists in not exceeding that limit . " <p> Walt Whitman : " Have you learned lessons only of those who admired you , and were tender with you , and stood aside for you ? Have you not learned great lessons from those who rejected you , and braced themselves against you , or disputed the passage with you ? " <p> E.H . Little , president of Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Soap Company , started out as a soap salesman for Colgate . At first , he was at risk of losing his job for his poor performance as a salesman . When he failed to make a sale , he would come back to the merchants and outright asked them for criticism : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I tried to sell you soap a few minutes ago ? Please give me your criticism . be frank . Do n't pull your punches . " <p> Rule 1 : Rest Before You Get Tired During World War II , Winston Churchill was famous for working sixteen hours a day , every single day . But during this time , he always found way to relax at his work . He worked in bed until eleven , and took two daily naps . He found a perfect way to prevent fatigue . <p> Eleanor Roosevelt , before meeting a crowd or making a speech , would sit down and relax for twenty minutes . <p> Thomas Edison slept whenever he wanted . <p> Henry Ford : " I never stand up when I can sit down ; and I never sit down when I can lie down . " <p> The US Army had its infantryman rest once every hour for ten minutes . <p> Rule 2 : Learn to Relax at Your Work Psychiatrist Dr. A. A. Brill said : " One hundred percent of the fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological factors , by which we mean emotional factors . What kinds of emotional factors tire the sedentary ( or sitting ) worker ? Joy ? Contentment ? No ! Never ! Boredom , resentment , a feeling of not being appreciated , a feeling of futility , hurry , anxiety , worry - those are the emotional factors that exhaust the sitting worker , make him susceptible to colds , reduce his output , and send him home with a nervous headache . Yes , we get tired because our emotions produce nervous tensions in the body . " <p> William James in his essay " The Gospel of Relaxation " wrote : " The American overtension and jerkiness and breathlessness and intensity and agony of expression are bad habits , nothing more or less . Tension is a habit . Relaxing is a habit . And bad habits can be broken , good habits formed . " Four suggestions that will help you learn to relax : <p> Relax in odd moments . Let your body go limp like an old sock . Be like a cat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Work in a comfortable position and consciously relax your muscles . <p> As yourself a few times a day , " Am I making my work harder than it actually is ? Am I using muscles that have nothing to do with the work I am doing ? <p> At the end of the day , ask yourself , " Just how tired am I ? If you are tired it is n't because of mental work , because of the way you have done it . <p> Rule 3 : Apply These Four Good Working Habits1 . Clear your desk of all papers except those relating to the immediate problem at hand . 2 . Do things in the order of their importance . <p> Charles Luckman , who became president of the Pepsodent Company , said : " As far back as I can remember , I have gotten up at five o+lock in the morning because I can think better than any other time - I can think better then and plan my day , plan to do things in the order of their importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do first things first . His plan called for writing five pages a day . That plan inspired him to go right on writing five pages a day for nine heartbreaking years , even though he made a total of only thirty dollars in those nine years - about a penny a day . <p> 3 . When you face a problem , solve it then and there if you have the facts necessary to make a decision . <p> 4 . Learn to organize , deputize , and supervise . <p> Business executives who build up big businesses and do n't learn to delegate responsibilities to others are driven by a sense of hurry , worry , and anxiety , usually pop off with heart trouble in their fifties or early sixties - heart trouble caused by tension and worries . <p> Rule 4 : To Prevent Worry and Fatigue , Put Enthusiasm into Your Work Ms. Vallie G. Golden , a stenographer from Elmhurst , Idaho once had to do job that was a pain in the ass . She had to type a long letter over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many people who would kill for her job , so she decided that a change in her mental attitude was necessary : " I suddenly made up my mind to do my work as if I actually enjoyed it- even though I despised it . Then I made an important discovery : if I do my work as if I really enjoy it , then I do enjoy it to some extent . I also found I can work faster when I enjoy my work . So there is seldom any need now for me to work overtime . This new attitude of mine gained me the reputation of being a good worker . And when one of the department superintendents needed a private secretary , he asked me for the job - because , he said , I was willing to do extra work without being sulky ! " By talking to yourself every hour of the day , you can direct yourself to think thoughts of courage , happiness , thoughts of power and peace . By talking to yourself about the things you have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that soar and sing . <p> Keep reminding yourself that getting interested in your job will take your mind off you worries , and , in the long run , will probably bring promotion and increased pay . Even if it does n't do that , it will reduce fatigue to a minimum and help you enjoy your hours of leisure , Rule 5 : How to Stop Worrying About Insomnia Five rules to keep from worrying about insomnia : <p> If you ca n't sleep get up and work or read until you do feel sleepy . <p> No one was ever killed by lack of sleep - worrying about it causes more damage than the actual sleeplessness . <p> Try prayer <p> Relax your body ; take up meditation if necessary <p> Exercise to the point of exhaustion . <p> PART EIGHT : HOW I CONQUERED WORRY Even though this part is basically filler ( and therefore optional ) , the 31 stories in it show how Carnegie 's lessons and rules can be put to practical use . It demonstrates , on a case-by-case basis , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is my favorite story : <p> I Can Turn Myself into a Shouting Optimist Within an Hour by Roger W. Babson , famous Economist When I find myself depressed over present conditions , I can , within one hour , banish worry and turn myself into a shouting optimist . Here is how I do it . I enter my library , close my eyes , and walk to certain shelves , I reach for a book , not knowing whether I am picking up Prescott 's Conquest of Mexico or Suetonius ' Lives of the Twelve Caesers . With my eyes still closed , I open the book at random . i then open my eyes and read for an hour ; and the more I read , the more sharply I realize that the world has always been in the throes of agony , that civilization has always been tottering on the brink . the pages of history fairly shriek with tragic tales of war , famine , poverty , pestilence , and man 's inhumanity to man . After reading history for an hour , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are infinitely better than they used to be . this enables me to see and face my present troubles in their proper perspective as well as to realize that the world as a whole is constantly growing better . Read history ! Try to get the viewpoint of ten thousand years - and see how trivial YOUR troubles are , in terms of eternity !

Do you have a network of friends with whom you maintain good relationships , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Anytime I ever felt nihilistic about the game it was because there was something about myself I really did n't like or something about the state of affairs i was in that I had to reevaluate and eventually change . If this is the case for you ( and even if it is n't , there is always room for self-improvement even in the face of contentment ) you would probably be better served looking within and trying to better yourself rather than try to fill the void with sex . <p> Personally , I love , love , love the company of multiple feminine women . I love the contrast of their surrender/submission to my dominance . I also LOVE giving women multiple orgasms . It 's one of my greatest joys . This , of course , inevitably compels them to surrender/submit and become my willing servants . I LOVE THAT SHIT ! ! ! Those are some things that motivate me . <p> The whole " fucking different women wears off " thing is case-specific . I 've not yet tired of it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of fucking different women is a matter of declining health ; a healthy , youthful ( which should last a lifetime ) , virile man is built to want to fuck different women ... until death . <p> ALSO : A fulfilling sex life and powerful orgasms are essential for optimal mental/emotional health . So the " pure hedonistic pleasure " is a catalyst for a better quality of life . And again , seems to me a sign of an aberration in the organic functioning of the body to not seek healthy , " pure hedonistic pleasure . " <p> The desire for pickup and new partners is partly driven by the desire for novel experiences . When the experience is no longer novel , but predictable or played out , it 's less pleasurable . <p> The solution this is to change your game . The same way using the same line on a girl will eventually become boring , using the same pickup style , targeting the same type of girl , or seeking the same experiences will also eventually become boring . <p> Most one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty calorie connections " - it feels like you 're being nourished , but you 're not . When men start talking about all the ways they can please a woman he just smiles and says " ah , but how well does she please you ? " <p> Part of the struggle I 've noticed ( at least for me ) is finding women I respect , who can support me in more than just my need to get off . Many American women have rejected the feminine , and in doing so forgotten how to nurture men and support then in their purpose . <p> Masturbation is only a minor influence for my drive to bang women . It has always been determined by more intense emotions . Emotions of achievement or pride .

That 's become increasingly common since people are surrounded by technology all the time , but it 's also dysfunctional . Things like fucking , exercising , and eating properly are more essential than most people realize because they 're doing shit that truly is a " waste of time " like watching TV , playing video games , and pounding away at their phones . <p> Damn it , I 'm on the fence on whether I should go out tonight , I got two different voices in my head trying to talk me into/out of it . I have no wingman and the bars have been really tough lately , it could prove to be a suicide mission . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good nights sleep , etc. , but I will probably jerk off and get no pussy . If I go out , I spend money , drink alcohol and feel like shit tomorrow , but there is the off chance that I will meet a horny chick and I will get laid . <p> I think sex is a waste of time if you are n't necessarily having sex with the women you truly want to fuck , if she 's some mediocre 6 that you 're banging just because you are on a dry spell and want to bust a nut , it 's only a step above masturbation IMO . <p> That said , what it really boils down to is your time and your money , I 've gone out a bunch , spent a bunch on drinks , drained my energy levels in the pursuit of pussy only to go home with my dick in hand . At a certain point , you got to look at the return on investment , that said success always starts with an attempt . If you do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , and are on the path to being one of those MGTOW types that either just subsists off internet porn or does p4p to get pussy . <p> I 've actually thought of this quite a bit recently . I had very little sex in the beginning of my life and have had a lot of sex as of late but now it is kind of boring to me and I think I 'm ready to focus on improving my life and a few other things . <p> I think like most things a good balance is key . I was spending way too much time just focusing on getting laid and now that I have accomplished that I will focus on life improvement things while still balancing out a little game in my life so I do n't forget how to pick up girls . <p> I think it can help also focusing on going for better quality of girls . <p> I can definitely understand getting burnt out with having sex and the time and effort that goes into it . Even when it 's easy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave thread , and I 've been laughing out loud at some of the comments . <p> I understand and sympathize with what some of the guys here are saying . Sometimes you get a feeling of futility and pointlessness to the great quest , and it can get you down . Many guys wo n't admit it for pride reasons , but we all feel it from time to time . <p> We all feel it every now and then , and it is a feeling that has visited me at 3 or 4 in the morning on empty streets in big cities all over the world . I even tried to capture this feeling in a recent article for ROK called " A Night In Lapa " a few weeks ago . <p> But the good news is that the feeling will pass . Do n't get discouraged . Do n't make chasing pussy the end-all , be-all of your life . It is n't . Of course sex is a key part of the male identity . Of course getting laid is important . But you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make that your primary goal . The game will come , just take it easy and do n't get frustrated . <p> Expect to fail much more often than you succeed .

American women are not the measure of the world 's women . Try to focus on foreign women , and try to get outside the US , to really experience true femininity . <p> Thinking of myself as a Schopenhauer influenced misanthrope and sometimes as a nihilist I often question those self labels ..

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your own frame for the times you are asked to take a photo of a group of girls ? <p> If they are ugly/fat/old women , then take only one pic , it does no damage to you . If they start telling you to move/change the angle/lighting , then give them back the camera . <p> If it is a group of hotties , threin lies the dilemma . You gain nothing by taking the pic , as it is doubtfull will help you to isolate one girl later . Negating it will turn up their bitchy attitude since they have the strenght of numbers . <p> ( 11-07-2013 10:23 AM ) slothpiece Wrote : With the rampant narcissism of girls and their stupid Facebook and Instawhore , what are some ways you 've regained control after being asked to take a photo of a group of girls ?

Any suggestions for setting up your own frame for the times you are asked to take a photo of a group of girls ? <p> This shitty behavior is why years ago i stopped doing any favors for women I do n't know well .

Hell no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat you like a chump for helping them . ( elderly women excepted ) <p> Them : " Can you take our picture ? " <p> Me : " Nah " -smirk and backturn <p> I 've also taken the pic of their tits . Making them pose in ridiculous ways or taking a pic of yourself are also good . I read about one guy who would take the phone and start running as if he was going to steal it , making them scream . Pretty funny <p> I was out at a happy hour last month and a girl asked me to take a group pic , I did without a fuss . Then she asked if I was single and wanted to met her friend . I ended up getting her friends digits.so it could be a good thing .

Then you can start talking to them about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The correct response is " only if you take a picture with me first " . Taking a photo is a perfect way to start escalation and often times this is a girls way of opening you . <p> I was working and parked outside a club waiting for a call with the window down . This dude and his friend were chilling close to the line up but not actually in it . A solo girl was walking up to get in the line and he stopped her and they started talking . He touched her arm and she laughed . Next , he told his friend to take a picture of them probably 20 seconds into the interaction and he wrapped his arm around her shoulder . He then told his buddy to take another . He wrapped his hand around her waist and put his head against hers . The dude then said " were going to a party , your coming right ? " and they took off down the street . <p> This whole scene took under 2 minutes . The girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit jealous . Find any reason to start kino . <p> You can actually use is as an opportunity to escalate physically by posing th girls and moving them into place with your dominant hands . Then you can start talking to them about how you are a professional photographer who does fashion shoots etc . <p> I also feel like guys are way over thinking this , I had a girl ask me to take a picture of her and 6 girlfriends on a crowded Halloween dance floor a huge ADD no connection environment . I was polite and smiled . I isolated her by offering a shot while we chatted ( so fucking beta ) , she was grinding my dick like a champ with heavy making out and under skirt groping soon to follow . <p> I feel it is better to see women as opening you instead of trying to make you out to be a chump .

( smirk and get in the middle of the pic WITH them . Do n't ask , assume ) <p> The girls will collectively giggle and pose with you . <p> Have your buddy or grab a random person to take the pic . People are used to being asked and with dominate Frame 9/10 will take it . <p> Next Level Game <p> Girl : Can you take our pic ? <p> You : Nah , but they can .

@@96059140 @259140/ <p> Definition of frenemy - person or group that is friendly toward another because the relationship brings benefits , but harbors feelings of resentment or rivalry . <p> I am usually quick to cut off unloyal people from my life . Since i was a kid , i hardly ever gave a second chance to people who were unloyal to me . I come from a family where we have strong principles such as : somebody lends you something , you must give it back , somebody lends you money , you must pay it back , what is not yours , its not yours , you do n't  steal from friends or family or whoever invited you into their homes . As i grew older i always made sure that i was surrounded by people who i could trust , i never saw the point of hanging out with people who were unloyal to me . The older i get , the more i notice that the majority of people are unloyal , and that it is very hard to find people who are loyal , specially with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before and i have noticed that i have less people to hang out with comparing to years ago and less parties to attend ( before i was invited to a party every friday and saturday ) , i know part of that is because i am always travelling but i believe one of the main reason is that i cut off a LOT of people from my life . <p> Let me give a quick example : There was this dude that was my close friend for few years , he is probably the best player i have ever met and hanging out with him really got my game on some super level . We lived together for a year , fucked a lot of chicks , video recorded bitches , gangbanged house wives , we would back up each other whenever we got into a fight , he was very red pill about life and he brought a lot of value to my life . Then one day when i told him that i was going to travel for a while , i told him that he probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was packing his shit , he stole some stuff from my house ( cd , shorts and some other shit ) . I noticed that after few days of his departure , i called him and told him that he had 2 days to bring my shit back or we would have a serious problem . He brought most of my shit back and one thing that was missing he told me it was n't him , for me to look properly at my house . From that day i just thought " fuck this dude " , he lived in my house for a year , i did n't  even charge him rent ( the rent i was paying was very minimal anyway , no more than 100 dollars a month ) and this is the thank you i get , i am not hanging out with him again . <p> He tried to call me few times after that but i showed him that i had no interest in hanging out with him again . <p> I have this " friend " who challenged my approach last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off somebody from my life just because they were unloyal to me , he told me i may need these people again in the future . He told me i could just keep them as friends but trust them less , so if for example i lent somebody money and he did n't pay it back , next time he needs money again , i just do n't lend him anymore but we can still be friends . He also said " You know that a friend can steal something from your house ? Well , do n't  allow them to come into your house but you guys can hang out in clubs and shit like that " . <p> I wonder if my approach is somewhat distorted in relation to be quick to cut off people from my life . Many of you have more life experience than me , i would be glad if i could get some advice on this . <p> Is it better to hang out with a frenemy or get rid of them for good ? Of course the majority of fake friends are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually gives you value but fucked up some loyalty laws , is there an exception for that type of person ? <p> Note : I am not bitching about this , i just want to find out if I am taking the best approach on this . <p> Mods : I am putting on this section because i believe this is part of lifestyle management but feel free to move it on the everything else section if you believe that is the right section . <p> I 'm pretty ruthless about this type of thing . I have no patience for people I ca n't trust and do n't make room for these type of people in my life . I can see your friend 's point but it just seems like a political approach to life and I honestly would n't have the energy for it . 49876 @qwx909876 <p> I was taught ALL friend ships are based on using one another . Think about it ? Except for those childhood friends , most people form relations with people they get something from . When you no longer get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy clubbing with him , you are getting something from the relationship . NO reason NOT to be friends . But do n't consider him a trusted , like family friend.Pretty simple . That being said , you obviously missed the term " friends should n't be lenders , nor borrowers " . You really should n't lend people money . I am not talking about cab fare for a drunk friend who is short . Most guys i know who have to lend money to family , consider the money a gift . <p> I like where your head is at Pitt . Do n't  keep dishonest people around . But IF the guy brought everything back except 1 thing ? What makes you reluctant to give him the benefit of the dobut ? With close friends I give them the benefit of the doubt .

We have our own definition of friendship and it is n't a universal one . <p> My friend has helped me in many ways . Like I said , you are just seeing black and white much like most of society . I help people all the time I am not friends with . I do it because I want too not because I am their friend . I do n't expect anything from anyone unless they want to do it . That is why I do n't define my friendship based on what people do for me . I just sounds so narcissistic to look at a friendship that way . I just accept it for what it is and life is much easier because of it . <p> Once a thief , always a thief . Worthless group of people . I was taught to never lie , cheat or steal .

I will respect the jobless drunk 1000x more , even if he can be a royal pain in the ass . <p> My dad always told me if you can count your true brothers on one hand , that you are a lucky man .

I have stuff from my friends from years ago , they have my things , honestly I 'm not going to start go making threats and cutting people out of my life for stuff that is frankly immaterial in the big picture . It is n't a sign of disrespect , it 's a sign that people live busy lives , and a few obsolete CDs frankly is n't even worth the half hour it would take to find , let alone the time and gas to take them back . Maybe clothes get mixed up in the laundry . You went on a trip , they got mingled and then never found their correct spot .

Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na go try and kick someones ass over something like that ? This is the kind of thing where even if you win , you lose . <p> The fact you even brought up that you were n't charging him rent makes it sounds like you feel he owes you for letting him piggy back on your good housing deal . But you conveniently do n't feel you owe him for him getting your game to a super level ? People pay thousands of dollars for advice like that . <p> I kind of take the opposite tact . Generally believe people are honest , and give them the benefit of the doubt . It works good for me . <p> While I think there comes a time and place to cut people out of your life , I 'd suggest that you are jumping to conclusions way too quickly and people 's true intentions . <p> When I left room mates houses before its very possible that I took some of their DVDs or left some of mine there , or a pair of gym shorts , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that I 'm operating on a best guess system . To me it 's just not that big of a deal , and I 'm not going to put that much effort into it for what amounts to $50-$100 over a couple year relationship . Now if these guys called me up , started demanding petty things back , and making threats , I would give them back , and then probably cut them out of my life . Because they 'd have shown *them* selves as petty , whiney , and quick to make threats ( short fuse ) . Those are qualities in people I do n't need in my life . <p> I have a problem like this as well . In my friendship group of about 10 people there this one really tall , lanky guy ( 6ft 4 and very skinny ) who constantly gives me shit .

But , the Kamaki would n't exist without the sexual repression of the north . <p> Reasons for kamaki decline and gradual vanish during the ' 90s : 1 . AIDS epidemic really scared the shit out of everyone ( one small town in Rhodos has now a 5% AIDS the highest in Greece ) 2 . Gradual conservatization of northern European chicks after invasion of alien cultures to their countries 3 . Travels became much more common with result the loss of exotic effect from both men and women ( Scandinavian women got used to Mediteranean appearance by the hords of dark skinned men in their countries ) 4 .

Expansion of gayism to the extent that 50% of Greek guys are now suspicious.This is sth lots of foreign women complain about . 6 . Stag parties and expansion of stag culture in most touristic places which repelled many guys.In the past the women who came had a genuine interest for Greece and its people.Now they just book a last minute offer because it is cheap.They just want sea , sun and cheap booze . <p> Fun watch .

Besides , almost all Europe would fit inside Argentina , so travel and variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time you did not even need to speak conversational English to bang.Some simple sentences were enough.You did not need a car or fancy clothes , even not a room ( they banged girls on the beach ) . Now the modern day kamaki ( which is not a real kamaki anymore in the old sense ) needs to speak 3-4 languages , have a decent apartment , drive a car , have social circle , spend money on drinks , have a job related to tourist industry , sharpen his pick up skills and having to compete against international PUAs who come to these islands.He also needs to be well travelled and hit the gym during the winter before the tourist season arrives to be ready for the northern chicks . Fact is now when spring is in full force we are already out picking up.From November till April most kamakia sharpen their penises to guest the horny visitors from the North . <p> This sort of thing has been going on in Greece since ancient times , under different guises . Here , as in so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Periclean Greece , premarital chastity was in theory required for " respectable " women , but for unmarried men , the rule was pretty much " do as thou wilt . " Sexual license was accepted as a fact of life . The great festivals ( even though religious in origin ) were used as safety valves for mankind 's natural promiscuity . No stigma was attached to male promiscuity , provided one went about it the right way . <p> The pursuit of courtesans was a common diversion for young men . Women were actually divided into different classes for sexual accessibility . The lowest order were called " pornai " , who inhabited mostly brothels or some religious temples . A man could make a temporary " marriage " or bargain with them as he wished . <p> Next up in the ladder rung of women was the " auletrides " or " flute-players " who were a lot like the Japanese geisha of olden times . These were not common prostitutes ; a young Greek had to work to seduce them , and they were free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in poetry , music , and the art of conversation . <p> The highest class of woman available to the enterprising Greek male was the " hetairai .

The philosopher Aristippus achieved some status for seducing the famous courtesan Thais , who was highly sought after by other high-status men , such as Demosthenes and the philosopher Diogenes . <p> Hetairai were educated women , and enjoyed a generally high standing in Athenian society . The plays of Aristophanes leave no doubt that relations between the sexes were just as contentious then as they are now . A man needed what we now call " game " to dodge the traps set for him by wily hetairai and conniving male competitors . <p> Italian guys were doing it for ages too : - call themselves Pappagellos - parrots , which is in a way a hint towards smooth talking and maybe a bit of peacocking . <p> While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male sexuality - it actually shows a guy with a 1000+ notch count who has been smashing tourist girls all his life .

In one Kamaki video a guy said " The worst thing a man can do is not have sex when a girl wants it . " So they 're going by boner test only .

If you go off your feet you are in a lot of trouble . <p> Best shit to learn for self defense is boxing . Once you can handle yourself a bit there , then take up a combat system like Krav Maga .

It 's not the end all be all of martial arts , and in an altercation you may still very well get fucked up . <p> In terms of grappling and self defense skills , it 's what you make of it . Unless you 're a natural and/or very gifted , it takes a long long time to become proficient . But if you are in a 1 on 1 fight with an unarmed attacker , I 'm sure most blue belts would do pretty well even if the attacker was bigger and stronger . Since most guys do n't know much beyond throwing a haymaker . <p> The attrition rate for BJJ is ridiculously high . Injuries , ego , job , family , kids , girls , whatever can easily get in the way . You need to really make a commitment and tell yourself that you are going to be pretty much training for life . As far as injuries , yes they do happen . They are n't that bad and are probably equal to other ' contact ' sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners are and how hard you train . A lot of injuries happen because of ego ( Fuck this I 'm not going to tap , shit my elbow just popped ) If you decide to do it train at your pace , and leave your ego at the door . If you make every roll like it 's the final round of the mundials , you 're going to be riddled with injuries . <p> Martial arts with groin strikes , head butts , biting , etc. are theoretically more dangerous . But what ends up happening is that when you train you water down the moves and go light so you can practice them on your partner without hurting him . Thus , you never learn to go all out since that would cause serious injury to each other . And when it comes time to fight , you fight like you train . <p> The thing is about MMA styles is that you can practice them continuously to get the techniques down . BJJ 's innovation was not its techniques , since they 're all taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gracies wrote about how they tried to remove a lot of the dangerous stuff from jj out so you can grapple full strength every class . <p> Once you get the proper technique down , you can always just tweak the moves a little bit for street . Switching from kicking someone in the stomach to the nuts is not that hard . <p> I did Krav Maga between 2005-2010 , though I 'm out of shape now since I no longer train . I suggest that as a good compromise between learning some techniques that are effective and not needing too much time to be proficient . BJJ is good but it can take a decade to get your black belt . Not everyone has that much time to dedicate . In Krav , I was taught standup , clinching and ground game . Maybe not in the depth of someone doing each of those full-time training for the Octagon , but enough to feel like I can handle myself against some douche at a bar that wants to exchange fists . <p> So my suggestion is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , then branch out into other things if you are interested . I 'd like to get into boxing now . And maybe wrestling or judo since I feel that clinching and grappling is my biggest weak point . <p> Also realize that BJJ is more effective in competition than on the streets , because if you get in a fight in real life , there 's a good chance his friends are going to start stomping you once you take your opponent to the ground . There 's no way to defend against multiple attackers in BJJ . But if it 's purely one on one , BJJ is very effective . <p> There are tons of options out there . Really , complete fighter means longrange , shortrange , and takedown . Certain combinations mesh well in my experience ; the area of origin often helps define that , as various regions and areas have distinct styles and even different arts from the area will share many common points . <p> A common " Asian-inspired " routine : Kempo + Tae Kwan Do + Jujitsu . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten to higher ranks and really gotten experience , you can go further . <p> Alternative : Karate + Muay Thai + Judo . Kind of light with the hand-to-hand , but a bit heavier on legwork . Good if you 're leggy . <p> Krav Maga , Silat , the Russian art Sambo , and others are good too , but I 've not had as much experience with them so I ca n't really comment . Personally I use Kempo , Tang Soo Do , and Jujitsu . If you 're someone who really wants to finish a fight quick , learn power breaking too . There 's no more definitive end to a fight than a one-hit knockout . I can attest to this personally . <p> if we 're talking a one on one confrontation in the street , having trained anything at all set you apart from 99% of most people . if you 've trained a real striking art like boxing or muay thai , aside from being able to strike effectively , one of the biggest advantages will be knowing how to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , the best thing was that i was n't afraid of getting punched . <p> i 'd suggest that in most confrontations muay thai clinch work would be the most effective . someone swings , you avoid , grab them , control them and knee the shit out of them until they stop . <p> with a tight clinch game , you can control guys who are trained . with guys that have no idea what to do ? you can pretty much stop a fight right there . <p> I used to do tae-kwan-do for 2 years and i found that there were too many rules in fighting . No leg kicking , no punching , always keep distance , no knee strike . However , in tae-kwan-do they also teach you grappling techniques and how to defend yourself from people who hold knives or broken bottles . Those self defences were brilliant but there were definately more kicks involved . You wo n't break ribs , hurt yout knees , nor will you be asked to kick a tree all day to make youself stronger . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every week he came to the school with broken nose , knees hurting , generally a lot of bone injures . <p> In my limited experience in a really high pressure fight situation only the the first thing you do is concious , the rest is instinct so drill heavy impact moves to death and when training imagine various real world fight scenarios so your subconcious knows what to do . The most important part though is learn to spot trouble coming and make sure you land the first blow early . There is a wing chun saying that if a man want to fight he will come to you , in that case the second an aggressive person invades your space let it fly .

All in all , it 's something I have been toying with in the mind . <p> Also , I need regular lays and black bears just do n't cut it ( too bushy ) . But I am going to let that one simmer ... <p> A +1 from me Scotian . I also second the push for some of the young cats to read into this a lot more . <p> Like most Albertans I got a trade not far out of high school ( Metal Fabrication ) . I worked pipelines for six months , hated it , but I had almost $60,000 to show . I never went back to the patch . <p> A few journeyman I worked with on the coast went up there and I talk to friends now and then about the work . Sometimes it gets tempting ( after reading Scotians post for example ) and other times I just cant bring myself to go back to that lifestyle . <p> But young guys getting in there now will lead to as much work and cash as you can manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs pulling in $700 a day and was back in my Vancouver condo every night . Not as common in the cities but jobs for $35 an hour are very common . The trades are nothing to ignore these days . <p> If you do go the trades route , make sure to plan for the future . You do n't  want to be a 40yo tradesmen . I worked with too many bent , broken and miserable men to want to do it forever . <p> Scotian , you 're not the only blue collar guy on here . I worked on and off as a carpenter and tiler for nearly 8 years . I worked at a BMW dealership , as a taxi driver for a year and in a bread factory before landing n office job as a ( assistant ) buyer . I got lucky on that one . <p> I would be interested in a high paying job like this . Do you by any chance know if they hire foreigners . I 'm Dutch , we have good relationship with Canada since we many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 's . <p> I 've heard that working in the mines of Perth/Australia makes similar mad paper but they have strict laws on people above the age of 30 . <p> Anyway a +1 from me . <p> Book - Around the World in 80 Girls - The Epic 3 Year Trip of a Backpacking Casanova <p> My new book Famles - Fables and Fairytales for Men is out now on Amazon . <p> Glad to see some interest from you guys and nice to see that I 'm not the only one coming from a blue collar back ground . <p> There 's definitely some misconceptions about working in the trades or in industrial environments , remember that just because you get into a trade or into the oil biz , it does n't mean you 'll be doing that specific task forever . MANY guys start out as welders , then move up to supervisors or into management side of things , a lot of senior managers who make well into 6 figures and live in Edmonton/Calgary started out just like that , this is definitely an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make big $$$ on the way . <p> Moma , the examples I used in the OP are probably some of the shittier gigs ( remote camps ) , some of the sites are closer to the city of Fort Mac ( Suncor , Syncrude ) and many people stay in the city and communte ( 45mins-1hour each way ) , it really depends on the gig . <p> My last gig was sweet , they put me and a co-worker up in a nice furnished condo ( rents for $3500/month ) in the nice part of Fort Mac ( there is such a thing lol ) , gave us a brand new 2011 GMC truck to drive to work and gave us non taxable $60/day for food . So we could actually have a life , go out on weekends , I even had a FWB situation with a chick there for the last 3 months . <p> The best part is , employers are VERY flexible ! I walked into my boss 's office back in mid-October and said " I 'm taking the winter off and Dec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel until the spring " , his response , " cool , wish I could do that , take lots of pics and we 'll see you in April " . <p> G , yo 're right , union trades are the best but unfortunately these jobs are a bit harder to get into . I am a proud member of the United Association union of plumbers , fitters , welders and HVAC service techs ( Local 496 ) , which means I have a great pension and make double time on the weekends ! I encourage all USA union members ( IBEW , UA , Iron workers , carpenters , etc ) to call you local and ask about work in Alberta , we have special agreements for USA guys and we love working with Americans ! Crane operators with the International Union of Operating Engineers ( IUOE local 955 ) make 250K/year , I know many who do . <p> You may need a specific skill to get in , I " ll do some more research later , but I know a lot of Asians come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alecks , actually there are many non skilled jobs that a young buck like you could do , being Irish , you can qualify for a working holiday visa . here 's a couple of companies that I KNOW hire many foreigners , its a bit shitty work ( industrial cleaning ) but its a foot in the door and you WILL make good money , also they are going to be VERY BUSY this spring , check out their websites , call/e-mail their HR people : <p> http : //www.cleanharbors.com/ ( these guys also operate in the USA , Americans , take note ..... if you get a job in the states with a USA company with OPS in Fort Mac , you can get a transfer ! ) <p> Also , check out http : **30;559;TOOLONG click on " 2012 CEDA jobs " and you will see listings for unskilled and skilled jobs , these guys hire lots of guys for maintenance shut downs every year , read the offer , they will fly you in , train you and put you up in camp . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( shut downs or turn arounds occur each spring and fall for about 2-3 months , they shut down sections of the refineries to inspect , build and repair areas that need maintenance ) this is what I do , 3 months in spring , 3 months in fall . Last fall I grossed over 60K in 3 months and I 'm an apprentice , my JM probably grossed 75-80 ! <p> Here 's the kind of $ you would make working for say CEDA or Clean Harbors ( there 's tonnes of other companies and examples I could use ) : <p> work 3 weeks on , 1 off , 12 hours per day : <p> each weekday : 8 hours straight time at $20/hour , 4 hours at $30/hour. gross $280 weekends : 12 hours at $30/hour , gross $360 each day <p> so , 5x280=1400 plus 2x360=720 =$2120 <p> Of course the Canadian government will take a nice slice of that ( got ta pay for the " free " health car somehow ! ) , but you will likely ( any tax guys can figure this out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket each week . Remember , you 'll be in camp so you wo n't have any expenses , so 3 weeks times $1500 per week , you 'll have $4500 per month to fuck around with ! Hopefully you do n't blow it on your week off ! <p> Guys , this is the MINIMUM you will make . Sometimes its busier so you work 16 hours instead of 12 , for us lucky union guys , its more like this : <p> Anyway , it may sound like I " m bragging and boasting about the money , but I just want to highlight how much coin can be made up here guys , its no secret , its public knowledge , if you take a trade , you WILL make this kind of money . And that 's for us lowly trades men , imagine what an ambitious , intelligent entrepreneur can make up here , its wide open . <p> Quote:Not too many people on this forum appear to be the blue collar tradesmen types ( am I the only one ? ? ? ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard its good ) <p> Longshoreman and Railroad guys are also protected by old laws on the books so if you ever get hurt , you are compensated pretty heavy . <p> I was a railroad engineer for 13 years . It 's not hard to make $100K but the hours are really bad . You are basically on call 7/24 so it 's not a good lifestyle if you like to schedule your life in any way . And do n't plan on having weekends or holidays off . While you might not actually work them , if you get lucky , you will still be on call . The phone can ring about any time . <p> I have no desire to go back to it because of the lifestyle , but I am working on contracting services to the railroad . Good money there and a regular schedule . <p> Also , the injury labor laws G mentions go under FELA . Railroaders do n't get workmans comp , which is good . FELA pays out a LOT better . It 's too much to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have some question for you . The first one is if I have read well some one like me with no experience in the oil industry can work over there and have a really decent salary ? <p> The second one , a french guy like me who is bilangual but still have an accent , do you think I will have difficulties to adapt ? <p> The third one is about the taxes , I read you work there there and had a condo in Vancouver . How the taxes work for you ? I guess you pay your main taxe to B.C and the federal taxe but do you give a % to Alberta too ? <p> Great thread scotian ! Is this the same thing we were talking about before ? I 'm all for that 6 months on and 6 off . I feel like finishing this semester ta school , getting up there to start from the bottom and seeing how everything works . I 'm tired of waiting to travel and this looks like the golden ticket . <p> Scotian - You said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20s without college ed .

I would suggest doing some safety courses before you go out ( unless of course the company offers to ) , it makes your CV more attractive to employer , the 2 essential ones are called " H2S Alive " ( its a one day 8 hours sour gas safety course ) and CSTS ( Construction Safety Training System ) I think you can do that one on-line through Enform.ca . You may also want to take First-Aid CPR training . <p> And that 's pretty much it , you need those courses and you have to piss in a cup ( there 's ways around passing those tests too ) and you can begin working in the oil sands . <p> As long as you can get up at 5am everyday and go to work for 12 hours ( sometimes more ) you can make decent money . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , do what I do and jump ship whenever a better gig comes up , I 've had 4 employers in the past 3 years and my earning keep going up ! <p> This spring is THE LARGEST SHUT DOWN SEASON ever in Alberta , this is a really big deal for guys like me in the industry , I know that when I go back home in April , I " ll have a solid 3 months of crazy work , then 2 months off to do whatever in the summer ( Montreal ? ) , then another 3 months of crazy work again in the fall then maybe Asia ? <p> Alfonzo , look into the company DCM , they 're Quebec based and I 've worked for them at CNRL ( http : //www.dcmgroup.ca/ ) . I can tell by your writing that you speak English well enough to work out there , trust me I 've worked with many guys out of Quebec here .

Also , remember that at your first gig , you 're low man on the totem pole , you 'll be getting shit on a lot and you 'll probably have to do some shitty jobs , but that 's life ! <p> If anyone in Canada is underemployed or is thinking about trying it out in the oil sands , this spring 2012 is THE BEST time to get out there and make some good coin . The shut downs are temporary but can definitely lead to full time gigs , or if you want to fuck off and travel like me between shut downs , that always a possibility ! <p> And , I do n't live in BC , I 've been an Alberta resident for the past 4 years , my condo is in Edmonton .

@@96059154 @259154/ <p> I intend for this to be a " living thread " that I 'll add to as needed . My main point is to pep talk you guys and demonstrate what kinds of emails work well . I have a few buddies on Match ( ranging from lawyer and doctor to valet at a 3 star hotel ) and none of them know how to properly target and email . Targeting is key and emailing is even more key . Yes , it takes some time to fire off a custom email , but there is a pattern than you can draw from and once you get the hang of it you can crank out a funny and effective custom email in under 5 minutes . <p> I 've noticed that a lot of guys on here have nothing but negatives to say about Match.com . I feel like I can help . Now I luckily fit into that category of white , 6-1 , fit , handsome , good pics , cool dog , graduate degree , etc. but I would argue adamantly that Match.com is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I approach in bars . I make day approaches downtown where I live . But Match is awesome and should be an important part of your arsenal if you have the right characteristics . The best thing is that your competition on Match.com is fucking horrendous . I 've had at least 40 dates since I moved to my new city and close to half of them have ( unsolicited ) said by our second drink something along the lines of " wow - this is so different from my other dates . " Knowing where they 're going ( I 'm cool and " normal " , their other dates are IP guys or accountants with zero social skills/confidence ) I will either prompt them further or downplay it and change the subject to something that I 'd talk about on a " normal " date . <p> There are several factors that you need to realize to maximize your efforts .

Find your interests , figure out what niche of girl fits some of those interests , and search for them . <p> I think it 's very possible for you to build a portfolio of girls comparable to your range ( 6-8 if you 're a 7.5 , for example ) to use as a nice confidence booster/calendar filler to supplement with your day game or social networking pickups .

I 've got soul but I 'm not a soldier " , the last line from the song she quoted . Simple concept . With Google you can even fake this . Chick into Downton Abbey but you 've never watched it ? Google " best Downton Abbey quotes " - easy to play off after the fact : " Ehh my ex made me watch a few shows but I have n't kept up ) <p> Rest of email is pretty easy - just mentioned things in her profile that most guys would n't . Do n't pick the obvious , pick one of the more quirky and niche mentions and rock that . <p> I agree 100% with the previous criticisms that my original emails were too long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , deletion of pics that were n't good , and tweaking my emails to short , playful burts have done for my replies . I 'm batting nearly 50% on attractive girls in their mid 20 's now ( even if at 34 I 'm slightly out of their stated age range ) whereas before I tweaked my pics , profile , and emails I was getting less than 10% response on cute young-to-mid 20 's . Despite a previous post I made about shifting to 30-somethings , I 've decided against that . I 'm having such success with younger birds that I 'm devoting all my energy ( online anyway ) to that age bracket . <p> Good post mike . I try not to rely on online game to get a pipeline going after wasting so much time on okc . Would you say match is more time efficient ? In your first post you make it seem like the competition is weak , and since it 's a paysite the women are probably more serious about meeting in real life and not there to just boost their egos , right ? 
@@96059155 @259155/ <p> For those who have seen the film starring Paul Newman . I want to share my analysis . I have an interpretation which I have never seen before . <p> LONG ... <p> Cool Hand Luke is basically a Jesus figure - but with a twist . Since the film was made in the 1960 's when existentialism was fashionable it is my contention that Cool Hand Luke is an existential martyr . <p> Jesus gave up his life to bring people closer to God . <p> Well - Cool Hand Luke does n't believe in God . Instead he gives up his life to provide meaning to the prisoners he is in prison with . <p> Existentialism is a philosophical system based around the idea that there is no God and that the most important task facing man is the search for meaning . The work of Albert Camus is the biggest influence on this film . The film was made 7 years after Albert Camus ' sudden death ( in a car crash ) . <p> Look at the opening scene . Cool Hand Luke is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely nihlistic crime which has absolutely no point . <p> Absurd - in the existential sense of the word . <p> When he is put in prison they mention his war record . He entered the war as a private - won a bunch of awards for bravery - and still came out a private . <p> Not only is Cool Hand Luke an existential rebel . He also rejects societies value system . And he rejects the meaningful good life which society promotes - ie being a war hero . <p> So even though Cool Hand Luke WAS a war hero - he was never promoted since he clearly was being a complete pain the ass when in the army . Again - this shows his rejection of the praise and merit offered by his contemporary society . <p> Now - there are a number of scenes in the film which reference Jesus Christ . You can read about them here : <p> The idea of Cool Hand Luke as a quasi-existential version of Jesus Christ is a clever one . Because - all existentialists by definition do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no way that Jesus could have being the son of God . <p> Which means that Cool Hand Luke and Jesus Christ were identical types of people . Both were ordinary people who decided to devote their lives ( and sacrifice it ) all in the name of providing hope and meaning to others . <p> Now - with all this said . There is one scene in the movie which is more important than any other . <p> You see - during the film , Cool Hand Luke does occasionally look to the sky and ' talk ' to God . Which is strange - since he is supposed to be an atheist , right ? <p> Well - this song is the key here : <p> He has just found out his mum has died . This is the hardest part of his life . <p> Well , I do n't care if it rains or freezes , Long as I have my plastic Jesus Riding on the dashboard of my car Through all trials and tribulations , We will travel every nation , With my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care if it rains or freezes As long as I 've got my Plastic Jesus Glued to the dashboard of my car , You can buy Him phosphorescent Glows in the dark , He 's Pink and Pleasant , Take Him with you when you 're travelling far <p> Refrain <p> I do n't care if it 's dark or scary Long as I have magnetic Mary Ridin ' on the dashboard of my car I feel I 'm protected amply I 've got the whole damn Holy Family Riding on the dashboard of my car <p> Now the lyrics are the key . This is a song about the comfort that the act of belief provides for the believer . But if you look at the words used - it is all about the material the figurines of Mary and Jesus is made from . <p> So the words used are about the physical properties of the figurine . And the content of the song is about how looking at these figurines provides him with the religious comfort and strength he needs when he is feeling alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - staring at the dashboard of his car . <p> Look at the title of the song - ' Plastic Jesus ' . This is a metaphor for a Jesus Christ - who is literally just a ' plastic ' Jesus . By which I mean a fake Jesus ( ie Messiah ) - who is just an ordinary person and not the Messiah his followers believe he is . <p> Lastly - remember the scene where Cool Hand Luke has to repeatedly dig a hole and then refill the same hole ? <p> This is a clear reference to Albert Camus ' most imprtant book which was called ' The Myth Of Sisyphus ' . <p> This is a very interesting book . It is a book devoted to the idea that if life has no meaning - is the rational response to literally put the book down and immediately kill yourself ? <p> Well - the conclusion Camus comes to is that as with the myth of Sisyphus ( the Greek God condemned to rolling a large rock up a hill and down again and up again for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning ' by repeatedly doing ' pointless and meaningless ' acts . And by somehow not being broken by the pointless task ahead of us - we can overcome the lack of meaning in the world . And we can define our character by this overcoming . And in a way - our response to the lack of meaning in the world and the pointlessness of existence can be an act which provides a defiant sense of meaning in the face of absurd existence . <p> LONG ... <p> That mostly covers what I have to say about this film . <p> Cool Hand Luke is an existential Jesus Christ . <p> But - remember - there is n't actually a God in any case . <p> Which means Jesus and Cool Hand Luke are the exact same figures . <p> Ordinary mortals who sacrifice their lives in the name of providing hope and meaning for their followers . <p> To me the ' failure to communicate ' can be taken as a failure ( on Luke 's part ) to follow rules , share societies ' goals and values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the officers live in . It is a total rejection of everything they stand for . <p> So - to me - this speech is also a reference to the ongoing existential rebellion from Cool Hand Luke . Indeed - at the end of the film - as a joke he shouts these words - just before he is shot . <p> My reference to the ' Myth of Sisyphus ' ( the god who is sentenced to roll a giant rock up and down up a hill for all eternity - but who in Camus ' retelling becomes defiant and inspired by his ongoing pointless task - since his defiance are the only source of meaning he has left ) is even clearer in an earlier scene . <p> Early on in the film - the prisoners are given the task of doing roadwork for the day . Laying tarmac and digging ditches and so on . <p> None of the prisoners want to do it . But Paul Newman inspires them to work as hard as possible in order to get it done as quickly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - this is Paul Newman 's attempt to find meaning the only way he can . By laying roads as quickly as possible . By working so hard it actually upsets the guards supervising them . Even though it is not an open revolt - the gestures , organisation , cameradarie and motivation of the prisoners has the same feel as an uprising . <p> So - even with the mediocre tools to hand ( a day laying roads ) - Cool Hand Luke manages to inspire his friends , provide meaning to them ( in the form of trying to antagonise the guards by defiantly working as hard as possible ) and at the same time rebels against ' the man ' . In this case with the ironic weapon of obeying rules and working as hard as possible . <p> When they finish laying the road - they still have two hours left to kill . <p> This image is of Cool Hand Luke after he is left lying on the table after eating 50 eggs in one hour . <p> I mentioned this image earlier . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - think about the context of the image . <p> When Jesus Christ was on the cross - he had given his life to try and save all humanity from sin and bring them closer to God . <p> When Cool Hand Luke is in the same resting position - it is because he thought it would be fun to pointlessly kill an hour by doing a dumb challenge . <p> This is an important thing to note . Since to the absurdist existentialist - every act is equally meaningless . Whether it is wriiting a great novel , saving a child 's life , inspiring millions - or killing an hour eating eggs . <p> The only shadow of meaning that can be grasped from any act is whether it provides a form of meaning to yourself or others . So - in a sense - the Parable of The Eating Of The Eggs ( according to the Existentialst Gospel of Cool Hand Luke ) is just as important an act as any other , since it helped filled some time in the days of our meaningless existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I just want to say that the interpretation of a film is not like plugging numbers into a mathematical formula and seeing what the answer is . <p> Instead - in my analysis above - I am trying to show how most of the scenes and lines can be read from the point of view of a guy who is searching for meaning in the world . And is looking for any silly way of providing it - since meaning is meaning . Whether it is the meaning you feel when you listen to Bach - or the meaning and sense of purpose you feel when killing time with friends doing a silly stunt . <p> Speaking of the above - one of my favourite posts on this forum was the guy who spent a day at work doing a challenge to see if a co-worker could eat one of everything from a vending machine . I love shit like that . And as with Cool Hand Luke - I find dumb shit like that quite moving on a spiritual level . Since it speaks to my absurdist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene - in the church - Cool Hand Luke talks about how ' bad ' he was during the war . Yet - he won many medals for his bravery . <p> This suggests that the war was the event which made him question everything . This is an important point since it was the same war ( WWII ) which inspired Sarte and Camus ( the early existentialists ) to question society , and to ask what kind of purpose and meaning could be found in an amoral universe with no God . <p> **25;619;TOOLONG <p> Existentialism is out of fashion these days . Which is a shame since I do n't think philosophical ideas should be subject to the whims of fashion . But sadly they are - since there is no objective way of judging one system as being more truthful than another . As such - the winds of academic fashion take on far more important than would be the case in other fields . <p> Still - I enjoy existentialism - and think it is an interesting area of study . It is also very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such I think it is neat that Cool Hand Luke pushs an existential message in the film . It is just a shame that this message has been overlooked by alot of people . <p> One other important point . When Cool Hand Luke escapes from the prison ( early on in the film ) he sends back a postcard to the prisoners which has a photo of himself in fine clothes , drinking champagne ( or wine ? or whiskey ? I forget ) surrounded by two beautiful women . <p> When the prisoners read it they are delighted that Cool Hand Luke is free and ' living the high life ' . <p> Later on he is caught - and admits , when asked , that it was a fake photo that he paid a couple of bucks to get taken in a shopping mall somewhere . <p> Again - the postcard fits in with the rest of the movie . Of Cool Hand Luke devoting all of his energy to trying to inspire his fellow prisoners and provide them meaning for their lives . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lives on in the form of the stories and hope that is spread amongst ' hios disciples ' as they talk about him in the prison camp . <p> If you think about - this is a form of ressurection . And a form of Eternal Life . Not by living again - but by having the example you set live on for all eternity . Perhaps this was the true sense of the ' second coming ' that Jesus was trying to share in a ' Cool Hand Luke ' kind of way ? <p> **29;646;TOOLONG <p> Lastly - the whole film is set in a prison . Which is about as striaghtforward a location anybody would pick for setting a film which is about ' challenging the rules ' and ' breaking free ' . <p> Sorry - for all the loose ends . I should have put some of these ideas in some of my earlier posts . But when you look at the film in this way - so many examples come to mind that it hard to keep track of them . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film in a few years ) - but I will stop here for the sake of everybody 's sanity . <p> ( 12-14-2013 06:51 AM ) cardguy Wrote : This is an important thing to note .

@@96059158 @259158/ <p> Is it just me or has there been a big surge in fake accounts on OKC lately ? I 'm talking like the last couple of months . My theory is that it has something to do with the ( new ) requirement that you must have a picture on your profile to view others ' pictures . Now , people ( dudes ) who had second accounts for various crypto-purposes have been practically forced into trolling . <p> But even if that is a factor , that does n't fully explain the increased level of sophistication in the fakes . I 'm surprised at the amount of work that 'll go into troll , which I 'll end up confirming with a simple reverse-image search or general intuition . I ca n't help but think that a resource with its own set annoyances ( thirsty spammer dudes , SIFs , 6s with the delusions of 8s , et cetera ) might be getting a new one . <p> Have you guys noticed this ? What are your theories on why this is ? And more importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse-image searching--which I 'm rarely willing to put in the time to do--and a general too-good-to-be-true vibe , I have n't found any other good tells . Well , maybe being way over-the-top sexual and slutty is another one . <p> Note : This thread is not for the purpose of debating the at-large merits of online dating . <p> EDIT : My evidence for the new image requirement being a factor is the fact that I 'm also seeing a surge in blank profiles with only one image--clear fakes that only have picture to fulfill the requirement . <p> I 've got this smoking , smoking hot chick who wants to play hard to get with her phone number , does n't want to make plans to meet yet , does n't use facebook despite having 9+ looks , makes jokes about sleeping around or talking about sexy stuff ... <p> I mean come on .. the only thing stopping me from being dead set sure that this is some gay guy trying to get me to sext him fap material is that none of her pictures showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me are quick to give me their number and often want my facebook to feel more comfortable meeting me off the internet without knowing me .. <p> I even told this girl .. you know this is in the internet .. how do I know you are you ? She had a lame response <p> There has been a big increase in trannies calling themselves women , but then putting it somewhere in their profile that they are " trans " . <p> Tuth , try doing this if you have n't already : go to locals and just swipe right rapidly . Okc will message you with the girls that matched you , then you can open them instead wasting your time opening up fake profiles . <p> Okc is , at it 's core , a website for indescretion and secrecy . It 's the option for people who do n't want to rely on the club to find sex . Now it 's even more in that direction with the tinder function- where people are secretly matching each other instead of having to take risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a flag mod on OKC and I 've noticed this gradually over the last few years . Most are just lazy modelmayhem or general model pics easily found by Google image search . The profile to go with them are often highly sexual so they are easily spotted when a dime piece says she 's looking for guys in the 18-99 range . <p> Some weirdos write long elaborate profiles and answer 100s of question and take the pics from some rather small blogger/instagramer . These are the ones you have to watch out for . They are some sick version of online stalkers living out a shadow life of their subject . Making phony plans , and using fake numbers . Really sad stuff . <p> I think its important to remember this , some girls on online dating have boyfriends but are looking for dick on the side , some just log on on a friday or saturday when they are dtf . We all read that article about the girl who put up the worst profile ever but with a girl who looks like a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pic and the vast majority of guys will still message them , and would still be willing to meet them . Its fine that we are cautious just know that a couple of them just have hangups about being judged for looking for dick on a website . <p> One time i got an unsolicited message from an empty profile with no pics , she gave me her number and said she could send me pics there if i wanted to . She was cute but i got all paranoid and asked for spoon pics , of course she just said ok nevermind and did n't  text again , a month later i was deleting contacts from my phone and i looked at her pic on whatsapp , it was really her and she was really really hot . I missed out on a booty call for being too paranoid . <p> Here 's a common type of fake ( since someone above asked to see an example ) . The profile is blank , apart from the biographical data , and pictures are too good to be true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get way more subtle . Notice , though , this person did n't just add one pic--which is all they needed to see others ' peoples pictures--they added three . <p> Imagine if , like many others do , they 'd bothered to add some text into the profile . <p> Last time i checked she had a full body pic where you could also see her face as her profile pic on whatsapp . Why would anyone create a fake profile on the internet and also go and buy an extra SIM card with a burner cellphone just to trick some guy on the internet ? <p> Its not the first time something like this happened to me , i messaged with girls who i thought no way could be real because they only had a pic and were more good looking than the average on the website , with some of them i just wrote their first name on google plus twitter or facebook and usually they pop up on the first page . <p> Why is it so hard to believe that a girl would be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this counts as getting too paranoid from reading a rare case of catfish ( if you watched the show you would see that those guys are hopeless omegas ) on the internet and thinking that every other case is bound to be the same . <p> ( 01-07-2014 05:13 PM ) dog24 Wrote : I hope i do n't  get banned for this but i think this counts as getting too paranoid from reading a rare case of catfish <p> That 's the whole point of the thread , to establish how common these are in your areas . In the case of mine , they absolutely are n't rare . And they have--without question--proliferated in recent months . The example I 've given is one of many . Also keep in mind that a lot of guys may not have the acumen I have in detecting subtler cases of fakes . I 'm pretty sure I have above-average Internet detective skills . <p> I did just did a Google search and turned this up . Clearly I 'm not the only one noticing this . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get any answers , just trolled by some herb-looking dude . <p> The one tell that I 've noticed is that fake profiles usually have pictures of a girl by herself . The typical American girl pulls her profile pictures off of Facebook , which usually include her group of slutty friends or male orbiters . This is n't perfect . I myself made a female OkCupid profile before starting my real profile , and I used a 7 with her friends instead of the model mayhem outtakes common to the troll profile . I also filled in the profile with brief answers that a girl might say . It was equal parts and education . <p> Some of the fakes use straight-up stock photography , and do n't even bother to crop out the stock-photography watermarks . Apart from dudes using fake accounts for the the purpose that masterthespian mentions above , I ca n't help but think that all of the blogs and articles of people running " experiments " or looking for lulz to populate their sites are driving a lot of these . 
@@96059159 @259159/ <p> This edition was supposed to be about Thinking The Game , which will come out shortly , but I had a moment today that inspired me to write this particular edition tonight . <p> Whether we like it or not we live in a world with finite resources , thus , it is inherent that we must compete to obtain those resources . It is not possible for everyone to have everything . Some of us have convinced ourselves we can go without , which is just a coping mechanism for failure , some of us do n't really have the drive others have so we set the bar low because it 's easier . <p> That 's fine . <p> At the end of the day , I 'm only in control of what I can do . <p> I 'm responsible for being the best I can be and making my life the way that I want it to be , which in the end , is the only way I will feel good about myself and the life I 've led . <p> This evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to stop off and run an errand , and while doing so , I came across a cross-fit class that was jogging in the street . I 'm thinking to myself , " Come on , get the fuck out of the way " as I try to complete my business . Afterwards , I drove past several gyms -- where I live gyms are everywhere , damn near everybody is trying to look good -- and I could see through the windows , people lifting , running on treadmills , etc . <p> I thought to myself , " How dare these motherfuckers , how dare them . " I 'll get back to why I thought that , but first let me go back to my intro statement on competition . I 'm a competitive motherfucker . Always have been . I love being able to say I came out on top , being a winner is a great feeling . Winning in life helps you build the self-confidence you need to accomplish the goals you set out for yourself . I allow my competitive nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross-fit people get it in , and I 've looked through the windows of a few gyms and witnessed other people getting in , and in that moment , I felt the sense of inadequacy creeping up on me . I watched other people putting in the work one needs to put in to get physically better while I was just sitting in the fucking car . <p> Sure , no matter what , I was going to work out later in the evening anyway , but I knew that I would probably go home and rest a little bit , eat , check some things online , etc. before I got started and in this moment it just could n't wait , I needed to do this now . I needed to get this feeling of someone else trying to kick my ass , thinking that they 're better than me , off of my mind . <p> I like to ball and sometimes I come across parks where people are getting it in , so I keep a pair of shoes and some basketball shorts in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of dumbbells and some old push up bars back there as well . So , I decided to find the nearest park and I looked up one of the total body workouts for P90X and got my workout in at that park . <p> My feeling was how dare other people take the time to get better , and actually think that I would slip up . I always feel that way when I see people doing things that I know I should be doing . <p> If I see a cute girl at a club and spend too long taking an extra sip of my drink while someone else goes and scoops her up , I 'm pissed . If I see some scrub with not even an ounce of my athletic ability busting his ass in the gym while I 'm sitting in fucking traffic , contemplating what to make for dinner , I 'm pissed . <p> You should be pissed too . <p> I 'd like to think we 're brothers in this community .

It does n't care that honestly you 're not even a part of the competition . <p> When I go out to meet women , most guys out there are not really competition , they 're just interference . They 're getting in my way and they 're getting in the girl 's way , because she should be talking to me , she should be thinking " Holy shit , I met this guy , and my life just changed " , instead of , " Ok , how can I fake having a boyfriend and needing to go to the bathroom at the same time ?

Why not take matters into your own hands and protect yourself with a firearm , instead of believing in the illusion of safety provided by " the state " ? <p> I can see your point that a home alarm system should n't be the end all be all of your security . But even then , it 's not entirely blue pill since it is a valid deterrent I think to a would be intruder . If there are three houses in a row A B and C. House A has a home alarm and B and C do not . I 'm sure a would be intruder would make houses B and C their initial targets before looking at house A. 
@@96059169 @259169/ <p> I was really planning to write a long ass thread about this but I figured I make a rather short one instead and update it continously . <p> Short story is I 'm 28 , I was in a relationship between 17 and 22 - my first and only girlfriend so far - at 22 , getting dumped I probably got into some kind of semi-depression , isolated myself and played world of warcraft for 6 years straight . <p> Worked with a shitty minimum wage job just to get by and be able to afford a roof over my head and food . Lost all of my IRL friends I had since high-school and I have n't touched a girl since I got dumped . <p> " Woke up " now at 28 , deleted my account and all the characters , I had all of my social life/friends online cause of the game so yeah , I lost that too . <p> Ive been so damn tired and without no real motivation for so long so I recently went and checked my blood testosterone , came back 250ng/dl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check for some tumor on my HPTA to rule that one out and at the moment I 'm waiting for the results and hopefully after that I will be put on testosterone replacement therapy . <p> I live in Norway , a small place with just a couple thousands people . I need to get out of here and get some kind of education and hopefully get a life worth living again . <p> Basicly in a rut . Not sure what I 'm looking for with this , maybe some inspiration , motivation or " tough love " , ass-kicking over the internet . <p> Pretty lost and without any purpose really , every day is just the same . <p> Before everything - I wish you well , and hope you 'll be healthy .

Based on that look for jobs which suit you . 3 . Start working out , and eat well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4 . Look up either new friends , or RVF members near by - you need a support group . 5 .

I just recently had a similar conversation with a relative who has similar issues . <p> Here 's my two cents for you : <p> Deleting your WoW account and signing up for the RVF is a good start . <p> Basicly in a rut . Not sure what I 'm looking for with this , maybe some inspiration , motivation or " tough love " , ass-kicking over the internet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is just the same . <p> First things first , find a high quality source of liquid gelcap Vitamin D3 . You probably need to take at least 20,000 I.U. a day for a few weeks to get your Vitamin D blood levels up . That will help you tremendously with your depression issues . Being in Northern Europe means you certainly do n't get enough natural sunlight exposure to have a healthy Vitamin D levels , and spending 6 years basically living indoors online obsessing with WoW makes that much worse . <p> " Woke up " now at 28 , deleted my account and all the characters , I had all of my social life/friends online cause of the game so yeah , I lost that too . <p> You had virtual friends in a virtual world . You did n't lose anything other than an enabling support network keeping you plugging into a false reality . Go find some real friends in real life . <p> The best way to do that is by DOING something ( anything ) with other people . The harder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bond and form meaningful relationships with each other . <p> So join a gym , or a martial arts club , or a skiing club ... or take music classes or art classes or even something like cooking classes . Point is , find some activity/hobby that involves working with other people ( especially if you find someone to mentor you ) to accomplish something or develop some skillset . As people help you and you help people to achieve some sort of goal or develop a skill , friendships form , and achieving something/anything will also give you a sense of confidence and self worth . <p> Main thing is get off your ass and go find something you can do that will inspire you to be passionate about something and give you something to work towards and overcome some form of difficulty . 49878 @qwx909878 <p> You 'll also have to change your environment and no longer be exposed to the same stimuli ( people , places , your fixed roles , people 's expectations of you etc . ) . If possible , just move away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rewarding challenge . Other things will thereafter fall into place . 49878 @qwx909878 <p> Your two priorities for now should be : <p> 1 . Learn a marketable skill , and get a decent job . Go back to school if need be , or self-teach something , which is easier than ever in the modern information age . The benefits of this are self-evident . <p> 2 . Lift weights . I ca n't name a single endeavor that benefits a man 's life in more ways than lifting weights . Getting in shape will : -make women more attracted to you -make men respect you more -make you healthier -make you more confident -increase your testosterone levels <p> Before trying to bring other people into your life , whether girls or male friends , you need to get your own shit taken care of . Quality people want to be associated with other quality people . Your life will be more " all work , no play " than you 'd like at first , but you 'll have reason to believe your future will hold better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here are a couple quick points : <p> 1 . You need to do something different . I think you are already aware of this , but you simply need to switch things up . Even if it is something simple like going to bed at midnight instead of 4 AM , that 's a good start . You should worry less about T-levels and identity-based stuff on focus more on what you do . <p> 2 . In this same vein , I recommend training yourself to substitute reading for electronic media . Not only is it better for your raw intelligence , but it allows you to unplug for sleep easier and is better for your psyche . Video games give one the false sense of accomplishment that is fine when you have direction in life , but becomes a drain when you lean on them for a sense of self or purpose . I recommend any major works by Stephen King , John Grisham , maybe Ray Bradbury . You can PM me and I can send you a list with links to some fiction you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge on your personality , so there 's that ) . <p> 3 . There is no shame in going back to a minimum wage job if need be . Get one you can tolerate and bust your ass . Given the high turnover at these jobs , you can distinguish yourself pretty quick . I know they can be soul-crushing , but there is no shame in a minimum wage job . <p> 4 . We do n't have much to go on at this point , so I just want to emphasize checking T-levels and all that is fine , but you simply need to make new , more productive habits . The obvious question being : Where to you want to go ? What 's your education level ? A man needs purpose and I do n't mean that vaguely oppressive feeling most millenials feel about needing purpose at work , I mean you need to have real faith about where you are taking your life . <p> Old Chinese Man Wrote : why you wonder how many man another man bang ? why you care who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrote : i on the other hand will be banging hotter chicks and still be DOCTOR KHAN . 49878 @qwx909878 <p> Thankyou for the responses so far . <p> I will definately order the vitamine d3 right away . <p> It feels kinda weird at the moment , Its like I know on an intellectual level that I should " do something " , yet its extremely difficult to find the motivation or even figure out exactly what it is I want . I have a feeling the low testosterone might have to do something with it , I really hope to get help with that one soon enough . <p> Oh did I mention my libido is basicly non-existant , too ? <p> About my weight : Its pretty good , despite my gaming life Ive actually managed to run like 3 times a week , so the weight is healthy at 78kg , 180cm height . <p> I do believe I would gain alot by maybe take up studies on an university level , that will give me a " new start " aswell with student life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in scandinavia , I have nothing to loose really .

I 've been through similar and am still vulnerable to all the ailments you mentioned . I live right behind the border and study norwegian in community college so PM me if you like . <p> In addition to your T levels I would get your thyroid checked . I used to have a very serious thyroid issue that went undiagnosed until my dad brought it up with an actual physician . As a consequence I received radioidione treatment , which might have been the bad choice and now I no longer have a functional thyroid and am on medication for the rest of my life but whatever your case , you should get it checked just in case because it affects every cell of your body . <p> I would perhaps consult the employment agency to arrange for a meeting with an occupational psychologist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education plans and what not .

( I 'm more sexually experienced than you are , which I 'm only bringing up to show you how the raw amount of bangs does n't much matter , in my opinion . Whether you can consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . ) <p> Grew up in a home with both parents , but they were relatively hands-off and did n't have a clue how to raise me . We moved constantly and I never learned social skills . When puberty hit , I started skipping school when I realized girls and peers did n't like me much - and I ended up spending an extra year and a half in high school . Started college about a year after that , drifted aimlessly , partied . Never really had a " girlfriend " , just bangs that happened out of luck , some stuck around for a few months . Have only recently begun to find a direction , but it is n't a strong one - the only real thing keeping me going right now is the gym , my job , friends , and hobbies as I hang out and figure out what to do with myself . <p> You 're turning the ship around and seem sincere . Keep doing it . That 's all that matters . 49878 @qwx909878 <p> ( 01-07-2017 07:25 PM ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually checked my thyroid too when I looked up my testosterone levels , my endo said that the thyroid was fine , so I guess its fine , I never saw any numbers tho , maybe I should check that one . <p> I think the ideal for me is to move and change town , live with other students and participate in teh student life culture , that would probably help alot in regards of getting new friends . <p> I do n't want to confuse you with what might be a trivial issue in your particular case but it would be good to check if your thyroid reading included your T3 values as well as opposed to merely T4 values . T4 is the hormone that 's supposed to be converted to T3 , which is the truly important hormone for your health and sometimes the T4 reading is misleading ; where I live the tests usually do not include T3 unless requested . Your TSH level is also an indicator of whether things are under control or not but should never be used as the stand-alone indicator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite what my username might indicate just in case that might affect your perception . 49878 @qwx909878 <p> If college is basically free it 's a no brainer . Study something practical like engineering/computer science/accounting . Get a part time job and start lifting regularly . This should help with you malaise/lack of energy and give you some purpose . Scandinavian woman are smoking hot - take advantage of the natural bounty . The worst thing you can do is feel sorry for yourself . Take charge of your life and do the best you can . 49878 @qwx909878 <p> @Realbor Hei og takk for det spennende temat ( sorry for the bad bokm+l ) . I 'd like also to chime in as some who can related to a *lot* of what you are describing . Aged 33 , with constrain ' brain fog ' , zero libido , energy of an 80 year old , zero motivation to achieve anything , addicted to zero-risk and minimum effort , constantly afraid of everything . I let my academic career go to the dogs , never fulfilled my dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO god-damned long to finish my BSc and Masters degrees , that they are now almost worthless . Consequently , it took me more than a year of begging to find a half-way decent job which unfortunately bores me out of my mind - after all , the cool and interesting jobs are a tiny fraction of the whole and only the best of the best get to do them , deservedly . Needless to say , my love life is an unmitigated disaster , and although every once in five years or so , some decent-looking girl shows direct interest in me , nothing ever happens because of paranoia and trust issues . I 've turned down direct offers for sex on a few occasions which is n't that hard to do when libido is close to zero and paranoia and fear is close to infinity . TLDR , you get the picture . <p> As to the practical stuff people suggested , yes I am taking D3 as advised by my local GP , although the dosage that some people suggest here seems dangerously high . Most docs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So consult a physician before proceeding . <p> Also , I 'm wondering how you could randomly get all those fancy tests and MRIs ? Do you have a friendly doctor who prescribed them ? Or it 's possible to contact a private healthcare services provider and pay for them out of your pocket ? <p> Also , I see a lot of people giving the classic and very sound advice " start lifting " . Unfortunately I got a ' weird case ' of rhabdomyolysis 4 years ago after relatively little exertion ( about 20 minutes of playing soccer ) and docs said ' you should only do light exercises ' . Needless to say , I used it as a perfect excuse to not ever set foot at the gym again . <p> In any case , I think it would be very beneficial , if you I and other people in similar situation could somehow remain in touch and build some kind of virtual support group . What does everyone think ? 49878 @qwx909878 <p> ( 01-08-2017 04:47 AM ) Khan Wrote : OP , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up without a father and discovered the red pill in my late 20s . <p> You 're probably resentful of the fact that you 've lost so much valuable time .

In fact , we embrace it . <p> Very interesting post . There are deep , deep psychological divides between men and women . Did you ever find yourself in the toilet , or taking a shower , and you start solving some large big-picture problem . You think to yourself " If ( favorite sports team ) just does this , this and this , they can get to the playoffs . " Or , " If the Republicans would just do this and the democrats that , we could solve ( important national problem ) . " Well it turns out , most men do that ! They solve some large , abstract macro or global problem in their minds ... its a way of warming up their brain for the problem solving they will do all day . Which is basically what men do : Solve problems . Women are n't like this at all . They live far more in the moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . Ten minutes later they feel another ( perhaps contradictory ! ) need or want , and they give in to that . Their minds are built from totally different blue prints . And most of their " wants " result from something they do n't have but some other woman does have . <p> And that 's what makes working with them so difficult . Living with them is hard , but at some point , nature takes over . They nag , if its a small thing , you give in , nagging stops . If its a big thing , you assert yourself , put your foot down , and they either capitulate or leave . Either way , nagging stops . But at work ... it 's like ripping the bandaid off oh-so-slowly . If you assert yourself in a dominant way , you 're " verbally abusive " . Or , " aggressive " . Sometimes just from talking ! We 've defined everything down . <p> Its the same in the world of " abuse " ( women 's favorite concept , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your wife , or putting her on a budget , is now " domestic violence " . Touching a girl 's vagina is now rape . I saw a story the other day - it was about Lara Logan , the sexy , slutty news reporter who slept her way to the top . She was the one caught in Tahir square a few years ago . She said she was " sexually assaulted " , but for a while would n't say if she had been raped or not . Finally she got another 15 minutes of fame by saying " Yes ... yes ... I was RAPED ! ! " . And I 'm thinking " Wow . I wonder if one of those muslim brother-hood types busted a nut in that blonde pussy . Every Egyptians dream , I 'm sure . " Then later she clarifies : " they touched me everywhere ... they raped me with their hands " . Look , lady , I agree they should n't have put their unwashed hands in your butthole and vajayjay . But that 's called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetration . Let 's stop dumbing down words . Soon , posts like this will be considered " violence against women " . <p> Come on Onto , there is no need for any of the allegories about the different ballgames to explain why men will always play with a ball and women never will . It 's both simpler and more fundamental than that . <p> Men 's most basic instinct is to handle objects in the outside world , that 's just what men do . A ball is a perfect object because it can be tossed , kicked , thrown , batted etc . Some objects may be set aside because a man might have no immediate use for them , but a ball can always be used and always invites use . So a man will just go ahead and handle it because it so readily lends itself to being handled . <p> Women simply do n't care about objects in the outside world , as such . The only thing that women care about is social interactions : who is doing what with whom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of power , who is paying attention to whom . That 's why social media and smartphones are like crack to them , because that is a way for them to exercise their most fundamental instincts 24/7 .

There is nothing that prepares you better for doing great science than a complete lack of curiosity about the outside world . <p> It really is a perfect object and you do a great job of describing how the attribute of masculine being is to " take action " vs the feminine which is inclined not to because for her to do so would go against the feminine principle which espouses there should be no self-interest ( egotism ) in the world . <p> It 's why a woman deeply desires a man to read her mind . If she were to say what she wants then she would have to appear to herself as a self-interested ego making demands on others and the world . <p> It 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wealth to her without her having to do little more than petition the court . Even after that is done the law is designed to " automatically " upwards adjust without her having to take action . A woman will always say , " It 's not me taking the money , I 'm just following the law . " , or " It 's my lawyer doing it , not me " . <p> It 's why they demand equal pay without having to take the action of " asking for it " , or " working for it . " They just want it given . If Joe takes action and gets a raise , well better give Suzie one too . It 's only fair ! <p> It 's why a woman likes when a man holds the door open for her . She does n't have to be there for herself , acting in the world . She just glides right through . It 's why they like for a man to make the decisions , and on and on . <p> Women 's egos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . There is egotism in the very demand there should be none ! They just ca n't admit this and in a very real way ca n't even see it and will hate you if you successfully make them aware of it . <p> I think women love all objects . Whether it 's diamonds , fur coats , or the biggest object of them all , the body . Existence through the body is the most important thing to the feminine . Whereas the masculine could care less about the body . For him it 's just a vehicle to bring the other-worldly ( principles , ideas ) into worldly existence . For him it 's ok to sacrifice his life through war so that what he fights of carries on , whereas the feminine believes there is nothing more important than just being alive . For a Father , his child must act in a way that subscribes to and carries forward his ideals and principles , for the Mother the child just needs to have a pulse . <p> I think social media is like crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alone with themselves . When you have nothing to distract you , you are left alone with you , your thoughts , and your awareness , and for women that 's like a death sentence . <p> We see women taking an interest in sports now because they are trying to be masculine . However , it 's still their natural inclination not to , which is probably why a group of young girls will ignore the ball . <p> I was in a small colonial town in Mexico for a vacation when I randomly saw a guy I went to school with . The school I went to in the US was a private school with lots of wealthy international students , this guy being one of them , from one of the wealthiest families in Mexico . <p> He was getting married that weekend and invited me to stay for the wedding . The wedding day came , absolutely stunning women ( think Mexico 's Next Top Model ) . I got a glimpse into Mexico 's elite circles . <p> At the wedding reception , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as intense flirting even though they were with boyfriends . The fact that I was associated with my old high school friend was enough for them to think I was a high status guy . <p> This Mexican chick that looked like Anna Kornikova I know I could have banged . She was feeding me tequila shots and trying to get me to leave with her until her sister came and took her away . I did n't end up hooking up although I could have . In retrospect , I would n't have known what the fuck to do with such good looking women at that point in time . I used to be a real pussy when it came to pussy . <p> It was n't until about 2 years ago when I really started to see demonstrations of the privileges that accompany social proof with either high status guys and girls that I was really able to put that night into its proper perspective . Social proof and status are KING ! <p> ( 01-10-2016 01:17 PM ) The Lizard of Oz Wrote : Come on Onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the different ballgames to explain why men will always play with a ball and women never will .

@@96059179 @259179/ <p> Pretty sure I have Alcoholic Neuropathy ( nerve damage from drinking ) , heard of it ? <p> This post is to serve as a warning and also to see if anyone has any experience/information about this since there is probably many others on this forum who live a similar lifestyle as me . This is a long post but I want to make sure I get in all the details . <p> So I recently turned 31 and have been drinking alcohol since I was 14 with only about 2.5 years in between with no drink which gives me about 14.5 years drinking total . <p> My drinking from 14-24 consisted of a mixture of beer and liquor on the weekends mostly ( binge drinking ) with my fair share of mild blackouts etc but not drinking to the point of not being able to walk . <p> At 24 I quit drinking until about age 27-28 where I drank mostly beer until now ( 95% of the time ) . <p> About a year ago I started noticing a weird twitching of my right thumb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2nd day after drinking . I stupidly wrote it off as some temporary hangover shit from dehydration , lack of vitamins or whatever . <p> Fast forward to the next year ( 2015 ) I do almost a full year of traveling , drinking maybe 2-4x a week about 10 beers a night average . <p> About a week before Christmas I noticed the thumb twitch again and I pointed it out to a girl I was with and she said to look it up on Google to see what it was . I said yea why not , not expecting to find out anything important . <p> What I saw at first was serious nerve damage stuff ( neuropathy ) mixed in with some non-serious " dehydration " stuff . I stupidly chose to believe the minor dehydration shit because it always went away on the 2nd day after drinking and never bothered me much , and I already had a year of it happening with no progression and only during heavy nights . <p> Later that day I felt tingling in my right wrist along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumps appear on my wrist and lower back at the same time ( which I think now was some type of food allergy from the restaurant I was eating at ) and I thought the tingling had something to do with that so again I wrote it off after it went away in 15 minutes . <p> A week later after 3 nights of drinking beer I awake to the thumb twitching again and later its accompanied by more tingling . The thumb was twitching heavier than normal this time and I decided to do some more research online ( as I was drinking a beer ) to look more into this nerve damage stuff . At this point I started to suspect something more but it was Saturday and I decided to go out one more night and stop the next day until I saw a doctor . Later that night the shit goes away and I go home to sleep . <p> The next day I was not drinking anything and began to read more online . At the same time I started noticing light tingling in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " alcoholic neuropathy " based on what I was finding online . At this point I was pretty freaked out and decided to totally stop drinking until I talked to a doctor . <p> The feeling of tingles in my feet remained for a couple more days but was pretty light and I began to wonder if I was just overthinking everything and perceiving something in my feet that was n't really abnormal at all . I went out with a new girl that night and decided to have a beer since she wanted to drink and as a test to see if I noticed anything more . <p> Later that night after the girl leaves I 'm sitting on my couch and notice my left foot go partially numb for about 10 minutes . At this point I 'm almost positive this is some sort of neuropathy that is being caused by alcohol and now I 'm thoroughly bugged out about it . <p> Over the course of the next couple days the shit gets more intense ( with zero drinking ) in my feet and by New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with needles mixed with a feeling of small worms crawling under the skin of my feet . This is n't the feeling you have when your foot falls asleep but feels more like someone is actually taking a needle and poking you with it fairly hard in random areas of your toes . To relieve some of the mild annoying pain I have to push my feet against something like the ground ( when standing ) or side of the couch ( when laying down ) . <p> After reading more stuff online and talking to a couple friends I decided to wait a week to see if the shit would die down and go away . I 'm in a foreign country that speaks a foreign language and it was the holidays so if I did n't have to fuck with going to a hospital that would be ideal . <p> Over the next couple days the needle pricks in my feet get less intense however now the feeling has spread to my fingers , but only about 20% of the intensity of what the feet felt like at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this deep uncomfortable pain in the center of both of my arms which really scared me . I actually had a mini break down in my apartment at this point because I felt like the shit was spreading and getting worse and I was n't sure wtf I did to myself . Thoughts of my wreckless/unhealthy lifestyle from the past 3 years started to flood my mind ( lots of condom-less sex with sketchy bitches , lots of alcohol and heavy hangovers , etc ) . <p> After a couple days the deep pain in my arms goes away but I still have the random needle pricks and tingles in my hands and feet ( less in hands ) . Also random pains that last 3-4 seconds in other random areas of my body like shoulders , sides etc . Another symptom is the top of my fingers feel like they are sunburned when something touches them . I still have not drank anything more since that one beer about a week prior . <p> At this point I decide to go to a " good " clinic where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her my symptoms and my history of drinking . On the way to the doctor I actually felt some pretty sketchy pain in the side of my face that felt like nerve pain , which I also told her about . She did a bunch of blood tests on me that included glucose , vitamin b12 , HIV , and some others . <p> The tests came back the next day and everything looked good but she said for my age my Vitamin b12 should be around 500+ and it was at 331.8 . Vitamin B12 deficiency is what is commonly believed to cause the " alcoholic neuropathy " along with the alcoholic toxins themselves , so I thought OK so now what ? She said this " could " be the reason and put me on one Vitamin b12 shot for 5 days and some folic acid pills ( Biocobal ) for 30 days . She also told me not to drink . I was n't able to converse with her on the level I would with a doctor who spoke English but I asked her if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " soon " after I started the treatment . She also had a light vibe and joking a lot of the time so I left the sessions with her feeling fairly optimistic about everything . <p> During the 5 days of shots I noticed a significant decrease in the symptoms to where I barely noticed it and I thought I was out of the woods and that the shit would go away completely very soon . <p> I 'm now 3 weeks out from the last beer I had and about 2 weeks out from the start of the treatment , still taking the pills . However the symptoms have increased again in the past week since the shots ended and I am now getting random twitching in my toes and thumbs ( much more in toes ) , along with random pricks , pains , and tingling in my arms and feet . I also notice more muscle twitches than normal like in my legs . <p> I 'm able to function normally and go about my day without really thinking about it , but its still annoying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . <p> Anyone have any experience with this fucking shit or know anything about it ? It 's one of those things that alcohol causes that nobody talks about and you do n't hear about it until it actually hits you . I 'm nowhere near your typical fucked up looking alcoholic , actually quite the opposite . I 'm a fairly young stylish dude who travels , games , and makes decent coin and has no other health issues or major life problems in general . I actually feel great besides this shit , especially after not drinking for 3 weeks . <p> Maybe it 's early still and I need more time for my nerves to heal ? Maybe I have some other weird sexually ( or non-sexually ) transmitted virus that is causing this ? Maybe it 's permanent and I 'm stuck with this ? Maybe something else ? <p> Any thoughts , experiences , advice , or insight is welcome . Until then I would recommend anyone else experiencing early symptoms ( twitching/tingling of the toes/feet/fingers etc ) to evaluate their drinking before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please go back and get some more B12 shots , or at least some B12 tablets , since your tingling is back . You should actually keep getting shots until your blood levels return to normal . And even then , maybe carry on with weekly shots for 3 months or so just to build up your liver stores . <p> Your story reads like a medical case study from a textbook . It clearly is most likely to be alcoholic neuropathy . It is a combination of direct toxicity and the suppression of nutrients required for normal nerve function . B12 is the most common deficiency but alcohol can mess up the absorption and use of a lot of other nutrients too . <p> The shakes , twitches and needles become permanent eventually , if you are not willing to stop drinking .

I know anxiety very well and can recognize it because I 've experienced it in the past from drinking too heavily . It 's actually one of the reasons I quit drinking the first time . What I am experiencing now is totally different and it 's definitely some type of neurological issue ( agreed by the doctor I saw ) . How serious it is exactly and how to get rid of it completely are still the question marks I have . I contacted the doctor about the symptoms coming back more after the shots were done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very light , comparable to how they were while I was on the shots . It 's likely that I may just need some more ongoing Vitamin b12 supplementation like Thomas The Rhymer said . <p> What I do know is this is the second time alcohol has fucked up my health in a scary way ( anxiety issues the first ) and I 'm only 31 . Drinking is n't worth the possibility of long term nerve pain for me . Which sucks because I love beer and the experiences had while drinking it on my travels , but I love my health more .

You 've stopped , and you have been putting off hangovers by drinking again for a certain period of time so what 's happened is all these things have come together . Have you noticed any other symptoms like bruising on your hip ? Or occular pain ? If not , then it probably is n't too bad . <p> Good news is you probably have n't done any long lasting damage . Bad news is your body might have built up a dependancy and you will have mental and pyschological roadblocks if you want to reduce or quit drinking . <p> I 'm in the same boat .

It 's extremely hard to overdose on B12. ( disclaimer : again , this is just an educated guess on my part , not medical advice . Go see your doctor for ' real ' medical advice ) <p> A recent patient of mine had similar symptoms , his hands had a rather obvious tremor and he complained of pins in his hands and feet . I do n't have injectable vitamins in my ghetto African clinic but I put him on a cocktail of vitamin b complex , niacin , thiamine , and pyridoxine . He did rather well on it , his hands stopped flapping about and the pin pains went away . I 'm not sure which ingredient did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin blood tests I had to shoot blindly . The illness seemed to scare him off the alcohol , hopefully he stays off it . <p> Your profile says that you 're from the United States , and you said you 're in a foreign country where the native language is Spanish . So unless you 're currently in Spain you 're most likely in a 3rd world country . My first piece of advice would be to get your ass to a 1st world doctor . If you ca n't fly to one ; go to the US embassy and see if they can assist you with medical care . Most likely they will help you out ; at the very least they 'll point you to a competent doctor . <p> My second piece of advise is to stop drinking , and enter a treatment program if you need one . I 'm not passing a moral judgement on your lifestyle but 20-40 beers a week is not normal . You have a drinking problem . You 've damaging your body and starting to see the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen people die from cirrhosis of the liver and it 's not a pretty way to go . <p> Nothing anyone is going to tell you in an internet forum is a substitute for the advice of a competent doctor after doing a though in-person exam .

At one point last year , it got so bad I could barely walk and it felt like something was pushing my toes up at an uncomfortable angle . It also felt like the bones in my feet were pulling apart . I also had those weird bumps on my knees , arms , elbows , and they hurt like hell whenever they touched or scraped anything . I finally broke down and got checked out ( long story short , I was in a really bad financial problem and put off seeing a doctor because I could n't afford to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ) . I found out my blood sugar was almost 500 . Also found out the bumps were related to my cholestorol . They 've pretty much gone away since getting that under control . <p> For the most part , I 've been keeping it somewhat under control , and the neuropathy has eased . My doctor put me on Gabapentin , which can sometimes help . I 'm supposed to take two a day , but I normally only need one . <p> Anyway , get checked out . I 'm not sure what you drink , but through testing I 've found I can enjoy a few Sam Adams without spiking my blood sugar . Blue Moon , on the other hand , does spike me so I avoid it . 
@@96059180 @259180/ <p> I 'm sure everyone here is aware of the ratio problem in America . It only seems to be getting worse . This a lengthy post , but it 's accurate . I 've been to other countries , nowhere has this problem the way you do in America , well maybe China , but at least it 's documented there . It 's well known the Anglosphere is bad , but America takes the cake here , by a wide margin , and in more ways than one . <p> Basically , among non-married people , even when you include gay men , men in jail , men overseas ... there 's still a massive abundance of single straight men . America is one big sausagefest outside of some college campuses . At this point , it 's the United States of Hillshire Farm . Male/female ratios in the US when adjusted to include fat women ( who might as well be men ) are probably worse than mainland China , or easily within 1 standard deviation ( it 's never been scientifically quantified but does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lots of fat men too . At least the average Chinese woman has a BMI within normal limits . If the average American woman sits on you , there 's a good chance you might end up Shanghai 'd . <p> 107:100 is the worldwide birth ratio ( 105 or 106:100 in some countries ) . I knew as a kid there were way more boys than girls . It was depressing to know that fact at a young age . The birth ratio explains it . Years ago , I worked with a guy in Chicago who told me in 3rd grade , his class was all boys . I did n't believe him , so he brought in his class picture from back then . 20 boys , not 1 girl , a co-ed school . <p> No one talks about this , immigration in the US has always been overwhelmingly male , probably going back to the days of Ellis Island . I 'm not sure where the statistic is , but when Mexicans &amp; Central Americans were crossing the Rio Grande en masse , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their H1B visa to churn out computer codes all day ... almost exclusively male . The current situation is this . Any woman who is n't fat , at least average looking , does n't matter if she 's on food stamps , welfare , multiple " baby daddy 's " , criminal record - she will have a revolving door of men every time she unlocks her smartphone main screen . Whether its standard text , facebook likes , facebook messages , kik , snapchat , instagram , whatsapp , skype ... it 's never ending . Men have never had to deal with this before . The extremely lopsided ratios do n't help either . Attention typically reserved for strippers on the clock is now commonplace for any American woman who is n't fat , at least average looking , and happens to be on social media , which most everyone is on in some capacity . <p> I 've gone out with women who were attractive , but had baggage ( there 's not much choice in Middle America ) , have kids , on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages in a week . A lot are repeat messages , but they are there nonetheless . It was easier 10 years ago in the days of AOL instant messenger and nokia phones . Today , it 's become impossible ( or exceedingly difficult ) to really keep a woman . Marriage or a long-term relationship is simply a losing proposition . I do know some happily married people but they 're exceptions . My friends who are in long term relationships seem to be in this never-ending cycle of her threatening to leave , and having to constantly deal with that . <p> Attraction ( or simply not being fat and at least average ) has trumped fertility . I 've gone out with women ranging from early 20s to late 40s , and regardless of age , they all had several men-in-orbit ranging from guys in their early 20s to men in their 60s ( orbiting goes up exponentially if a woman has been on a dating site even one hour ) . Conventional wisdom would say an attractive woman in her 20s has the most worthy suitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might see them as too difficult and will go for one who is slightly older first . Even fat women unless they 're Humpty Dumpty personified get attention from regular guys several points above them . It 's really that bad . I will use 3 examples of women I 've talked to lately that messaged me first on a popular dating site . I entertained the conversations out of curiosity although I typically would n't bother responding to them . <p> 1 . 52 year old woman . Would be considered attractive for her age . Confirmed what I knew , tons of messages from younger guys telling her how much they love older women . Brags that she can get men half her own age easily . Seemed offended I was n't interested . <p> 2 . Overweight blonde woman early 30s ( probably hovering around 180 standing 5 ' 5 ) . Confirmed she gets messages daily telling her " I love your curves " , " voluptuous women are sexy " , " I want a woman like you to keep me warm in winter " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step in the ring with Lennox Lewis . There 's a ton of these , usually seem to specialize in the " if you do n't love me at my worst you do n't deserve me at my best " mentality . A pass to be mean and inconsiderate whenever she wants . I told her it 's stupid to think that way and to buy a treadmill . <p> 3 . Attractive white/hispanic girl with genital herpes , mid 20s . She mentioned it in the first message . I asked her how its affected her dating life . She says it has n't at all . Gets messages saying " hey I do n't  mind that you have it , I think it makes you special " . " If other guys do n't want you for it , I will " . " I do n't judge you and will only care for you more " , or " If I get it from you let 's be together " . <p> The men telling these women those things are doing so mainly as a shortcut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex drive combined with lack of prostitution gives them more options than they could dream of . The 3rd one is attractive ( a legit 7 ) so guys supplicate heavily on the fact she has herpes hoping she gives them a chance . The inverse would not be true for a man . Twice as many women have it as men but there are obviously guys willing to get it so they essentially can try to lock her down . <p> The fat women probably know most of those guys do n't want them for more than a one-night stand or short term fling , but it has to be very validating receiving that attention constantly from men several points above them . A below average woman gets more attention than a very above average man does unless he 's famous . Legalize prostitution , and watch the fat woman 's pseudo-desirability sink like the Titanic . <p> Stuff that worked back in the day like playful jokes in the first message can potentially get you blocked right away now . They want you to supplicate for their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a man , you are just a number , a commodity she can bring out of a box and put back whenever she wants . There 's been a massive change in the past 2 years now that absolutely everyone has a smartphone and the constant connection to social media . I 'd estimate using my own data there 's probably about 15-20 normal , in-shape men ranging from average looking to very good looking for every 1 woman who is not fat &amp; considered at least cute anywhere from 20s to 40s . If you count the men who are complete tools , its probably closer to 100 men for 1 attractive woman . <p> The gender imbalance is starting to manifest itself in some strange ways . I 'm going to address these individually . It 's making men stupid , men are turning gay just to get off , excessive drugs/drinking , rioting , cuckoldry/polygamy ( rise of the SMF ) , societal rudeness , now or never ( using their slew of options against you ) , posting updates asking for favors , having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . <p> - Guys are getting stupider . A guy gets a woman 's number online , instantly texts her a picture of his junk . I 've had women personally tell me they were surprised I did n't do that . Basically , there 's a large subset of American men who ca n't even think correctly these days . <p> - As a somewhat androgynous very dapper guy , I seem to attract interest from society-deemed straight men on occasion . This has happened in the past , but it 's almost a given these days . I 'll be at a bar , some guy will start talking to me , ask if I 'm gay/bi ( I 'm not ) and tell me it 's something he wants to try . Some will jokingly ask me off the bat if I will dress up in drag , i.e. they 'd rather project an attractive female in a male than actually be with a fat or unattractive real female . These guys are either single , in sexless marriages , or they are not satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . Facebook accounts of passable transgenders have orbiters these days I 've noticed from men who identify as straight . <p> - Craigslist DL . Look in any town of at least 100k people in the m4m casual encounters section . There 's men openly admitting they are willing to go gay because they could n't find a woman at the bar that night , men that struck out sending their usual barrage of copy/paste messages online to any woman who is n't fat and at least average . There 's even gay men trying to court straight men . Be prepared though , you 'll see some weird stuff and overtly perverse taglines . <p> - Excessive drinking . You see it all the time . Closing time is nearing , the lights are about to go on , so they decide to order a shot of tequila with a beer , because they know they 're just gon na end up at home watching porn . Lots of them get behind the wheel and endanger the general public . Some also turn to excessive drug use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her away from her friends since women only go out on " girls nights " these days it seems . They 'll probably try to delay you by getting food . If I had it my way I 'd make every IHOP close early . <p> - Rioting during any unpopular racially-charged verdict usually involving a white cop and black male . All these men doing that probably would n't if they had a good woman in their lives . In the past year it 's happened in Baltimore &amp; St. Louis . These are essentially mini civil wars led by unhinged men . <p> - " The Single Married Female " . Lots of men unfortunately are learning to accept cuckoldry . For some , it 's a fetish , for others they know she is constantly bombarded with male attention , so she 'll just do what she wants anyways . I 've met a few of these women . They are paradoxically easier to get in bed than a woman who has so many options she ca n't decide . It 's usually just a one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby boomer generation overall seem much more pleasant than whatever generation/s after that is . Women become entitled , men get desperate . Men are constantly on edge because even if their girlfriend/fiance/wife is a couple points below them ( or has a lower SMV ) , she still has way more options than him . The only exception here is being a celebrity , and a sex symbol male celebrity at that . <p> - Woman tells you to meet her , but it has to be right now or exactly when she tells you . This is your only chance sometimes . If you do n't , the revolving door of men is right there and it 's not closing . They will use that against you as well using terminology like " Well I have about 40 guys who want to hang out so fine I wo n't meet you then if you ca n't when I 'm available " . <p> - Using men only for favors . A woman will put on her tinder or plentyoffish page in the headline " Someone bring me **25;677;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump on it like a jug of water in the middle of the Sahara . It means they 'll get a minute alone with her . I actually know women who have done this , then bragged about in facebook , to get comments from orbiters saying " Hey next time you need something tell me first " . It 's gotten to a point the orbiters start praising her amongst each other not realizing they 're making themselves look like a bigger stooge than Octavio the clown . Arguably the biggest goofball ever shown on film . <p> - Accepting you 're just a guy on " her list " . She is concurrently seeing other guys or has a buffer stock of men to choose from at any given time . One guy she cuddles with , another guy goes down on her ( sometimes gets nothing in return sometimes does ) , another guy is strictly a booty call ( this is what you should always go for ) , another guy pays her cell phone bill in exchange for blow jobs . Banging a woman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . You 'll be laying next to her in bed , and it 's text/text/text/text from other guys . Women also have orbiters from faraway places . These poor saps hope they can somehow use the distance to show their appreciation , i.e. the knight in shining armor from afar . <p> In my current town ( a mid-sized city in middle america in the middle of nowhere ) there 's constant headlines " XYZ county sets record for arrests in one year " . " Vote for prison expansion today " . " The sheriff wants to arrest even more this year than last " . Expect all crime under the sun to rise when you have this many additional males . <p> The mainstream media has started to address this imbalance slightly . During a discussion of one of those recent shootings , a famous psychologist on CNN said the situation in the USA simply is n't good for straight men and brought up the ratio and how it 's not talked about . Unfortunately , we are only going to see more of this behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gay teens being bullied , and the right is still puritanical . <p> Do n't get me wrong , anyone being bullied is a problem , and I support equal rights for all . If anything , it would help if questioning men choose that alternate persuasion . Even if all of them did , it still would n't be nearly enough . <p> Fixing the ratios would call for a worldwide immigration program granting women immediate legal status in the US ( must have BMI within normal limits ) . Also the deportation of illegal men would have to happen , and some sort of financial incentive to get American women back in shape with additional incentive if they keep it off . Waive their college loans . Something . Obviously this wo n't happen , but until it does do n't expect things to change in the US anytime soon . This is sadly the most violent developed country on earth . As irrational as the Hivemind is ( they might as well be sent to Pluto ) , there 's no way they can be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US is already there . <p> You have to essentially prove to women these days you do n't need them and not let them use their fan club against you . There might not be a better time to work in porn or own a strip club . You have to " proof " yourself against their bargaining chip , which is the fact they have way more options than you , even if you 're a high value man ( which I assume many of you here are ) . <p> The left &amp; right both will blame each other on the economy all day long . Both need to wake up and realize they 're both wrong . A lot of American men can not really feel motivated to work or be productive when even to keep an average-not-fat-woman is difficult and she has about 50 more options at any given time than you do . While it 's a different topic for a different day , the average working man can not make enough money to even support a family these days . <p> I 'm convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , they 'd personally unleash Torquemada on all straight men . A single straight man above 30 not married with no kids will most likely be viewed as strange or some kind of social idiot unless in a major coastal city where you are n't expected to be married in your 20s . Yet across America , a single gay man above 30 checking grindr or craigslist every 5 minutes looking for a new " bud " as they call it should be looked at with reverence now . <p> It was different before smartphones &amp; social media . Social media itself did n't create the orbit problem , Women had orbiters , but nothing like today . Essentially , men &amp; women have gone rogue . Too many women would rather brag about " binge watching " Orange Is The New Black while downing a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry 's , post that on facebook , and watch the incoming tsunami of likes or instant invitations via the chat box now that it 's announced she does n't have plans that particular night . To be fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , and happen to be American . Thankfully , not everyone is susceptible to the Hivemind . <p> The most prized commodity in the US is n't even gold at this moment . It 's single , thin , attractive , feminine , non-bitchy women . Any presidential candidate who addresses this ratio and wants to fix it would win the male vote minus the SWPL contingent . Meaning , they 'd easily win . Trump should address it if he wants to win ( assuming voting is real which it probably is n't ) . <p> ( 08-11-2015 04:07 AM ) toysoldier Wrote : - As a somewhat androgynous very dapper guy , I seem to attract interest from society-deemed straight men on occasion .

Even though not everywhere is the situation as hopeless as in the U.S./eu sphere , everyone who has traveled and paid a bit of attention will notice the same patterns all around the world : with 7+ billion people we are not only facing a dramatically overpopulated planet , but it is male overpopulation in particular that is the driving force behind all the misery we are confronted with today . <p> No amount of migration wil help and if we take a historic perspective of where the future will lead ... <p> This is interesting .

In the US , society will publically hang you for any minor crime and it will most likely follow you forever . They might as well bring back town criers in most of the US . There are tons of backpage escort ads opposed to very few real craigslist non-escort ads of women looking for men . I knew a stripper who was on backpage , and checked her emails from her smartphone during smoke breaks at the strip club . Easily over 500 in a day , and keep in mind in any decent sized city there 's a revolving door of backpage escort ads ( a lot of them starting at $200 for half hour , they know they can charge basically anything , men are that desperate in the US ) . Another thing , prostitution stings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SJW 's would probably go into a full chant if that ever happened . <p> I 've also noticed online there 's a new thing going on legitimate dating sites and tinder/blendr where you have girls who claim they 're 21 , but after a few messages tell you they 're 17 . Being a straight guy in the US is a slippery slope these days . When you do find an LTR ( I think more guys than not still want that ) you have to deal with her constantly getting bombarded by male attention . It 's hypergamy at the press of a button . <p> Will be interesting to see if this gender imbalance ever makes it the mainstream . <p> ( 10-10-2015 08:42 PM ) shayneToxic Wrote : I used to work with a woman who had genital herpes and she told me on a herpes dating site there were lots of guys who did n't have it but figured it would be easier to get with women who do have it if they said they do .

All the tourists go there and approaching is easy . Just find yourself a comfortable spot and holler at the passing traffic as they come through .

Bar hop a bit there , look out for Americans ( Campo de Fiori attracts a lot of tourists ) . On weekends it can be completely thronged by the end of the night . Also watch out for Italian hooligan types being rowdy or aggressive . I 've seen fights and bottles getting thrown around . You can just stroll around and jump into the action at any of the small bars and pubs in the area . <p> If you want big techno places and a wild party scene with a very diverse crowd go to Via Monte Testaccio .

I propose that modern Western civilization , with its ideas of individualism , materialism , and hedonism , have created a toxic environment that is hurting men more severely than had they been raised in a traditional society , using my own life path as a case study .

@@96059196 @259196/ <p> Guys , so I find myself going out with a nice 29 year old Eastern European girl on many date 's and she wants a commitment out of me . There are really no problems in the " relationship " except for the fact that I ca n't quite get past her look . She is constantly messaging me , calling me , and sending naughty pics . While she has a smoking body ( ex-college athlete ) which i 'd rate an 8.5 she has one thing that I find disturbing , and that is that one side of her face around cheek area has bad acne scars , we are talking about worse than Cameron Diaz ( on left ) type of acne scars and they appear to be " permanent " , which even the make-up ca n't fully conceal it . I asked her if it was a burn scar and she avoided the question . I am not sure how to bring up the theme of her seeing a plastic surgeon ( do n't think a dermatologist would be enough ) without her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area with her hair and makeup all the time . Therefore the face I can only generously give a 6 . So , my question is have any of you guys dated girls with bad acne scars and how have you been able to overcome this ? I know the saying go 's " beauty is only skin deep " but this is something that also worries me a bit in public with her . How are you handling it with girls who you are considering taking to the next level , i.e. , having a serious relationship ( or should I try to break off contact as it will only get worse as she ages ? ) . Thanks for any input . <p> Think about it this way : when a relationship first starts out you do n't mind her flaws as much , but as it progresses the flaws will become more of an issue as the newness of the relationship wears off . <p> If you think it bothers you now , wait 6 months , you wo n't even want to kiss her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix them .

As for Brad Pitt , Ray Liotta , etc. , you can still see them clearly in later films like Inglorious Bastards , I think it 's just that they are disguised a little better than previously . <p> It depends on her and you.if this chick views the scar as a big deal then deep down her she wants to have you to boost her self esteem . You should have your own defination of beauty and what you want which you should never compromise .

By then , she already knew I was married because I found her too unattractive to lie to her , but my other head was still willing to get to know her better .

The campus is also beautiful with sandstone Victorian era architecture , not to mention very conveniently located . <p> Melbourne is a city you will either love or hate , depending on what kind of person you are . It has a population of 4.6 million people and is the cultural , arts and sporting capital of Australia . It is also one of the most hipster cities in the world , up there with Berlin or Portland . It is actually the dominant culture here . By that I mean that it pervades the entire inner city even in the supposedly non-hipster areas and even has a noticeable impact on the fashion and cultural tastes of what you would call the frat/sorority or jock/cheerleader type in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't venture into the outer suburbs suburbs the jacked brutish bogan stereotype you might encounter in Bali is not much of an issue here . You are essentially trading off the obesity and masculine behaviour of the bogan females for the alternative fashions and left-wing politics of the hipsters . <p> I do n't know what your race is but Melbourne is also an inter-racial dating mecca because of it 's hipsterness . It is easily the most " progressive " city in the country , much more so even than Sydney . If you 're African American and even just average looking you will have a big advantage in Australia in general but even more so in Melbourne . On the flipside being white and American is a disadvantage in Australia because of negative stereotypes stemming from politics , it started because of George W. Bush and you can expect it to get even worse now because of Trump . A lot of Aussies seem to believe that white Americans are obese , racist Evangelical Christian gun lovers , especially in Melbourne . <p> What that is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban amenity and girls , you will love it here . If you do n't , you 're shit out of luck unless you have an Asian fetish and want to focus on girls fresh off the boat from China . The only other option is daygaming the European backpackers during the Summer but that will dry up as it gets colder . If none of those appeal to you , the chances of you having a good sex life here are very very slim unless you 're in top few % of men looks wise . <p> Keep in mind the cost of living is high here . If you want to live close enough to the city centre to be able to go out and game without having to leave your own neighbourhood , your typical rent will be AUD$1,000 a month each for a place with housemates . It 's still a lot better than Sydney but on a PhD budget you will probably be struggling . I would say at the minimum you 'd need to be able to afford AUD$800 rent a month here plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand if you can get work here , the minimum wage is around AUD$16.50 an hour . If you can afford it and you like hipsters and/or have an Asian fetish then yeah come , they do n't call us the most livable city in the world for nothing . Otherwise , Melbourne is not the place for you and you most likely wo n't have a good time here . <p> University of Maryland is a pretty good school which is known in the US and even outside of the US . Having it on your resume , even if it 's a one year program , would help you find a job in the US , particularly on the East Coast . You can also travel around the US during that year : drive or take the train up north to NYC , Boston and many other places . Drive down south to Florida and other places in between .

The area immediately south of the campus on Route 1 is also safe . If you go really far south on Route 1 into Hyattsville and Mount Rainer , it gets more dangerous , but I still do n't think it 's that bad . Really ugly female student body , especially for a school that size . Also , really bad restaurant choices . All joking aside , the Applebees on Route 1 may be the best restaurant around there . As for the water sports question , for surfing you have to take a three hour drive to Ocean City , Rehoboth , Dewey , or Bethany , or a three to four hour drive to the southern Jersey Shore .

Its by far the easiest non beach-party gaming environment I 've ever experienced , and I 've traveled a lot . The American college drinking culture is also just amazing fun . Frat parties , keggers , tailgating for college football games etc . Its unique , and great . <p> Melbourne is a lovely city to be a 40 year old with a family in - good amenities , safe etc . But its absolutely horrendous for game if you 're not a hipster . The problem is twofold : so many girls are unattractive hipsters , and so many girls want hipster men .

And on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing worth considering is you wo n't be able to go back and experience the American college party lifestyle when you 're 30+ . But you can easily travel to Melbourne and check out the nightlife there when you 're that age . So if you do Maryland first , you can always do Melbourne later . But the reverse probably is n't true . <p> I just looked up where the University of Maryland actually is. 15km from the center of the nearest big city , and that city is Washington D.C ? Damn son . You know what they say , logistics logistics logistics my friend . Bare in mind the University of Melbourne is smack dab in the heart of the city , the public transport network is very extensive and it runs 24/7 on weekends . <p> ( 01-06-2017 11:30 AM ) zatara Wrote : Melbourne is a lovely city to be a 40 year old with a family in - good amenities , safe etc .

I should add that to make things worse , even if you do have yellow fever for some reason the Asian girls born in Australia are the cuntiest of them all ( I strongly suspect the same is true of Asian-American girls also ) and almost all of the FOB 's who you 'd be going for would be Chinese , who are one of the least attractive Asian groups anyway . <p> Being south african changes everything .

The rugby reference makes me strongly suspect you 're from New South Wales or Queensland . Your advice is more suited to Australia generally , but is n't relevant for inner Melbourne or UoM where OP would be living and studying .

It is true that American girls put out incredibly fast , but I have had a few experiences with Muslim girls ( particularly Persian and Afghan girls ) that have really put things into perspective for me . These girls are from conservative families and are restricted from doing a great many things . Muslim girls have to face the dichotomy of seeing their friends go wild at parties , have casual sex , etc. while they are left on the sidelines . I think it is because of this dichotomy that Muslim girls in the US are easier than girls from other backgrounds . The Persian girl I had sex with was called Reema .

@@96059207 @259207/ <p> While I have n't banged the drum of narcissism as a metaphor for our current social malaise recently , I still think that much can be learned from a complete understanding of the subject . As such , I will be continuing my in-depth book review of " The Culture Of Narcissism " that I started some time ago . <p> The second chapter is entitled , " The Narcissistic Personality Of Our Time " and is broken into five subsections with the most important information coming at the beginning of the chapter . <p> Narcissism As A Metaphor For The Human Condition <p> One of the grave -- if not chief -- concerns with any discussion of psychology is how so many of its terms and concepts are at great risk for moral inflation . Lasch notes that many critics of the " new narcissism " simply dress up moral platitudes in psychiatric grab . This is a terribly misguided attempt at using the concept of narcissism as a tool for social analysis . For example , progressive critics of society have often criticized this " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eradication of ancient prejudices and reorganization of society . This critique is unsound : firstly , men have always been selfish and ethnocentric and secondly , it drains the term " narcissism " of any real clinical meaning and uses the term in service of humanistic dogmas . <p> In order for any psychiatric term to have any real meaning , it much be considered a clinical perspective : what is the etiology of narcissism ? It is n't simply a metaphor for the human condition , but a wildly exaggerated form of real human wants and needs . Lasch sprinkles this chapter too liberally with all the various indicators of pathological narcissism , so I will just listen some salient ones here : <p> dependence on the vicarious warmth provided by others combined with a fear of dependence <p> a sense of inner emptiness <p> boundless repressed rage <p> pseudo self-insight <p> calculating seductiveness <p> nervous , self-deprecating humor <p> intense fear of old age and death <p> altered , ahistorical sense of time <p> fascination with celebrity <p> fear of competition <p> decline of play spirit <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with individuals , not groups . The trouble with trying to generalize clinical findings to groups is that groups have a life of their own . Individual psychic needs are necessarily subordinated to the demands of the group . It is precisely the demands of the group -- society , here -- that causes individuals to alter or displace their psychic needs , thus meaning that careful , intensive study of individuals -- using psychoanalysis , not common sense -- can tell us something about the inner workings of society . <p> Every society reproduces its culture ( norms , assumptions , collective goals , etc. ) in individuals in the form of personality . In other words , personality is merely the person socialized . The family is by far the primary agent of socialization , with schools , media and other agencies of character formation coming second . These institutions try -- in their own way -- to deal with the common and painful crises of childhood : separation from the mother , the fear of abandonment , competing with others for a mother 's love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- produces personality . In other words , personality can be seen as how a society chooses to prepare its children for the reality of existing as a finite human whose needs can only truly be met by others . <p> For the rest of the chapter , Lasch lays out and builds on some basic Freudian psychological analysis . He stresses the incredibly important point that psychoanalysis best explains the relationships between society , individuals , culture and personality when it confines itself to clinical appraisals of individuals . Psychoanalysis tells us the most about society when it makes no attempt to do so whatsoever . By careful , evidence-based assessments of individuals , psychoanalysis can tell us much about the patterns of behavior engendered in individuals by society . <p> Newborns do not perceive their needs as coming from themselves , but as originating in their mothers . They do not yet possess the ability to understand that their mother has a separate existence from their own . Primary narcissism is characterized by this inability to separate the self from surrounding objects : the person does n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their emotional maturity is arrested at the outset of infancy . Secondary narcissism develops after this crucial stage of human development meaning the secondary narcissist has the ability to recognize that needs originate within the self . <p> Narcissism In Recent Clinical Literature <p> More recent psychoanalytic literature has begun to emphasize the study of secondary narcissism , not primary narcissism . No longer did patients present -- as they did in Freud 's time -- with well-defined neuroses . Now , the typical patient presents with diffuse dissatisfactions , purposelessness and unshakable feelings of emptiness and depression . Instead of crippling fixations or enervating phobias , the modern patient has violent oscillations of self-esteem and " acts out " conflicts instead of repressing or sublimating them . <p> Lasch reemphasizes that pathology simply represents a " heightened sense of normality . " The personalities that present to modern psychiatrists are merely a reflect of social phenomenon . The patients are adept at managing impressions given to nursing and psychiatric staff , are ravenous for admiration of others but contemptuous of those he manipulates into giving him it and insatiably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner void . <p> He goes on to utilize more Freudian psychoanalysis of this particular sort of character . It is beyond the interest of this summation to break it apart , but what should be readily apparent is that this sort of person 's intrapsychic world is so " thinly-populated " they experience extraordinarily intense feelings of inauthenticity and rage . Their psychic world consists only of the " grandiose self " and shadowy , flickering images of the self and others . <p> He further explains why this sort of personality results in so much personal anguish and discomfort . They are unable to truly intellectually or spiritually connect with the world because they care so little for the world if it does n't relate to them . Their protective shallowness precludes any serious emotional connection with another person . They are chronically bored , eternally searching for an external salve for their inner disquiet , often using sex and new age therapies towards that end . <p> Social Influences On Narcissism <p> Every age develops its own distinct pathologies . In Freud 's time , hysteria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of industry and capitalism at the time . These pathologies were characterized by a certain acquisitiveness , a zealous devotion to work and a strong repression of sexuality . <p> Modern times have seen more preschizophrenic , borderline and personality disordered patients . Lasch cites several psychiatrists , noting this change has been happening since at least World War II . The seismic shift from symptom neuroses to character disorders represents the inner direction to narcissism . <p> Take note of these two important excerpts : <p> Quote:Today 's patients by and large do not suffer from hysterical paralyses of the legs or hand-washing compulsions ; instead it is their very psychic selves that have gone numb or that they must scrub and rescrub in an exhausting and unending effort to come clean . <p> Quote:According to Sheldon Bach , " You used to see people coming in with hand-washing compulsions , phobias and familiar neuroses . Now you mostly see narcissists . <p> Lasch rebuts arguments that psychiatry has simply caught up to the real prevalence of character disorders , as this growing obsession with the self has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians and corporate managers . <p> In a needlessly lengthy bit , he explains how this " new narcissist " is a perfect fit in many ways to the modern workplace . He further explains how our vastly " over-organized " society approximates the universal animosity that Hobbes called the state of nature . While interesting , these bits are n't terribly relevant to the general thrust of the chapter . <p> The Worldview of the Resigned <p> New forms of social organization require new personalities and ways of organizing experience . Narcissism provides us not with a cut-and-dry way of understanding modern society , but it helps us understand the impact of recent social changes . Narcissism -- in many ways -- represents the best way of coping with the anxiety of modern life , and the prevailing social zeitgeist that coaxes out narcissistic traits that reside in us all . <p> Through the institutions of the family and schools/media , social patterns reproduce themselves in personality . These patterns live on in the individual , buried beneath consciousness , even after these patterns are recognized to be unhealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afflicts so many individuals is simply a way of merely surviving in a society that believes it has no future . As Lasch concludes , this ideology of narcissism is the faith of those without faith . <p> Old Chinese Man Wrote : why you wonder how many man another man bang ? why you care who bang who mr high school drama man <p> Dr. Kahn Wrote : i on the other hand will be banging hotter chicks and still be DOCTOR KHAN .

This level of emotional honesty is extremely rare . A great many men experience resentment -- specifically , the kind of sexual resentment you describe here -- as one of their strongest and most burning emotions . Indeed , for many men , it is the defining emotion of their lives . But virtually no men will ever straightforwardly admit to it ; there is nothing more hidden from public view and more persistently and cagily lied about and dissimulated . To the extent that men lie about their psychology -- and they do -- varieties of resentment are what they lie about with the greatest care ; so it is bracing , and good , to see it laid out in an intimate and unadorned way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp and bitter sting , across the screen and across the ocean ; the pixels themselves seem to burn with it . <p> It is truly excellent that you did not keep this resentment to yourself , but had the instinct to bring it out into the open . And now you should seize upon this opportunity to examine this resentment , to reflect on it , and most importantly , to rid yourself of it as completely as possible . <p> You should let go completely of this sexual resentment and the attendant regrets about the past . There are few things that are more insidiously corrosive to a man 's mind and heart than resentment felt -- even intermittently -- across a long period of time , years and years of a life . Resentment evacuates a man 's best energies , thoughts and feelings ; and over time , it makes him curdle into something as small and bitter as the emotion itself . It is a dreadful spiritual fate , and it is not a fate that any man should want for himself ; yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lesser extent . <p> Men like to attribute this diminishment to the world around them , saying that it has changed for the worse , and has lost its lustre ; but it is they that have changed , it is they who have curdled into smallness and bitterness because of resentments that have been allowed to fester for too long and corrode their hearts and souls . The world is still there , in all its splendor ; but not for them . What could be more terrible ? <p> How do you let go of an emotion so deep and seemingly insuperable ? It seems impossible . As you say in your post , all the reminders about the sexual success you 've had at various points in your life do n't seem to touch this bitter resentment of other men who are having it right now , and the feeling that one has been robbed of it in one 's youth and can never get those years back . It seems as if experiencing an emotion like this is not a choice ; you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only remedy seems to be ever more " self-improvement " , in the hope that getting back what 's yours will relieve the sting . What else can one do ? <p> But this is not so . What most men do not understand is that feelings , emotions -- and particularly powerful and persistent ones -- do not occur in a vacuum . All feeling proceeds from thought . The reason you can have this lingering emotion of resentment , which is sometimes tamed but sometimes bursts into the open , is because there are certain thoughts and ideas about the world that you hold . It is these thoughts and ideas that lead to the emotion and make it possible . If those thoughts and ideas were to change -- truly change , from something you believe to be the case to something you no longer believe -- the emotion , soon enough , would change as well . <p> What are the thoughts and ideas that lead to this emotion of intense sexual resentment ? They are , more or less , the following : <p> -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life ; there is no other good that compares to it . -- The part of sexual success that makes it a great good is its purely psychological component , the validation received by being able to seduce sufficiently attractive and high value women . The physical pleasure of the sex itself is secondary at best . <p> You would not experience the kind of intense and bitter sexual resentment described in your post if you did not believe both of these statements to be true . Of course you may tell yourself that you do not believe one or both ; but the emotion proves that you do . <p> Why is that ? The intensity of the emotion is enough to show that you believe the first idea . If sexual success were merely one good among many others , its absence at periods in your life , and its possession by others , would cause at most a mild pang ; you would not feel a world-enveloping resentment -- and what you describe is nothing less -- unless you believed that sexual success is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they might as well be worthless . <p> As for the second part , let me note that the kind of resentment you feel is essentially unrelated to the idea of sexual pleasure as such . As you remark , women were not even on your mind that particular night . If you were to think back , you would find that you feel this resentment most acutely not when in a state of sexual excitement -- even unsatisfied sexual excitement -- but indeed , in states where that sexual excitement is largely absent . Thwarted appetites -- as such -- can lead to frustration ; thwarted lust or being " blue-balled " can lead to intense sexual frustration ; and you will recognize that this is an entirely different emotion from what you 've described . Resentment is something completely different from frustration , and its source is always psychological , not physical . <p> It follows , then , that not only do you believe that sexual success is the great and ultimate good before which all others pale ; but also , that the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very fact of the success itself , the validation and achievement that it represents ; the physical pleasure derived from it being a mere bonus at best . These beliefs are what enables the burning emotion of resentment of other men who enjoy sexual success while you do n't ; and also the terrible regret of having been deprived of this success in the past . <p> Now we come to the point . Both of these beliefs are false . And if you can come to see that they are false -- not merely to say it , but to actually see it -- the emotion of resentment that proceeds from them will no longer be able to exist in your heart , because the thoughts that lead to it will no longer reside in your mind . And so you will be rid of an emotion that , if unchecked , threatens to corrode and lessen your spirit and to curdle it into something less than what it can and should be . <p> The fundamental reason these beliefs are false is that , very generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectivity and the world outside the self . One 's personal success or failure , and all that attends to it , is simply too narrow a field to constitute the greatest good . Subjective psychology , and all its paces and iterations , is something quite finite and limited ; whereas the world at large , the world outside the self , is endlessly various , complex and unlimited . To be fundamentally absorbed in one 's psychology is an error -- not so much a moral failing as a cognitive error . It simply misses the fact that the greatest and most important part of life is what happens outside the self . <p> Almost all intelligent men are guilty of this error to a lesser or greater extent ; and indeed sexual psychology or the psychology of eros is the one that they privilege most often , but there are other varieties as well . And in very large part , this error is due to the literary conventions that intelligent men imbibe virtually with their mother 's milk . For a very long time , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inquiry and concentration ; they made it seem as if these were the most important subjects . As a result , there is no other belief that is more characteristic of the intelligent literary man than the notion that the entire play of life unfolds , more or less , within the theater of the psychological self ; and that the psychology of eros is its grandest and most serious stage , the locus of life 's most profound tragedies and most intense melodramas . <p> But to see through that belief is to realize just how limited and narrow in scope it really is . The greatest part of life does not consist of the harshly constrained dramas and tragedies of the self ; rather , it consists of the vast and endless comedy of the world outside the self .

He may and will strive for other forms of success , and for pleasure where he may find it ; but he will not lose sight of the fact that the vagaries of psychology -- whatever they may be , including that hot and narrow band of sexual psychology and its attendant defeats and triumphs -- are never for long to occupy the topmost position on the podium of his mind . That place of honor should be reserved for the only thing vast enough and various enough to reward endless concentration and attention , and that is the objective world outside the self and all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can think is " that should 've been me when I was 20 " . What that kid that was Phoenix , what his life was then should never have happened . Never . No one should have had to suffer that , whilst people like those guys were off getting their dick wet like it was nothing . " <p> edit : I assume you 're from a religious upbringing where you were taught that chasing tail is wrong . <p> Every year a new crop turns 18 man . and the carefree young people you see hooking up will perish in droves when the economy collapses soon . that sounds very shadenfreude but it 's true . all the young people partying it up will probably suffer or at least have a shitty quality of life down the road . These are the same types of young people who live carefree , in the moment are the ones politicians will fuck the hardest , as like you said , they are positive , happy people who avoid negativity. but reality is quickly becoming negative for many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to handle adversity or adapt to a changing economy . <p> You value women too much , you should n't take them seriously . they are n't meant to be ' understood ' so to speak . There 's nothing profound about who they decide to fuck . That 's like going to a dog park and getting mad a dog would n't chase your Frisbee because a shiny tennis ball stole its attention first . <p> I like reading posts like that too . It reminds me that all of us have the same experiences . <p> I have had moments like that . And I still have them . It 's natural . <p> The anger comes from rage at knowing that you were lied to , that no one was there to help you learn about women , and from the sense of lost time . <p> It is really a melancholy reflection on the brevity of life , and the loss of perceived opportunities . <p> I remember having one pronounced experience like that . It was a long time ago . I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two girls come in . The girls were very attractive . The guys were ( in my opinion at least ) not . <p> I knew very little about attracting and dating women . I was awkward and inept around women . But I knew I had the raw materials . But I was so furious at my lack of success , and the idea that someone was getting more than I was , that I had to get up and leave . <p> It was a moment of transcendent rage . <p> That was the straw that broke the camel 's back for me . I said : No . More . Failure . <p> I was sick and tired of failing with women . I would not accept failure any more . <p> So I forced myself to change . Everything : clothes , habits , dress , conversation , everything . I attached myself to guys who had smooth social skills and imitated what they did . <p> And on a modest scale , I began to see results . <p> But you are still haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I understand you , Phoenix , man . <p> But you have to let go of the anger . Let it go . Here 's why : <p> 1 . Your parents were just as clueless as you were . They probably did the best they could but did n't have the tools to help you . <p> 2 . Focusing on the injuries and resentments of the past will blind you to the opportunities that exist now . You might miss new opportunities if you keep thinking about the old stuff . <p> 3 . Maybe your old failures helped you in some ways you can not yet appreciate . Maybe those failures made you a man of iron . Maybe they shaped you into being what you are . Do n't underestimate the power of failure to produce good things . <p> 4 . You will always feel like someone is getting more than you . It is human nature . Do n't focus on that . Focus on your own level of virtue . Be satisfied with the things you have , not what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to realize just how limited and narrow in scope it really is .

" <p> And yet we all instinctively know that neckbeard guy and Lebron James are in fact not on the same level , and it is completely fanciful to imagine that there is n't a vast chasm between them . Is n't this why we one this forum place so much emphasis on self improvement ? Why bother with lifting , making money , and chasing women if the true meaning of life is to convince yourself that all that really matters is enjoying the view as life passes you by ? <p> Chalk it up to the game and realize how far you 've come - which I realize is an easy thing to say and a much harder thing to internalize in your own head . All I can say it with a lot of time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this bother you . This is part of growing up and realizing that it 's just not worth getting upset over the things you ca n't control - such as other guys going home with a girl , or worrying about the past and what might have been . <p> Look back to reflect and learn from the mistakes and successes of your past . Look around to best make decisions and live more happily in the moment . Look forward to map out who you want to be and how you want to live . <p> Never worry about the things that are out of your control . It 's just not worth the stress or the time . If you can manage conquering that , you 'll be much more successful and content in life . <p> ( 12-10-2015 01:25 AM ) Quintus Curtius Wrote : The anger comes from rage at knowing that you were lied to , that no one was there to help you learn about women , and from the sense of lost time . <p> These are the parts that angered me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot chick . <p> Realizing that your entire view of opposite sex relations was based on one big fat lie is part of taking the red pill . Or having the red pill shoved down your throat , for that matter , in the case of divorce . It 's natural to feel angry as one of the stages of grief , the grief in letting your closely held fairy tale beliefs die . <p> But in the end , you emerge as a new man . Like a snake shedding his skin ... maybe not the best metaphor , but you get the idea . <p> This is a great thread . One of the reasons I like this community so much is that we can be brutally honest about things that would get us laughed at and shamed by feminists and manginas in the real world . A few years ago I once had a feminist woman ( who I had been in an " open " LTR with for a couple of years .... ) tell me sexual frustration was just something made up by " men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time I almost believed that . Here we know better : the truth is that men require regular and consistent sex to function properly . I should know . We all should know . We 're the fucking men , after all ! <p> Sexual resentment . I know this feeling all too well . My entire adolescence and early adulthood was defined by it . It was a constant burning hatred and confusion inside of me . Hate can be a powerful fuel and I thrived on it . Secondary school and especially college were particularly agonizing times of my life in this way . I got through it , thanks to the limited success I had here and there , but mainly thanks to the bitterness and anger burning away inside myself . Its quite perverse , really . Of course , you can imagine I have a great deal of regrets about my past too . This kind of posthumous anger can be very damaging to your well being in the present . I fully appreciate that it can be hard to ignore . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started becoming conscious of game and the red pill around 22 yrs old . You can bet that a lot of my thoughts , then as now , were " if only I knew all this when I was 16 ... " . Where I am now may be better , but it does n't undo the past . I 'm predisposed to being quite nostalgic anyway . My formative years were full of as many profound and seemingly magical heights as they were pits of despair . Its a very bizarre , almost schizophrenic dichotomy to still feel that longing for simpler times , now with an added resentment for what you did n't know back then . Of course , this is compounded by the realisation that you were n't *meant* to know this stuff , just be a good beta and roll over on command , and that you may lose friends as a result of your new-found knowledge , maybe even by them feeling threatened by your success . That 's one of the worst parts for me . <p> I have long since lost count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fucking mind from being deprived of what I need . For all I know I am already slightly mad as an effect of that and other things in my life . All we can really do is try our best to improve things going forward . I am no slayer , but where I 'm at now is a marked improvement to where I was before . You 've come this far , that absolutely counts for something . There are still guys out there who have n't woken up , some who never will . As bitter as the truth may be , to stay blind to it is a fate worse than death . <p> ( 12-10-2015 01:25 AM ) Quintus Curtius Wrote : 4 . You will always feel like someone is getting more than you .

One benefit to this is you become immune to those who try to manipulate you by playing on your insecurities . <p> A woman I know has been mourning her imperfect childhood for twenty-five plus years now and constantly uses it to score points against her father . Her parents were divorced and he drank . He never hit her or abused her , and worked hard despite his failings to put her through a very good school that 's given her a great career where she 's very comfortable . <p> Instead of moving forward with her life , she 's constantly-looking back into the distant past and mourning a phantasm of an envied ' perfect childhood ' that she believes all other people must experienced . She 's too wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's childhood experiences are imperfect too . <p> I guarantee you this : she will carry the weight of this resentment to her grave and is making a daily active choice to do so . She 's fixated on mourning a past that she ca n't change , whilst ignoring a future that she can influence . <p> Probably many have felt something like that me included . But now I am much older and I can have 10 times more sex than in the past funnyly I don-t want it so much anymore . I already developed so many other interests that my sex drive is no more a priority . <p> Everybody knows as a kid at one point we wanted something so badly . Truth is couple of years later we don-t even care about that stuff anymore . So basically there is a great chance that one gives something more value than it has . <p> To be content means maybe to be able to have many perspectives and switch when it fits . If you have only one perspective you get stuck without alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am thinking about getting a bigger one . The thing is I am totally happy with my little one as my interests are mainly mental . For that a litte cave is sometimes even better than a bigger appartement which may trigger more materialism . <p> Bottom line : Don-t believe your biology . Nature is not there to make you happy . You have to work for it with logic and brain . <p> I definitely felt that resentment before I learned game and got my mind straightened out . I do n't have the psychological need to care about other guys getting laid now . Might say " lucky bastard " if she 's my type but no visceral jealousy or hate . Learning how to breathe and meditate helped me a lot . As did talking to good people , and understanding my psychology . <p> You mentioned your parents and wanting to send them something nasty .

More success never helps , if the trauma is deep . A little therapy helps in that regard . <p> When I was 16-18 I had a different girlfriend for each of those three years . Every one of the three was pretty and adorable , the highschool romance was sweeter than sugar . Great right ? <p> In those years I did n't consciously know anything about girls . Some things about me made me " good " with them , other things made be " bad " . One of the latter was that I was a rigid cunt . I set very high standards for myself in every aspect of life : academically , in the gym , hobbies , and of course , the girls themselves . I would desire a girl from a distance , make my move and by luck , social circle and being technically a good " catch " I would get the girl I wanted . A month or two passed , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering disappointment . <p> There was one girl I could have gone for , but never did . We had grown up together since pre-school finger painting at 3 years old . Before we could even speak it was us two . As we entered puberty at the end of elementary school , we stood outside in the middle of her street with rain and wind lashing down on the two of us . We did n't even embrace , I regret that . I looked at her and felt weird , something I had never and still have never felt for another girl in my life . I do n't think I ever will , because I have swallowed a red pill . We just looked at each other , all the kids had run inside . We just stood there , staring at each other . As we turned twelve all we knew how to do was tease each other , and sometimes it went too far . This girl grew up to be the most beautiful in my highschool , although some might have reasonably preferred my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful and typically feminine . On paper if I had chosen one to marry , it would have been my girlfriend . Although from 16 to 18 there were fleeting moments of electric contact , my high standards and expectations of what feminine behavior " should " be halted me for accepting my childhood sweetheart enough to even embrace her , just once . No matter what happens , no matter what women sit on my face , no matter the level of suffocation until I am purple in the face ; no amount of declarations of love could make me feel like the girl who used to pour buckets of sand on my head in preschool . <p> At my peak in highschool I was pretty shredded . My girlfriend was waiting for me outside the school so that we could walk home together , but as I walked to my locker to get my stuff , the girl appeared in the other direction , placed her hand on my rippling abdominals , and said , " your girlfriend is waiting outside " , then left . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blissfully had no reason to , when lovestruck highschool girls do half the work for you , it 's god hard to do anything when a girl has a place in your heart , and there is no logical reason why , and you are just paralyzed . As the person I was at that time , it was impossible for me to do anything about it , yet to this day my heart might occasionally skip a beat with a passing thought of brief moments we had or could have had , and I ca n't help but regret my paralysis and chide myself for it . Because , at the same time , there was both nothing and everything in the way of making happen what was , as it felt , written to happen into this universe billions of years before we existed , yet I could produce nothing . Fucking nothing . <p> I was n't even desperate . I just loved this girl . I do n't know why . No one knows this , not even her . I do n't even think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too depressing and much worse than the occasional passing thought I have of her from time to time . <p> One moment for no apparent reason I remember above all others . She was standing in the entrance , waiting for somebody . Maybe her boyfriend , maybe a friend , you would think I might have kept track of these things , but I just did n't , I blocked her out . I was a rigid cunt . I did n't approve of her being " hot " and even having fucked one other guy , which she definitely had ( and then some ) . Was I right to dismiss her because , compared to my faithful , feminine , virgin ( when I met her ) girlfriend , she was relaitvely slutty ? Because she dared to put on makeup and challenge me ? She used to say in math class that me and my girlfriend were in love and going to get married , both in a teasing manner and almost as if she was happy for me . She was bad in ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of a community of " red pill " thinkers , but she had also grown up without a father , and I was there when people asked her where her dad was and a well held back tear would finally make it out and down her cheek . She partially at least had a good heart , and could be exceptionally warm to me , turning back the clock ten , fifteen years to when we were kids . Now to all of us she is just another slut . This hurts my heart . <p> So on that otherwise non-exceptional day , when she was there waiting , one of the greatest regrets of my youth was not walking up to her , putting my differences aside for just a few seconds , just enough to embrace her . I do n't know what would have happened . I may have cried , she may have cried . I would have clasped the back of her hair tight and she would have known I loved her . The world is such that it could never have lasted beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the only resentment - that of myself for my inaction - that exceeds observing that small percentage of men who at least appear to " have it easy " . When I see a " hot girl " with these largely average men , I try to think of the things more important , and that she could never beat what I felt all those years ago . I do n't beat myself up so much anymore for letting that go , because I had no conscious awareness of what I was doing with girls , I was an 18 year old fucking dumbass . The older you get , the more you realize that you actually did n't know as much as you thought you did when you were a teenager . The first twenty years of your life , you are like a leaf in the wind . Any semblance of true control is an illusion . Do n't beat yourself up for things you can not - and could never - change . All you can do is your best going forward , and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion so that you can mold your future into something that you can be proud of . <p> ( 12-09-2015 11:34 PM ) The Lizard of Oz Wrote : The post below was written as a reply to a remarkable , and remarkably honest , post by Phoenix in the forum lounge on the subject of sexual resentment .

Why bother with lifting , making money , and chasing women if the true meaning of life is to convince yourself that all that really matters is enjoying the view as life passes you by ? <p> Fast Eddie , thank you for this question which really cuts to the heart of the matter . You are essentially asking , what constitutes the good life -- is it really simply a matter of " enjoying the view " , as I seem to be saying ? And is n't that idea contradicted by your juxtaposition of LeBron with the imagined " 30 year old virgin working a dead end $10/hr job " ( aka " neckbeard " ) ? Is n't LeBron 's life self-evidently better than the neckbeard 's , never mind their respective abilities to " enjoy the view " ? And the implicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view " amount to anyway , what is it really all about ? <p> These are important questions , and I would like to address all of them . To do this I will have to bring together some strands of thought from a number of other threads , and this will require a series of posts . I hope you and others will find them of interest . <p> To begin with , I will note that the crucial dichotomy I made in the OP is not the one between activity and contemplation , as suggested in your question ; nor is it the one between ambition and quietism . Rather it is the distinction between psychology and objectivity . What I contend is that it is the privileging of psychology over objectivity that most deprives intelligent men of the ability to live a good and enjoyable life ; and of all varieties of psychology , it is the psychology of eros that is particularly privileged in this way ( and sexual resentment , the subject that spurred the post , is just an especially corrosive consequence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noted that the privileging of psychology in general , and of the psychology of eros in particular , is part of the default cognitive predisposition of intelligent literary men . <p> I discussed this very idea previously in an earlier post that I am reposting in full below . It was written in reply to Icarus in the Mark Ames " Meditations on Misogyny " thread , and I 'd like to bring it to bear here because it touches on this crucial part of the OP , as well as on what it is that constitutes the good life as I see it . <p> I will continue answering your question in subsequent posts . <p> ( 04-27-2014 12:04 PM ) The Lizard of Oz Wrote : Icarus , I never said Ames was a beta ( or not ) , only that he glorifies the knowledge born of the beta 's experience a little too much for my taste . <p> My impression of Ames himself is that he is an extremely literary guy in a way that is unpleasant to me ; I find his writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many writer types are overrated -- they preen and psychologize and leave you with very little . Really , almost all literary writing is poison : a thin and mannered reduction of the world rather than a lively addition to it . This is doubly true at the present time for reasons that I outlined in our previous exchange . <p> Further , one of the real problems with literary and intelligent men is that they overvalue the sphere of eros quite generally , making it the locus of absolute concentration of their psychology ; this applies both to men who are relatively successful with females and to those who are n't . Almost all these men are obsessed with eros and its highs and lows , its supposed Garden of Eden and its hells and purgatories , to the exclusion of almost everything else . <p> This is a terrible mistake ; the erotic band , while it is a very hot one , is much too narrow to sustain such concentration . As a result of this , men often lose the world , because they never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their writing , if they do write , often feels so dead on the page -- all the details that are mentioned seem rote and rehearsed since they are not the organic distillation of a sustained loving attention to every part of life ; such a loving attention is impossible to a man continually consumed by the psychology of eros in all its manifestations . <p> Indeed , this applies even to these men 's apprehension of the ostensible point of eros : the act of fucking and the purely physical aspects of sexuality . For it is quite true that in the right circumstances , using a woman 's body with the appropriate concentration and avidity is one of the very greatest physical pleasures that a man can experience -- and that is a big deal . But intelligent and literary men are so absorbed in the useless morass of erotic psychology that they often lose even the pure appreciation of the thing itself , and their relation to what I called elsewhere the moving meat becomes as abstracted as their relation to all other parts of objective reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while is is of course necessary and important for a man to acquire a good understanding of female nature and female psychology , it is perhaps even more valuable for literary and intelligent men to deflate and de-emphasize the psychology of eros very generally . It is no Garden of Eden ; it never was . It is a sphere where great and superb pleasures can be had , and they should be sought when possible ; but while these pleasures should be properly attended to and appreciated , it is a bad mistake to let the psychological ambiance surrounding either their presence or absence become one 's main focus in life . There is maybe nothing that an intelligent and literary man can do to give himself a chance at an unusually interesting and enjoyable life that is of more value than seeing through the lamentable literary cliche of valuing psychological eros and its ecstasies and depredations above all other parts of life . <p> Finally , what I mean by " other parts of life " is not " algebraic geometry " , as it were ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But all too often for a certain kind of intelligent man the world divides a little too neatly into two spheres , one of them encompassed by an abstract and purely technical field of work , and the other consisting entirely of some variety of eros and erotic psychology . <p> So by suggesting that such men should de-emphasize erotic psychology , I do not mean that they should therefore concentrate entirely on their often quite abstract and technical field of expertise ( although that may be fine in some cases ) . Rather , I really mean a much more subtle and not so harshly delimited interest in the world at large ; in what one sees on the street and in the coffee shop , so to speak . I really feel that there is no better and more rewarding way to live one 's life than one that allows a man to enter into a state of relaxed and thoughtful openness to experience and to the world around him . Life has the characteristics of depth and subtlety , and it rewards nothing so much as unforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; a man only comes to love and embrace the world if he allows himself to marinade in it for years and years . <p> Nothing distracts a man from the world and its subtle depths as much as the continual absorption in this or that psychological morass ; and for the intelligent and literary man , that morass consists of the world of eros in 9 cases out of 10 . <p> In this post I will continue to address Fast Eddie 's question about LeBron and the neckbeard . It seems that they are both in a position to " enjoy the view " ; but is n't LeBron 's life necessarily better ? <p> I believe that this question proceeds , in part , from a misunderstanding of the way that a life , lived over time , acquires value and meaning . One of the crudest cliches that the literary -- yet again -- are guilty of is their reduction and hollowing out of everyday life ; their thoughtless dismissal of the cumulative effect of modest efforts , interactions and activities sustained and marinaded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of a so-called " 9 to 5 job " ( for example ) , other than the utter banality of calling it " soul-crushing " . They are blind -- they make themselves blind -- to the myriad possibilities that are involved in almost any endeavor that brings the human being and its mind in contact with other people , and with the material world that we humanize and permeate through long companionship and that we ourselves are , in turn , permeated by . <p> This is a subject that I addressed in another thread ( about a supposed banker who at 46 decided that his life had been " wasted " ) and again I will quote my post from that thread in full below : <p> ( 12-13-2014 10:29 PM ) The Lizard of Oz Wrote : The real waste of life is not working a " 9-7 banker 's job " or whatever this fool thinks is his problem . <p> The real waste is being a whiner and an ingrate who still imagines -- at 46 -- that ludicrous banalities and cliches like writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and homeless " are the things that make life worth living . <p> The real waste is working a banker 's job for years and not being enough of a man to have a thousand different thoughts , impressions , and feelings about that job and all the myriad things and people that it involves . The waste is buying into the idiotic cliche that such a job is necessarily " empty " or " soulless " , as if it is not a part of life that accrues depth and interest over time if one only allows it to , and keeps one 's eyes and one 's mind open to what life truly is , to its everyday modest charms and possibilities . <p> The real waste is being so foolish and conventional as to believe that the true depths and subtleties that make life worth living are only contained in the exotic locales that one has failed to visit or in some thin and conventionally defined literary achievements imagined in one 's youth -- as if a very young man could ever have anything of real interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingratitude -- not because it is morally wrong ( which it is ) but because it so cognitively evacuating . In the search for a thinly imagined ideal , it hollows out and reduces the actual lived life , depriving it of the true and rich meanings . This is where the real waste lies , in the ingrate 's turning away from life , in losing the world . How terrible . <p> Next , I would like to make another point . Just as intelligent literary men misunderstand the life of activity and its charms and possibilities , so too they misunderstand the life of contemplation . The notion of the contemplative life , as conceived of by most intelligent literary men , is not only not the same as my idea of " enjoying the view " ; it is , in fact , its exact opposite . <p> This is because for intelligent literary men , the idea of a life of contemplation is always animated by the need and desire to turn away from the world , to escape reality and life as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what really spurs this need for escape is these men 's psychology , and the psychology of eros in particular . Intelligent men who wish to abandon the world and make their way to " nature " and to the contemplative life that they associate with it are , more often than not , simply fleeing eros and its depredations . <p> In contrast to this , the good life as I see it -- the life of " enjoying the view " -- is the opposite of such an escape . It is , rather , the life of the mind that seeks the world as it is arrayed before us , in its true and endless variety and complexity ; it is a life that seeks to join itself to the world , rather than escape it in favor of the vacuous and harshly limited contemplation of the self . <p> I discussed this subject in an earlier post in a thread about an ostensible hermit who chose to live on $5k a year in a so-called " hobbit hole " , and I am reproducing that post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lizard of Oz Wrote : thedude3737 brought up Thoreau and " Walden " in a previous post , and indeed this is something worth talking about in this context . <p> The literature of nature worship that is exemplified in the writing of Thoreau and other writers like Emerson and Rousseau is , in my opinion , one of the most overrated and pernicious strains of the literary . <p> It is a literature of bookish men who grossly sentimentalize their experiences of " nature " because for all their brilliance , they ca n't get a good handle on the world around them . The real world of men and , importantly , women . <p> They find " nature " pleasant because it offers them a blank canvas on which to project their petulant and thwarted sensibility -- thwarted particularly by unfulfilled eros and the inability to control the female as they think they deserve ; and they surround this experience with empty rhetoric born entirely of their book learning , the one thing that they really have . " Nature " is never worshiped by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant , solipsistic and wounded outsiders . <p> To be clear , I 'm not saying that these men were necessarily " losers " in a conventional or even erotic sense . But I am saying that they were sensitive , bookish and intelligent men who could not truly get a handle on the world , which is what they thought was owed them by dint of their cleverness and assumed superiority . The literary are immodest , self-absorbed and impatient ; when they saw that they had no control over the world and particularly over the thing that meant most to them -- women -- they skulked away to " nature " in which they chose to see their genius reflected back at them . <p> All very understandable , but the literature that it produces is grievously overrated . Yet many have been suckered by its rhetoric . <p> It is worth hearing what a truly great writer and thinker , Dr. Samuel Johnson , had to say about these subjects : <p> Quote : " No wise man will go to live in the country , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . For instance , if he is to shut himself up for a year to study science , it is better to look out to the fields , than to an opposite wall . Then , if a man walks out in the country , there is nobody to keep him from walking in again : but if a man walks out in London , he is not sure when he will walk in again . A great city is , to be sure , the school for studying life . " <p> Quote : " Sir , if you wish to have a just notion of the magnitude of this city , you must not be satisfied with seeing its great streets and squares , but must survey the innumerable little lanes and courts . It is not in the showy evolutions of buildings , but in the multiplicity of human habitations which are crowded together , that the wonderful immensity of London consists . " <p> Quote:Johnson : " The happiness of London is not to be conceived but by those who have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more learning and science within the circumference of ten miles from where we now sit , than in all the rest of the world . " Boswell : " The only disadvantage is the great distance at which people live from one another . " Johnson : " Yes , Sir , but that is occasioned by the largeness of it , which is the cause of all the other advantages . " Boswell : " Sometimes I have been in the humour of wishing to retire to a desart . " Johnson : " Sir , you have desart enough in Scotland . " <p> Quote : " Why , Sir , you find no man , at all intellectual , who is willing to leave London that life can afford . " <p> Lastly , one must note that conditions have changed to an almost magical extent ; there is vastly more learning , interest and experience immediately accessible to anyone with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . We all live in " London " now . But this does not change the truth of his thinking . When a man is tired of " London " -- meaning , of the true and complex life of the world of thinking and action that surrounds us -- he is tired of life . <p> Finally , I would like to answer Fast Eddie 's question directly . Is n't LeBron 's life necessarily better than the neckbeard 's ? And does n't that contradict what I say about what I see as life 's greatest good , namely " the vast and endless comedy of the world outside the self " ? <p> The answer to the first question is , of course not . A life of outward glamour and even of surpassing achievement can still be a failed life if the man who lived it has neglected to take stock of the world and to respond to its true depths and possibilities ; and a life of no great outward achievement can still be a superb one if it has had a wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and its subtle riches . <p> To see an example of the former , it is enough to look at a recent thread about someone who might as well have served as a substitute for LeBron in the juxtaposition , namely Tiger Woods . Here is this thread : <p> When a man of such great accomplishment and such great wealth as Tiger makes so terrible an error as to imagine , as he turns 40 , that he has " nothing to look forward to " -- and even though this complaint is made somewhat more excusable as the result of some long-standing physical injuries -- you see that no amount of ambition satisfied beyond all possible expectation is enough , in itself , to guarantee that sustained thoughtful engagement with the world which alone vouchsafes us a good , enjoyable , and varied life over the full arc of a lifetime . <p> Conversely , there is nothing that prevents the " neckbeard " -- and yes , even a " 30 year old virgin working a dead end $10/hr job " , to take that figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless depth , interest and variety . To take but one example , this character has at his disposal and at his leisure access to the greatest art that the world has ever known , the art of film , and its unparalleled flowering during its great height of the last century . I wrote down some thoughts about film in a post on another thread , and I will quote the end of that post below : <p> ( 10-10-2015 05:38 PM ) The Lizard of Oz Wrote : There is too much to say about this subject for a brief post , or even a long one , so I 'll add just two things : <p> First , my point about film was not that its existence was enabled by technological advances ( even though it was , of course ) . Forget about how or why it came to be -- all that matters is that it happened , that this art flourished in the past century and produced countless masterpieces that are , as great and permanent art , beyond anything mankind has created before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- it is about the immense bounty , the unthinkably luxurious harvest of the hundreds and thousands of beautiful movies that have been made ; not just a few hoary classics , but an explosion of creation unlike any other . <p> Second , the most important way in which film is different in kind from the art that precedes it is not , in fact , technological ( though again these things can not be separated ) . It is precisely the fact that film is not the creation of a single author ; it is not the director 's movie in the same way that it is the writer 's book or even the playwright 's play ( and when it is , when film is too harshly directed and too constrained by a single artist 's vision , it usually fails of greatness ) . It is that magical freedom -- the happy and profound felicities that can come about in a fundamentally collaborative art beyond the control of any single mind -- that gives film at its best its special companionable warmth , that allows us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were at large in it , not driven forward by the necessarily limited and straitened conceptions of a single mind . <p> ******************* <p> I have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies , and yet I know for a fact that I have hundreds more to see , some of which are as great or greater than any I 've seen before . This is not some abstract consideration ; it 's like knowing that you have been granted an endless bounty of beauty , warmth , interest , texture , and truth -- enough for many lifetimes of the most pleasurable concentration that the human mind is privileged to enter into . The least I can do with such an embarrassment of riches is to acknowledge it , and that is why I mentioned the movies as a particular gift that was bequeathed to us by the last century . <p> A true immersion in that greatest of all arts , a sustained heartfelt response to its unspeakable marvels , would -- in and of itself -- be enough to grant the imagined 9-5 neckbeard a life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not to say , of course , that the neckbeard is likely to have such a life ; he is not . The greatest part of the life of such a man would , in all likelihood , be wasted in varieties of corrosive sexual resentment ; and the rest of it would likely be straitened by an adherence to one or another reductive and limiting ideology . Most conventional " losers " are not men who have immersed themselves in objectivity -- quite the contrary , they often burn with the insult of their psychology as much or more than anyone else . Conversely , a man of great worldly achievement will be forced to deal in a serious way with reality and with the world as it is ; and this engagement with objectivity will distract him from his own psychology -- whatever it may be -- and tend to improve his mind and his life . <p> That said . There is nothing , in principle , that prevents the neckbeard from throwing away his resentments and his ideological commitments alike , and living a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ; indeed , this is a possibility that exists for nearly all of us ; but every man must find his own way out of the limitations of the self and into the peerless comedy and glory of the life outside the self . <p> You know , I read this a lot where guys discover game as they get older and start having success with women , but then they feel ashamed and angry about their failures when they were much younger . Quite honestly , I do n't think guys should beat themselves up like this . Game is like any other skill , it takes lots and lots of practice to get it down . <p> However unlike many other skills one strives to acquire , game requires not just physical ability but mental and perhaps most difficult , emotional intelligence . In my mind for most men , it comes as you get older . Sure , some guys get it intuitively when they 're really young , but for most guys , they got ta work at it . And that takes time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most important thing to do once you start having success is to forgive yourself and embrace your past failings , not dwelling on it . <p> As a guy getting out of a 20 year marriage , I 'm now having to relearn the game , a game where the rules have become much more daunting than they were 20 years ago . I have no doubts though and that 's in part because I remember my failures and their lessons and my ability to overcome them without feeling bitter about it . <p> The purpose of money is n't for buying shit , it is for buying your way out of shit . <p> When I was younger , sex was on the pedestal , I thought it was everything . As you get older and you start getting lots of it , especially with women you find very attractive , then it 's value just plummets . The mystery just goes away . Of course it is a need , and It is something that needs to be itched every once and a while . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you start developing this aloof attitude , then getting women becomes way easier . <p> Getting a high ' notch count ' does have a positive effect , once you have achieved your person goal , there is this feeling of accomplishment and just a zen state , is the best way to describe it . But mainly because of as mentioned above , it no longer becomes a high valued prize , which can be used to be yielded against you . <p> In places where there is a proper balance between the sexes , like Russia , Eastern Europe ( Even mainland Europe in comparison to the U.K , U.S ) , parts of Asia etc . Men do n't seem to care about notch counts that much , or going out getting laid . Focusing on having fun , or getting their goals is more of a focus in their lives . <p> Compare this to men in Britain or America , where you can just hear the frustration in their voices . <p> A big part of the problem , is that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instagram , music videos , advertisements , is all too much . This leads to men constantly thinking with their monkey brain , and being over stimulated . It actually makes men weak and dysfunctional , especially if you start removing their ability to attract women and to have sex , by teaching their erroneous self emasculating beliefs . <p> I grew up in a household with a very dramatic mother . In theatrical arts we know most all " acts " can be described as either ( Shakespearean ) drama , or comedy . Naturally with such a drama queen mother , and a father who just ignored it unless it got too extreme for even him to handle , I became nearly the exact inverse of her .. a comedian . Not the clown type , but it taught me a lot about introspection . <p> The ability to laugh at one 's failures . This is n't to say laugh foolishly without brief hindsight admonishment towards myself , especially if I fell into the same trap I did before with a girl ( just with a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ) , but rather laugh at the process , the fickleness of it all . <p> These are my most at peace times , and frankly happiest . Basically saying to myself : " Ah HA ! That 's what I was really supposed to learn there , maybe I 'm behind the curve , maybe I 'm the leader changing shit for better around me , who knows , but I 'm living a life I do n't douse with deflectors like booze , drugs , workahol , or women to wash away the pain . " <p> So here 's how I view things now . Get addicted to the pain itself . This is what I tell recovering addicts of just about anything . Pick that one thing that eats at you , that has control over you , zero in on the pain , and make it your addiction . Eventually what ends up happening is you 've run your own results-focused simulation over n over so many times , with the worst case scenario 's results playing out - via your personal experiences - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your emotions , into a little box , and throw it away , burn it , wipe your ass with it , because now you own it . <p> And what happens is you 're no longer focused on the results at all , and all that dysfunctions you bestowed upon yourself becomes function instead , you get your edge back , this time it 's sharper than ever . <p> Why would he want to send an angry letter to his parents ? He sounds like a hater , guys do not really like to see other guys get women in front of them . I used to get mad many years ago , until I started watching guys to see how they did it ..

I usually cut them loose . Because it 's hard to shake feelings once you cross that line . But again you have to learn to hold back and not get feelings until you 've smash a half dozen times .

@@96059219 @259219/ <p> So during my short lived time in the game ( about 10 months ) , I 've come to realize there 's about 3 main forms , in night game , day game , and online game .

I 'm chatty and warm , so I use friendly life of the party alpha male game . I work an entire room , making sure everyone feels great , even the girls I 'm not interested in . It is an abundance mentality of making everyone you come in contact with feel like they met someone special because I 'm warm and friendly with them , plus I 'm an active listener . When this game is played well , women and men will introduce you to new women . I then filter accordingly for LTR traits .

You can do a couple of other things around there ( bird park , big dam ... ) but I think 2 or 3 days is enough ... <p> Afterwards I took a bus to Floripa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit unlucky with the hostel ( only 40 yo brazilian bums there ) , had nice weather for 2 days but a bit rainy the other two days . I had lined up some tinder dates there but my phone broke down just when I arrived in Floripa , which sucked ass . Supposedly was gon na meet up with a Brazilian friend from way back , but he flaked on me ( has happened a few times already , I do n't think Brazilians are really trustworthy ) ... Was a bit frustrated with the phone situation but in the end I bought a new one ( very expensive in Brazil ) . <p> Then I flew to SP , where I stayed from Tuesday till Sunday . Not that much to see there , just concrete and people everywhere . Definitely felt like a gigantic city , a lot of different neighbourhoods ( e.g. Villa Madalena ) but none were that great imo . European prices I 'd say . I was lucky and met some great people in the hostel and hung out with them . Followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative/gay neighbourhood , but that was pretty dirty/shitty . Meanwhile I was tindering and had a lot of matches and chatting a bit with them in Portunhol . Met up with a tinder date on Saturday for a coffee . Her father was Chilean so she spoke decent Spanish . My Spanish is quite good so the conversation was flowing nicely . We went to a bar afterwards and kept drinking . Then I had a burger , and we had some more beers afterwards . She took me back to her place around midnight ( decent place very near to Paulista so I guess her family has some money ) . Great body ( ass ) but we were both a bit drunk and tired haha . Felt good to have a notch without even putting in much effort . She genuinely liked me and was even paying for her own drinks , did n't have to ly or play any games/tricks . I might have gotten more success had I gone out more or actually put in some effort to meet some of my other matches . Problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city ... Next day I flew back to Europe . <p> Had a pretty good trip overall I 'd say . Game-wise I 'm a bit disappointed in myself . Next time I either have to bring a wingman or just suck it up and go out alone . 
@@96059224 @259224/ <p> However , it helps to be able to spot a certain type of woman early if you want any relationship other than that just based on sex . In other words , if you want a woman that will take up any of your time , money , or emotion , then it helps to be able to spot the bad girl as early as possible . <p> The girl who is n't worth any effort other than for sex , because its more trouble than its worth every time . The girls who respond most to being treated very badly . Girls who you never , ever want to bring home to Mom or take seriously . Girls who are often dynamite in the sack but who you never , ever , under any circumstances want to knock up because the Mom will ruin your life more than the baby ever would . <p> Some of these women are great at hiding their true nature to the untrained PUA . Therefore , I nominate that we make a running list on how to tell who the sluttiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls are . <p> All hail the bad girl , as you truly do fulfill our porn star dreams . <p> I think this could get funny , but try to keep it so it all has some basis in reality and your experience : <p> 1 . She uses facebook as her personal slut photoalbum , posting tons of posed pics of her in slutgear in her house . The key is that its outside of natural environments like the club or the beach . <p> 2 . She offers you anal the first time you have sex , even before you have put in in her vagina . <p> 3 . She has more than one baby daddy . * I recommend avoiding all single moms . Personally , I 've sworn them off . <p> 4 . She treats you like a King , but people in her family like shit . In other words , she treats the people badly who are close to her , who she does n't stand to gain anything from , and who ca n't get away from her . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> 5- Much like Hydro 's 4:If she treats wait-staff or service people shitty , expect to be treated the same in time . Also , I 've found that women who tend to be OVERLY picky with meals and send stuff back often , are hassles in every other regard . <p> 6 . She puts a a lot of value on jewelry or other status symbols that would put you both in an irrational amount of debt . <p> 7 . She knows how to suck dick like a pro - she gives that underside a good , long lick . * Not exactly a scientific measure or deal killer , but it should arouse enough suspicion to where you are then on alert for the other signs <p> 8 . She suggests that you both attend the voyeur sex club . And , oh yeah , she 's been there multiple times with a selection of other boyfriends . <p> 9 . She either has sex with you in a bar/club , or tells stories about doing anything like that with other guys . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you can check off number 9 . <p> 10 . Your mom or sister hates her . Women are often much better at knowing the score on other women , and so you can usually trust their opinion . Your mom and sister have your best interest at heart . <p> 11 . She never works to make amends in an argument . She just waits for you to apologize because , after all , her feelings are the only ones that exist . An extension of this is that her prior breakups were always the guys fault . Nothing she ever thinks or does is to blame . <p> 13 . She has signs of high testosterone production . A higher sex drive than is normal even for a horny woman . Wants it anywhere , everywhere , and probably rough . Fucks more like a man than a woman . Strong muscles . A mustache she needs to wax regularly . Anything that tells you that there is a man 's caliber sex drive bottled up with the reasoning and rational capacity of an average woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it sounds like I 'm describing a man , but I 'm talking about women that can look very feminine and hot . Its not a good combination for relationships that are n't just based in sex . Having a relationship with one man 's sex drive involved is hard enough ( yours ) . With two , and one is n't under control very well , the future is n't good . Your sex drive will dip well below hers , most likely , as you age . <p> 14 . Divorced . While she might be a good woman , I look at her as being too high a risk to take a gamble on . It would have to be a good story where the husband was a complete bastard . Otherwise , it tells me that she 's a bad decision maker , impulsive , gets bored in relationships after some time passes , or a mix of the three . Most divorces are initiated by women . And if there is a kid , forget it completely . The chances of it being a defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true , but the risk is too high . <p> 15 . When she is at your house and she talks openly to her friend about other guys that she is doing/wants to do , then wants to have sex with you , but it turns out she is only 16 . She really wants your dick so she tries to convince you that she is about to graduate college and is turning 17 in " a couple months " <p> 16 . She tells you that she is ' special ' or ' not like other girls ' . This is girl code for " I 'm emotionally unstable " or some other psychological abnormality that she has , is aware of , but is powerless to stop . However , feel privileged about the fact that she is at least warning you , in her own way , if you can decipher the code . Now you can . As an extension of this , be aware of any message that she gives early in the relationship about how she is , what she wants , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early for a reason ! Listen , no matter how insignificant that you think that it is . Think hard about what she tells you and what it means . Sooner or later you will be dealing with it . <p> 17 . She admits to having her homemade porn on the internet , or wants to make it with you and post it . Go ahead and do it if you want , but do n't take her seriously after that . <p> ( 01-31-2011 04:38 PM ) kickboxer Wrote : 15 .

I know this from experience .... several times . <p> Hydro I 'm on board with your post for the most part , however for argument sake I want to point out a few things . A girl could def. have a high sex drive and still be dating material . Girls like that are fun and to me atleast , at times better than a girl that is too cold and just wants it on rare occassion . Of course you need to be a real alpha to handle an alpha bitch . This should be noted . That is the biggest problem is that there are dudes out here dabbling with trying to bang various women , be " players " etc but the moment they meet a realy alpha bitch they fold and show beta tendencies quick fast . <p> Also as a note to all the young bucks out there . It has occured to me that there are a ton more phony wan na be sluts out there now a days . Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might ask ? Simply to point out that girls in this day in time more than ever are just doing what popular dance music , hip hop and faggy beta emo shit tells them to do ... which is act like a whore , of course with the guise of bieng " Free , independant , grown up and liberated " . So , when they are telling you their desire to lick a chicks hoo ha or to bang you in a bar piss stall , maybe they really want it or maybe they just want to keep up with the slut next door . I started to notice this in College when chicks at parties would pull out boobies , kiss other girls or do something really slutty all the while with the look of guilt , shame and uncertainty on her face and really 75% of the time , she really just desired the attention of the drunk frat boy egging her on to do it . <p> 19 . She starts shit off the cuff with your friends or anyone in your social circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or others who might also notice her whorish tendancies and call her on it , or warn you when she is not around . <p> 20 . Has very slutty girlfriends - If she has a roommate or another friend who she constantly tells bad stories about ( close friend who strips , sleeps around , smokes crack etc ) you can bet she is not far behind that friend . <p> 21 . She says she does n't have a " type " - Every girl has a type or atleast limits on types of guys she dates . There is a slight chance when she says she likes all types , that it could mean she is just bieng nice ( meaning she will tell you she loves all people , simply to not sound close minded or racist ) but more than likely she really does not have a type and will bang any kind of dude different fashions , races , heights out there on a sudden whim . She rides the Int'l Colours of Beneton Cock carrousel . <p> ( 01-31-2011 06:14 PM ) Rocco81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part , however for argument sake I want to point out a few things .

I definitely agree . Girls with high sex drives are insanely fun . Haha ... most of what I listed as negatives are incredibly fun traits for a girlfriend to have . Amazingly so . Its worth it to have experience with women such as these , as long as you do n't take them too seriously . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look out for to assure the best low stress long term relationships . For short term fuck flings , all bets are off . <p> That 's the point of what I 'm saying . Guys will confuse all of this fun for a woman that 's worth falling in love with , which just is n't the case . Its very seductive behavior , in more ways than one . The " femme fatale " moniker is well earned for these women . <p> About the alpha bitch thing , though . I disagree that a real alpha man is what an alpha bitch wants for a long term relationship , or vice versa . I do n't think that two alphas go together well . However , I will grant that there are degrees of alphaness . If there is enough separation in the degree of alphaness ( she just a little and he a lot ) then it might work . But I still do n't think its as good as when there is a larger separation such as when an alpha is with a beta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think that an Alpha woman is most sexually turned on by an Alpha man , but she can least tolerate him or he her . I think that she gets along best with a beta male ( flaw : who wo n't turn her on ) , and the beta male with alpha tendencies is the best compromise for her . There is no perfect solution for the alpha woman , because its an unnatural personality for a woman . <p> I do n't think that an alpha guy would prefer a true high alpha woman for a long relationship , unless he thrives off of stress and challenge . <p> No matter how alpha a man is , unless he 's Zeuss himself , that high alpha woman will continue to challenge . A beta man is much better for her . Especially as things become routine . <p> Usually , an alpha male will want the most feminine woman he can find , to compliment his alphaness . After all , he has the pick of the litter . I do n't see alpha women as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth , and for as long as you want , but do n't let them get their financial or emotional hooks into you . <p> The highest status alpha men generally get the hottest , most feminine women ( if they know how to screen and they do n't settle for an alpha that seduces them with sex ) . Betas with alpha tendencies/alphas with beta tendencies get the hot alpha women or less hot feminine(beta) women as their best choices . The lowest women on the totem pole are the ugly alphas . <p> CEO is right on .... what is it ( Esp UK and US girls ) and their gay ass Facebook pages . They try so fucking hard to look important and cool , showing their their pics posing like hookers in any given trendy club in your local down town dancing to some techno and/or Auto-tuner based shit hop .

@@96059231 @259231/ <p> It has been almost 12 days since I arrived in Barranquilla . I left Ukraine in late July and then wen to Quito , Ecuador for 10 days , Pasto , Colombia for 3 days , and 10 days in Cali . This last year I lived mostly in Colombia , Ukraine , Poland , Thailand , Indonesia , Romania . Will write about my experiences in future posts , but just wanted to share some knowledge about the women of 2 of the forum 's favorite Colombian cities . Last year and this year , I spent a total of 4 months in Cali , but in the end I decided not to buy a house or settle down there . When I thought about all the minus and pluses , i could not justify , to myself , spending 3 to 6 months each year in Cali . The straw that broke the camel 's back was the fact that I had just as good a time in Quito , Ecuador , this last time around than in Cali . I have always been a detractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ecuador ) of Ecuador , but this time it was n't bad . Similar to a world wide trend that I have noticed ..... where the good places are not that good anymore and the bad places ai n't that bad ( this does not refer to 1st world countries .. i.e. Canada ) . I will still pick Colombia over any country in Latin America , specially because you can still regularly bang young broads .... but it ai n't like the past for most of us not named Linux hehe . So I left Cali with thoughts of finding something better in Colombia . i banged 3 girls in 10 days in Cali , but the experience , overall , was not so pleasant . So here I am in Barranquilla . I had been here before , , , , for 3 days several years ago and have been a few times to Cartagena and Santa Marta . I picked Barranquilla , based on those experiences and info from the thread . Here are a few observations . These are from a late 30s in shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One date and one night stands are more common in Barranquilla. 2 . Girls drink more in Barranquilla. 3 . The average 18 to 28 yr old woman is a 5.5 in Barranquilla , while in Cali a 6 to 6.25 4 . In Barranquilla , the average girl has more black blood and in Cali more Indian . Though there is big mix of 3 races in both . 5 . The average Barranquilla girl is not as fit as a Calena. 6 . Flakiness is about the same . It is pretty bad in both , but I have to go back to Medellin to really put it in perspective . 7. 2nd date bangs are the norm in Cali . In Barranquilla , go for it on the 1st meet because you might not get a 2nd chance and most are not worth a 2nd date . 8 . The high end in looks and social status are similar and they tend to be more white . They are a pain in the ass in both cities . <p> Granted I am not drinking here in Barranquilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has both minus and pluses , in terms of banging girls . My surprise so far has been that Barranquilla girls can be just as flaky as Calenas . They are more trusting and open than Calenas ( so more one night stands ) , but that is counterbalanced by how much these girls here have been dicked over , by the biggest dogs in Colombia . 20nations advice about building comfort , through webcam or direct calls , is golden . Also , my average quality of bang has gone down , though quantity remains about the same . So next year , I will give Bogota a try or my old hunting ground of Medellin . Fortaleza and Bahia , Brazil are on the list for October and November . Unfortunately , will still have to look around to find a place to settle down , 3 to 6 months of the year . <p> Qualifier : if you are a gringo in your prime from 25 to 35 and do well in your home country ... you will do well in both . Follow Linux 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though , on average , it will be easier in Barranquilla , but the quality will go down a bit . <p> Good post . I have my eyes on Colombia , possibly for next year , as I already know a bit of Spanish . <p> Since I have a mediterranean look , I expect some people will mistake me for a latino , so I do n't think I 'll light it up as much as some of the blue eyed gringos ... but it definitely should be an interesting experience and really tighten up my Spanish . <p> I , I like young women .... 18 to 24 . In my late 30s , in the Northeast of Brazil is where , I will get the most of what I want I know how the quality is in Belo Horizonte ( lived there for a month and a half ) and Porto Alegre , If I was in my late 20s ..... that is where I would go . <p> One funny thing , is the difference in how they flake in Medellin and Cali vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mostly not care , not answer your messages or calls and probably will disappear forever . In Barranquilla , most girls will actually try to apologize and get you back on their attention rotation . It is more active ..... compared to passive flaking . Yes ..... most of the girls here , have been dicked over big time . <p> For me Barranquilla was a nice surprise in terms of the city actually having some pleasant and clean spaces with green areas in the north . Your analysis is pretty spot-on although I almost felt like the average girl in Barranquilla was just below the bangable range for me ... but it 's close . But again , I did n't do much night game here and focused primarily on day game . <p> I think the quality in Cali ( I 'm here now staying in Ciudad Jard+n ) very much depends on your location and day of the week . In the south of the city ( Unicentro ) , the quality to me seemed very good on a Friday between 2:30 - 4:30 PM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges 17-40+ . I approached ( doing 90% daygame now ) a few girls that were in the 8-9 range ( no numbers ) and saw plenty in the 6-8 range and got a few numbers in the latter range . Returned to the same mall at the same time ( 2PM ) the next day ( Saturday ... and Sunday for that matter ) and I literally did n't see a single girl that was worth approaching who was n't already with her **26;840;TOOLONG family or parents . But as far as the looks of cale+as , I 've seen quite a few ass implants . And I 'm talking like absurdly-sized asses . Every time I see one like that ( which is several times per day ) I just shake my head in disbelief that some men actually like them THAT BIG ... some of them are really outrageous to the point where it seems surreal haha . <p> In Barranquilla , I think quality can be pretty decent but not great in Buena Vista Mall ( from say 4:30-6:30 ) , Centro Unico ( during after-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portal del Prado Mall ( 4:30 - 6:30 ) , and and the Falabella in the Centro Villa Country and the supermarkets in said malls with the exception of Unico . Although I did find that the girls in Portal del Prado seemed a bit gun shy for day approaches and a few appeared to have the impression I wanted to rob them ( they would look at me suspiciously and closely clutch their purses to their bodies ) , which was both funny and a little bit depressing . The gun-shyness was confirmed with a wing as well . The overall look for girls from Barranquilla almost seemed Arab to me . There 's definitely some African blood too but to me , Cali in general seems to have more mulattas and negritas on a whole , mostly only in the south though . <p> In the end , I would probably pick a cale+a over a coste+a based purely on looks and sex appeal ( ass implants excluded ) , as there has n't been enough time yet to meet more cale+as for a better overall analysis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got some good insight on Colombia and will look for your posts on Ecuador as I 'm heading there in a few weeks . Hopefully will spend 10 days more or less in Quito .

In the south of the city ( Unicentro ) , the quality to me seemed very good on a Friday between 2:30 - 4:30 PM . There was an abundance of pretty girls from many age ranges 17-40+ . I approached ( doing 90% daygame now ) a few girls that were in the 8-9 range ( no numbers ) and saw plenty in the 6-8 range and got a few numbers in the latter range . Returned to the same mall at the same time ( 2PM ) the next day ( Saturday ... and Sunday for that matter ) and I literally did n't see a single girl that was worth approaching who was n't already with her **26;896;TOOLONG family or parents . But as far as the looks of cale+as , I 've seen quite a few ass implants . And I 'm talking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which is several times per day ) I just shake my head in disbelief that some men actually like them THAT BIG ... some of them are really outrageous to the point where it seems surreal haha . <p> In Barranquilla , I think quality can be pretty decent but not great in Buena Vista Mall ( from say 4:30-6:30 ) , Centro Unico ( during after-work hours during the week ) , Universidad del Norte , Portal del Prado Mall ( 4:30 - 6:30 ) , and and the Falabella in the Centro Villa Country and the supermarkets in said malls with the exception of Unico . Although I did find that the girls in Portal del Prado seemed a bit gun shy for day approaches and a few appeared to have the impression I wanted to rob them ( they would look at me suspiciously and closely clutch their purses to their bodies ) , which was both funny and a little bit depressing . The gun-shyness was confirmed with a wing as well .

@@96059232 @259232/ <p> I was considering just posting this in the lounge thread , but based on similar sentiment I 've heard from some other members , about hoping to see a move away from politics following Trump 's victory , perhaps others might want to post their own affirmations here too . <p> I recently posted a thread attempting to provoke intellectual discussion on the proper role/form of education for women . That seemed to push a bit outside of the Overton window , provoking quite a few ad-hominem balks , somewhat ( extremely mildly ) reminiscent of what Roosh 's infamous article got from the mainstream . That surprised me a little , but it got me thinking about my intent in raising the question and how I was spending my time and thoughts . Do I really have the luxury to be pondering these questions ? Is it appropriate to be investing further time in such debates to further refine my political position and answer such cultural questions , given the other things I need to do ? <p> The answer I came to is basically : no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on , should not be important to me given other things I need to be focusing on , and given that my understanding of those things is now clear enough anyway . <p> So henceforth I commit to abstain from any and all political discussion on this forum for the duration of 2017 ; with the exception of anything directly , currently and personally affecting me . If I breach this feel free to call me a phaggot and post a link to this thread . <p> This thread is not in any way meant to criticize other members who enjoy participating in political discussions or who consider politics to be important and a valuable part of this forum . It is merely an affirmation of my own commitment for the year , as I know posting this will force me to stick to it on pain of being called out . If you want to join this ' no politics wagon ' for the year feel free to post your own affirmation here too . <p> The problem with goals like this is that when you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , sometimes to a greater degree than when you participated . You may quit talking or writing about it in public , but political ideas will still continue mentally . This is what I 'm facing right now with my Twitter break . I 'm not participating , but I do still go often to the site to catch up . The answer seems to be the middle path of moderation , where you recognize you are prone to excess but put limits that do n't require such will that you 'll regress back and feel ashamed for it . <p> Quote : I recently posted a thread attempting to provoke intellectual discussion on the proper role/form of education for women . <p> Quote : That seemed to push a bit outside of the Overton window , provoking quite a few ad-hominem balks , ... That surprised me a little <p> That sort of surprises me , ask a question about restricting the capabilities of a person . Something rather important to others and most would n't consider such a question , and then being surprised at how others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing . Not trying to reopen that whole topic though . <p> I myself make a point to avoid the politics thread unless I 'm linked to something outrageous . my whole take on that goes down to how I view the world around me . There is a great anecdote about that . <p> When I was a young man , I wanted to change the world . <p> I found it was difficult to change the world , so I tried to change my nation . <p> When I found I could n't change the nation , I began to focus on my town . I could n't change the town and as an older man , I tried to change my family . <p> Now , as an old man , I realize the only thing I can change is myself , and suddenly I realize that if long ago I had changed myself , I could have made an impact on my family . My family and I could have made an impact on our town . Their impact could have changed the nation and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to try , go all the way . There is no other feeling like that . You will be alone with the gods , and the nights will flame with fire . You will ride life straight to perfect laughter . It 's the only good fight there is . <p> When you talk about politics , the cultural war with the intention do make a difference , change something you will be disappointed . I 'm mainly active in the migrant invasion . Not direct because I will make a big difference . I do it for me . A lot of things from the news do n't bother my personal life direct , so why spent my time to read , discuss and so on about topics where I mostly never till take any action ? Is it a waste of time ? I 'm not blind to the world that surrounds me . Things that do n't affect me direct can have a long term effect in the long run . For this politics helps me . It also helps me for orientation in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my personal thinking and behaviour . This is also what this Forum is about . Self improvement . To be aware about political effects , the cultural war helps to make a stand and orientation in my own life . Also it helps to think about long term effects and creates more value for me because I do n't become a puppet that easy . When I see stuff in the media I see mostly the intention behind it . Of course avoid it all , read only books set you out of this too . Still at the end things will come to you . <p> The main intention for me to participate in politics is to sharpen my mind , to understand situations and long term effects . This helps me to live my life with better purpose . Also it helps me to prepare and may be even aware for radical changes in society that will hit most people like a rock . I maybe can doge away . What 's also important for me , when stuff that bothers me . Where I just ca n't ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it helps me to talk about it . Have a political discussion helps me to release some stuff . I can ignore the downfall of my country to just a certain degree . Its know when you talk about stuff it ease the tension inside you . <p> For us , these conflicts can be resolved by appeal to the deeply ingrained higher principle embodied in the law , that individuals have the right ( within defined limits ) to choose how to live . But this Western notion of individualism and tolerance is by no means a conception in all cultures . - Theodore Dalrymple <p> By understanding politics you understand society , and by understanding society you learn more about the psychology of women and your fellow man . <p> I agree to not getting too involved in the day-to-day political squabbles , but some of the most enlightening moments of the past year for me have come from reading and posting in such threads . <p> It 's also a brilliant form of procrastination . If you do n't use this as an outlet then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind it 's near impossible to not procrastinate at least some of the time , so if your vices are learning and discussing the world around you I could think of far worse ways to live . <p> I agree . It does n't benefit me to know more about politics than politicians considering I never plan on making a living in politics . The time I spend learning is mostly wasted on this subject . Having an understanding deeper than 95% of people is enough . <p> Politics is the dirtiest faction of humanity , especially the way opposing parties confront it . Religion has an air of reverence surrounding it that both parties generally understand however politics has no such thing . That 's why politics is somewhat addicting , because it 's a pure form of drama . <p> I was thinking about getting off the forum completely , but from past experience I agree with what Roosh says regarding moderation . The political discussion here is only a tiny portion of the forum , the rest being a highly valuable archive . To jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath water . <p> It 's good to see there are others who recognise this too , and hopefully 2017 will be a great year on the forum for getting back to self improvement with the added benefit of gained knowledge and experience a year long political battle brings . <p> In an ideal world we 'd never need politics . But nothing affects your Neighbors more than politics . If you care about God and Neighbor , then you 'll always be interested in politics . <p> Casca , your poem is out of date . It now reads like this : <p> Quote:When I was a young man , I wanted to change the world . <p> I found it was difficult to change the world , so I tried to change my nation . <p> We shitposted on the internet . We created memes . We got Trump elected and changed the world . <p> Before the internet one man felt powerless . But now anyone with good writing skills can influence millions of other men . The internet has changed the world forever and the genie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political today has more rewards than ever before . <p> That said , I co-sign on moderation . I for one will be focusing heavily on personal development over politics in 2017 . <p> Some may not be able to quit politics could turkey . My suggestion is that if you 're not actively engaged in some job that requires you to be up to date about the most minute of political intrigue , just schedule ten minutes a day to read the headlines , set a timer , and close out all your browser tabs once it goes off . Prevent yourself from going down the sinkhole of political time wasting , which quite honestly , is what most discussions on politics really are . If you focus on building up your finances and career , you can affect change more directly than posting long threads on political theory . <p> I 'm done , including posting on this thread . I just posted my last comments on the Holocaust thread and the Pizzagate thread . A good 2017 resolution . <p> When I joined RVF a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths and trolling the world of fat , tattooed , short-haired , selfie-obsessed girls . <p> There were great new stories in the Travel section everyday , and a lot of good information in the Game and lifestyle and fitness sections . Any man was welcome to participate , there was n't a political or racial orthodoxy which could be discerned . <p> The shift into a particular brand of politics , particularly the " race realism " and Jew-baiting , has n't been good . I do n't even know what " alt-right " stands for . <p> There have been some high-repped members who used to post good stuff in Travel and Game who are gone , some of them Jews . I do n't know why they disappeared . I had PMs with some of the Jews on the Jew threads . <p> It 's not up to me to defend the Jews , but fair is fair . I had some great Jewish teachers in HS , one was an OSS veteran of WWII . I also got hired by a couple of old-school Jewish shopkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law were Jewish . Plus Seinfeld , Danny Elfman , Kirk Douglas , and Carly Simon . <p> I 've had experience with a lot of different people , just because of age and career . The bravest guy I ever met was a Muslim Iraqi police officer who knew he was facing certain death and kept doing his job until he got killed , so I ca n't rant about " Muslims . " I served with some great black officers and NCOs in the military . One of my after work drinking buddies as a criminal defense lawyer was a lesbian feminist lawyer who carried a concealed semiauto . It takes all kinds . I also got exposed to scum and idiots of all types in the criminal courts . <p> I 'm an old Cold Warrior , a JFK liberal who still believes in the US Constitution , liberty and equality under law . Maybe only iknowexactly is of the same type here now , because of age . We 've been around . <p> Anonymity is great , but it has a big issue . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in an argument with a Down 's Syndrome kid or homeless schizophrenic over whether 1 + 0 = 1 or 1 + 0 = 10 . On the internet , you might be arguing with the functional equivalent , a nut or barely-educated basement dweller , but you do n't know it . Why bother ? <p> I 'm cool with anyone posting their stuff . I 'm a First Amendment absolutist , and it 's not my forum . Let Samseau and Scorpion post away . But it 's not my forum , and Roosh has endorsed the Kevin MacDonald stuff , so . . I 've been around the internet long enough to see what happens . Last year on other commenting platforms , I got banned from 3 sites for supporting Trump . I do n't do ad-hominems or obscene rants , I just dissented from the prevailing current on those pages and got banned for saying things like " Hillary is a warmonger . " <p> What happens is , you get a prevailing trend . It gets endorsed by the moderators . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others leave due to disgust at the barrage of racial subject matter . Some people flip out when they perceive attacks on their group . Then the remaining majority of active members start to flag and call out dissenting views as trolls . The moderators start to have a flexible definition of " trolling , " and look at the posts of the " dissenters " more critically , looking for a reason to suspend or ban them . After awhile , the place becomes an echo chamber . <p> Extreme politics also leads to an even more extreme reaction from the outside world with DDOS attacks and hacking attempts . " I 'm not a robot , " " Select all squares with storefronts . " You avoid discussion with personal information on PMs , demur from posting a data sheet because there are demented doxxers out there . <p> I do n't know if RVF will totally become an echo chamber . All I know is I 'm not going to try to find out . I have other things to do . <p> Well done pheonix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics brings , but taking meaningful action which will help you . Look to develop a brotherhood of men who you have real bonds with . This is important for both when there is a crisis or when there is n't a crisis . Look to develop skills that will enable you to live independently outside off society I.e. how to fish/hunt etc . It is important that you recognise the situation of the world which is on an ever greater March towards a police state , but once that has been recognised you have to stop there with research and begin to take action that will help you . I am starting a brotherhood in Nottingham UK , read the meetup forum in the travel forum for more details . <p> This is why the liberals , leftists , and SJWs are going to ultimately win . They are fanatical and never quit . They are willing to go to North Dakota and put up camps in the dead of winter to protest the pipeline .

However , it reminds me of Nixon . Historically , Nixon is now considered one of the most liberal president 's in history . His Supreme Court appointments were some of the biggest Constitution changing liberals on the court . Why was that ? Because of the times . The liberals controlled the culture and Nixon was liberal because the culture was liberal . Will the same happen with Trump ? Will Trump makes the culture worse by creating more economic prosperity , which is the source of all degeneracy ? <p> ( 01-01-2017 09:50 AM ) Roosh Wrote : The problem with goals like this is that when you try to abstain from something , it 's still on your mind , sometimes to a greater degree than when you participated .

Why is England so obsessed with playing the same content and theater day in and day out ? <p> The two parts in bold are the answer to your question . <p> One part is to make money , but the other part is for political reasons . <p> A cynic would say it 's predictive programming in the run up to some conflict in the near future . Recall that there was a burst of high profile war movies/miniseries ( Saving Private Ryan , Band of Brothers , Enemy at the Gates , Pearl Harbor , etc ) leading up to the middle eastern conflicts of the 2000s . <p> Speaking of WW2 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be highly ironic . " What are we fighting for ? " ' Freedom . ' <p> Ah yes , the freedom to be enslaved into fighting and dieing in a war of which they have no say over ( draft and selective service ) . The freedom to have their family wealth ( gold ) stolen at gunpoint . The freedom to have the fruits of their labor stolen ( income taxes ) . <p> Maybe it should remember the Brits on their last time of glory , like the World Cup 66 . Kind of strange nostalgia . <p> For us , these conflicts can be resolved by appeal to the deeply ingrained higher principle embodied in the law , that individuals have the right ( within defined limits ) to choose how to live . But this Western notion of individualism and tolerance is by no means a conception in all cultures . - Theodore Dalrymple <p> It stokes up passionate patriotic and nationalist sentiment about a victorious war where the threat of invasion was real .... <p> .... and because the enemy was nationalistic white men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from becoming anti-immigration sentiment . <p> " You are n't against those poor refugees , are you ?

It was the last hurrah of the British Empire . After WW2 we fell from ' global superpower ' to ' fairly important but not the big player ' . Rose-tinted glasses and nostalgia does the rest . 2 . It was a victory to be proud of , one that defies logic : the logical decision in 1940-41 would have been to seek terms with Germany , but we did n't . We kept fighting and that 's something to get behind 3 . As stated before , the amount of footage allows all these documentaries to be made 4 .

Few wars thus fought in the last few hundred years have been so easily categorised as the ' goodies ' against the ' baddies ' . It 's easy to get jingoistic and proud in fighting and beating history 's most evil man . <p> The WWII documentaries being pushed hard all lead inevitably to holocaust brainwashing which leads to " we must willingly accept all the migrants and welcome and embrace them , whatever " . It 's all a part of the liberal globalist agenda . <p> Also , watching trench warfare is like watching people play poker when you do n't know what their cards are . Boooring . <p> I imagine there 's just a lot less public interest in WWI . In WWII there 's the whole good vs evil thing ; it seems a lot more black and white . What the fuck was WWI even about ? Most people have no idea , and it 's not like there were a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last 30-40 years either . <p> But a LOT more people died in western europe in WWI ! So it deserves to be remembered . I 'm old enough to have a grandfather who served in WWI and one who served in WWII . Bothe WWI and WWII were horrible , brutal destructive wars . Nothing like the romantic fiction portrayed in the films . <p> The difference is the media can push their muslim migrant loving agenda with WWII by analogy to the Jewish holocaust . ( i.e. if we do n't accept unlimited amounts of Muslims into Europe , we are as bad as Hitler ) . <p> This agenda should be resisted by all possible means , even including challenging the Holocaust story . <p> I 'm not saying it does n't . I think WWI was both fascinating and horrific . The tactics were slow to adapt to the lethality of industrial warfare and it was the meat grinder of all meat grinders . <p> Many more people died at the Battle of Somme than in the entire American Civil War . More soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the west has lost in the Middle East in the last century . Death on that scale is hard to grasp ; it is awe inspiring in a terrible way . <p> But , most people do n't care , and the TV stations are n't going to put out shows that the average idiot wo n't watch . That 's all I 'm saying . <p> There 's not much footage from WW1 , the documentaries that exist , are good . I find WW1 much more fascinating than WW2 , introduction of air , tanks , proliferation of repeating guns , and how tactics had to change due to all this new tech . <p> Stephen Ambrose Wrote : " The British had as many problems , if not more , in recovering from victory as the Germans did in recovering from defeat .

In fact , a girl speaking English too well in Russia is usually a turn-off . Girls that like English/USA a lot are usually users and also they embody certain qualities from the West that I do n't like . They 're also too easy for me .

What 's up with this LTR nostalgia ? ? ? <p> First things first . Do n't think an LTR is the solution for regular sex . Think about it . When do you have the best , most frequent sex with the same girl ? At least in my case , it 's when we 're just " friends " , before we start infringing on each other with our growing emotional attachment . That 's when all the fun gets sucked out of the relationship . When you go from being happy because she actually turned up ( your expectations are low ) to when you get a bit anxious because she 's taking her time ( your expectations are high ) when in reality , she 's taking the same amount of time , but the oxytocin in your system in bonding you to her . <p> No man , LTRs can be nice .

Life would be perfect if I hit it off with a girl who met the cut for FWB every two weeks .

Before that guys owe it to themselves to build up experience . Do their time in the trenches . <p> Outside of an LTR , the alternative is seeing different chicks or constantly refreshing your roster . But you can also take a break and avoid it all for a while , and come back stronger . This is n't a popular opinion , most guys feel you should always have something going , but time off does wonders for me . <p> Can you take the same break in an LTR ? I do n't think so . But it 's probably effective to be emotionally and physically distant every now and then . Take a week or two off after spending a particularly great time with your girl and have her miss and crave you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult point for me . <p> I 've had a lot of short ( weeks-months ) flings/relationships in the past several years , but nothing that long . I think my last was 9 months ? But I checked out when I realized how much time/money I was putting in and how little effort I seem to have received on her part . <p> In the past , long ago , I had several 1.5-2yr relationships . But , I was also more delta/beta and willing to give in to a lot of bullshit that I can not fathom doing now . Also know that 1 was cheating most of that whole time . <p> Biggest , most consistent errors : <p> Bargaining of any sort - if you reach this point , you seem to have already lost <p> Being too easy to get locked down - I 've fallen for this where the girl is a 7.5 and I 'm happy enough to have her around that I get less skeptical of her ability to please me . They smell this like sharks smell blood in the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid commitment first - I spent a few $k on my last one on some trips . I make good money , but I had to twist her arm to do anything much other than drive to see me . She 'd been pampered by being a 7.5 in a quagmire of 5s for far too long <p> My own complacency - I have not dropped my gym habit for any girl , but I gave up on a good proportion of my social activity that was separate from her . I tend to bounce back and forth between introverted and extroverted phases , and I need to maintain the extroverted side . It helps that I am still steadily meeting girls when that is going on . Even if I 'm not doing much more than flirting with them , it keeps my game tighter . I let this slip quite a bit over the past year . <p> Not making things interesting enough - I got bored with our relationship routine but I did n't do much other than a few trips . It would 've taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting a bunch of time and money all at once <p> Slipping back into porn/jerking it - When I realized that the sex was n't that satisfying anymore , I retreated back into old habits . She needs to feel the drive to satisfy you . If she can not satisfy you , at least to a certain amount , she will feel useless , dejected , and will stop putting in the effort . 49879 @qwx909879 <p> Sexual boredom has been a big downside of my previous LTRs that has n't been as much of a problem once I started spinning plates . How long can two people go seeing each other causally and not let the boredom set in ? At least for my part , I know I was able to see one girl for the better part of six months on average once a week , at most twice , with one break of several weeks and our meets were always exciting , and she only once pulled the " I du n no I 'm just not feeling it let 's just cuddle " thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putting the collar I gave her on ( all three girls I saw regularly over the past year were into kink ) the minute she knew I 'd be stopping by .

I did sometimes , and sometimes I did n't . You know they 're " exploring other options " too if you 're not committing , it would be foolish to think otherwise . Can your ego handle that , and can you deal with the inherent insecurity that a girl who agrees to a setup like that for any period might also one day decide to cut you off on a dime in favor of ( hopefully ) some beta who is willing to hand everything over ?

A lot of chicks definitely are n't getting what they think they want out of their LTRs , that 's for sure . They 're 30 or pushing it , been with the same schlub for 5 years , they 've read 50 Shades of Grey and feel cheated . They want the Dominant Daddy player who treats them like a whore mystery-man experience before the door shuts forever . <p> But I 'm getting older , and while it 's been fun I ca n't keep this up forever .

Most chicks would hold grudges only to have it all come fluttering out when you track mud in the house after she 's " just mopped the kitchen " It 's not the big ticket issues that are corrosive to LTR 's it 's the small day to day misunderstandings . Sure , you can try to reframe an interaction , a conversation or her mindframe but at what point does the maintenance you apply to baseline strategy become too costly and exhausting ? <p> In retrospect , this reframing should be done on the front end before advancing into the deeper phases of a LTR . Once entering into the thicket the weeds become too great and grow too rapidly . 49879 @qwx909879 <p> ( 10-27-2016 09:49 AM ) MY DETROIT PLAYAS Wrote : In retrospect , this reframing should be done on the front end before advancing into the deeper phases of a LTR . Once entering into the thicket the weeds become too great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left has to begin right from the start . But I know the cost is that some girls are going to rapidly drop out of the running when they see where the frame is headed , particularly when they 're older . I guess that 's for the best , but it always costs time at the very least . 49879 @qwx909879 <p> I think its very hard to go over this without taking into account your own personality type , energy levels , etc . <p> I do need to preface that before getting into any LTR , or LTR talk , one must absolutely knows basic game as well as advanced screening . You can have A+ game but if you sack up with a girl who has no business being in a LTR , then all bets are off . I firmly believe that most LTR problems and disadvantages come from people coupling up with shitty girls who ruin their life . These are dead on arrivals LTR that Jariel spoke of , which are too numerous today . <p> For a LTR to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and herself , among other things . <p> Now , about LTR . Some people love the chase and live for it , some hold their personal freedom very sacred , in which case I do n't  think they should do a LTR , except for a " test run " to get the feel . <p> Some people enjoy the hunt like they would a glass of wine , but would rather devote their energy elsewhere . Some enjoy deep connection with women and prefers quality time , some just have a deep romantic side . In these cases a LTR would clearly benefit them . <p> So I guess : <p> Pro : -Regular on demand sex with compatible , compliant partner <p> -Stability + support from a good gal , which frees you to devote energy to other things <p> -Profound , deep connection / companionship . I do think some of the most warming things in the world can come from a loving woman : sew and alter your clothes , weave a scarf for you , iron your clothes , etc . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my first LTR my ex bought me shit ton of clothes and stuff , which I used to game other girls ... I was an ass . <p> -Social proof : having a beautiful girl visibly devoted to you does wonder for social proof . Society approves , strangers treat you better , etc . <p> -Introspection : the right LTR reveals a lot about you than you know about yourself . Its also a good trial run for those who would like to start a family . <p> -Good networking : pretty girls often have good connections . <p> -Force you to develop tight game . <p> Cons : <p> -Time and maintenance : I would not put this as cons because if you screen right she would n't be high maintenance . You are expected to put in work however . For me , its a lot less work and GGG than going hunting . <p> -Mentally taxing : just avoid talking politic and philosophy with your girl ... Eventually however she will gravitate toward your own beliefs , but avoid focusing on it . I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant women are n't the most " educated " <p> -Intrusion of privacy : while I love my girl , I do not and will not live with her . Period . And I do believe moving in with a girl you do n't  consider marrying is a like shoving a morning star up your ass . <p> -Exclusivity / cant fuck other hoes : gray area . My game is not good enough to speak on this . <p> -Might compete with your other hobbies : again this goes back to screening . You should be with a girl who like the same things as you do . <p> -Relationship game : drama , social circle , trust issues , etc . Might be a pro if it forces your game to evolve . <p> -Break ups : every LTR has a shelf life . No matter how you cut in , part of you gets ripped away when it ends . 49879 @qwx909879 <p> Upsides You will have good company and hopefully good experiences Extend social Circle and meet new people Safer rawdogging - It 's never safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downside . Women are exceptional at emotionally blackmailing and guilt tripping . <p> Downsides Your " me " time starts to be her " me " time . Especially you start to live together . - I rarely have time to do what I want , most of the stuff I do , is with her . Which is fine , unless I want to play starcraft or do something else alone . There is a high degree of probability that she will not like your friends . Both of you have your own personalities and different needs , and they will eventually clash . Women are emotionally very needy , and we do n't have time for that shit . - My girl has the tendency of starting a " fight " over stupid shit at 2300 and prolonging through the night . I fell for it twice . You never truly know if she is in the long con or not . Weight gain ( and not the good one ) - Sharing food , going out to eat .. even cooking at home stopped being as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got skinnier . Less interest in sex - I suppose you just start showing affection some other way . I have googled this and appears to be normal . 49879 @qwx909879 <p> I feel like this is mostly self-explanatory . Really no content to add to OP question that others have n't already said . <p> As for LTR game in general , I do n't consider myself any kind of expert at it . I 've failed at most every long term relationship I 've been in to date in my adult life aside from one that ended mutually . My heart has been hardened by a history of LTR 's that left me hurt so nowadays I tend to keep myself at arm 's length from women emotionally . I expect relationships to fail so I do n't let myself get all to deep into them . All I can do is speculate based on my past experiences and lessons learned , so here goes : <p> -If you are going to live with a woman , do n't get a place withi her or mover into iher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , or buy a house under your own name that you both can live in . No only is this just smart economics , but it maintains the frame that you are indeed the " man of the house " and run the ship . It 's your world , she 's just living in it . Of course let her decorate and make it look nice ( women are far better at this than men ) so it feels like home to both of you , but at the end of the day you 're the captain . <p> -Let it be known what you want and what you expect early on . This will make for less ambiguity down the line . If she does n't want to play by the rules then show her the door before you get too attached and decide to let shit slide . If she decides to stay and place nice then game on . <p> -It 's okay to " be beta " once in a while . I think one of the biggest problems a lot of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They pull way too hard the opposite direction and come off as bitter , stubborn , mean , and difficult to deal with . A lot of women will put up with it for a while , but it does n't hold up . I think of days where I was a chump when trying to deal with women and letting my LTR 's go off the rails - if I had just a little bit of game , just a drop or two of red pill , it would have been great . You do n't need to be a shit heel , just have a spine and know when to draw boundaries and stick to them . Sweet but firm . Calibrated . <p> -Realize that things you are uncomfortable with are not going to get better , they will only get worse , or at best be an ever-present annoyance . Come to grips early on if issues with a girl you ca n't change can be forgiven/overlooked . If she has males friends and you do n't like it , well you ca n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but good luck ) so either give her the door or deal with it . You do n't like her sexual past ? You ca n't change it so either forget about it or move on . Etc. 49879 @qwx909879 <p> In an LTR , I have much clearer focus on work . 100% of my energy goes into it . One should n't underestimate how much goes into establishing and maintaining a harem . Nevertheless , for several months of the year , I require fresh pussy . Boredom is inevitable . So some kind of balance is the optimal situation , at least for me. 49879 @qwx909879 <p> ( 09-09-2011 10:37 PM ) UgSlayer Wrote : I know this board is all about getting notches and all that , but let 's not ignore the benefits of being in a LTR with a top grade girl/woman who respects you and your masculinity who will do whatever you say . .... <p> Being a player and being in an LTR both have its benefits . <p> Bingo .

I feel like this thread could be useful for older guys looking at specific countries , almost like a reference sheet . <p> Just to get things kicked off : <p> United States : Not an easy place for age gaps it seems . In my experience , 3-5 year differences seem to be the norm , and with a younger girl still in her prime ( 18-25 ) , its tough to get them to go much further than this .

A 40-50 year old guy in decent shape will have no problem bedding or marrying a non-pro half his age ( 20-25 ) .

Needless to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are looking for a younger woman , you 'll have absolutely no issue . <p> Yes here in Ukraine younger girls seem to have no problem with much older men .

This decrease begins right around age 25 , which is right in line with our knowledge about female aging . <p> The bottomline is this : Beauty , fertility and estrogen production in women are all inextricably linked , with what we perceive as physical beauty ( or lack thereof ) largely being a visual representation of the other two . <p> Know your enemy and know yourself , find naught in fear for 100 battles .

It has n't been scientifically proven yet ( before the porn advocates jump in ) , but several studies hint to it , plus a library full of **27;982;TOOLONG strongly suggest it . One of the reasons why there is n't strong research yet is because it is close to impossible for researchers to find subjects for control-groups ( =men who do n't watch porn and have never watched porn regularly ) . The effects are more detrimental in younger brains and for people who had their first " sexual experiences " with porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , I can list some of which I can think of right now off the top of my head but if you have n't heard about this yet , I 'd advise you to do some research . Of course , not all of the following will be the case for everyone and the severity will also vary individually . <p> 1 ) With porn , you have to ability " to fuck " as many hot , beautiful girls every day , as you want . Whenever you feel horny even a bit , you can just get online and " fuck " any girl you could ever dream of . This is unnatural . The human brain is not made to be overwhelmed with such a selection . By doing this you basically flood your brain with dopamine . It feels amazing - almost like a drug , but it can also be as addictive as a drug . And after years of exposition , you will experience sexual oversaturation and jaded pleasures . The dopamine-receptors become less sensitive , which leads to a situation where normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . Which leads to point number two : <p> 2 ) With porn , you not only have a huge variety of which girls you want to fuck , but also what they do . Every single fetish can be streamed immediately . This often leads to the development of weird fetishes that you never thought you had . In the beginning when boys start watching porn , just a nude girl will get them rock hard . After a while , they often start wanting something else . She has to get fucked . Then she has to get fucked in the ass . Then she has to get gangbanged . Then she has to ... to be continued , you get the idea . At some point , some men experience that it is difficult for them to get erect with erotica only . And it can even lead to erectile problems with real-life partners . Real girls ca n't change into the other girl from tab number 20 . Not every girl will want you to ATM her . So because the brain is adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sexual ) stimuli anymore . This is what is called PIED ( Porn-induced erectile dysfunction ) and an increasing number of even teenagers seem to suffer from it . <p> 3 ) This jadedness can cause problems not only in regards to sexuality . In every-day life your brain uses dopamine to regulate your mood and how your feelings react to the situations you encounter . When your dopamine-receptors are desensitized , you literally wo n't be able to enjoy life as much anymore . Dopamine has also motivating effects and helps with learning , etc . All this can be negatively impacted by porn . People report constantly feeling tired , dizzy , unmotivated , having some sort of brainfog , etc . Most of this resolves when they abstain from porn for a few weeks/months . All effects can be reversed with complete porn/erotica-abstinence . <p> 4 ) Especially in a developing brain with little to no prior real-life experiences , porn can be very bad . What is the situation like when you watch porn ? Well , you usually see how the girl you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy that . Porn teaches your brain that watching sex equals sex . Because it is the first/only sexual experience your brain gets . Some men report they ca n't get hard with their girlfriend , but they have no problems when looking at pictures of women . You basically train yourself to be a cuck . <p> 5 ) When you 're sexually satisfied ( with frequent porn-consumption you 're even over-satisfied ) , there is little to no incentive for you to actually go out and talk to girls . If you do this from puberty onwards , it will get increasingly difficult to change everything around . It also lowers confidence , which seems to have already impacted F1l1pV - although not every case of low self-esteem can be explained by this . However , every case of low self-esteem will be reinforced by this . <p> etc. , etc . The more frequent and the more extreme the porn , the worse the effects . If you bang your girl every day but additionally watch porn once a week , then that probably wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how you 're feeling . I 'm a young guy too(21) and at the crossroads of turning 18 , believe it or not , well .. no fireworks appeared at midnight at 12am and nothing much changed in my life in the days that followed . It almost felt ... just like any other birthday . Except that it is. 18 is an important age where you start to formulate your own views and opinions and as you grow older , you tend to either build on those views or discover new ones that you relate more to . I 'm in no way qualified to tell you decades long personal success stories since I 'm probably just a couple of years older . I think the fact you CARE about your future enough to research on it shows that you have what it takes to go far . Other 16 years old could barely give a shit . The only advice I can give you is that at your age , it is the absolute worst and detrimental to be a crowd follower or pleaser . High school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections you need but do n't ever mentally compromise on your own well being . High school will come and go , have a blast and move on to the next phase of life . Do n't follow the crowd blindly , find your own passion . Start looking at potential internships or colleges or even cities you want to move to next time . Everything that will shape the life you will have in future . It 's never too early to be ready . If you need life advice , I 'm probably not the most cut out to be giving that but if you need to talk about your troubles going through this phase of life that a fellow millennial went through not too long ago , feel free to send me a PM . Good luck buddy . 
@@96059248 @259248/ <p> Book review:Three Billion New Capitalists : The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East <p> Reviewed by G. John Ikenberry <p> In this stark portrait of a coming economic crisis , the veteran trade analyst Prestowitz writes that the postwar era of U.S.-led globalization is giving way to a global economic restructuring headed by China and India . He is alarmed , because those nations are not simply integrating into the Western world economy ; they are shaking its already " battered and strained " foundation , playing by different rules and growing quickly . Prestowitz is all the more worried because the United States is not prepared for this momentous shift . One failing is the mismanagement of the U.S. economy , manifest in low household savings , high budget shortfalls , and unsustainable trade deficits and foreign borrowing . But the deeper problem for Prestowitz is that the United States has no national strategy to protect its industry , skilled workers , and technological leadership . Echoing his earlier work , he argues that the United States ' laissez-faire economic ideology and confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming crisis and from developing a programmatic national response .

@@96059250 @259250/ <p> I 've been into gaming girls for the last couple of months since I 've read BANG . However , I feel other guys , without game are doing much better than me . For example , a friend of mine who does n't know anything about talking to girls gets more success than me with the girls ? Now , I am still a noob when it comes to approaching girls ( anxiety , etc ) , but after that everything runs smoothly ... Here comes another factor that has been discussed thousands of time on this forum , I am part of a minority group and he 's not . I know minority guys can also pickup girls , but I feel they need more game than other guys ? What do you guys think about this ? <p> I think you 're worrying too much . I 'm not tall , but I ai n't worrying about it . I get more girls that guys taller than me . <p> I 've learned in a few years that if you do something with enough confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do I mean by that ? It does n't matter how you look ( if at least you look groomed and well dressed ) . How you carry yourself matters much more . And trust me , if a woman does n't want to be with you or be friends just because you 're a minority , you do n't want her in your life . <p> Ok this is something I have been studying for a while . I 've been in sales for several years now . No matter what you say , gaming girls is a sale . When I first got into sales I sucked . I would see people come in and just kill it but I could n't figure it out . I spend time reading books watching seminars , training with people , etc . So eventually I got better because I was committed and I built confidence in myself as I went . <p> Now the thing about it is I would still see those people come into the sales company and have amazing results without any knowledge of sales at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time every day to get better and these people could just do it without trying . So I figured out a few things over time that helped me deal with these situations so they did n't effect me mentally anymore <p> 1 . Skill is learne and you never know where someone got their skills . For me all those years of learning how to sell , it became second nature to me , and picking up girls is just another sale , so it looks a lot more natural for me then other people starting in the game . Other people might have been more out going as kids , or worked other jobs that allowed them to open up easier . As far as picking up girls it 's not to much more then having good . Communication skills , confidence , And knowing when to do things at certain times . <p> 2 . People always did better when they did n't think . I know this sounds crazy , but I would throw all my selling skills away for the ability to not think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mess up enough times where these skills become natural to you so you are not thinking about what to do next , you just do it . There was this one guy , dumb as a bag of rocks , but could out sell me any day of the week . Instead of getting upset with him , I spent more time with him and learned what he was doing . Most of these people if you asked them , they would n't be able to tell you what they do . It all comes back to having a conversation with someone . You can have a good human to human connection and girls will want to fuck . <p> 3 . Learn from these people . Never get upset with someone that gets results . More often then not they will help you if you just ask . What I do is when I see a good player at a club , I stand next to them and just listen . Or I make friends . I have added several very good wingman this way . Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do because some of it is garbage . What appears to be good moves might actually be hurting them , but they are doing enough uncoinsciencly that they are making it work . The better you get at the game the more you will be able to pick up on these things and pull the good things they do to make your game better . <p> 4 . Shear numbers . Some guys just do n't stop until they find someone that is wiling to talk and work with them . I had one sales guy that was terrible , but he sold because he just would not stop talking to people . All day . Came in early , left late , no lunch , horrible pitch , but he sold . <p> 5 . Do n't let it discourage you . It may appear they are getting a lot of girls but these people tend to fizzle out fast . In sales these people had a life span of about a month , maybe two . These guys that have no game are a lot more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . or they have looks going for them that they can use . Looks fade , but if you get good at the game you can keep that as long as you want . <p> 6 . Directness appeals . Some girls are just ready to fuck . And the more direct you are the more they like it . Does n't always work but this might be what some of those guys are doing . Also take a look at how far they are getting with the girls . A lot of girls will hang out , flirt , even make out , but a real gamer is in it for the bang . Which one are they doing ? <p> 7 . Some guys go for the easy one . In sales we called them low hanging fruit , they would go to places they knew would be easy to sell and screw everyone else out of potential sales . Now that 's a little different with girls , but you have to ask yourself : are they getting the hot ones that everyone wants or the slutty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on by the easy ones . I like a good challenge . I had a fried who slept with a different girl every night but they were like 2 's and 3 's . <p> So basically I can not completely explain all of why it does happen but at least I can hive you a different mindset to look at it . Never get discouraged by someone else . Keep your confidence and learn what you can from them . <p> No offense , but this post sucks asshole . I have n't even read shit , because it 's 2:30 am and I 'm posting on here , which means I 'm not getting any pussy . Sure it sucks to see a guy getting pussy based solely off looks or whatever , we 've all been there . But jealousy , is one of the worst , most negative , counter-productive emotions a man can feel . It 's better to focus on yourself and learn not to give a fuck about anyone else . Recently , I 've kind of fallen into the trap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume and quality of pussy he 's gotten , simply due to his looks/height .... <p> But you know what , fuck it , nothing good can come out of it . We all have our strengths and weaknesses . Homie pulls way more ass than me , but my safety deposit is about 20 X fatter than his , and I could travel around the world thrice , if I wanted to it at this point . Anyways , these are all moot points , there is no value or point in comparing yourself with others , whether that be in a positive or negative light . <p> ( 08-19-2011 01:05 PM ) Clearwaterkid Wrote : 5 .

Human nature tends to overestimate your effort while downplaying the effort put in by others . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort your friend has actually put in . Remember that as years pass , you tend to forget how difficult the learning was , and unless it was spectacularly difficult , it all comes out as " not a big deal " . Learning English was easy for you . I still remember the effort I 've put ( and putting ) there , but even I 'm already at point where I can say it is not that difficult . <p> Everyone is jealous . As much as I hate to admit it , I do sometimes get jealous of another person 's success in any field , that in my opinion is a natural reaction and can not be helped . However , what you do have control over is what you do after that natural reaction , you go on being jealous and try to diss them and put them down or you can learn from them and get better at whatever it is you are trying to get better at . <p> As for the minority thing , if you are being mistaken for Arab/Turkish then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum about how important dress sense is in Europe ever since I joined this forum , I would say that its more important than your skin color . I am an Indian and I do fairly well in Europe , including France . I have been called many names but all those were from guys . In fact I have been subject to so much cockblocking and hate in Europe that its not even funny . I could have pulled out the race card and said RACIST ! But they were n't being racist , they were trying to hit me where it hurts the most because they were hating . <p> I just got home from a night out with one of my best friends . We double-teamed a couple of girls at the last bar we went to tonight and he ended up going home with his chick and is probably balls deep right now , while I had to settle for a phone number from mine . Am I jealous ? Fuck no . I 'm grateful for having such an awesome friend who can challenge me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying what he did right that I did n't . The worst thing in the world in my experience is going out with guys who have no game and wo n't challenge you to be all that you can be ( and will passively cockblock you in the process ) . I 've learned countless moves and lessons from hanging out with my friend and I have no qualms whatsoever with the fact that he got pussy tonight . If anything I 'm glad to have played a small part by occupying her friend , who I now have a chance at banging whereas if my friend had no game we would have both been blown out within 5 minutes . <p> Do not be jealous of those who have mastered what you hope to master , instead cherish their company and learn all you can from them . <p> I 'm going to quote Carl Van Loon ( Robert De Niro ) from Limitless , if you 've seen the movie , you will know . <p> Quote:That you would even think of that would only show me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@96059255 @259255/ <p> Atheist polemicists portray religious faith as an irrational belief that has no supporting evidence at all . Theists reply that of course there is evidence for the existence of God , the atheists respond that it 's not real evidence , and round and round they go . It 's not my purpose here to convert you to Christianity , although I 'd be gratified if my writings played a part in that , however small . I suspect most RoK readers already have strong , settled opinions on the question of God 's existence . <p> My aim is to briefly outline the classical arguments for the existence of God . Some of these arguments are incomprehensible to the secular modern , as they assume a classical background in philosophy and theology , but that says more about the secular modern education system than it does about the arguments . <p> Christianity is integral to Western tradition over the past 2,000 years and all men should have a basic knowledge of why our ancestors believed what they did . <h> The Ontological Argument <p> Anselm of Canterbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably the greatest mind of the Latin Church between St. Augustine of Hippo and St. Thomas Aquinas . As Archbishop , he came into conflict with the English Kings William II and Henry I , the sons of William the Conqueror , and was sent into exile on two occasions . He is chiefly remembered in philosophy and theology circles for creating the Ontological Argument for God . The argument can be found in Anselm 's work Proslogium : <p> - Even a fool , when he hears of a being than which nothing greater can be conceived understands what he hears , and what he understands is in his understanding. And assuredly that , than which nothing greater can be conceived , can not exist in the understanding alone . For suppose it exists in the understanding alone : then it can be conceived to exist in reality ; which is greater. Therefore , if that , than which nothing greater can be conceived , exists in the understanding alone , the very being , than which nothing greater can be conceived , is one , than which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . Hence , there is no doubt that there exists a being , than which nothing greater can be conceived , and it exists both in the understanding and in reality . <p> In layman 's terms , the argument can be summarized like this : By definition , God is a being than which none greater can be imagined ; God exists as an idea in the mind ; a being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is , everything else being equal , greater than a being that exists only in the mind ; thus , if God only exists in the mind then we can imagine something greater than God ; but we can not imagine a being greater than God because it is incoherent to say we can imagine a being greater than the greatest possible being ; therefore God exists . <p> Rene Descartes also devised an ontological argument for God 's existence grounded in his philosophical concepts of innate ideas and clear and distinct perception : I have an idea of a supremely perfect being ; existence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When most people hear the Ontological Argument for the first time , it strikes them as wrong somehow . They feel like they 've been tricked even if they lack the philosophical language to pinpoint how exactly . If you do n't find the Ontological Argument compelling , neither did St. Thomas Aquinas or Immanuel Kant , so you 're in good company . <h> The Teleological Argument <p> The First Vatican Council ( 1869-1870 ) declared in its canons : <p> If anyone says that the one , true God , our creator and lord , can not be known with certainty from the things that have been made , by the natural light of human reason : let him be anathema . <p> In other words , Catholics- are doctrinally bound to believe that the existence of God can be proven through reason alone ( even a reactionary extremist like me can appreciate the irony there . ) The notion that God 's existence can be proven through created things is rooted in St. Paul 's letter to the Romans : <p> For the invisible things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made ; his eternal power also , and divinity : so that they non-believers are inexcusable . <p> - St. Thomas Aquinas ( 1225-1274 ) devised five proofs for the existence of God . Unlike the Ontological Argument , which is rooted in pure concepts , Thomas relies on sense experience to guide his readers to the conclusion . <p> Thomas offers the proof from motion : we observe motion all around us . Whatever is in motion was once at rest until moved by something else , and that thing by something else , and so on . But if there is an infinite series of movers , motion never would have started and there would be no motion now . There is motion now , so there must be a first unmoved mover . This we call God . <p> The proof from efficient cause : everything in the world was made by something . Apple made your computer . Your parents made you . Again , if there were an infinite series of efficient causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're here so there has to be a first unmade maker . This we call God . <p> The proof from necessary being : there was a time when you and I did not exist . There will come a time when you and I no longer exist in this world . We are contingent beings , which means we do not exist necessarily . If existence is contingent , then there was once a time when nothing had yet come to be . Nothing comes from nothing , but because there is something now , there must be at least one necessary being , which we call God . <p> The proof from gradations of perfection : we evaluate all people and things in terms of how good , true , and beautiful they are . We have standards on how things and people ought to be . But those standards would n't make sense unless we had a concept of that which is the most good , true , and beautiful . This we call God . <p> And finally , the argument from design : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed for flight , the human eye is designed for seeing , the earth 's environment is designed to support human life , and so on . Design implies a designer , and that designer is God . <p> We can see the influence of Aristotle in these five arguments . For that reason they are called teleological arguments because they presuppose meaning and purpose in creation ( for example , Aristotle and Thomas would say that the telos of an acorn is to grow into an oak tree . ) <p> David Hume responded that it 's a faulty analogy to compere the universe to man-made objects . We have not witnessed a universe being designed so we can not be certain that it 's the result of design . Further , he argued that if nature itself contains the principle of order then the need for a designer is removed . Even if the universe is designed , Hume says it does not follow that the designer is the Christian God . I find Hume 's objections unconvincing , but I include them because he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today . <h> The Moral Argument <p> Immanuel Kant ( 1724 " 1804 ) famously objected to the Ontological Argument by stating that existence is not a predicate . He believed that all theoretical approaches to the question of God would fail because the nature of God transcends pure human reason . <p> Kant sought to ground both morality and God 's existence in practical human reason . However , it should be noted that Kant 's argument is less about God and more about justice in the hereafter : moral behavior is rational ; it is only rational if justice is done ; justice will only be done if God exists ; therefore , God exists . <p> Obviously there is a lot of evil in this world . Sometimes crime pays . Bad things happen to good people , and good things happen to bad people . Kant believed that if morality was nothing but a cost-benefit analysis , many more people would choose evil if it was to their personal benefit . Like Pascal 's Wager , Kant 's argument is meant to influence our behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . If people are to choose happiness and virtue " the summum bonum " the afterlife must exist . <p> Cardinal John Henry Newman ( 1801 " 1890 ) argued from the existence of our conscience . Our conscience drives us to choose good even when it 's not in our best interest . If our conscience suggests the objectivity of moral truths , then God must exist to give those truths normative force . <h> Conclusions <p> I converted to the Catholic faith at the age of 24 , so I do n't claim to be a disinterested observer in this debate . To be sure , many men believe in God because they were raised that way and they 've never seriously questioned it . Similarly , many men were n't raised in any particular faith and they 've never seriously questioned their own secularism . <p> In a real sense , the existence or non-existence of God is the question upon which everything else hinges . Dostoyevsky said through the character of Ivan Karamazov that if God does not exist , then everything is permissible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or faith seeking understanding . Thomas taught that some truths can be known through faith and reason , but some truths can only be known through faith . Faith in God drove men to create some of humanitys greatest artistic , philosophical , and political achievements. - You may not believe , but most of your ancestors did . It was in the very air they breathed . <p> It 's a common place of atheist polemicists that religion has killed more people than any other force on earth . Even minimally educated readers should see that 's nonsense . Stalin alone killed more people than the Spanish Inquisition did in the 300 years of its existence . Christianity in particular has been declining in the West for at least a century . Is the world that much better for it ? <p> This is n't a bad article , but Aquinas ' Fifth Way is badly misunderstood . The design argument of Aquinas is not the design argument of Paley . Aquinas is arguing that natural processes are goal directed ( i.e. sex is directed toward reproduction , hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' view , teleology is immanent , that is , inherent in nature . <p> Paley , on the other hand , is arguing for imposed teleology , a logical conclusion from his mechanistic world view . It 's also part of theistic personalism , which has huge issues ( when compared to classical theism ) .

@@96059259 @259259/ <p> I believe that there is a natural law of compensation , a reaction for every action made . A lot of the time the university will find a way to provide a counter balance , to a movement , lifestyle . You sow what you reap . The industrial revolution saw a big boom in free market capitalism and the reaction to this action , was the creation of Marxian Socialism . This dynamic play out , is seen on the microcosm and macrocosm , among individuals . <p> This may be the key to the purpose of man . As discussed throughout the Manosphere and as you can clearly see on all forms of media , men are fundamentally disposable . When you were boy , no one would care if you were bullied , abused or were going through a roller coaster of emotions . If you were lucky , there would have been parents , or family members who would give you a degree of comfort . But even this is a luxury that wo n't seep out into the outside world . <p> Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Sensitivity and emotions will be trampled on you . As being a man , you will constantly have , even the love of your life , put you through a series of shit tests . To prove your worth and to temporarily pave over her biological insecurities . <p> So the question has to be asked , what does the natural of compensation , have to say about this apparent disadvantage in manhood . I believe the blessing of such a curse so to speak . Is that it will fundamentally make you more stronger than you could have possibly imagined . That is if you accept this resolve and try to ride the wave of of this uncertain disadvantage . <p> The pillars of civilisation were built by this stoicism . When the physical world only brings with it suffering and transience . One has to look up and seek the nearest possible thing to absolute truth that can be attained on the earthly planes . Most times this will be the attainment of a high art form , skill , trade . Or minimum benchmark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your family , finances , for some of those it may be a leader of a team of soldiers or even his own business . Ultimately though being a leader and master of yourself is what has to be accomplished . <p> Good thread . Abraham Maslow 's work goes a long way towards an explanation . I 'll include an updated version of his famous Hierarchy of Needs below . <p> It can be summarised in one short phrase : " What a man can be , he must be " . In other words , men must constantly be improving themselves . <p> Women 's needs can also be expressed using the same hierarchy , although they have a much stronger focus on the basic needs ( lower in the pyramid ) . They also tend to prefer stability , not constant progress through the hierarchy .

Our sex life is great , it 's just that I 'm lacking something , or rather I have a huge desire to try something with my girlfriend . During my younger days , I liked experimenting with wanking , so one time I attempted to penetrated the insides of a squid . I pushed it inside the squid , squeezing the squid 's entrance with my hand to keep up the stimulative pressure . Since then , I have become addicted to it . <p> I 've always liked wanking , and I did n't stop while in relationships either . Sometimes , after cumming into the squid , I would wash it , bake it and eat it . So one time during the relationship , I baked some squid into which I 've cummed earlier and served it to my girlfriend . I did n't wash the squid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that it tasted great . After this dinner , we ended up in bed despite her being on her period . <p> Everything was great until she started complaining that my penis reeked of fish . I 've washed it after playing with the squid , of course , but the smell still remained . It bothered me that she complained about the smell , so I snapped back that it was her menstruation that reeked of fish . I know it was stupid , but during that time it seemed like a good way to get out of the problem . We did n't continue the sex because she got mad . That was a long time ago , and since then I 've always taken care not to have any squid-scent during sex . I would carefully wipe my penis with scented Kleenex tissues . <p> Why I 'm writing all of this is my desire to use the squid during sex .

About 20 last year and 5 different girls within the last three weeks .... <p> I 'm feeling tired of the game . Tired of approaching girls . Tired of dealing with the drama . Tired of the process . And although I still like sex with new girls . It 's really just not that exciting to me anymore . The rewards are diminishing for sure . I definitely do n't get the same rush I used to . I used to be pumped for weeks after sex with a new girl . Now I 'm slightly excited for an hour or so afterwards and the next day I feel like I 'm right back where I started . <p> I do n't regret breaking up with my ex .

At an individual level , most Jews are passive . I mean , how many Hasidic Jews do you think are in prison right now ? <p> So anytime you see a comment on ROK or this forum like " Damn Greeedy Jewzzz " I would re-frame it as " Damn greedy bankers " or " Damn manipulative media moguls " . Sounds more logical does n't it ? This is n't to legitimize the commenters using that language though , as if they really wanted to tackle those issues they would avoid making it about Jews . <p> And when it comes to Israel , no being anti-Zionist is not anti-semetic . I think this is quite harmful as Israel can bypass legitimate criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good point . Like gays , Jews are about 2-3% of the US population , but for some reason are grossly overrepresented in government , business , media , courts , etc . It does n't mean there 's anything " wrong " with that . It just is . <p> It 's an issue I 've always felt like I had to tread lightly on . Sometimes asking an innocuous question or making a point on the subject can gain immediate accusations of anti-semitism . It 's usually an ad-hominem attack meant to shut down conversation immediately , like most things SJWs do . <p> But back to the original question , I have n't seen any anti-semitism or racism either from Roosh or from this community . I could give the questioner the benefit of the doubt and assume he did n't communicate his point clearly , but reviewing the original posting it sounds like an accusation .

@@96059265 @259265/ <p> Looking for some suggestions here . I used to have longer hair , nothing crazy long but maybe a little above shoulder like Mathew Mcconagay length . Been either shaving my head or wearing it short for a while but am growing it out . I hate the part in between when you go through those awkward just look goofy stages . Looking for suggestions on how to cut it while its growing out . I read something on GQ about keep the sides short and grow out the top but thought that would look goofy . If any of you guys have long hair or have grown out your hair looking for suggestions on what to do during those awkward lengths . Thanks . <p> What are you going for now ? I 'm assuming you want shoulder-length hair again . <p> Do n't cut it . If you 're growing it out , do n't mess with it . I used to have much shorter hair , but then I went without a hair cut for a over a year . That 's what it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimal during this period , but I embraced the messiness and made it work for me . The only real change I made during this stage was that I started putting a side part in my hair . After reaching a good length ( around my jaw ) , I went to have it cut and styled . I kept growing it after that , and now my hair and beard look more or less like this : <p> In the beginning stages just use a light or medium gel to style it or slick it back . It 'll take almost 2 years to get it long enough to tie back in a tail . After that it 's easy . Just keep it tied back and let it grow . Keep a hat in your car for driving . Long hair sucks when driving in a convertible or with your windows down . <p> Trim the ends every 2 months . Use a leave in conditioner to keep it healthy looking . It takes a lot of time to wash and style your hair . Sometimes I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . You might be better off showering the night before . Blow dry it , tie it back and go to bed . In the morning just comb it out and spray in some leave in conditioner . I use Infusium . It 's light and watery . <p> I 've got you man . I went from having a buzz cut to looking like surfer jesus during my mid 20 's . There is an endless amount of dumb info out there on a super simple topic . <p> First and foremost you must under all circumstances resist the urge to cut or trim it for at least 6 to 8 solid months . If you can go a year . The awkward or " gay " stage you are referring to is an unavoidable pain process that one must go through in order to reach full on jesus mode .

@@96059266 @259266/ <p> The Seneca Falls Convention was held in the summer of 1848 , between the days of July 18 - 20 in Seneca Falls , in upstate New York . <p> It has been credited as the first , formalized meeting of women 's rights activists in America . At this point , there was no talk of feminism ; the rhetoric was about women 's rights . It was a hot , stuffy affair of about 300 men &amp; women . Tellingly , men were not allowed to be stand-up speakers , as the women were trying to counterbalance male domination of the political sphere . Already , we see the terrible roots of feminism as female supremacy . <p> A declaration of sentiments was drafted and some interesting &amp; damning debates over class &amp; race started here and still percolate &amp; permeate feminist discourse . <p> The two primary organizers of the convention were Lucretia Mott &amp; Elizabeth Cady Stanton . <p> Elizabeth Cady Stanton is quite possibly one of the most influential people in American history . As usual , her psychologically deficient childhood birthed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father who was a prominent lawyer . There were eleven children born into the family , five of whom died in early childhood . This caused her mother to fall into a life-long depression . Her father 's robust professional life prevented him from having a great influence on her directly . The parenting in the family fell to the eldest daughter - never a good situation . <p> Stanton took to her father 's legal library and began to develop a knowledge base . She attended elite primary schools and won awards for her debating skills . Her father famously remarked after her getting an award , " How I wish you were a boy ! " Stanton took this comment to believe that he valued boys over girls . In reality , it seems that he valued them differently , not as the same . A key error in feminism is that they assume men &amp; women are the same and as such , valuing a man for this &amp; a women for that necessarily means a person values the man over the woman . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of a man - her father . Her mother is a supremely weak person and that probably fuels her own inability to value a woman 's distinct contribution to a marriage &amp; childrearing . As such , she found a beta to marry &amp; took on the role of " voluntary motherhood . " She rubbed elbows fellow 1%'ers in New York City and loved the intellectual debate - probably all fueling her narcissism as she got to feel superior to men as a class if she bested a man in a debate , all the while doing it in a supremely class &amp; race privileged atmosphere . <p> Eventually , she moved to Seneca Falls , where she fell into a depression because of the lack of intellectual stimulation , in which she did not get narcissistic self-preening validated . She traveled to London in 1840 to the Anti-Slavery convention , where she met Lucretia Mott . The two bonded over women 's rights , as they were not allowed to speak or vote at the convention , as the organizers were worried the two would push women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , herself , was a Quaker and was primarily interested in abolishing slavery . Her interest in women 's rights paled in comparison to Stanton 's , especially as Stanton radicalized her views . Mott was interested in expanding social respect ( worship ) for women 's roles in society . Women like her were strong proponents of women as men 's moral superiors . She was opposed to female suffrage , noting that politics are corrupt and subject to power relations that prevent true morality from being used . Part of this relates to the privileged women that would develop as a Gibson Girl in the Gilded Age of America , but also part of that is Mott 's observation that voting is n't as close to as relevant as a person might think . <p> However , their deep friendship &amp; mutual correspondence lead to the Seneca Falls Convention . Predictably , the narcissistic Stanton insisted it be in the town in which she lived , which is quite the demand in a world that does n't have the automobile . <p> Regardless , around 300 people showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held during a hot , blustery series of days . <p> The first day , the men were required to be silent as the two headliners talked about the importance of women 's rights as general concept . Stanton recited her " Declaration of Sentiments " in the morning session . What I find is humorous is they had breaks for refreshments in both days , when men plowed through in greater heat to draft the Constitution . I had better keep my misogynistic observations to myself . <p> Later that day , debates over female suffrage occurred , with a " humorous " recounting of a woman 's idea she works so much harder than her husband - her slaving away all day while he comes home from work to sit around . That woman is already admitting she has class privilege as not many men worked outside the home in such a manner in America . <p> The second day was the most important . Stanton 's declaration was adopted by the entire convention , with men 's &amp; women 's signatures segregated on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is most striking is the only black person allowed to the event - Fredrick Douglass - gave a rousing speech about the equality of all people , black &amp; female , that is often cited as marrying the nascent women 's rights movement and abolition as one . It is n't . <p> Before talking about race &amp; women 's rights , consider the roots of Christianity in women 's rights . Stanton herself distanced herself from Christianity in her life , but knew if she was to reach women , she needed to use Christianity . Her declaration was couched in Biblical exhortations . She argued that female happiness was the touchstone for social approaches to sex relations , but then would argue men &amp; women were created equal by God . She used Christianity to appeal to women , but knew that she could never get the world she wanted purely through Christianity . <p> She knew that she could get to women via emotional appeals . Towards this end , as she was not a great orator nor had the ability to relate to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give rousing speeches to the women in the evening sessions . Mott probably was the one that cemented the convention , as her speeches brought tears to the eyes of women and laid the groundwork for Stanton 's radicalism . <p> Lurking right underneath this was pure social constructionism by women 's rights activists . Like many other women 's rights activists , Stanton thought women 's more emotional nature stemmed from oppression . Douglass , himself , more than hinted at that he thought men &amp; women were equals , only held apart by male domination of women . <p> The convention ended with a good bit of fanfare . Unlike what any feminist would tell you , the convention was met with , in totality , tepid approval . There were many newspapers &amp; intellectuals that did not approve of the convention , but a very good bit of people agreed with the convention . The ideas that women should have easier access to divorce , custody rights &amp; independent income streams was n't as radical as some would argue . The radical idea was women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aftermath of the Civil War , a few Constitutional Amendments were considered . The least controversial one , the 13th Amendment , officially abolished slavery &amp; involuntary servitude . However , a serious rift developed in the women 's rights movement - between those who supported universal enfranchisement for all men , and those that did not &amp; insisted on an equal voting rights Amendment that included women . <p> The 14th &amp; 15th Amendment concern discrimination based on race &amp; black male voting rights , respectively . I am certainly butchering 14th Amendment jurisprudence , but understand the impetus for the 14th Amendment - although hotly contested - was to ensure equal enforcement of the laws for both whites &amp; blacks . Of course , it took over 100 years to see this idea reflected in reality in a sense . <p> Stanton , and many of her supporters , refused to support either Amendment , saying it should not be Constitutional law if women are not included . This caused quite the rift in the movement , as many women 's rights activists were white supremacists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put off by Stanton 's insistence that black &amp; female emancipation should be tied at the hip . <p> Fredrick Douglass argued that white women already enjoyed class privilege , marriage privilege and the fact many women can bend their husband 's ears , as well as their son 's &amp; brother 's . Do you think his correct idea bent female ears ? No . He eventually backtracked in his comments , asserting he never meant to suggest women should n't have the right to vote , saying he was suggesting white women enjoyed more privilege than black men , but in a way that ignored female oppression . <p> Douglass fell into the classic trap of American feminism - he is forced to ignore race so he can solicit female approval . He stood by when Stanton relied on highly racist language in order to move white female approval away from both Amendments , he stayed by her side as a friend and never spoke ill of her . <p> A fascinating , and probably an unprovable concept , is the psychology of American slavery with respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , with respects to Stanton , in her shadow with regards to sex issues . She clearly regarded women as superior to men ( meaning she thought she was superior to everybody else ) , but she also sensed the country was changing with respects to race . She clearly prioritized female emancipation over black emancipation ; in my opinion , she hijacked the issue of slavery to talk about her own discontent as a woman - excuse me , all women 's discontentment with being a wife &amp; mother . <p> Did , at the time of emancipation , slavery gift many black men to either codependency or narcissism ? Douglass clearly suborned himself to women - was he dominated by a narcissistic woman in his youth ? Was she black or white ? What about the men in his life - what were their profiles ? Douglass ' acceptance of Stanton could have been purely political , understanding white women &amp; their issues were far more important to society than a black man 's . That is entirely possible . Still , is the idea that Douglass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views on white women 's rights is plausible , as well . <p> Still , Stanton 's marriage of women &amp; race reflected her correct notion that race was more quickly evolving than women 's rights in America . She would be incorrect in the long-term as racism was far , far more entrenched than any other prejudice . However , in the short-term , she was right America was more concerned - superficially - with the equality of blacks . <p> Consider this post by Ta-Nehisi Coates , whom I consider one of the worst , if not the worst , political/social commentators in America . <p> As usual , he sides with a white woman over a black man , taking the peculiar position that if Douglass still spoke of Stanton highly after she laid out her racism , it must be cool . <p> Once again , a rich white women versus a black man right after the Civil War ? Please , liberals , let 's talk about power differences . Do n't give me this shit about once racism is abolished by the 13th Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their white counterparts . What choice did Douglass have ? Alienate a very prominent white female supporter ? <p> For all their power analyses , liberals like Coates ignore it when it means their heroes are either hedging their bets for the future or are outright charlatans . I give Douglass the benefit of the doubt and I assume he was calculating his political bets and decided it was best to not ditch Stanton . Stanton , as I previously argued , was just a rank narcissist that only cared about herself - so white women were all that mattered to her . <p> Is n't it a little weird to talk about entitled feminism in 184 ? .

I 'm no expert , and my information might not be 100% accurate , but this was a much more complicated situation than you are considering . <p> Germany was kind of forced into World War 2 . They sort of honorably ended World War 1 without actually being defeated , and then got absolutely taken advantage of by the conditions created by the Treaty of Versailles . They had huge amounts of land taken from them and were put into a reparations/debt situation that was absolutely oppressive and impossible to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basically everyone on the European continent was in fear of a successful Germany . All did their best to keep Germany down . Let 's not forget that the Jewish people , who at that time and still do , control the banking/financial industry , and were also the creators and pushers of communism , were internationally trying to oppress Germany long before World War 2 ever began . And Germany was very welcoming to the Jewish people and the Jewish people lived extremely well and equal in German society . This is an impressive fact considering the Jewish people had been driven out of nearly every land they 've settled in . Throughout history , this has been what has happened to them . So , when this war began , just as America feared the Japanese and had to act defensively for security reasons ( by putting them in camps etc ) , Germany also feared the Jewish people and contained those in camps for security reasons . Germany also began encouraging them to leave directly prior to the war beginning etc . And do n't paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . I am just trying to tell a more informative and fairer side of this issue . But , I do n't believe in this " Germany was hell bent on killing every Jewish person on the planet " nonsense . <p> Getting back to the topic , there was all kinds of violence on the Polish border or former Germany territory that had ethnic Germans living there . The Polish were backed by everyone and encouraged to bait Germany into confronting this violence . <p> Germany was then declared war on by nearly everyone . I do n't believe Germany wanted a war , especially with England , who the Germans tried very hard to negotiate with ( but were met with refusal ) . <p> The Germans then began their operations , in my mind , as more of an offensive to maintain a proper defense . <p> The Germans also knew that Stalin and the Russians were preparing for an invasion of Europe , specifically an attack on Germany . The Russian 's motivations were to conquer territory and spread their communism etc . And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would soon be impossible for the Germans to defeat . Therefore the Germans decided to go on the offensive to prevent a Russian conquering of Europe etc . <p> I do n't really think the Germans had any other options . <p> Now of course , the Germans felt screwed by what happened after World War 1 and wanted their territories back . And it 's understandable . If someone came and stole all your shit and oppressed you , you would have an interest in getting it back . <p> Where Germany screwed up was with their stubbornness . This fighting to the last man crap and trying to hold onto battlefield gains at all costs despite the extreme tactical risks , was one thing that was senseless and did them in . <p> But I read a very interesting book and I ca n't remember the title , but it was about all the ways Germany lost the war or could have won the war . It was very interesting . Actually fascinating that despite all the opposition against them and few resources there were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had Germany of won the war , I think everything would have been fine . I do n't think we 'd all be speaking German or that Europe would be destroyed etc . There would n't have been a Cold War and I think that the relationships with the old colonial powers would have been productive and peaceful . I think the third Reich would not have collapsed . It would have been economically successful and the German people would have been content . <p> I do n't think there 'd be everlasting war . War takes its toll and in the end , and I believe Germany just wanted their land back and wanted to be free of the oppression from their neighbors . There may have been some additional land taken etc but nothing too crazy . <p> Remember , the winners write the history . And there 's a lot of propaganda and negative BS told about the losers , who in this case were the Germans . I 've studied both sides of this fascinating period of history , and have come to believe that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , and everyone else , is extremely one sided and basically untruthful in most instances . <p> But going back to the main topic , the Eastern front was brutal . Urban warfare especially is the worst of the worst . Fighting where civilian populations live , fighting house to house , snipers , booby traps , horrible logistics etc ....... urban warfare is hell . As as someone who has experience fighting in urban environments , I know exactly what this is about . Germany should have avoided these battles and went straight for Moscow instead of getting too confident and making decisions to conquer cities purely for the symbolic and psychological benefits of a victory , like the impact of conquering STALINgrad would have had . <p> Germany simply got too confident and some of the higher ups in the Reich , like Hitler , took some battles and strategies too personally . <p> But thanks to the original poster for the content provided . I 'm definitely going to check it out . <p> RE : " Ghosts of the Ostfront " - an incredible perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it better . Germany gets all the blame . Russians were the real bastards . Imagine the scenario that Russians had attacked first and Germany had n't a strong army to fight them . <p> The west have always allowed Russians to do what they want . Without German support my country would have become a USSR republic . Both in 1918,1939 and 1944 . <p> Scandinavia turned their back on us , same as Britain and France and USA . The only availble help was Germany . Fucking bastards . But even Germany let Stalin do what he wanted with us in 1939 . Britain and USA even declared war on us later . Lol . <p> Like Churchill said in 1945 after defeating Germany . " It looks like we 've butchered the wrong pig " <p> RE : " Ghosts of the Ostfront " - an incredible perspective on WWII 's Eastern Front <p> To get back on the original topic - by far most of the fighting and dying was on the Eastern Front . It was a War of Annihilation . <p> That said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US . <p> Without American trucks , railroad-tracks , locomotives , boots and spam the Russians would 've had a much tougher time of it . Major Soviet offensives would n't be able to carry out the Soviet tactic of deep penetration , and their advance would 've been far slower . <p> On the other hand , the Western Allies believed they had to give all this stuff to Stalin to keep those 150 German divisions in the East . Stalin was interested in a cease-fire with Hitler all the way to early/mid-1943 , but by then he 'd realized Roosevelt was a gullible fool and the Western Allies were prepared to sacrifice Eastern and Central Europe to defeat Hitler - an odd calculation given the original reason for going to war . 
@@96059271 @259271/ <p> Hey , so I have been in Poland for a month now and here is my initial assessment for anyone who wants to come to get the Polish girl experience . <p> Basically , I used Roosh 's book " Bang Poland " as my travel guide and from what I seen , I do concur with most of what he describes . So some of this may be redundant . <p> 1 . Feminine - Many Polish girls are indeed very soft , sweet and easy to talk to . You 'll instantly see that they 're friendly , flirtatious and would even giggle when you tease them . They 're a lot more down-to-earth than girls in western countries and like to dress sexy and cute . <p> 2 . Love foreigners - I 'm Asian and often got many looks from the ladies everywhere I went . And when I did approaches , they were often happy to engaged me in conversation , sometimes invited me to have a drink or to walk with them . They 're always curious to know where I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Latin countries like Spain , Italy , Portugal and Greece get top billing because the girls romanticize those cultures as warm and romantic . One Polish guy even told me that if the girls find out you 're from one of those countries , they 'll instantly get wet . <p> However , Germans and Russians do n't get much love at all . Part of it is history and just overexposure and influence from those places , which has been mostly negative . <p> 3 . Tension with Polish guys - Some of the girls told me about a kind of rift between the girls and the local guys . Mostly has to do with the girls not wanting to date them because many lack sophistication and class . The popular look is to dress like Eminem and thug out as much as possible . But oddly , some of the girls like it though . <p> 4 . Clubs are actual meet markets - This is the cool part . Going clubbing is almost always fun because many girls go with the mindset that they 'll meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few places I been where I did n't feel like I was interrupting a gathering of close-knit social circles . Each night I went out , I end up chatting up , dancing and having drinks with at least 2-3 prospects . Do n't fret if it starts to feel hopeless , partying goes on until the morning so you 'll get your opportunities . <p> 5 . No one-night stand culture - SNLs do happen , but they are rare . They 're more than willing to fool around and do some heavy making out , but they 'll stop just short of going full slut , often retreating back to their friends or making excuses like they have to work in the morning etc . <p> 6 . Cockblocking - As expected there will be some cockblocking . Mostly from protective friends or other guys . The Polish guys are kind of weird in that they 'll get wasted drunk and literally hurl themselves at girls even while you 're in the middle of talking or dancing . This can be easily remedied if you turn your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less rowdy area . It 's the girl 's friends that you really have to worry about as they tend to be really committed to ensuring that everyone leaves together . <p> That said , if you 're interested in someone , it 's rare that her friends are going to completely hate on you . All the girls know that they 're there to perhaps meet a guy . So they typically wo n't stand in the way of you conversating , sharing drinks or dancing . They 'll just wait until you are both done making out and fetch her when it 's time to go . <p> How to score points with Polish girls : <p> 1 . They 'll all say that Polish girls are the most beautiful girls in the world . Do the smart thing and agree with them . In fact , they love it when you praise them and make fun of how the German girls are so ugly . <p> 2 . Talk glowingly about the USA . They are all familiar with the phrase " The American Dream " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . For many , it 's their dream to go there . These are your selling points . Talk them up . <p> 3 . Make fun of Polish guys . This is a semi-risky approach since some girls might think there 's nothing wrong with the local dudes . But you can say you heard " Polish guys like to wear socks with their sandals . " When you make the jokes , just say you heard other people say that . <p> 4 . Talk about traveling - One good way to screen for girls who are out for foreign guys is to ask whether they like to travel . If they do , you 'll see right away them bubbling over with enthusiasm and a deep yearning to see more of the world . Poland is a relatively poor country , so it 's not very easy for them to spend much time abroad as much as they want to . <p> 5 . Dancing - A lot of the girls are really into dancing . Like they 'll dance all night . And so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In particular the girls love to be spun around and grind on the dance floor . The better you are , the more your prospects will improve . <p> I hear so much different stuff about Poland. , . its unbelievable .. some say is the easiest place in europe to get laid , some say they are really religious .. i do n't  know what to believe , i think i just need to fly there . <p> I hear so much different stuff about Poland. , . its unbelievable .. some say is the easiest place in europe to get laid , some say they are really religious .. i do n't  know what to believe , i think i just need to fly there . <p> It can happen and I saw my roommate pull a couple SNLs . But they were 5s and 6s at best . Pulling a hottie for a one night is n't going to be easy . It 's possible , but you 'll need a lot of things going in your favor , especially her being very drunk . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to partying , its totally irrelevant . If it does n't happen the first night , sex should be assured within 2-3 dates . <p> I hear so much different stuff about Poland. , . its unbelievable .. some say is the easiest place in europe to get laid , some say they are really religious .. i do n't  know what to believe , i think i just need to fly there . <p> That 's what I hear as well . I still plan to check it out for myself someday . <p> I hear so much different stuff about Poland. , . its unbelievable .. some say is the easiest place in europe to get laid , some say they are really religious .. i do n't  know what to believe , i think i just need to fly there . <p> Individual variance should n't deter you from the general consensus , which trends almost universally positive . <p> I have described the ' ' German girls are ugly line . ' ' But to tell them the polish girls are the most beautiful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not instantly get wet when you say you are from Greece.They just give you a chance.The advantage that we Balkans have is that we mix easily in the local environment and the polish guys take us often as fellow Slavs so resistance is minimal.The other is that we are in firm control of the situation because Spanish fall into the macho trap , ( too much boistness for nothing ) , Italians can appear as rather superficial ( very fashion conscious and no substance ) and Arabs lack the bulk to actually control the free movement of polish girls . So in a polish women environment the Balkans get inevitably the most attention ( I mean we generally draw attention of everyone because of firm attitude , control etc ) . The problem is the general craziness ( especially in case of Serbs ) and some mental instability ( we get too enraged easily ) that can rip from us the benefits . <p> For example if I go to a club with polish girls and there are western guys , American guys , Arabs , Asians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no position to exercise control.If there are Serbs , Greeks , Albanians , Croats I sweat.I have to double check first . <p> ( 07-20-2012 12:48 AM ) Greek kamaki Wrote : I have described the ' ' German girls are ugly line .

Depends on how you approach the mixed set - if you talk only to the girls kind of trying to avoid the guys - yes they will cockblock you , but when you say hi to everyone , and start for example talking about vodka with the guys they will be mostly friendly and there 's even a chance they will introduce you to the others . <p> About the Mediterranean guys - they are not really a competition to polish guys with game and looks ( on the other hand there is not that many of them unfortunately ) pretty much because they are mostly half of our size , they got luck that polish girls are so petite <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw when I crossed the border from Germany to Poland.In Germany every woman was so fat and masculine they had such a Brunhilde appearance with deep voices and no feminine figure I was completely unintrested in the female species.And then I come to Poland and I see all these hot looking polish girls around I mean how is it possible ?

I 'm sure Roosh would concur . Here 's an excerpt of a facebook chat I had with a Polish girl : <p> Me : i see that young people party here every day Magda : yeah , most of them do n't have any other entertainment actually especially women - desperates Magda : dressing like .... wanting nothing but ... Me : really ? Magda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some spanish/italian guys . this is really pathetic <p> It is not so simple.If a Greek guy , an Italian and a Spaniard happen to be in the same polish club who do you think is going to get the hottest girls ? It is not only matter of preferences.I tell you that the Greek guy will outbeat them all although the polish girls will say they would prefer the Spaniard . Also if the Serbs happen to be there noone of the polish guys is going to challenge them due to their intimidating physique.So they have an easy task.The Spaniard will get scared the Serb will not get scared.The polish guys would scare the shit out of everyone if there were not the EU which makes them afraid of expulsion. ( they are afraid not only in host countries but in Poland as well ) . There are many issues which come into play not just who the girls find more attractive.You can see the dynamics in Greek resort clubs with polish girls where the punches fall like rain sometimes . <p> ( 07-20-2012 04:43 AM ) polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you told us about .

The girl is top ( the best looking girl in club ) 2 . They know her and 3 . It is clear to them she likes you and they take it for granted you will extract her . Only if these prerequisites are there the polish guys intervene with the two methods I decribed before . <p> Keep in mind that polish girls have romantic views of foreign nationalities ( the English gentleman , the Latin dancer , the French gigolo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some terms.Now the stereotypes after meeting with them tend to transform to the drunk English , the horny Latino , the snobbish French , the crook Greek etc but these changes in beliefs take time . <p> ( 07-20-2012 12:35 PM ) Greek kamaki Wrote : Keep in mind that polish girls have romantic views of foreign nationalities ( the English gentleman , the Latin dancer , the French gigolo etc ) .

If she 's into you , she 'll call which is great - I 've found girls very rarely call , but if they do , it definitely makes them stand out . <p> Then I ask something about the date I 've planned , eg do you prefer coffee or dessert ? ( because you 're deciding whether to go to a cafe or a dessert place for your date ) . <p> From a pragmatic point of view , if your phone keeps a message history , you should n't need to confirm . If a girl does n't prioritise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not very important to her . <p> Ask the average girl how many dates she goes on , most I know never get asked out , so when a man asks a girl out on a date in this day and age , it SHOULD be a big deal for her .

I imagine most girls will see your number and freak out and just not pick up . <p> I totally agree , I gave up on calling years ago because I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on without talking to a woman on the phone at all . <p> It 's weird , girls will bitch about " why do n't guys ever call anymore , texting is sooo impersonal " and then they wo n't pick because they 're too nervous to have an actual personal conversation with someone where they have to respond on the spot and ca n't ask their girlfriends " what does this mean , how should I respond ? " <p> Texting and social media appear to validate the conflict aversion and poor social skills of modern young women by depersonalizing interactions to the furthest possible degree . <p> Another reason to confirm is not only with first dates ... but girls you 've been seeing who have a history of flakiness . <p> For example , this particular girl .... I had a date lined up 5 days in advance and texted her " was it 7 or 7.30 to meet ? " the day before . <p> She texted back " we did n't say specifics and I promised my sister I 'd .... blah blah " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame text her back " And you 're not even offering alternate days .... " to which she responded " I was going to offer Tuesday " <p> So ... I 'll probably confirm the Tues appointment now because she 's got this history of flakiness ..... something like the former poster said " I 'm running late fyi. " or something . <p> Girls who have demonstrated punctuality and courtesy probably do n't need confirm texts . Only first dates , if you so choose and dates with girls you 've been seeing who have been on and off flaky . Also .... probably if the date was set 4 or more days in advance . <p> One planet orbiting a star . Billions of stars in the galaxy . Billions of galaxies in the universe . Approach . <p> ' are we still on for today ? ' In my opinion has a bit of a validation seeking and desperate vibe to it . It 's as if your hoping she comes through because you really value your time with her above other things you could have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're communicating . Also , it 's as if you 're confirming her interest in you , by looking to be extra sure she is going to come through . <p> ' hey let 's meet 30 minutes later i 'm running a bit late ' is immediately a difference . You 're not seeking to confirm that she is going to come through ( although that 's essentially what you are doing ) . This does still have a potential for a no response though even though she could come through but in most cases she should reply . <p> The best confirmation text in my opinion is ' let 's meet at xyz , near xyz ' a few hours before the date . This is of course based on her having agreed to a time the previous day when you texted her . If you agreed to meet at 7 at night the next day , send her that text around 1-3 pm the day of and leave it at that . If there 's any hint of a flake it will come up in her reply otherwise you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text of any sort . <p> Sometimes you can also instill a bit of dread in her , wondering if you are going to flake . If I 'm only mildly interested in a girl ( she 's cute but ehh , happens a lot ) I 'll be lazy with the plans . I 'll set the time the night before and location , and confirm with her that night ( ' see you then ' ) . But I wo n't text her during the day . In all of my cases that I 've tried this they end up texting an hour or so before to confirm with you , so that they do n't get stood up . Change the frame , do n't worry about her not showing up , make her worry about you . <p> If she did not send a confirmation text , I would simply not show up , with my excuse if she called me out on it being ' shit i forgot ' . But I have n't had to do that yet , in the few times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yeah this is what I do . I always initially set the date for 30 minutes before I actually want to meet , then a few hours before I 'll text something like " i 'm running late , can we do 830 instead ? " ( assuming I originally set the time for 8PM . ) If she does n't reply I assume the flake and wo n't even show up , but she 'll almost always reply and agree . <p> The only exception is that I 'll sometimes text " are we still good for tomorrow ? " the night before if I set the date really far in advance ( usually 5 days or more ) . I do n't think it comes across as desperation in that instance , in my mind it 's perfectly appropriate to confirm a meeting with someone you have n't contacted in several days .

@@96059276 @259276/ <p> Contrary to popular belief , the fat acceptance has been around in the United States for some time , first being birthed in the 1960 's , when many , many discrete groups began to organize around identity politics . The movement is a strong mix of narcissism and female-centrism . <h> A Brief History Of The Movement <p> Consider a brief history of the movement . Like I have previously said , the first documented fat acceptance acceptance event happened in New York City in 1967 . The participants dubbed it a " fat-in " at a restaurant and consumed many , many pints of ice cream . Later that same summer , the first nation-wide movement , which eventually become the National Association For The Advancement Of Fat People ( NAAFA ) . This time period is generally referred to first-wave fat acceptance . <p> For a brief period of time , moving lockstep with other identity political groups , a militant arm of the movement coalesced into the " Fat Underground , " a radical feminist-allied movement whose rallying cry was , " a diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease that does n't  exist . " The movement never gained much steam as they called for violence against perceived fatphobia . <p> Accordingly , as Americans waistlines expanded , the movement gained ground . This time period has been called second-wave fat acceptance , as Americans needed explanations for their decreasing physical attractiveness &amp; increasingly poor health . Mainstream outlets began to run some sympathetic literature , mostly just viciously attacking the medical establishment &amp; perceived fatphobia of the media at large . <p> Fat acceptance is currently thought to be the in third wave , which coincides with the birth of the Internet &amp; blogging . Tumblr , online feminist webzines &amp; WordPress have been credited with advancing the cause . <h> A Review Of Their Claims <p> Let 's review some of their more insistent claims . First , and foremost , is the concept that dieting &amp; exercise do n't  work . Given the- multiplicity of posts on Return Of Kings abouthealth and fitness , I will not talk about the veracity of the claim , just about the psychology presented . The claim that exercise &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begs for- a reason why they cling to it . Part of this is the inability to accept responsibility for their weight gain remember early fat acceptance warriors worked with radical feminists . These sorts of groups portended the nascent narcissism that would come to pervade identity politics in general , but markedly show off the sheer and utter inability of its adherents from truly changing their reality . <p> Consider that there are also people who are underweight . Fat acceptance types fold anorexia and related issues into their dogmatic and self-serving approach to weight issues , but they- think that the underweight suffer from psychological issues . It is a delicate road to hoe , because they cant just say that vastly underweight people are completely healthy , like they would claim a person 300 pounds overweight to be . Of course , its those poor , poor underweight folk that have psychological issues . Of course it is related to- impossible beauty standards forced onto women by the heterosexist patriarchy . Notice , though , that fat acceptance claims the over- and under- weight suffer from psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjust their weight . You know , to become healthy again . <p> They are not seeking to decouple weight and health issues but to destroy the concept of being overweight . They want people to either considered healthy or underweight . It shows off neatly the psychology : it is all about them . <p> Take this study- that is often bandied about in fat circles about the failure of dieting . A top comment on the article gets it right : <p> Why are n't  we looking at those who successfully lose the weight and keep it off for 2 or more years ? <p> Of course , we should be looking for the success stories and understanding why they succeeded in the wake of others failing . What the commenter does n't  understand is narcissism . <p> Take game-denialists . They desperately need stories of failure of so-called game adherents to fuel their psychology . They do n't  want to hear stories of men pulling themselves up-by-their-bootstraps , they want to hear about some guy tripping over himself tying his boots while he relied on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe ? A man who claims X , Y or Z is a fraud or a man that- has- achieved success and relates this personal stories , approaches and what his failures taught him ? <p> That is the simple psychology of fat acceptance-activists and their denial of the science of dieting . Remember , if you are reading it , it is for you . Unable to bear hearing about successful dieting approaches , personal stories about weight loss or just seeing the photos of the so-called " weight privileged , " they demand media conform to their perceptions of their value . - So- people cant keep the weight off for long periods of time ? Sounds like a personal problem to me , not the diets problem . On the rare off chance it is a biological disorder , you will find that out from your doctor . <p> Babies are born- being able to select physically attractive faces from those that are not . This damning evidence for the fat-acceptance movement , as fat faces are rarely considered attractive because fat is unattractive and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strong jaw becomes an unhealthy man with a weak chin when he is fat . <p> Another serious issue is the insistence that fat people , as a discrete class , need to be consulted on public health policy that affects fat people . This is a curious claim , as it tries to democratize what is , essentially , a dogmatic movement based on narcissism . Any fat person who deviates from the dogma is not included in the movement . - You think the spokesman for Subway " Jared " is a fat acceptance hero ? <p> Most importantly , here , is the notion that being a member of a class somehow confers a level of perception that non-members can not access . This is classic narcissistic armor and it is wholly untrue . This approach is most used to defend feminist claims of male privilege , it is also used to defend claims of racism and homophobia . Being a member of a discrete class does little beyond signify you belong to said class . Like anything else in life , what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great insights to provide , you may not . In your thoughts and ideas people will judge you for you have to offer . <p> Which feeds into the next point , is the fear of being judged that fat acceptance-activists wish to counter . Instead of encouraging positive traits in fat people ( that are n't  related to you looking in the mirror and declaring yourself awesome ) , the main thrust is to change wider society so that they never have to confront their own issues . This never works for anybody . At the end of the day , you always have to close your eyes with no psychology to consider but your own . <p> Finally , a point is made that all humans deserve bodily autonomy . They consider decisions on being fat as relating to personal autonomy . That is a terrible approach , as it brings in the age-old liberal adage , " your autonomy ends where my feelings begin . " If you get fat , you will get medical issues and not just affect the appropriation of my tax dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a woman I married , but you are either too fat to be interesting or dead .

You are n't  fat and fierce , you are a pathetically privileged plus-sized person . <p> The serious issue with " your autonomy ends where my feelings begin " approach is that there is rarely an action one can take that does not affect somebody else . I am not sure there are any actions of consequence that be undertaken that will not affect at least one person . Exercising autonomy often implicates limiting others options to pretend otherwise is ludicrous . <h> Conclusion <p> Fat acceptance has a long history in the United States , but only recently exploded as left-wing friendly platforms such as Tumblr and Reddit began to become popular . <p> The claims made reek of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late-capitalist society could possibly be able to complain about their poor choices in diet and exercise need to be validated by authority figures in the media . Not only that , but they are not seeking simply acceptance , but worship .

@@96059277 @259277/ <p> Since there 's a lot of threads of the big classical cities i want to give you something different but still amazing . <p> We 'll start off with a little mini-fact section about the country <p> It 's a little country with a population of 650 000 ( increases to about 2 million during the summer ) . The country is located between Croatia , Serbia BiH and Albania and as you might of guessed , yes it was a part of Yugoslavia . The country claimed its Independence in the year 2006 and has been evolving like crazy since then . I 've never seen a country develop as much as Montenegro ( well except Dubai , UAE ) it 's crazy ! <p> Citites and Places <p> I 'll start off with Budva because i believe this might be the best city in Montenegro to apply your game on . You could prefer the others if the description fits you , so everything is to his each own , like everything else in this world .. <p> Budva <p> Budva is a coastal city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women here are exceptional , 7 to 10s are the easiest women to spot , i sincerely believe it 's hard to spot a women below a 7 . The women are often blonde , tall and large breasted of Slavic origin . The BWH ( bust , waist and hips measurement ) averages the same as the Polish , according to my experiences . The tourism is mainly from Serbia and the eastern block ( mostly Russia ) so there is a lot of potential in the girls that visit . Usually the Russian girls are even easier than the locals , but they do cost a little bit more , want more cocktails , wants you to dress expensively etc . It 's known for long that the Russian girls that visit Montenegro are on their " Sex-vacation " , i find that pretty good <p> The locals are crazy over tourists ( and money , of course ) , the girl might think you 're a local but the second they find out that you 're a tourist , THEY attack ! I believe this is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the " small-town " feeling in the country during off-season , " everybody knows everything about everyone " applies here very well . Therefore when she sees a tourist , her panties wet up immediately since there is no risk of anyone ever finding out . <p> I stayed in this town , the summer of 2011 for 10 days and my game was pretty impressive , 7/10 days i scored . You will definitely love the town , the atmosphere the structure i mean everything i beautiful , as well as the nature and the women . <p> Wow , just wow . This got titled recently as one of the best open air clubs in the world ! With amazing DJs and women in MASSES ! The music is often pumpin ' house and the girls get crazy ! Check this place out before everything else ! Laid Score : 5/6 Nights <p> Sparta <p> As Trocadero , Sparta is on of the local hot spots with enormous talent , plays also balkan music but switches to party music often . Laid Score : 1/2 Nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the best in Montenegro . Recently the city received a World Heritage mark from UNESCO which says the most . If you want to visit a city because of it 's beauty I recommend Kotor but if you want to apply your game , choose Budva . <p> THIS BEING THE EXCEPTION : Club Maximus <p> This club is banging , it 's the largest club in the Balkan and it 's boomin ' , you will love the DJs ( well who would n't when the worlds best visit ? ) and the girls are everywhere , GOOD LUCK trying to find more men than women in this club ! So visit this club only over night , but stay in Budva ! <p> So if you want to visit Maximus , just take a cab from Budva , it might cost you 25G and it 's only a 15-20 minute drive . <p> Porto Montenegro , Tivat <p> Rich playboys with tens and tens of blonde skimpy models running around everywhere , this is Porto Montenegro , do n't forgot the yachts of your dreams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the New York Times Porto Montenegro will in a couple of years become the new Monaco and i can second that . First of all the place is magnificent , the atmosphere is wonderful but it 's expensive , really expensive . It 's the second largest luxury-yacht marina in the world , Monaco being first . <p> My experience <p> I stayed here for 5 days , there are no hotels yet so I stayed in my fathers friends apartment which he bought for around 1,000,000G , so it was a really exclusive apartment but it 's NOT the most expensive , far from it actually . The women are phenomenal and have a nice attitude but a little bit up-tight like in any other High-end area . I did not have a Yacht so that is a huge minus when you are in " Porto " because the women only see one thing , money . My stats here 0/5 days , i did make out with one model but that 's it . <p> This place is beautiful and really cheap to dock your yacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Monaco BUT if you do n't have that huge amount of cash your game will not work here , at least it did n't for me . Maybe in a couple of years i will be able to return to Porto Montenegro and kill it ! But at this time in my life , i 'm just not that rich , yet ! <p> If you have any questions , feel free to ask anything and please rate my thread but please be gentle , it 's my first haha <p> ( 04-01-2012 02:44 AM ) Soma Wrote : Sounds like you had a ratherthan Richie .

When the locals are in a group you have to isolate her from her group ( the game 101 ) , it 's not hard but it takes finesse . Tip : Let her notice you , approach , talk for a while , then get her out of the group by going to the bar and ordering just the two of you , tell her that you 're buying , then you 're in . <p> When it comes to the money , i did maybe buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ russian/ukanian/etc. tourist is a tad more expensive but much , much more easier , as i said Montenegro is their " sex-vacation " . <p> I like to dress well with a nice watch to it , maybe that did help me i do not know but , my day game at the beach without clothes worked pretty well too . <p> As for the greek/spanish looking type ( as myself ) is the best , no doubt .

@@96059278 @259278/ <p> I realize that there is already a wealth of information about Miami on this forum . I am quite sure , however , that nobody has divided Miami women into separate categories , so here goes . <p> Category 1 : Women who are from other countries , but live in Miami <p> The City of Miami has the highest percentage of immigrants of any North American city . It is therefore no suprise that Miami is full of Category 1 's . Category 1 's can be found on both sides of the bridge . When I say " the bridge " I am referring to the bridge which connects Miami Beach to the rest of Miami-Dade County . Many of the Category 1 's who live on the beach side are Argentine or Brasilian . Of all the time I have spent in Miami , I can not recall meeting an Argentine Category 1 on the west side of the bridge . Most of the Brasilian Category 1 's I have met on the west side of the bridge I have met in a bar/restaurant/nightclub known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the bridge , not too far from the area known as Little Buenos Aires . I have heard that there is another Boteco on Espanola Way in South Beach . I have never been there , but I would appreciate any reports . The Boteco on the west side of the bridge is good for meeting Brasilian Category 1 's on Tuesday nights . People always laugh when I mention Bongo 's in downtown Miami , but I really believe it is a good venue , especially on Saturday nights . Saturday nights tend to draw the Category 1 's , while Friday nights have more women from other Categories . There is a nice outdoor section which has a spacious dance floor ( weather permitting ) . I have actually found that bitch shields are lower in the outside section . Club Tipico Dominicano in Northwest Miami is good for meeting Dominican Category 1 's and some Category 1 's of other nationalities . You should definately try the mofongo con tostones when you are in that place . Sunday is for some strange reason the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have the nicest decor and it is not in a section of Miami which could easily be mistaken for Coral Gables or Coconut Grove , but it is the best place to meet Dominican Category 1 's . Women from other categories predominate the beach itself . I have met some bitchy Colombian Category 1 's on the Beach itself along with some less bitchy Colombians and Category 1 's from other countries . They are definitely a mixed bag . La Covacha has been mentioned elsewhere on this forum but is always a good bet on Sunday nights . It basically stays open until the last person leaves , which has been me on more than one occasion . This is prime Category 1 territory . I stopped by on a Wednesday on my way to the airport and numberclosed a Category 1 who was one of the hottest girls I ever met . She eventually flaked on me on a subsequent trip to Miami , but those things happen . They happen every day if you are doing what you are supposed to . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to numberclose . I actually think I have a complete set of the cell numbers of the female employees there . The numbers are usless to me when I am not in Miami . Brickell has its share of Category 1 's along with many women of the other Categories . Brickell venues are Lolita , Baru Urbano , Blue Martini , and Segafredo . Segafredo can be good for Venezuelan Category 1 's . Baru Urbano was supposedly the setting of the original Was This Beta ? fiasco . I do n't want to talk about people behind their backs , so I will leave any and all credibility issues alone . If you are going to Miami cold , I do not recommend making Category 1 's a priority . Not living in Miami puts you at a great disadvantage with them . They are also the most flakly women I have ever met in my live . It does n't even matter that I have strong family ties to the Miami area . Going to Miami with the sole purpose of trying to get Category 1 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unwise . Although they should not be ignored in their entirety , the women of other categories are better options for those visiting Miami . For guys who live in Miami , things are slightly different . Notice I said slightly . <p> Category 2 : Women who are from another county who live in a United States city other than Miami and are visiting Miami <p> These are always a solid choice . They are from a variety of countries , but Mexico seems to dominate in my experience . This makes perfect sense as Mexicans are the largest immigrant group in the United States . They have a vacation mentality and the fact that you do n't live in Miami does not seem to matter . Some people believe that not living in Miami actually helps you with Category 2 's . The beach itself is very good for Category 2 's . I used to avoid Mangos like the plague . I now realize that it it one of the best venues , if not the best venue to find Category 2 's . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday nights , but they are a scant minority there . Other than that , I never meet any on the west side of the bridge . The beach itself , Mango 's , and maybe in some cases the Clevelender are your best bets for Category 2 's . <p> Category 3 's : Women from other countries , who live in other countries and are visiting Miami <p> These are also very good choices . The come from every country imaginable . The beach itself is full of them and many of them are topless . Being able to approach topless women without looking like a pervert is a skill which every guy should master . A great deal of information regarding that skill has already been posted . Greek Kamaki may be able to provide further assistance as I believe he has a great deal of experience in that department . Other than the beach itself , restaurants and clubs in South Beach are where you will meet Category 3 's . If you have an extemely strong desire to get an Italian , Argentine , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best , or only , shot . The downside of this women is that many of them go to Miami for very short periods of time , two , three , or four days . That makes absolutely no sense to me . More often than not , when I meet them they are either on their way to the airport or say that they are leaving for the airport . Other than the sometimes short stays , there is really no downside to Category 3 's and they should be at or near the top of your list if you are visiting Miami . <p> Category 4 : Women who are from the United States , live in a city in the United States other than Miami and are visiting Miami <p> There are plenty of these in Miami . They tend to stay on Miami Beach . I have only met one Category 4 on the west side of the bridge . They tend to be from all over the United States and often have inflated egos for some reason which is beyond my compehension . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey , or New York City , in that order . I basically throw the rest back . Luckily a fair share , if not most , of the Category 4 's I have met in Miami have been from California , New Jersey , or New York City . Again the beach itself is good for Category 4 's as are South Beach clubs . At least stop by the bar at hotel W. I met a nice Category 4 from California there last Labor Day weekend . It does n't take a genius to figure out that if a white girl or black girl is at a South Beach nightspot by herself she is a prostitute and should be completely avoided . Unfortunately , prostitutes find their way into every analysis of mine . I do n't know if making Category 4 's a priority is a great idea , but they should definitely be sought out . There are plenty of them . <p> Category 5 : Women from Miami who live in Miami <p> These are mostly Hispanic women of Cuban descent . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found pretty much anywhere west of the bridge and sometimes on the beach itself . Bongo 's on Friday has plenty of them as does Blue Martini on Friday . The problem with Category 5 's is similar to the problem with Category 1 's in that not living in Miami is a DLV . They can also be extremely flaky . They should not be avoided , but should not be made a priority . <p> Category 6 : Women from places in the United States other than Miami who live in Miami <p> They are similar to Category 5 's and the two are often difficult to tell apart . Many Category 6s are also Hispanic and I have met some of both Cuban and Colombian descent . They have the same hangups as Category 1 's and Category 5 's do regarding guys who do not live in Miami . The one benifit to seeking out Category 6 's is that many of them are from North Jersey or New York City and have the sluttiness factor often associated with women from that region . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . <p> Rationalizethis recently posted a very impressive and detailed data sheet on the Brickell area of Miami .

Women traveling , rarely travel alone . And it 's very difficult to get a girl to leave her friend when they are traveling together . They usually also stay in the same room in hotels so going back to their place is also an issue . Without a wing man to take care of her friends gaming tourist of any kind is problematic . You best bet to just to meet up and hope she get drunks enough and find you hot enough to just go for it . I knew this dude that ran a tight game on Ft . Lauderdale beach . He would simply pull girls out of the clubs and take them to the beach to smoke pot and bang . <p> ( 05-12-2013 11:00 PM ) thegmanifesto Wrote : Merenguero , this is an incredible breakdown . <p> I think you kind of missed one category that I shall add : <p> Category 7 : Girls from Broward County coming down for the night <p> These girls will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Midtown , Wynwood or Design . <p> These girls will be relatively easy to impress with a little local knowledge and door juice/ venue choice juice . <p> The trick will be that these girls are often with at least on friend or in a group . This group may also contain guys . <p> With these girls , you are going to have to Game the whole group or her friend to get them to roll back to your crib . <p> Many times , these girls will also want to roll back to Broward at the end of the night , so screen hard for logistics/ who is driving etc . <p> Digits can be had for later conversion as well as these girls like to come to South Beach . <p> Good point . " Category 7 " as you call it , seems to be more rare than the other categories , but they do exist and can be a good option . What I did in the past with a girl from that category is meet her on a later night in downtown Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there . There were obvious problems with logistics when I did that . <p> Category 8 , which is extremely rare , but exists , is girls who live in Naples who go to Miami for the night . I met a complete knockout model from this category , got her number , and met up with her on a subsequent trip to Miami . <p> Merenguero , the " Boteco " on Espanol is actually called Boteco Copacabana . It 's just a restaurant and has no ties to Boteco on 71st . It 's just a family owned Brazilian joint . You 'll see groups of Brazilians there , sometimes some hotties , and many times they have hot Brazilian girls working there , but it 's not the most hoppin ' place . The food used to be great , but I personally think it went down hill the last couple times I went . My picanha was always burned and the beans and rice were n't even good . Another Brazilian restaurant I 'd suggest is Little Brazil , right around 71st st. in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stroganoff was excellent . <p> I also hear great things about Bongos , though I never checked it out when I lived there , but I hear you find a lot of hot genuine latina girls . <p> I used to work at a couple hotels down there so I can give a breakdown of where you 'll see the most tourists from outside of the USA . <p> -HUGE amount of Canadian girls flock to South Beach during the winter . Outside of Americans they are the #1 by far . <p> -The next biggest group you 'll probably see are Brazilians , but unfortunately it 's mostly older Brazilians or families . When you rarely do get a fine , single , younger Brazilian girl , it will be hard to get her out as she 'll be on a family vacation . <p> -After that you 'll meet lots of British and Ausies . Many of them will be young girls and a lot of them will also be slutty/dtf . My first black girl was a British tourist in Miami . <p> -Next I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing with Brazilians . <p> - After Mexico comes the Scandinavian countries and the German speaking countries . I 'm biased on the girls here , because personally I think they 're ugly , but many seem to disagree . But I really do think the ones you find in South Beach are definitely bottom or at best middle of the barrel when compared to how they are in their home countries <p> - You 'll see a lot of French . Here and there they will be cute young ones . <p> - After French you 'll meet people from all over Latin America . Probably the most will be Argentine and then Colombian . Again , pretty much the same deal with Mexican and Brazilian tourists . It 's pretty tough to meet single girls who are n't on vaca with family . <p> After these groups it 's pretty spread out all over the board . The middle eastern women are almost always with men . Not a whole lot of Asian tourists . Africa is also pretty rare . Spain is quite common , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ( 05-12-2013 11:09 PM ) Merenguero Wrote : Category 8 , which is extremely rare , but exists , is girls who live in Naples who go to Miami for the night .

@@96059284 @259284/ <p> The Office , for those who have been living under a rock this past decade , is an American TV show that was originally created in Britain . The American version differs from the original , but I have only seen a handful of the British episodes , so I will not comment on that and that is also beyond the scope of this writeup . <p> The Office , itself , opens itself to much interpretation . The Ribbon Farm has an absolute must-read of posts analyzing power relations in the modern workplace through the lens of the The Office . However , for my purposes here , I wish to talk about Michael Scott , as he is a perfect example of a narcissist - a person who feels no guilt , only shame . <p> Michael Scott , for the first eight seasons , the regional manager of a mid-size paper distributing company . He clearly had a traumatic childhood . While such narcissism is always born out of a childhood not lived , consider a few points that reinforce my perception . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His younger self said his dream was to have 100 kids so nobody can say no to being his friend . He seems to think that childhood is necessarily limited by the parent 's wishes , which is not healthy . Further , he is admitting he is n't not getting the positive emotional reassurances at home . Second , consider the taped footage of his mother 's marriage to Jeff . In the clip , when bringing something down the aisle , he screams , " I HATE YOU " and storms off . He is wetting his pants the entire time . Clearly , this situation reminded of very traumatic experiences that can only be speculated on . Still , if I was to hazard a guess , his original father was an abuser and he saw his mother was betraying him for marrying another one of those people with penises . <p> Back on point , Michael Scott displays a great level of delusion about who he is and the appropriate behavior to display in society . He never displays genuine sympathy or empathy , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show off to others . He has extremely low self-esteem and has he delusions punctured very easily and slips in narcissistic depression with frightening regularity . He also possesses the ability to turn women into compensatory narcissists and transform himself in a pseudo-codependent while still having a eerie sense of straight-up narcissism . The fact the whole show is supposedly a documentary reinforces the narcissism of the workplace and Michael Scott . <p> Before considering some examples of how guilt and shame , consider the differences of guilt and shame . Guilt , properly felt , is a feeling about things you have actually done ( to others ) . Shame , however , is a feeling about who you are , your identity . For example , let 's say a man forgets to pick a friend up from work and it forces them to be late to a date with an attractive woman . The guilt-based person would apologize to the person and feel bad because he hurt a friend . A shame-based person would think " I am such a bad person ! " and need public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they harmed . The guilt-based person would try to own up to their misdeeds and try to rectify the situation with good acts - i.e. buy his friend a case of beer he loves or personally call the woman and convince that is was his fault , not his friends , that she was stood up . The shame-based person will seek avenues to avoid personal culpability - downplaying the bad act ( she was probably a bitch ) , blaming them ( you know how unreliable I am ! ) or ignoring the situation ( dodging his calls or texts ) . <p> Guilt-based people are healthy . People should want to atone for their bad acts with commensurate good acts . Shame-based people are immature psychologically . While every personality disorder has shame-based impulses , narcissism is the one that expressly discloses any ability to feel guilt , only shame . You want to know which you are ? Do something bad in private that nobody knows about . If you have no feelings , you a narcissist who only experiences shame . If you feel something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches are born out of childhood approaches to criticism or lack of boundaries . Kids subject to intense , withering criticism as a child develop a complex that they are either 100% good or 100% . Recall that every child is a narcissist , which is why we tend to put the gloves when critiquing a child because we implicitly recognize they take criticism 100% personally as an attack on their identity as a whole . Also , kids who are never disciplined develop the same complexes . Kids who are unschooled , receive " participation ribbons " or who are born to parents who let them do whatever they want never mature beyond the emotional level of a child . Children need boundaries set by those who love them unconditionally and are intimately based out of that child 's best interest and personality . <p> Reconsidering Michael Scott , he displays this greatly . Recall the season 3 episode in which Michael and Dwight travel to the paper convention with Jim and his new boss . At the end , when Michael 's party fails and he broods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael was jealous of Jim 's rapport with his new boss . Notice at the end when he calms down , he refers to Jim as " Best Friends Forever . " See the black and white approaches to relationships ? Jim realizes he is dealing with an emotional child , so he treats him as such . <p> In fact , the rest of the office - outside Dwight - recognize this . While his antics are outrageous and often offensive , you ca n't really treat him badly because you realize he is , at this heart , an emotional child . When Michael hosts the Dundies in season 2 , he is heckled by a group of people ( hecklers are narcissists , too ) . He feels a great amount of shame as they puncture his personal concept of being a comedic genius . He does n't really need anybody to validate that , as long as he can perform , he will invent approval in his head . <p> In that same episode , as the Ribbon Farm posts have identified , this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becomes a sociopath ( I would call it a narcissist with real accomplishments ) . He successfully reads and manipulates Michael early in the episode and prevents him from hurting Pam emotionally about her failed relationship ( engagement ) with Roy . Jim does this by telling Michael that his long-running joke about " longest engagement " is lazy comedy . He spurs Michael to do something different because Jim punctured his self-identity as as comedic genius . <p> Let 's consider a few more scenes that flesh out the contours of shame-based behavior . Michael once makes an incredibly dismissive and flippant remark about Dwight crying on New Year 's Eve when it started to snow at midnight while watching one of Dwight 's favorite movies . In private , Michael exhibits a complete lack of feelings about somebody . I ca n't recall the exact scene , but I believe Jim says that pretty insensitive to mock Dwight for that . Michael backtracks and calls Dwight 's movie " stupid . " See the shame-based approach here ? Michael feels nothing with no audience to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he downplays his rejection of Dwight . <p> Now , making fun of Dwight is one thing , but a guilt-based person would feel a bit bad that a friend had such a sad emotional reaction to something . Sure , if Dwight was my friend I would razz him about it , but if he 's your friend , you care about his emotional state . Rudely ignoring him is not what a good person does . <p> Quite possibly the best episode to talk about is season 3 's opener , " Gay Witch Hunt . " In this episode , Michael jokingly refers to Oscar as " faggy . " Toby confront Michael and tells him Oscar was offended because he is gay . Michael is asked to keep this a secret as Oscar does not want his coworkers to know . A guilt-based person knows that they would feel bad if they disrespected Oscar 's wishes , would apologize to them in private and move on . If Michael had done that , Oscar would have respected Michael . That is not what happens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a self-aggrandizing way and only in semi-private . Oscar accepts Michael 's insincere apology only because he is worried about being outed . Michael does n't stop because he knows homosexuality can bring get attention into somebody 's life . He has Dwight research gay porn on his computer and it results in a very psychologically unhealthy and embarrassing , for Oscar , office meeting . <p> As is seen , most people do n't give a shit . I would n't be surprised some homosexual were upset at this ( if they notice ) because it means most people , today , just do n't care who you have sex with . Pam is interested in hearing about Oscar 's sexuality , but at the moment his biggest problem is Michael . Michael formerly outs Oscar , narcissistically thinking Oscar will love the attention , whether positive or negative . See the project here ? If Michael was gay , he would prefer worship for being gay , but would accept hatred if it means avoiding indifference . <p> Oscar comes out and in the intervening events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive and small . " Michael immediately engages in the shame-based defense mechanism of narcissistic depression . Oscar realizes that Michael no malicious intentions , just self-absorbed ones . He engages in a guilt-based acts right afterward . Oscar softens his tone , proffers a genuine apology and offers Michael to make up . Michael then tries to self-aggrandize with kissing Oscar but he realizes that does n't work for him , for obvious reasons . <p> I really should have posted this way back in May or June when I was doing my first posts on narcissism and codependency . However , the takeaway lesson is that guilt-based approaches are mature and shame-based ones are not . Guilt-based people do n't consider failures to speak to their entire identity , while shame-based people do . Shame-based people are children emotionally and that results from poor parenting of many stripes . Guilt-based people are worried about the effect of their actions on others , shame-based people are worried about their identity , especially as seen by others . <p> Old Chinese Man Wrote : why you wonder how many man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr high school drama man <p> Dr. Kahn Wrote : i on the other hand will be banging hotter chicks and still be DOCTOR KHAN . <p> First off , thanks for the write up . I 've found that the office has many different sociological concepts well highlighted in this show . <p> But I have a question for you since you spent a lot of time on narcissists , what do you do about them ? You cant avoid them since they make up much of America , especially women . So the issue would be to get someone from a narcissistic behaviour set to a less narcissistic one . <p> I 've talked with psychologists and they 've told me the hardest people to treat are narcissists since they cant admit they have a problem . As you mention , to admit a problem means they would feel 100% bad about themselves . And since they ca n't acknowledge they have a problem , they can never really work on fixing it . <p> I feel something powerfully externally would have to cripple their self-identity and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider there is someone wrong . But even then , most cases , narcissists will just double down on their psychological defenses . Hence , hamster rationalization of their poor decisions . <p> It seems to me the best strategy to deal with narcissists is preventing people from becoming ones in the first place since once they start using this set of psychological defenses , it 's pretty impenetrable to change . <p> PS : as a fellow dyslexic , I sometimes print my stuff out to insure that i do n't have too many typos but do i understand that means it takes a crap load more time . 
@@96059285 @259285/ <p> This is a multi-part series reviewing the book " The Culture Of Narcisism " by Christopher Lasch . Subsequent posts will become more in-depth as I move farther along in the book and my analysis is either changed by his argument or I will argue against his assertions . And , yes , the book is that dense the chapters need to be broken up . <p> Please keep in mind this book was published in the 1970 's . Very important point because he is n't talking about generation X or Y. You might be able to argue he was talking about the earliest people of the generation X , but his focus is on generations leading up to the 60 's . He focuses in particular on people who were teenagers/20-something 's in the 60 's who hit their 30 's and early 40 's in the 70 's . <p> CHAPTER 1 : THE AWARENESS MOVEMENT &amp; THE SOCIAL INVASION OF SELF <p> Lasch opens with quote by Donald Barthelme : <p> Quote:The Marivaudian being , is , according to Poulet , a pastless futureless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which organize themselves into a line , but what is important is the instant , not the line . The Marivaudian being has in a sense no history . Nothing follows from what has gone before . He is constantly surprised . He can not predict his own reaction to events . He is constantly amazed being overtaken by events . A condition of breathlessness and dazzlement surrounds him . <p> Lasch opens with a discussion about the waning sense of historical time the present generation has . He notes the obsession with imminent doom coming to America , in the form of jack-booted Russian Communists , nuclear bomb , the coming Ice Age , etc . People either surround themselves with modern technology - a bomb shelter - or return to primitive roots to complete eschew modern technology - communes or right-wing survivalists . <p> The political upheaval of the 60 's has lead to the modern American to retreat to purely personal obsessions - psychic awareness , dancing , gluttony , jogging , " getting in touch with their feminine/masculine side . " This retreat from the levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by rage/anxiety/nothing ( emotionaless expression ) that political solutions do n't work - has devolved into the obsession with the self . Unattached to the parental generation and unconcerned with the coming or younger generation , the present generation has little concern for anything but superficial self-obsessions aimed at therapy . <p> Lasch makes a quick detour to explain how this approach is not religious , as some commentators have argued . He points to numerous historical religious movements that had all had levels of social consciousness , desire for fair justice and lessening of class boundaries - i.e. " spread the wealth around . " His point here is that most , if not all religions , were rooted in concern for others . His most salient point is about primitive Christianity , which was concerned with abolishment of private property , social justice and a pronounced sense of worry to leave society better off for future generation while honoring the toiling of the previous generations . <p> Lasch , then , moves into the concept of the theraputic sensibility . His overarching point is that people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fleeting and momentary illusion of personal well-being or contentment . <p> In the 60 's , the emerging generation used radical politics to fill the void in their emotional/psychological . Rage , anxiety and narcissistic valuation could all be ported out in the ideologically churning world of the 60 's . Many college students would describe the electric feeling of connectedness they would feel at political rallies , that they finally had a purpose and had value . They basked in the perceived brilliance of radical liberal leaders . However , a curious phenomenon that this leaders were routinely cast aside and devalued as their brilliance always disappointed . <p> He further argues that these sorts of politics was about establishing an identity , not subsuming their identity to a large value system . This is crucial , as it means the approaches taken here are not religious , but therapeutic . <p> He observes the earliest form of American narcissism was the Jeffersonian concept that the world exists for the living . The " imperial self " celebrated in nineteenth-century America portray a man feeling liberated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone , with the ability to decide their own destiny . Isolated from the world , a man could truly make his own way . The differences between these generations and the current one is very significant , but most relevant here is that men have ceded his technical skills to corporations and government , so he has no ability to provide for himself directly . Further , the family has lost its productive and reproductive functions , so even parents are not able to parent without the advice of " experts . " <p> This is the psychological dimension of narcissism , stray thoughts of omnipotence aside , that the narcissist depends on others to validate their narcissism - an admiring audience is always needed . The destruction of the family and the atomization of the individual does n't free the narcissist but increases his insecurity as he must either find ways to self-aggrandize and gain audiences or attach himself to greater narcissists who display the power , fame or grandiosity he dreams of . <p> The early American was repressed in many ways to ward off their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , this repression lead to industrialization and settling of the entire continent . This was a fragile and doomed approach . <p> The modern America is consumed by annihilating boredom . This is result from erecting defenses against feelings and desire . This boredom results in a deep and abiding rage that requires defenses to ward against that . The dense and bureaucratic has little ability to find outlets for that rage or those desires so they stay bottled up as well as a person can handle . <p> This delicate arrangement , coupled with increasing levels of bureaucratic red-tape create a situation in which competency is far outweighed by the need for social skills to navigate the waters . As such , it greatly weakens the patriarchal order of fathers , preachers and teachers as their power is greatly drained away in this order . That is precisely the family collapsed when it did along with the church - not because of feminism or atheism but because of the castrating social forces . <p> The devolution of this former " imperial self " is the transformation from egomaniacal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , infantile and utterly hollow . The former person is a person who can act out their egos , the latter is a person who can not . <p> The modern person , ridden with depression , discontentment and emptiness , seeks not transcendence or change , but peace of mind in a society that is increasingly militates against it . Individualism and religiosity of the past has devolved into sheer therapy aimed at shoring up the sense of self , instead of creating a stable sense of self . Since society has no future , therapy is purely aimed at immediate needs . It does n't occur to therapists that love is more than fulfillment of immediate emotional needs , but about subordinating needs and wants to others and to causes or social traditions outside themselves . <p> Since submission or love that extends beyond the self is intolerably oppressive and offensive and injurious to the fragile egos of the modern generation , the modern therapeutic is aimed at liberating people from social and traditional constraints and then focusing on gratifying every personal desire or impulse . <p> BRIEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduces or implies many concepts or points Lasch eventually fleshes out in later chapters . However , there is still quite a bit to take away from here . <p> First , is the relationship between obsessive disorders and narcissism . While both have roots in America 's original psychological profile , understand that in order to deal with their anti-social impulses , often ported out as rage , was suppressed by religion and patriarchy , that lead to a collective sense of OCPD . The approaches to alcohol , sex and violence were all results of this disorder . <p> Freud 's research on psychology found many people with hand-washing compulsions , men and women with sex-based obsessions . Of course , the cracks were beginning to show in America 's psychology . Urbanization , men leaving the home for work and the emerging power of corporations and governments threatened and toppled this order . <p> The shining example Lasch utilizes is the 60 's . Some commentators have pretended the 60 's were about free love , acceptance and all that jazz . It was n't . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OCPD &amp; levels of narcissism to a far more pure form of narcissism . <p> The isolation of the individual coupled with a steady feed of media-approved messages and soul-crushing work has lead to a deadened life for Americans . <p> For example , the cries about " sending women back to the kitchen " is n't fears about misogyny , wife-beating or limiting women 's autonomy ( as women 's autonomy has already been eliminated ) but about the fear of change . Women have a very precarious sense of self that is ready to crack at the slightest provocation . Suggesting women might be happier in relationships and having children is a supreme violation of their sense of self . Finally , all that bottled up rage has a socially-approved outlet and the hatred and anger is beyond overwhelming . Since they place great therapeutic on working , suggesting that women might not be happiest doing that is offensive . <p> Old Chinese Man Wrote : why you wonder how many man another man bang ? why you care who bang who mr high school drama man <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be banging hotter chicks and still be DOCTOR KHAN . <p> It is obvious that " How I Feel About The Thing " is n't necessarily the same thing as " How That Thing Actually Is " - but this is only obvious if you 're not a narcissist .

But Alex Honnold and David Allfrey are n't most people : They are two of the best speed climbers alive today . So it 's no surprise that when David and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven days , they did more than simply complete the climbs " they smoked them ! <p> New Jersey Turnpike ( 12 hours 24 minutes " new speed record ) <p> Tangerine Trip- ( 9:28 " new speed record ) <p> Eagle 's Way- ( 7:56 " new speed record ) <p> Nose- ( 5:16 ) <p> Lurking Fear- ( 5:05 ) <p> Zodiac- ( 5:05 ) <p> Triple Direct ( 5:15 " new speed record ) <p> I am not suggesting that anyone runs out and becomes a mountaineer , much less free soloing with no safety rope each to his own . What I am doing is showing you one mans determination and drive under the most extraordinary circumstances . <p> When Alex starts up a 2000-foot face , there is no turning back whatsoever . It is literally impossible to go down unless he slips and is in free fall . Random risks such as bird or ants nests can take his life and still up he goes ; preparing himself mentally for his ascent , that might take several hours . <p> Essentially what Alex shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doing something in its most pure form , purely for the sake of doing it , perfecting it and being absolutely in the moment , while testing the skill ( and mind control ) against a back drop of certain death . This is a challenge that most men have never taken on . <p> So the next time you are having some difficulty and feeling frustrated with something or someone , just imagine what its like halfway up a 3000-foot- rock face with only your fingers to rely onand re-focus yourself . <p> The pea brain will probably have all kinds of ideas about extreme sports being lame replacements for real masculine pursuits or run some mindless debate , to try to excuse its own lack of focus , discipline , and drive . The fact remains that YOU and the other 6,999,999,998 people on Earth CAN NOT DO THIS , in large part because they lack the mental skill . <p> I find nothing in the least inspirational about him . He is a suicidal fool who risks throwing away his life at any moment for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " must feel that everyday life , as it unfolds , is " empty " and " meaningless " and has nothing to offer , and that such extremes of experience must be sought to gain anything of value . That is a dull ingrate 's idea based on a misunderstanding of life and of what is best and deepest about it . <p> Well , a lot of extreme sports/activities are basically just ways to force yourself into living the present moment , when you feel most alive . But you can become dependent on the method and there are other ways to achieve this . <p> A man who loves life and is in league with it can feel " most alive " when deliberating between de Cecco fusilli and de Cecco penne rigate , and ultimately settling on both , in the grocery store pasta aisle . <p> But the way to enter into such a life is through a lifetime of thought and feeling and interest in the world as it is . It is a delusion to think that climbing the face of some rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a shortcut to a greater love and understanding of life . What it can be a shortcut to is a premature and pointless death . <p> And of course there is a difference between your average " extreme " sport and the kind of necessary death from one wrong move idiocy that this loser engages in . <p> ( 04-03-2015 12:10 PM ) The Lizard of Oz Wrote : -&gt; A man who loves life and is in league with it can feel " most alive " when deliberating between de Cecco fusilli and de Cecco penne rigate , and ultimately settling on both , in the grocery store pasta aisle . <p> But the way to enter into such a life is through a lifetime of thought and feeling and interest in the world as it is .

Only thing that scares me about this guy is the possibility of pussy fucking him up ! Part of me wants him to get his fame , but my other part wants him to stay away because he seems to not be ready for the women that will flock to him if he blows up <p> Captain Gh , there is nothing wrong with a passion for climbing but he deliberately does it in a way that endangers his life at every moment with one false move . No real climbers do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from psychological compulsions that have nothing to do with a true quest for achievement and excellence . <p> And any soldier will tell you that the last guy you want to have next to you in a battle is someone so stupid and reckless that he places zero value on his own life .

It 's just like the White Ribbon campaign . She 's talking about how men need to change their attitudes and how people must call out " sexism " when they see it . <p> How about women do n't destroy their marriages and drive their husbands so insane they are willing to kill and be killed ? The murder itself was obviously triggered ( to use a SJW term ) by Rosie 's decision to deny her ex husband access to their son . The murder , while abhorrent , can be understood in this context . She was using the law to deny him his son , so he used violence to thwart her . If he could n't have his son , nobody would . In any case if the husband was mentally i 'll is n't he a victim too ? <p> Of course no media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count em ) eight ! of her kids in Queensland just a few months ago . No national soul-searching about the causes of female violence against children .

The five different men who fathered her children were not given the Rosie Batty treatment by our media . LONG ... <p> But what exactly is Rosie Batty using her new celebrity to campaign for ? Murder has always been illegal . Violence is already illegal . It 's clear , she is being used by the feminist establishment as a poster girl to push their anti-male narrative of emasculating , humiliating and removing authority and power from men .

Mind you , the sort of media that she would 've done the rounds on tend to be of the more populist , Right-leaning variety . She was splashed all over today 's Herald Sun ( which I avoid on principle ) . She 's barely rated a mention on the largely Left-leaning broadsheets ( which tend to be a bit on the high-brow side ) . <p> It 's interesting , on that note , how the media right wing in Australia has been a convenient vehicle for the feminist agenda . The former has a tradition for sticking up for the little man ( in this case the little woman ) in its wooing of the great unwashed . Child victims of crime -- especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentiments of the " broad church " as a result . Note the tabloid fascination with crime -- in keeping with Orwell 's postulation that crime , sport and astrology are the staple digests of the proles -- playing on the generally conservative heartstrings that support toughness on crime . From here , it 's easy to see how feminism can subvert this into a father-blaming mentality . I think that Anglo culture , deep down , oozes white-knight-ism : such concepts as " the fairer sex " and " white ladies " are quaint medieval holdovers in a society that is Puritan at its core . Note that while codes of chivalry existed in Continental Europe and Asia , there is n't for the most part such a pedestalisation of women . Observe the photos : for all of Tony Abbott 's supposed misogyny , he 's all too happy to jump on the Rosie Battie bandwagon -- as with his endorsement of other fem causes such as White and Pink Ribbon Days . <p> Great article , but I do n't believe the father was mentally i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great stress , perhaps .

Now imagine a lawyer who posts photos in yachts , in golf fields , expensive cars and tailor-made suits . When you add a girl on FB and she is hit by such an image , it 's impossible not to be impressed . You start the game 1-0 ahead .

@@96059295 @259295/ <p> WIA- For most of men , our time being masters of our own fate , kings in our own castles is short . Even those of us in the game will eventually succumb to ease of servitude rather than deal with the malaise of solitude <p> That said , I 'm ( somewhat ) critical of this essay . I do n't think there 's necessarily a fundamental transformation afoot in how power tends to be concentrated . Greene is right that there are more people involved in powerful inner circles now than there were before , but there is also a much larger human population than there used to be . If you actually look at the PERCENTAGE of people who have power at the top , the Western world is definitely becoming more top-down and top heavy . The powerful are just somewhat more ' scattered ' than they used to be . For example , Greene cites the breakdown of the record industry 's prestige , as evidence of power becoming more horizontal than it used to be . But are there actually less people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at the top just moved from record companies to Youtube ? I think the basic music industry dynamic of a few rich artists and promoters at the top and a ton of broke artists at the bottom , is truer now than ever . <p> I also think that a lot of the 20th century 's supposed horizontality was derived from the reality of a strong middle class and a lot of open free trade . As these start to break down , we can expect more concentration of power . 
@@96059300 @259300/ <p> What 's up members of the fourm , as you can see from the subject line I am wondering which of these 2 cities have a higher cost of living . Things like rent , transportation , food , going out etc .. <p> I plan to live a fairly modest lifestyle while I am over there . Maybe go out once or twice a week , Pay no more than $400 USD for rent , eat the local food , either rent a motorbike ( does any one know how much this would cost in both cities ? ) or use the cheapest form of transportation . <p> The reason I am asking this is that I have been offered a job to teach English in both of these cities and I do n't know which one to pick . I have visited both cities before but I do n't really know the true cost of living since I never actually lived in these cities . I will list some details below about the jobs <p> Bangkok , but it all depends on what standard of living you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apt with cockroaches all over , or 4k . There is much more selection in Bangkok . Food etc can all be whatever price you 're willing to pay . 25 cents for a meat stick on the street , or fine dining for $100 <p> You can live in either at any price you want , I would choose based on what interests you . I would n't live in Phnom Penh long term . Much better options for entertainment , drinking , and ladies in Bangkok . <p> You can do fine on $850 per month in Bangkok living how you described . You can find a decent , clean , no frills apt starting at $350/month or so . Food can be as little as a few dollars per day if you want . I would skip the motorbike . <p> Food ca n't be as low as a few dollars per day in BKK , unless you want to look like a malnourished African . Do n't go there thinking you are going to live on $3 per day for food . Try $10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a bullshit offer . $1,000 is usually the minimum for English jobs in BKK. $1,200 is what most English teachers sill make , and that 's ok to live on , but still not great . If you live like you say and do n't drink much it 'll be fine . <p> Agree with RioNomad that it would n't be ideal , my point was just that it 's " do-able " as long as you recognize what standard you 'll have to live . By " a few dollars " I 'm meaning under $10 , I should have been more specific . If you 're a jacked guy then you 'll need to eat more obviously . I ate 100% on the street , I could get by on $6-$7 per day for food just fine . <p> And yes , you should be getting paid more , especially if this is some sort of company that recruited you from overseas . <p> I have a completely different idea of what you can do BKK for than what I see other guys saying online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years in Cambodia , and I found hotel/apartments with pools that were damn decent for as little as 6000 Baht a month in Bangkok . They were n't on the BTS but they were very close to MRT . I think you would really struggle to find that in Phnom Penh , though a lot of other things in PP are cheaper ( food , for one ) . <p> In the end , I 'd say either is doable on this wage but will take some clever living , self-discipline , and a spirit of adventure for a Westerner - especially one who has just arrived . <p> All that being said , plenty new Westerners do live on that there . Not every one comes with the same living standards we have here on the forum . <p> But perhaps more importantly , I think asking which place is better at $850 a month is a case of asking the wrong question . Yes , it 's doable , especially if you start reading stuff like this and change some of your paradigms . I 'm all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . <p> But even then , there 's just no reason to accept a low salary like that when there are plenty of jobs out there that will pay more and still allow you to live in these locations . You can still live on less even , and then save money to invest or build a biz , making it more worthwhile to have that cut in pay . You could also look at it as a way to get one foot into the region while you look for something else . <p> At this stage of the game , the better questions you should be asking are : <p> That 's not entirely accurate . " Inexpensive restaurant " in Phnom Penh is more like $1 or $2 . Mid-range would be $3 . You could eat for $0.50 if you wanted to , and then they skipped the whole range of restaurants at $5 per person range . <p> There are quite a few more than three levels of eatery to look at in a place like this . <p> Then there 's this . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $11 . But that ignores all the meal you can have for a few bucks in the states . And comparing the two ignores that if you live in the states you 're probably not going to expect the luxury of eating out every single meal like many do in Southeast Asia . <p> These cost of living things are generally based on Western paradigms and very narrow spectrum of experience . You can trust them somewhat but they 're not 100% reliable - and definitely not 100% applicable to every situation and lifestyle . <p> Here 's another example . Did you notice they are claiming average apartment rent outside the Phnom Penh center is almost as much as the average after-tax salary ? That right there suggests something is off . We are talking about cities with millions of people , the majority of which live in poverty and swiftly growing middle classes . With many of the population paying from $15 - $50 a month for a place . <p> Of course , you 're never going to stay in a place like that ( lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that being the " starting point , " it 's only natural there 's a very very broad range of extremely livable places all the way up the spectrum . <p> I think many people move to these places with a subconscious attitude that they 're somehow above the rest of the population and therefore deserve to have the best of the best ( i.e. top location in the city ) in the area , even if they would never demand such a thing if evaluating a city back home . Then they wonder why they struggle to make local friends - with that mindset , is it any wonder ? <p> Yes , have standards for yourself , but also keep in mind that just because something is " local " does not make it inferior . Not to mention the hoardes of locals with growing discretionary income who I assure you are not paying what foreigners pay while still getting great comfort for the dollar ( hint : find out where the live ) . There is bargain living in any of these regions without sacrificing standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ( 08-15-2015 02:31 AM ) Beyond Borders Wrote : These cost of living things are generally based on Western paradigms and very narrow spectrum of experience . <p> This is exactly the issue with most cost of living guides- they are trying to give a like-for-like comparison , which is really useless unless you 're an executive at a multinational and want to reproduce what you have at home . It 's the reason places like Tokyo always are near the top of those charts , they are accounting for an apt the size of what we have in the U.S. , with the same amenities , when 90% Japanese do n't live like that . In reality it can be surprisingly affordable , if you live like the Japanese . <p> In another thread someone said they could n't see living in Bangkok for less than US$2500/month . To me that was madness , in my head I was thinking " what is the extra grand/$1500 for " ? <p> For me , the reason I have lived in Bangkok and similar places is to have decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a guy is going to spend $7 , $10 a per cocktail and have a rent of US$1200 living in Bangkok then what 's the point , that 's the same price as the West . <p> Yeah , I mean , if you can afford to live the high life here and get the $7 - $10 a cocktail , go ahead and do it I say . I have and those places can be fun to hang in . One of the biggest attractions to the region , in my opinion , is not " cheap living , " per se , but the luxury living you can get at a very decent rate comparably . <p> But even if you 're okay with paying a lot , how many other foreign faces live in your building may be indicative of whether you 're getting a fair deal or not ( though often they charge different tenants different rents , but it 's at least a start ) . Same with the nice restaurants you go to . <p> That said , the OP is obviously not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closer look and a more apples to apples comparison , and it helps to keep mind that people on a budget use their brain to make things work within their own limits . <p> Do you have any savings ? Bangkok is the better city but you wo n't get far with $850 unless you know the city super well . If you have savings then I would advise to go to Bangkok , more things to do , see and it will be more enjoyable . <p> If you do n't have savings than I would follow BB 's comments and find something better . <p> ( 08-15-2015 03:00 AM ) Beyond Borders Wrote : But even if you 're okay with paying a lot , how many other foreign faces live in your building may be indicative of whether you 're getting a fair deal or not ( though often they charge different tenants different rents , but it 's at least a start ) .

Not one white person in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably why I feel some of the low budgets mentioned here are perfectly adequate . <p> Some guys here on the forum only stay in serviced apartments in the farang heavy districts , those guys are correct about needing $2500+ . <p> Others , like myself , live mostly like local when it comes to housing and food . It was the same for me in Bogota , Buenos Aires and everywhere else I 've lived . I can spend plenty more , but I do n't . I 'd rather build up my early retirement stash . <p> It blows my mind sometimes how much people manage to separate themselves from the local lifestyle sometimes . I almost think it must take a certain amount of effort . <p> Example . The other day a friend was visiting me here in the North . He 's lived in Bangkok for years and is actually half-Thai but grew up in a Western country . Speaks Thai well now . Teaches English here . <p> We 're in a mall and walk into the food court , and it seriously blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people sitting around drinking beer . Blew his mind that they 'd have what was almost a bar scene in a public mall . <p> I honestly do n't get it ... I ca n't even guess how many times I 've sat around in Big C or similar places around the country drinking beer towers with beautiful girls in their beer dresses keeping the glass full ( all Thai clientele ) . It blows MY mind that someone who has lived here so long has honestly managed to avoid coming across this type of scene . <p> Now I 'm staying with a friend who lives about 20 minutes away from the very outer limits Chiang Mai , which is essentially a suburb with no separation from the city the way it 's laid out . Chiang Mai seems to stretch out forever if you get on a bike and explore ( it 's just full of greenspace and country roads but the domesticated area goes on and on ) . Here 's the point though . Guy says there are no places to eat where he lives so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of the city trying to find a place before we come . <p> I 've been here a few days now and surprise , surprise - there are probably about 10 restaurants on the small road out to his house alone . Very local spots . He has n't eaten at any of them . The main road is literally riddled with restaurants . Every time we go out to eat , he mentions that he does n't think anything is open at this hour ( whether it 's morning or night ) and that there 's really not any restaurants around . <p> It 's getting to the point where I just have him follow me and I go find a place . The food we 've been eating is some of the better food I 've had in Thailand - just as many Thais will tell you about the region . <p> It has become clearer and clearer to me lately that the greater portion of people living overseas are n't there to actually experience the local culture at all . They tell you local clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or that they ca n't order from menus that do n't have English . As if there wo n't be a learning curve to walking into a completely alien society and learning the ropes from the bottom up . <p> One of the interesting , and often unfortunate , things about world travel being so accessible to the masses is that it now means people who would normally never leave home are able to survive and thrive abroad without stepping too far beyond their comfort zone . <p> Really strikes a cord with me and takes me back . I 'm so grateful to have had the experiences in Thailand that I did . A girl would lead me through a maze of shacks , over creaking wooden bridges down tiny side streets and we 'd pop up in front of a tiny karaoke bar . Inside I 'd have the nights of my life drinking with people that have never been around farangs . I was fortunate to be shown these things from basically day one , then find others on my own . If you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never find anything . <p> Living removed from the skytrain meant I chose walk a lot , which led me to discover things I never would have otherwise .

CM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very reasonable prices if you stay away from Nimman and the Old City . <p> The organization will cover 40% up to $6K/yr of the rent if I move there . That said , my price range is the local price for an apt/house with a kitchen ; a studio is fine , but since my wife will probably relocate as well , a 20 or 25 m/2 box will probably be too small . Right now I pay 7K baht for a 45 m/2 extremely well built and very modern apt with Kitchen and maid service once a week in CM . Will not be surprised if it 's more in PP and that is ok , just curious because I have never been to PP , only Siem Reap . I definitely do n't fit into the ' fat expat ' paradigm and other than 6 months in Thonglor never stay in expat heavy areas . <p> Firstly , Cambodia 's whole local consumer economy is fucked . Expect to pay more money for Food and Bottled Water than in Bangkok . It 's an absolute headfuck considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Secondly , rent . In Bangkok , you can get a basic room for 3,500THB per month in most areas and down to 2,000 in the fringes .

However , I am not extremely familiar with PP . <p> Fourthly , $850 is skint anywhere on this planet mate . Hope you supplement yourself with savings because on that budget you 're living much like a lower class thai lives . Yes people make as little as 10K baht , but there a lot of unseen benefits such as accomodation , free food etc. as the job market in Bangkok is extremely competitive . <p> Oh , and I hope you have a lot of polyester beige/khaki shirts .

A top notch pizza is 13 dollars and a little ceasars is 5 or so this bitch can plow through 30 dollars in drinks an hour which does n't bother me but when she has to spend ? <p> I was bitching about the PR girls on one of my threads .

The ones who are fully educated with a 4-year degree from a state school in mainland or , went to a good school/University in San Juan , and holds a relatively " good " career as a paralegal , insurance manager or owns her own small business . <p> 2 . The ghetto girls of New York City , Chicago and other smaller cities on the East Coast . A lot of them have recently started migrating to smaller cities to get away from baby daddy issues back in New York/Chicago . <p> 3 . The Middle class Boricua girl who lives in cities like Orlando , Tampa , Atlanta and Dallas . <p> The ones who are going to bust your balls for being anglo-white are No. 2 and No. 3 , and from what I have learned it 's simply because they need to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> They already acquired the elusive US passport at birth , and hence , do not really even need to speak English to reap all the benefits you get as a US Citizen . They feel more connected with Black-Americans , than they do with White-Americans as they feel they are too oppressed as a race . Yes , a lot of these girls feel that they must get back at " whitie " for using their island as a land to test military weapons , or why their brother , cousin in the Army was killed in the line of duty in a white mans Army , or simply because white people discriminate against them despite them having FULL US Citizenship at birth . <p> It 's all bullshit you have to plow through because they are all fuck machines who love sex with insecurity issues . <p> I once taught a white guy a few basic salsa moves , and took him to a local Puerto Rican restaurant so he can learn the food culture of PR . I told him to mention that the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bitch shields will go down .... it worked wonders for him . <p> Always mention that your ex was a Puerto Rican girl , it sends a pre-approved by my race trigger to their brain .

@@96059304 @259304/ <p> I 'm sure there are more than a few guys that have &gt;10 years experience ( or somewhere close ) with weight/resistance training . Does n't have to be a consistent 10 years , more in general , I doubt even professionals are that consistent . <p> I 'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences . I 've done more than a few so far but I feel I 'm only recently starting to hit stride and efficiency . I would n't be surprised if others are on the same page . <p> Some questions : <p> 1 ) How does training change as you become more experienced ? Subjectively , in your experience . Age could play a role , but more specifically the factor of training for so many years . <p> 2 ) Did you find you could/can still make muscle gains , despite potential decreasing with time , by always working to improve your workouts and nutrition ? <p> There is not a better place on the web to my knowledge where I can find the best answers to these questions and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many sites telling you you can add 30 pounds of muscle a year which is obviously false . Also many claims for natural trainers by people who are on steroids ( nothing against it , but to claim you can achieve the result that is only possible with it without it is stupid ) . But how much can you realistically expect to add overtime , given experience ? Also considering that your workout efficiency improves as you learn what works and what does n't . What else have you noticed that improves/changes/needs attention overtime ? <p> I 'm at 12 years now , although I 've had 2-3 stretches where I took months off at a time . To answer your q 's : <p> 1 ) My training got smarter . I dropped exercises that were just injuring me or I felt were damaging me over time . That included barbell squats ( shock horror ) . Even with great form that I focused on for the start , they were simply not right for my frame . Back and hip issues and just generally straining so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also do n't believe spinal compression under a heavy load is a healthy thing . <p> I realised which exercises actually matter to me , for strength and aesthetics . I dropped benching and overhead pressing completely .. Now I only do three sets of pseudo-planche pushups per week , and my front delts are the biggest they 've been , and my chest still looks like I hit it regularly even though I do zero chest exercises . I work really hard on heavy rows , kettlebell swings , arms , and side-shoulders . <p> I also figured out some big wins : - kettlebell swings for conditioning and iron-hard glutes , and stamina " in the sack " - weighted chins and kettlebell bicep curls are IMO the best bicep exercises ( yep try the KB curls , the weight offset makes them really effective ... you ca n't " relax " at the top ) -Lying lateral shoulder raises . Add mass way better than standing laterals. -Paleo diet + 1-2 carb meals after workouts = optimal for body recomposition . Fast in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amp up the fat burning . -Removing sugar is the single biggest thing you can do to drop fat , without changing anything else . its not about calories , it 's how sugar affects hormones that affect fat storage and hunger . <p> Another " training smarter " thing I realised is that there are many , many ways to get strong . <p> Yes big compounds ( squats/deads/bench ) will do it . BUT they are not the only way . Ask a gymnast to test his bench max and he might well crank out 2x bodyweight on his first try without ever having lifted a weight in his life . <p> Olympic lifters can back squat huge amounts despite never doing back squats . etc . I find I can still crank out 12+ pullups with ease after not doing them for years , because my dumbbell rows have progressed so well . Many ways to skin a cat ... find what works for you . <p> 2 ) Pretty much yes , although it 's diminishing returns . <p> The biggest I got was about 50lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to some limit of gains there - was really getting hard to get bigger or stronger and I was eating huge , huge amounts all day every day . <p> To be honest , you 'll probably find that other things in life take priority for big chunks of time and you 'll spend alot of time on a plateau , or only making very small gains , and you 'll have some periods of backsliding , either because of illness , injury or other adverse events . It 's OK though , muscle memory ( wtf ever that actually is , but , the phenomenon is real ) means you can re-gain in a fraction of the time . <p> Overall though the incremental progress adds up - I 'm little bit stronger year on year . After 2-3 years of muscle gains , it 's not a problem to keep adding strength , but muscle size is harder to come by . <p> I 'd say try and get to your " ideal size " - the point where you 've added muscle , look good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to keep the size on . <p> There is always an area to make progress in . Improving strength on a lift , leaning out , getting high-level conditioning , improving your posture . Size is just one element that makes you look and feel great , there are several other worthwhile ones too . <p> I have been lifting weights 25 years , starting at 14 I had some periods over that course in time where I stopped but have been consistent over the last 12 years . I had two periods where I would classify myself as jacked , at 19 years old and at 33 . During these periods I was Not any happier . In fact , I got laid less and was more self conscious about my body . <p> I seemed to have plateaued but I am fine with it . I 'm not jacked but I have muscles and my body is in proportion <p> It took me a long time to figure out the right diet Another issue is genetics . Mine are n't great for building muscles so I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym has been such an important part of my life for a long time . I do n't understand why all men do n't lift weights . <p> I feel much more mentally engaged in my workouts than I used to . Helps that I do more heavy compound lifts and fewer endless bodybuilding-style sets ( or when I do , it is with a purpose ) . <p> A tip I think comes from Pavel Tsatsouline is taking your warmup sets as seriously as your heavy sets . Do n't zone out or go through the motions . Use the warmup sets to practice your form ; stay tight and push the weight hard , get a good contraction even though it is lighter . <p> Also good is avoiding mirrors unless there is something specific you want to watch about your form . Watching yourself distracts from what 's happening in your body . I set up for deadlifts perpendicular to the mirror instead of facing . At the most I take a quick glance to check my posture . <p> As Ryre mentions - I 've completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distracting now and will cover them up with a mat if I 'm at a gym and ca n't avoid having one in my eye line .

I would rather take a methodical approach to strength versus stroking ego , it is n't worth it over the long haul . I already have busted knees and a busted hand from years of football and having anything more would be a real set back to quality of life going forward which is important . <p> The number one thing I learned is the more mass you put on the more you need to eat which sounds great a first but almost becomes a sort of curse . <p> Because of that I realized where I was natural gifted in muscle ( legs , back , chest ) compared to where I am not ( arms , shoulders ) . I have prioritized and concentrated on resting up to PR for arm and shoulder workouts . I have found I do best with much rest . Maybe even a week to a week and a half between heavy lifting sessions . I did the 4x a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels from over training . <p> Other things take priority in life as the plateaus are harder to break and the eating gets to you . Flexibility , endurance , core etc ... become more important as you get older . <p> Everyone I know knows I eat a ton , and I eat fairly clean , it still usually is n't enough . As soon as you get over 200lbs and are at least somewhat lean it really becomes a chore . <p> I 'm starting to realize more than ever that lifting weights is a lifestyle for the long-term . <p> I 'm stopped doing maximal heavy sets and olympic weight lifting exercises because I have no intention or means to become a powerlifter or compete in any form . I do n't regret having trained in that way in the past , it has been rewarding to see what my body is capable of . But I 'm fortunate to know it is not sustainable .

The sprawling state machinery , although inefficient to run a nation , was able to allocate stupid amounts of time , money , and resources to backwater projects that would never get a green light in the west . <p> Back in the 50s the Soviets tried to tame and develop wolves into domestic animals they could use in the military . The wolf has a bite far stronger than any domestic dog , and also has far more accurate hearing and smellperfect for tracking . They are also extremely aggressive and hardy animals , able to go for days without food or sleep . They would , in theory , make great guard dogs . <p> Best of luck with that one , comrade .

Men do not need to get in touch with their emotions or seek out their feminine sideif anything that is a completely unnatural request .

The point is that they have a genetic programming and a need for more assertive or even aggressive behavior . It 's simply a matter of finding an outlet for that , because that very male trait is most important to the survival of the human race . <p> It does n't take four decades of Soviet experimentation to tell you that the drawback of breeding the foxes into domestic animals is that they can not survive well in the wild . Any dog that goes feral has a tough time , because they can not easily hunt , they lack an aggressive " animal " drive and want to cuddle up to some higher power than themselves . They are inherently beta . The same goes for females and " pretty boys .

A wolf is more likely to bite your hand off , whereas a domestic dog will beg for food , make funny noises , play cold or injured , or hold one paw out . They have way more advanced non0-threatening social skills ( as do women ) and they also offer companionship , guard dog duties , tracking , and hunting , which are their latent skills from being wild animals . The same thing applies to women who offer social skills , home making skills , and parenting abilities to comfort their man who does n't have the same priorities . <p> Looking at the wolf and fox experiments , it 's easy to understand the differences between male and female humans are far more than just characteristics and social programming we can gloss over .

@@96059308 @259308/ <p> The mystery of destiny remains one- which every man faces during his earthly existence . Life holds a spiritual meaning , apart from the sensual and material pleasures it provides man . The journey of our life keeps throwing challenges which raise questions as to what actually controls our lives . Sometimes life throws shit at us when we least expect it to happen . <p> We cant control everything in our lives , even if our control itself might be great to begin with . Sometimes , we have to make the best in what circumstances we find ourselves ineven if we may not want to be in those to begin with . <h> What controls destiny : predestination or free will ? <p> Man was destined to have free will . Hal Lee Luyah <p> Philosophers and great thinkers have always tried to unravel the secrets of human destiny since antiquity . Whether freedom or predestination controls human destiny is one of the most frequently asked questions among humanity " more so because of mans innate and great concern for freedom . <p> The questions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Are all our actions and fates really predestined ? <p> If every thing we do is predestined , then where does that put the concept of good and evil " when we do n't seem to have the power to change our intentions and actions ? Should we held accountable for our deeds and morality , then ? <p> The arguments for the existence of predestination often threaten the notion of human freedom in life , which itself seems distasteful for the rational mind . But at the same time , disregarding the presence of predestination in human destiny altogether also seems a flawed approach , if we take human history in regard . Free will thus seems to provide the way out . <p> Reading through the scriptures of most religions , one would indeed find a lot of prophecies , sometimes about the appearance of important men and events during various time periods . Now these prophecies would 've been fulfilled ( or may be fulfilled in the future ) but the fact remains as many of these prophecies have been fulfilled , life does seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind when one thinks about how some of these prophecies came true " sometimes across centuries . If mankind 's destiny was totally undecided and unknown " totally subject to free willthen how did these prophecies come true ? <p> The war between what influences destiny is a debate which remains baffling to humanity as ever . Arguments like the argument from free will and the dilemma of determinism are just a few examples of the numerous theories expounded to highlight the superiority of free will over predestination , or vice versa . Nevertheless , the logical approach seems to be adopting a middle ground between both , for both beliefs hold caveats . <h> A simple example to show how belief in either philosophy- pushed too far can muddle a man 's mindset <p> Both theories- will hold caveats , especially when pushed too far , for they can easily lead men into a blue pill world of illusionary thinking which holds nothing but disappointment in the end . There could be numerous examples to illustrate how both can affect mens lives . <p> Belief : " Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nature . Thus its better to be with a woman ( no matter how low-life- she might be ) , than to be without a woman at all . " <p> I 've heard a lot of men say this to justify their choice to sexually scavenge or choose sub standard women in their lives . This statement , reeking of defeatist fatalism , usually leads to the defeatist acceptance that women might not be able to control themselves at all , which might lead men to lower their expectations , standards and demands from women because women are supposedly predestined to fail men . <p> Indeed , women are not perfectand they have lowered their value even more by sub-standard behavior in todays feminist societies . But accepting that should not mean at the same time that men are disposable . Is a womans life , her needs and expectations , more valuable than a mans ? Definitely not . <p> But this defeatist " acceptance " stemming from a convoluted self interpretation of predestinationaffects a lot of men , not only when it comes to women , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be in their careers , friendships , or other relationships . Acceptance should in no way mean lowering your expectations or the bar for others in your life . Its important to be qualified in your life , but at the same time see that others also qualify themselves to be a part of your life . <p> At the same time , pushing the concept of free will too far can distort a mans thinking to push him into a blue pill world , without even him realizing it . Every a supposedly " rational " theory like that of free will could become limiting when it is practiced without moderation . One such example is below : <p> This is an example of free will driven thinking when pushed too far even though it might not appear at first . This belief basically exonerates every woman by assuming she would totally function to logic and proper use of her free- will , - basically ignoring the true nature of women . <p> The refusal to understand women with the known frailties of female nature usually ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will negatively , because sometimes we are socially programmed to believe that free will is more " rational " than predestination itself . Even if that might be logically true , can a leopard change its spots ? <p> Either ways , the end result seems to be that both free will and predestination can not single handedly provide answers for the questions of the human mind and the problems of human life . <h> Conclusion <p> As one penetrates deeper into the worlds of predestination and free will , one realizes that human destiny seems to be affected equally by both of them . Our deeds and thoughts are indeed indirectly influenced by them . <p> The solution remains to take the red pill to evaluate both theories critically , adopting an unbiased approach , But even if both might affect our destinies , it makes sense to maintain a mindset unaffected completely . Moderation in every aspect of life is praiseworthy ; and the same applies to the intellectual mindset how we utilize to unravel the mysteries of lifefor that is one of the hallmarks of self mastery .

It 's a shame we did n't get to see that . When it comes to villains , Kuvira was okay but Zaheer as the best followed by Amon prior to getting his masked removed . Azula and Zuko are still my favorite characters in the entire series though . <p> I have n't seen Korra , but I watched Avatar the Last Airbender and thought it was very good , other than the deus-ex-machina ending ( the writers got Aang and others into too much trouble against hopeless odds , and solved it by a gimmicky and stupid coincidence ) . <p> That said , I do n't recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it last year when I was already easily angered by SJW bullshit . <p> I do have one thing to say about Suyin and Kuvira .

She could have stabilized the Earth Kingdom and simply stepped down , I guess the creators had never heard of Cincinnatus . <p> Just decided to pick up the series after stopping for awhile . Just started season 3 . I remember why I hated the show in the first place , it was n't the SJW hues it had , it was the blatant pro globalization one world government message they had .

I was wondering if anyone could break down your average Polish girl from body type to personality . This might be in Bang Poland if so i 'll just buy the book . But hearing some of the forum member 's opinions are welcomed . <p> Psysical appearance : usually ranging from brunette to dark blonde hair , busty , kind of hour glass figure ( compared to other slavic women ) , average height , mix of slavic nose with more central european faces ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary to much , but they are hardly on the golddigger label opposed to many russian and ukranian women who care too much on status/wealth/money thing . <p> Body type:Generally tall ( average about 167 cm , 25% over 170 cm , 5% over 180 cm ) . Slavic long legs super shaped ( this is a trademark among Slavs the slavic legs are the sexiest ) . Nose slavic which means somewhat disproportionate to the rest of face ( this easily sets them apart from Germanic women who have smaller , more symmetric noses ) . Eyes light blue to green ( Green eyes shows the valleys of Eastern Europe ) . Hair light with color dirty blonde typically ( not so light like Scandinavian women ) . Boobs generally large with very good shape.Ass popping a little not so small like Germanic ass and much better than Russian ass.Most are fit and many of them follow vegetarian diets.There are some fatties around however lately due to recent explosion of Mc Donalds all over Poland . Teeth not in good condition but not as bad like in Ukraine ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs ) . Accent very feminine sweet with lots ofsexy sounds ( you just cum when hearing them ) . <p> Personality : 1 . Rather feminine like all slavic girls.A high tendency to submissiveness.They will cook for you , clean for you etc 2 . Always horny.They can not stay without dick for a long time.Sometimes they will go from you to another guy just because they can not stand a second without male company.For a polish woman having a boyfriend is utmost priority.They will compromise with everything as long as they can find a boyfriend.It is vital for them for a number of reasons . <p> 3 . Sex:The best BJ in Europe.Total tiger quality.They are very open minded and want to try everything ( gangbangs with several men or women.bondage even very hardcore bondage , dogging etc ) . I would say that I have tried with polish girls everything I have seen in porn movies even the most hardcore ones and when I say everything I mean everything . 4 . Openness:Very open to flirt even if they have boyfriend.They never say no to the advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ones.Very convenient when husband is abroad working . <p> 5 . Gold digging:A bit.50% of polish girls will ask you for financial help during some stage of the relationship or even very early.It is usually small money for every day needs.They do not ask for expensive presents.It is in your hand how to proceed . 6 . General behaviour:Very pleasant.They will admire you , praise you make you feel like the man.They are not so fluttering and men manipulating like Russian women who have upgraded this sport to an art.However polish women do know how to treat a man. ( they get vast experience by being exposed to several kinds of men ) . 7 . Virginity:Some of them(10%) stay virgin till marriage due to catholic upbringing.This can cause tricky situations.However it does not mean they keep all other orifices virgin ( maybe virgin nose remains ) . <p> 8 . Stability.Very unstable emotionally.Getting to different mental states very uickly from extreme joy to anger.They play lots of mental games usually by cheating you with other guys and judging reactions.However this is not the mental situation you will encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme.Czech girls or German girls are way more stable emotionally than polish women but this maybe percieved as coldness aloofness or indifference as well.Generally polish women react to the environment they are not phlegmatic like Germanic Scandinavians. 9 . Partying:Polish women like to party a lot.They like to drink and dance.They do not drink as much as Russian women but enough to go to the mood.They drink beer or vodka nor very expensive cocktails and drinks like Russian Ukrainian women.When they get a bit drunk they are very easy to have sex with . <p> 10 . Girlfriends.Polish women will introduce you all of their girlfriends very quickly.They do this deliberately to tempt you to fuck them and so manipulate you ( they play games with depth ) . If you stay with them long enough you are likely to fuck all of their girlfriends because they throw themselevs at you . 11 . Hospitality:Polish women are very hospitable.They will take you to their home , give you their bed to sleep , cook for you etc.They will not make you overspend if they judge you do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little money.Polish women ten to stick to you and want sex 24 hours a day.They will wrap their legs around yours as you sit with them watching TV on the sofa.This way they keep you always horny.This is part of a general plan ' ' find him-keep him-bang him sensesely-fall pregnant with him-marry him . 12 . Marriage:All polish women dream of getting married.They want to marry soon the guy they fall in love with.They are very easy to fall in love with.Within 6 months after you had sex with her pressure to marry her starts.If you do not prove yourself trustworthy to keep promises she will leave . <p> Common things you will hear from polish girls : How many girls have you slept with ? Do you like me ? You have beautiful penis.I like him very much . These are your children ( when you are ejaculating ) . <p> Other things:Inferiority complex.They believe they are unimportant , ugly , not attractive and not worth much.Maybe it is due to their upbringing.They want to escape from Poland which they regard a sad gloomy country.They dislike polish men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always complain.They say they are ill all the time.Every time a great misfortune happens to her.They like to make you participate in their lives full of complains.They want emotional and material support . <p> I have never heard/seen anything wrong about polish women 's teeth . What do you mean with " not so in good condition " ? <p> They have bad dental care and or genes which makes their teeth rotten very quickly.It is very common among slavic women.Thin hair , rotten teeth and asymmetric noise are their biggest drawbacks and what mainly aspires the germanic women lover who looks for perfection in these issues . <p> Common complains of polish girls about polish guys : 1 . Polish guys are very often drunk and treat women in low manner without respect 2 . They dress very shabby with no style 3 . Their haircuts are the cheapest because they do not want to spend money on a decent haircut 4 . They are stingy meaning even if they have money they are reluctant to spend it on girls and rather spend it on drinks or save it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to them in depreciating manner 6 . Many are village types with low education no degree and only fit for manual labour 7 . Polish guys drink so much that their sexual performance is negative they can not satisfy the increased demands of horny polish girls <p> Common complains of polish women about Greek guys : 1 . Greek guys are cheaters.They never stay faithful to one girl.They are not serious and predictable like polish guys.Greek guys like to hang around . 2 . Geek guys are sly and not straight as polish guys.They are not simple . 3 . Many Greek guys are gays.This is uncommon in Poland.Polish guys are way more masculine than Greek guys.There is no fear your boyfriend on Poland will separate from you for another man . 4 . Greek guys are spoiled by Greek girls who take their cheating behaviour for granted and do not complain.Greek girls represent a danger as they have bigger boobs , better looking hair and bigger asses than polish girls.Most polish girls feel insecure about the possibility to " tie " a Greek guy and make him marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ( tall , taking care of themselves , clam etc ) . Polish women do not believe that stand serious chances to get decent and committed boyfriends in Greece ) this is not the car with Abbas whose women look plain ugly so competition for polish girls in this situation is negligible ) . That is why a polish woman will trust much more an Arab than a Greek.Polish parents however always liked me and pressed their daughters towards me ( it matters to be white from first world in order to get accepted by plush parents ) . <p> How to spot a polish girl when you are abroad : 1 . First look at her ears.Does she wear earrings ? If not she is not polish ( all slavic girls wear earrings to enhance their sexy appearance and make an impression of availability ) . 2 . Second look at her heels.Does she wear high heels out very high heels ? ( over 10 cm ) . If yes , she is not polish.she is likely Russian if her face is slavic.Polish girls wear medium sized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly longer nose , fat lips , triangular or round chin , dirty blonde hair imply typical polish.She can be Ukrainian however with this look so you have to check further . <p> 4 . Look at her legs.If they are long and good shaped she is slavic.So you come at the point where you have established she is slavic by earrings , face , heels , face , hair and legs however you are not sure whether she is Czech , Russian , Ukrainian or polish since all these nationalities share the slavic look.So you have to rely on criteria in trends of fashion showing likely polish origin : 5 . Does she wear cheap skirt , cheap boots ? She is likely polish ( Russian women try to be dressed in more expensive clothes ) . 6 . Does she wear very tight pants ? She is likely polish.Polish women like to wear very tight pants to show of their as and curves.This gives then a cheap look however . <p> 7 . Does she show the lower part of her buttocks wearing shorts ? She can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 8 . Does she show the upper part of buttocks by low pants ? She is likely Russian.Russian women like to showtheir buttocks . 9 . Does she wear deep decoltes showing lots of breast ? She is likely polish.Polish women like to show their breast Russian women have relatively small breast and prefer not to show it . <p> 10 . Does she colour her hair black ? She its likely polish.Polish women like to colour their hair black even if they are blonde sometimes . 11 . Does she colour her hair red ? She is likely Czech polish and Russian women very seldom colour their hair red unless they are middle aged . 12 . Does she wear transparent clothes ? She is likely Russian.Russian women like to show their underwear under clothes . 13 . Does she wear golden chain ? She is likely Russian.the more gold she wears the more likely Russian she is.Russian and slavic women in general like gold . 14 . Is she blonde and tanned in the winter ? She is likely polish.polish women like solarium Russian women prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her mom ? She is likely Russian.Russian women use to do that . <p> 16 . Does her breath smell of vodka ? Russian . 17 . Is she giggling with her girlfriends all the time ? Polish . 18 . Is she sitting with long legs open showing her transparent underwear ? Czech.Czech women are a bit exhibitionists . Is she entering expensive shops ? Russian.Never not keen on shopping . <p> 20 . Is she accompanied by a guy 20 time worse looking than her ? ( shorter , uglier , fatter , bald , shabby ) . She can be polish , Russian or Czech.All slavic women can date very ordinary looking guys . 21 . Make up : From more to less : Russian ( almost plastered face to much make up ) , polish ( always make up but not to much ) , Czech ( more natural look less Barbie doll type ) . In trends of perfume the same.Russian women put too many and strong perfumes your senses get paralyzed by their approach . <p> Here in Greece you need Balkan power.You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and it is not easy.For example pavements which are very small and you can not approach comfortably , no benches , no parks where girls are sitting , no clubs for hook up because there are everywhere tables , people staring at you hostile when you talk to girls , roads are up and down , lots of heat , bartenders react when you annoy girls and shop owners sit outside their shops and scare you away from disturbing their potential clients.So you have to be really powerful so that all this does not matter you have to disregard and show your strength to shop owners , bartenders , random people , narcomans and beggars who will annoy you everytime you happen to speak to a girl . Then you come to Poland and absolutely not of the above exists.Even no policemen to cockblock you because they want to have the girls for themselves.You feel such a relief it is unreal.Like being forced to walk with 20 kilos weights around your ankles and suddenly being freed of every weight . <p> ( 06-20-2012 07:24 AM ) Greek kamaki Wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many obstacles you have to overcome them very fast and it is not easy.For example pavements which are very small and you can not approach comfortably , no benches , no parks where girls are sitting , no clubs for hook up because there are everywhere tables , people staring at you hostile when you talk to girls , roads are up and down , lots of heat , bartenders react when you annoy girls and shop owners sit outside their shops and scare you away from disturbing their potential clients.So you have to be really powerful so that all this does not matter you have to disregard and show your strength to shop owners , bartenders , random people , narcomans and beggars who will annoy you everytime you happen to speak to a girl .

Polish women also keep several boyfriends by side when she meets her ex it is not for friendly conversation as she claims she actually has sex with him in exchange for sth and you will soon find out when you become an ex as well . <p> ( 06-20-2012 04:55 AM ) Greek kamaki Wrote : .

But this morning I woke up and it was as big as ever , and getting painful too . <p> So I went online and read that tonsillitis is usually the result of a bacterial infection in the mouth . <p> Well , what is the best oral debriding agent we know about here on the RVF ? <p> I went into the bathroom and poured about 2.5 shots worth of Hydrogen Peroxide into a cup , and swished it in my mouth like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gargled anyways . <p> I spit it back out and it sounded like I had poured lava down my throat from all the sizzling and hissing . However , it did not hurt at all ; on the contrary , my throat cooled off immediately . <p> Afterwards I rinsed my mouth out with some water and took a 4 hour nap . When I had woken up , my tonsils had been reduced in size significantly . Right now my tonsils are back to normal size but still a little sore . <p> Now you wo n't find this on pubmed , but let it be known for everyone here : Anytime you get sick in the mouth , try rinsing your mouth out with hydrogen peroxide ( do n't mix it with water , swish it pure ) . Takes like shit but it 's basically the nuclear bomb of anti-bacterial oral warfare . <p> In the dental office , we regularly use hydrogen peroxide and apply it in infected areas .

Baking soda is basic and basically destroys the cell walls of bacteria ( pH and all ) .

In the comments , I asked him what order he belonged to . He replied at length : <p> Quote:Camaldolese would be the best description of it . I 'm Catholic , but my hermitage is not incorporated into the governing structure of the larger orders ; Camaldolese spirituality makes room for a half-way point between eremitical and cenobitic ( community ) life , under the Rule of St. Benedict 's spirit of moderation . I was tonsured a monk by my bishop , and my hermitage is in the process of becoming an institute of diocesan right . <p> The past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the very bosom of the Church . What many men have dubbed " Churchianity , " as I gather , eclipsed the true doctrine and nature of the Church . I believe that the Virgin predicted this crisis was to come , in her apparition at Fatima . I know some will think that religion or credence in the supernatural is a sign of idiocy or effeminacy , but , predictably , I disagree . The apparition at Fatima is striking to me , for the public notoriety of its miraculous events , and for the accuracy of its predictions about the 20th century : that Russia 's errors would eventually contaminate the entire Earth ( Communism , Socialism , Progressivism ) , even putting the " Church in eclipse , " pitting the highest ranks of the clergy against each other in a major apostasy , dragging them and many thousands of the laity who blindly followed them into hell . <p> I would say that is exactly what has been happening in Western civilization for the past 60 years or so . For that reason , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , which have all been appropriated by the modernists , and became an hermit instead . <p> Anyway , I realized some of the red pill truths about women a long time ago , but I also believe very firmly that a man needs to be honorable and virtuous . I was not willing to marry in the current culture , and I was also not willing to become an hedonist or sexual opportunist . I realized celibacy and a life lived in pursuit of manly virtue and the supreme Good was the only honorable path I could take , as a man in my position . I also realized that the monks preserved Western civilization the first time it went through a crisis , and we 'll need some of them around to do it again . <p> I 'm glad to volunteer for the job . I 've amassed a library that covers the basic elements of mathematics , medicine , philosophy , law , etc. , and I 've tried to retain competence in basic mathematics ( to algebra/trig ) , scientific knowledge and logic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts in the original Greek or Latin , and have undertaken the study of Greek and Latin as the key to the Western tradition . Also , frankly , I wanted to understand the authentic teachings of the Church before the modernists started disseminating their nonsense , always unofficially , in the 60s . Greek and Latin have helped with that - which , I 'm sure , is why the modernists were so eager to banish Latin from the liturgy and the seminaries . I hope to God that there will be no call for me to preserve these things through a crisis . But , if there is , I 'm ready to try and do so . <p> I like to read the " red pill " sites , because it pleases me to no end , to see that even secular men are starting to realize that the Church and the Patriarchy were right about manliness , hierarchy , the role of authority and tradition in society , etc . I suppose that not all " red-pill " sites are explicitly reactionary or neo-reactionary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in " game " for the sake of getting laid . But in the process , they take a big swipe at feminism . <p> Feminism is the belly of the beast , at present ; by dissenting from it , they put themselves on a trajectory that could lead them to **36;1038;TOOLONG , and in fact I often observe that this occurs . And then it is my turn to be " pleased and amused , " that men who frequent a site like this are starting to have some ideological common ground with men of the cloth , who have always taught things about contraception , sexuality , patriarchy , authority , masculinity , etc. , that many men are just now re-discovering . I am glad that the pleasure and amusement is mutual . <p> As for #2 , I do n't know . I will say that the religious are reproducing at an extremely high rate . In Israel , the fastest growing demographics are the Ultra-Orthodox Jews and the Muslims . In most Western European countries , the Muslims are the fastest growing group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it will cause a return in religious observance , but you ca n't be sure . <p> Ironically , although the West prevailed during the Cold War , the Marxists seem to be winning in the long run . The West has become progressively more liberal since 1990 . <p> #3 , yes , I do think so . If history is any indication , religious/traditional institutions will preserve what they can in the face of societal collapse . The Roman Catholic Church , for all the terrible things it did , did preserve Classical civilization as best it could in the face of chaos . I ca n't imagine how long society would 've taken to rebuild if the Church did n't maintain that knowledge . <p> Though I have some reservations about if this guy is really what he says he is , I still agree with what he is espousing . <p> As for a revival of religion , do n't know about that . I think we may see more " fellow travelers " , kind of like the people in the neo-reactionary part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are irreligious themselves . Brevik , the guy who shot up those teens in Norway was n't particularly religious himself ( though he did appear to be a theist ) but he choose to align himself with the Church of Norway as kind of a " f you " to what he saw were destructive forces and he also talked about the Catholic Church being the bulwark against the negative forces in modernism . <p> 1 ) I think we intersect with religious doctrine in that we probably agree with some religions that women are sort of out of control these days , and probably not for the better . <p> I also think that the monk 's life of focus is similar to our life of focus and discipline at becoming better at game . <p> I think we go the opposite way from religion when it comes to literally believing that there are supernatural forces because a book or person tells us . That 's like a blue pill guy believing that by just being a " nice guy " or " himself " that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to believe . I think we are constantly looking for truths and rejecting that which is false . Religions ca n't fully do this because they are sworn to uphold faith in irrational concepts ( like something existing outside of existence ) . <p> 2 ) I doubt there will be a revival of religion as backlash to feminism . That would be like trading one fiction for another as your belief system . <p> 3 ) I think religion is on it 's way out right now . There are a lot of people who say they are religious who do n't really believe . Keeping that in mind , it 's going to be hard to sell religion in the future , so I do n't think it will be a viable means of preserving tradition if it 's power over people vanishes . <p> I actually just did a quick Google search of his name and looks like has quite a commenting history on the web .

Not that I aspire for that , but I can see where they 're coming from . Maybe these guys do n't have the highest sex **28;1076;TOOLONG and they also do n't feel most women are worth the effort for whatever benefit they get from them . They may not want to be entangled in relationships and marriage either and have all the trappings that come along with that . They just want to do their own shit and pursue their own interests , maybe smash a few hookers or get a one night stand from time to time for sexual relief . I do n't think that 's the worst thing in the world . <p> I 'm sure many MGTOWs have what it takes to pick up , but just do n't care to or feel uninspired to bother being an entertaining clown with perfect game , perfect body and perfect logistics for the chance at sex . <p> 1 ) When I first found the manosphere and learned of the red pill , what struck me the most was seeing talk of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized from growing up in the church . Traditional gender roles etc .. I think a lot of guys who have n't spent significant time in a Christian environment would be surprised at how well they could vibe with a lot of its teachings . <p> I do n't subscribe to any religion , but my zealot ass dad will talk for hours about the degradation of society and the disgusting nature of modern American culture . The philosophical parallels between red-pill thinking and biblical scripture could fill a book , or at the very least make for an interesting article . <p> 2 ) I have to believe so , at first at least . If we as a race are able to pull ourselves from the current stranglehold of the elite corporate-ocracy which seems poised to dominate indefinitely , then I believe we will see a huge movement back towards traditional thinking , at first via religion , as that has been the source of these ideologies for centuries . These more natural ways of thinking , coupled with our technological advances and increasing knowledge of how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious aspects and retain the philosophical ones . At first , however , I do believe people will flock back to religion as their westernized , fem-centric worldviews fall apart and they seek immediate comfort in the next most established thought-system . <p> 3 ) I want to think any chance for the preservation of traditional civilization lies in the newer paradigms of technology and information networks ( internet ) . Although those are so dependent on constant energy , upkeep , and the concept of civilization itself that I could see old temples or church libraries being the only readily accessible records around if anything did happen to upset the way things are now . Maybe it would n't be the worst thing to move past the concept of " civilization " anyway .. <p> If there 's ever a significant EMP , then the US and most of the Western world goes back to the Middle Ages in the blink of an eye .

You might be surprised how perishable electronic information is . I wonder how much of our current civilization will survive into future centuries . Historians tell us that only about 25% of all classical authors ' works have come down to us . The rest were all lost : they were not preserved and no copies have survived the centuries . <p> In the end , maybe the most durable , most permanent types of writings and data that will survive 1000 years from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink on durable vellum , just like in the Middle Ages . <p> Those codices written in the Middle Ages are still around , but we ca n't even read our emails that were written 15 years ago . Think about that . <p> Maybe instead of investing in more electronic bullshit , we should be copying books onto real vellum in indelible ink . <p> Nassim Taleb has talked about this in his works ... our current infrastructure is " fragile " as opposed to " anti-fragile " or " robust " - using these terms in the way he does ( hint : there 's more to it then just the dictionary definitions ) . There 's a trade off between efficiency vs. robustness for any system and according to him , we are heavily tipped towards to the efficiency side of the scale which could lead to lots of problems in the future - such as the doomsday scenarios you guys are discussing above . The example Taleb used as an illustration was power grids - to make them more efficient you have to sacrifice robustness which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something goes wrong then a greater part of the grid will go down as there are less backups . I 'm sure you guys can easily see how this can be implied to information storage when it comes to storing something on a server vs. a book . <p> Everyone thinks that , because we have all this " modern technology " like computers , electronic data , etc. , etc. , that we wo n't lose information like we did in the past . <p> But I tend to think that our present civilization will blow away like leaves in the wind ... and 1000 years from now , only a fraction of it will survive . <p> I 'm not so sure about this .

Think about that for a minute . 1% of an entire civilization . We know practically nothing about the Egyptians relative to what they actually were . Look at how little actually survived the collapse of Rome . What we know of Classical Mediterranean civilizations is miniscule , relative to what they actually were . <p> As for the stuff that endures , ink and vellum always will . The Torah is manufactured with very specific types of both . There are readable Torahs in existence from over 800 years ago . Medieval manuscripts are even older in some cases . <p> The Church went wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK . <p> Usury is NOT OK . <p> Everyone on this forum bitching about Monsanto , Big Bracket Banks , Gov't Bailouts , Feminism and the Modern Workplace -- stop and think : If bank were not allowed to lend at high interest rates ( usury ) on their FRACTIONAL RESERVES -- would we still have 99% of these problems ? <p> The greed for money is the root of all evil . Someone stood to prosper from allowing usury and interest lending between Christians in the Middle Ages . Before that only Jews could lend with interest ... that 's what Shakespeare 's Merchant of Venice is about ... Usury between Jews and Christians . Unfortunately , the Church did not do due diligence and allowed this " modern lending " to take foot in Christian Europe . Even the Vatican has Opus Bank now ( which has been accused of money laundering ) . <p> Yes , exactly . I know Speakeasy makes a good point about the availability of electronic information for the future , but I 'm not so sure . Civilization , to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brother Speakeasy may be overlooking the fact that all this electronic data is useless unless the people living at that time care about preserving it . <p> The reason why the old temples , buildings , manuscripts , instruments , and secrets of past civilizations faded away is because no one cared about preserving them . With the advent of Christianity , for example , there was no one who cared about maintaining the old Greek and Roman temples and buildings . So they deteriorated . The same thing happened with the other relics of the classical world . <p> Some of the treasures of the ancient world are preserved in only one or two manuscripts . Can you believe that ? Some literary treasures existed in only one or two monasteries , moldering away , forgotten on the shelves . <p> Civilization is perishable . People forget that . Our present age is sewing the seeds of its own ruin by doing all the things we note here at RVF . <p> In the far future , I can see a situation where there is a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that everyone has forgotten how to " read " . <p> 1 ) The Christian Bible has a lot of similar threads that the " red pill " espouses . Both New and Old Testaments . In the Old , you have Jezebel . King Ahab let his pagan wife take control and led the kingdom of Israel to the long road of ruin in exile . ROK even had an article about Queen Vashti in the book of Esther , the queen not deferring to the king . LONG ... <p> In the New Testament , simply look to the writings of Paul and Peter . 1 Colossians 13:11 has already been mentioned . Paul 's letter to the Romans is full of themes our corner of the internet prides itself on . Self-sacrifice , self-improvement , self-restraint . Then there 's 1 Peter 3:1-8 ... <p> Quote:Wives , in the same way in God 's sight . 5 For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves . They submitted themselves to their own husbands , 6 like Sarah , who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord . You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way nothing will hinder your prayers . <p> 2 ) Are we likely to see a widespread revival of traditional religion ? In the foreseeable future , I fear not . Our enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frightening amount of power in our lives and have shown they are intent on stomping out anything that they perceive as a " false idol " ( like God , for instance ) . Frost pointed out the flight from God as an indicator of rising suicide rates a few months back LONG ... But in time , traditional religion will return , as birthrates among the devout have been higher than that of the non-believers throughout history . With luck , my children will see that day . <p> 3 ) Traditional religious institutions start with one place . The family . Faith can be passed down almost as easily and your genes . Children need a strong role model in all areas of life , including their spiritual life . Yet that faith can be snuffed out just as easily with weak adherence to doctrine or uninspiring pastors or parents . A sin of omission is still a sin . A pastor that only quotes 1 Peter 3:7 to his congregation without the preceding six verses is doing more harm that good . <p> Plastic books would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something drastic like that . Maybe when the 3D tech will be cheaper we can print our own plastic books from eBooks and create time capsules for the future . <p> I was raised Catholic but never bought into any of it . It was only after finding the red pill ( 10 years later ) that religion began to make sense to me , as a structure/guideline for self-improvement and traditionalism . <p> Through my travels and life abroad , exposure to other religions has been one of the most valuable experiences . Even in short passages ( regardless which book ) , lots of knowledge and insight .

@@96059319 @259319/ <p> Roosh 's analysis of the nature of women is spot on , it 's true and it is verifiable through careful observation- " within every woman on this planet , regardless of her education or background , is a bitch , a cunt , a slut , a golddigger , a flake , a cheater , a backstabber , a narcissist , and an attention whore that is dying to get out and that , if certain conditions arise and she is placed in a certain container at a certain temperature , will thrust her worst upon you , and this , I 'm afraid , is the true nature of women . This is the true nature that will come forth if society does n't put constraints or limitations on a woman 's behavior and choice. : While this is true , it is not simply women that have such ' evil ' inside them .

It is because humans do n't have an inherently evil nature , not to say that they have a good nature either , they have an utility-maximising nature ( thank you economics ) . And utility comes in many forms , it can come in the form of money , the form of sexual pleasure or the form of the happiness you get from helping someone .

@@96059322 @259322/ <p> A deep voice is an inherently masculine strait , being a symptom of both size and testosterone levels . Deep voices elicit attraction from women and respect from men . I was born a charismatic public speaker but with a typical , merely average pitched voice . I was also born with a perfectionist streak which when met with discovering game and self-improvement meant maximizing all my attributes as best I possibly could , so having a merely average pitch voice was no longer good enough . Unfortunately doing stuff like speaking from your diaphragm will only do so much , and really only make your voice sound fuller and richer rather than actually deeper per se . Since I have no interest in smoking my way to a deeper voice , this is where my exercise came in . <p> Disclaimers : <p> 1 . As far as I am aware it is impossible to permanently deepen your voice .

We often see statues of him with this symbol on the chest or on the sole of the feet .

The occurrence of swastikas in other parts of Asia is from Buddhism ( which took with it Hinduist symbols ) , so that is not difficult to get . <p> What is interesting is the findings of swastikas in iron age Europe , including isolated Northern Europe and the very old Ukrainian mammoth tooth . <p> That leaves only a couple of options : <p> 1 ) Swastika is Aryan and was spread to India and also Europe from these Aryan invasions , the Aryans originating from Caucasus and present day Ukraine . <p> 2 ) The Swastika originates in India and spread from India to Europe very early . <p> 3 ) The Swastika is a collective unconscious thing ( Jung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I lean towards 1 ) , since Sanskrit is the oldest Indo-European language we know of and we can basically trace the movements of the Indo-European people , identical with what was called Aryan people in the past . That is why there are Swastikas all over Europe . This is a remnant of ancient Aryan culture and also a suggestion that Hinduism is highly inspired by these outside forces . <p> We should compare the original European paganism to Hinduism to better understand this . The use and search for enlightenment , through oracles and truthseers , overlap of Germanic and Greek gods with Hindu gods . <p> I have little to no knowledge as to any overlaps in regards to Hinduism and Greek/Germanic gods , but it would be a very interesting study . <p> And if this hypothesis is true , then it could explain why so many white people go on spiritual journeys to India . Perhaps they sense some long lost resonating of spirituality of ancient Europe lost after christianity . <p> Someone beat you to it . When I typed into google " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search result . <p> Under the influence of psychedelics I have on multiple occasions seen swastikas and other universal symbols and geometric patterns ( and some unfamiliar symbols ) when sitting in the dark with eyes closed . Perhaps there is a connection in a common consciousness than spans cultures that can be plugged into via certain natural substances or trance , a sort of download of at times incomprehensible information , inspiring early cultures to make art and architecture with similar symbols and geometry . Fun to think about at least .

@@96059326 @259326/ <p> Are your looks a factor in getting women ? Definitely . But can the lack of looks be compensated for ? Definitely . It 's is very difficult for men to imagine that women do n't care about looks that much simply because we care so much about it . For men , physical beauty matters and matters a lot . But a woman objective is different and thus the way she looks at the world is different . Without getting into the details of this and to keep this simple : a woman see you not as you are but how you make her feel . <p> Look at the photo below . That magnifying glass she is holding is her feelings . How someone makes us feel affects the way we actually see them but for women this is magnified 10X just like the magnifying glass implies . Regardless of how you look , IF you can make a woman " feel " good you will change how she sees you . If you need additional proof of this , just look at all those little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ugly than some of those dogs . <p> She may look at you initially and think you are the ugliest thing she has ever seen BUT if she allows the chance for you to interact with her and through that interaction she starts to feel good her perception of you will begin to change . The better you make her feel the more her perception of how you look will change for the better . ( You will actually start to look more handsome to her " literally . ) This is also why women are less hung up on race , hair , eye color etc . This is not to say your looks do n't matter at all , they do . They just do n't matter as much as you may think and even if you are not the most good looking guy around , you can compensate for that by changing the way she feels when she is with you . <p> PS Just like men , some women have a strong attraction to certain looks , for example , she may like Black or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then your looks will confer upon you a significant " initial " advantage . If you were to put me in a line up with all of my girlfriends boyfriends you would immediately wonder what the hell I was doing in there . They had a type all right , usually : tall , handsome , and white and then there was me . Now I am not saying I am ugly but as one girl once told me I better stay behind the camera <p> But for one night stands and other short term flings , looking good really helps . Well built men enjoy more one night stands : <p> Quote:Women said their short-term partners were more muscular than their average sex partners . Muscular men reported more lifetime sex partners , short-term partners and more affairs with attached women . <p> Women love a good looking men . The biggest predictor of whether a woman will orgasm during intercourse is how symmetrical her guy is : <p> Quote:Men with symmetrical bodies apparently have a higher IQ , they run faster , dance better , sing better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and produce more and faster-swimming sperm than their asymmetrical counterparts .

I 've said it before and gotten major heat for it , but height is a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a muscular physique and style combined . <p> Maybe Roosh or Tuth will see me as a troll , but I truly think that looks/height ( at least at the top end ) are more important than game in this current day and age . I see this because I have pretty solid game , much better than 90% of the guys I see out at my local bar scene , however weekend after weekend , I witness the guys pulling the hottest chicks are typically the tallest and most handsome guys , with your occasional guy who is a serious baller , thug/meathead/jock ( masuline + ) , and guys with status on the local scene . <p> This especially stings when I roll with one of my bro 's who I 've mentioned before , dude is 6 ft 5 in. and what women would consider " classically handsome " , even though I have him beat for sure in physique and style , it 's like I 'm practically invisible to chicks when he 's around . Either they outright approach him , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , or I will be stuck with the ugliest of the two or the group . <p> I will say that approaching hard can be the X factor that will make up for the results . I have recently been in a bit of a funk and have n't really been putting much effort into approaching/gaming , also my local scene has been shit lately , so there have n't been many chicks I have really been motivated to chase . Anyways , the point I want to make is that , a lot of guys , like my tall/handsome friend , do n't really put any work into approaching chicks and typically hook up with chicks that approach them , or give them every IOI in the book , prompting the guy to approach . If you approach hard , you will play the numbers game giving you a wider array of girls to potentially work with , then a guy who just hangs back and waits for IOI 's . <p> Final thought , looks matter the most in dating/sexual markets that are stacked the worst against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a huge pool of men to choose from . Unfortunately that describes the scene I am currently stuck in , but that seems to be the trend that is overtaking most places in the U.S. Lot 's of horny , thristy men , all trying to holler and compete for the same pool of women . In this situation women can be more picky and judgmental , which in a way makes women more like men when it comes to their dating and sexual preferances , seeking to fuck the " hottest " guys they can . I will also agree that there are some women who through their " female " game will disqualify very handsome men for relationships ( because they know there will be a high chance of infidelity ) , but at the same time will happily ride the " alpha cock carousel " , while dating a less attractive guy who will really cherish them and put them on the pedestal . <p> I have a tall , good looking friend friend who I hang out with a lot . And sure , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman starts interacting with me things change . Usually what happens is that we will approach two women and initially they will both be interested in him but once they start interact with me I have a 50% chance of ending up with the higher value girl . This is especially true of girls with a high socio-economic status and higher education level . He has told me I am not really aware of the value of my socio-economic background . For example , he said girls are impressed with the fact that I have lived outside of the US and have traveled all over the place , and can talk about a wide range of subjects even though I do n't consider this anything special . <p> The point I am trying to make here is that , based on my own personal experience , I believe that personality , perceived status , and your ability to handle women ( game ) can compensate or neutralize looks ONCE you can engage a woman . What I do hate about the SOB ( my friend ) , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually have to work 300% harder to lay a girl than he does but I also get a higher quality of girls . He does n't get approached by any 8s and above but a good number of 5-7s and older women will ping him every time we go out . Whereas I am lucky if I get one or two pings from anyone the whole night . <p> There seems to be an increasing trend towards " game denialism " in the seduction community . Guys are increasingly emphasizing " looks " over " game " . <p> Assanova : <p> " One of the things that you 'll see PUAs doing , is insisting that game works . I 'm going to tell you why it appears to work in theory , but wo n't , in realistic situations .

This is probably the defacto reason why women are so flaky ; there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When trying to prove that game works , what a lot of game theorists will do , is try to use examples of a girl with no social life , who most likely never goes to nightclubs , and therefore never really gets the opportunity to interact with physically attractive men . In other words , if a PUA does get one of those girls , usually in day game type situations , it 's simply because the woman in question is n't interacting with physically attractive competitors . <p> Game theorists also like to selectively pick situations as examples of why game works . The most common examples are when the more physically attractive men are completely clueless and lack common sense , they are n't approaching the woman in question , or the more physically attractive man is the exception to the rule and is completely wimpy and beta because he is some kind of momma 's boy . <p> That 's just not the way things naturally work . Most physically attractive men do develop common sense , they eventually become self aware of their appearances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally beta , simply because more muscular men and taller men are placed into alpha positions , are jocks , and are generally looked up to by other men .

@@96059328 @259328/ <p> This is a book written by an Australian journalist , a woman who was raised Christian and converted to Judaism , about women and female sexuality in Islam . She spent many years of her life living in different Muslim countries as a journalist , spending time in Egyp , Jordan , Syria , Palestine , Saudi Arabia , Iran and other places . This woman was undoubtedly an outsider in the places she visited , but certainly a well informed outsider . Her perspective , as anything , is her own and should be taken with a grain of salt , but it was a very informative book . She quotes extensively from the Hadiths to explain where differing views on sexuality come from in Islamic thought . <p> The title refers to a phrase that says that Allah created sexual desire in 10 parts , and gave 9 to women and 1 to men . Women 's sexuality is viewed as more in need of control than men 's , beginning to explain all their various laws concerning women 's sexuality . <p> You learn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there exists such a thing as a temporary marriage . You can not go anywhere in public with a woman who is not your immediate family member or your wife . You will be asked for your marriage license regularly . However , Iran provides for a temporary marriage license . You could make it for only a few weeks if you like . <p> After the Iran-Iraq war , when many Iranian men were killed , their leader urged the country to make use of this temporary marriage license to repopulate the country . Just get married for a few weeks , pop out a kid , it 's for the good of the nation . <p> During her travels in Iran , the author was in a holy temple and wearing a chador , trying to pass herself off as muslim but worried that she would be caught . An Iranian security guard said something to her and she became frightened thinking she had been caught . She hid her face and moved away from him . Her Iranian companion told her that her chador was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the security guard had actually asked her for a temporary marriage , assuming her to be " one of those girls " . <p> In Saudi Arabia , she talks about women who go shopping for all this modern high fashion with all their oil money . Around the house , women dress as they please , as long as it 's only other women and children around . Saudi homes generally have separate social quarters for men and women . Even being seen in casual clothing by , say , your in-laws is considered to be no good . So when families gather , basically men and women hang out separately and there women will dress in the latest western fashions while dealing with the kids . <p> She interviews some wealthy Saudi who keeps a very traditional and strictly religious household . He invites her to his " office " one evening . There , interviewing him , she finds him and his friends surrounded by alcohol and strippers . How can he justify such things , she wonders . To him , strippers are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his daughters or wives , they were not even muslims , and as such , could be used for his pleasure . He even mentions that some religious scholars have acknowledged as much . The reporter ends up sharing a cab home with one stripper , a pinay girl . The stripper dons a hijab as she leaves , and the reporter does not . Walking around in public being dressed less decently than the stripper tickles the author pink . <p> In Syria , hanging out with some women , she was surprised to see just how sexy they all were . Completely waxed of all hair , hanging out in nice negligee . Apparently in the Quran there is some law about removing all body hair every so often . And another about making sure you do all you can to please your husband . These Syrian women took it very seriously by being incredibly dolled up when at home , looking to her like exaggerated sex toys . <p> In Egypt , she encountered the changing mores of Egyptian society . Previously a place where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things were being pushed to the sidelines . Perhaps you 've seen this famous picture of Cairo University 's graduating classes : <p> In the past , wearing hijab was just not something Egyptians really did . The custom has obviously become more and more prominent . Some view this as the encroachment of Saudi ideas , the Saudis apparently provide funds for many groups that promote their brand of Islam throughout the muslim world . This leads to the interesting fact that many older women , and older people in general , are much more secular than the younger generation in the muslim world . In Universities you may find older women who still cling to secular , pan-arabist , even feminist ideas . But young women are much more likely to reject these as heretical , much more likely to view wearing hijab as something you must do . <p> It 's interesting here to think how often the U.S. has been opposed to secular leaders in muslim countries . Mossadeq in Iran decades ago . Saddam Hussein , Qadaffi , Al-Assad . We were all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of them out . I 'm sure the Saudis were also eager to see them go . <p> This was an amazing book , it showed me lots of things which I had always wondered about . The author 's perspective is of course questionable as an outsider , but all the same it was very well written and the kind of book I could not put down . I would highly recommend it . <p> Humans are and have always been sexual creatures , and if sex is publicly restricted by government or by religion , that only means that dirtier , freakier and filthier sex is occuring somewhere hidden from the view of the naked eye . <p> The Islamic nations excelled most when they adhered to secularism and " soft " authoritarian rule to keep the radicals out from power . Trace back to Egypt at it 's heights was hen Nasser was rocking three piece suits as preaching for development over holy doctrine . Saddam , though no saint had the war education and health levels in the region during his time , Gaddafi gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on pace to exceed Russia by next year . Saudi Arabia meanwhile still practices slavery/bondage widespread and has complete shit living for it 's people for the amount of wealth it possesses . <p> Secularism was always an enemy to the West and to the Saudi royals , and was systematic to always treat it with hostility . <p> Well , again I will ask you to change your title ( sadly you ca n't ) : The Hidden World of Middle East Islamic Women . <p> The interpretation of the Quran is different according to the region . <p> In the Middle East , they pretend Islam allows you to marry a woman for pleasure only , and divorce her quickly . This is not the case elsewhere ( the rare occurences of it in Western World are from those migrating from Middle East ) . Iran ( and Saudi Arabia too ) took some of its traditions and mixed it to Islam . Come to think of it , every Muslim country does it . However , the degrees are not the same . <p> Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the homeland of the Holy Prophet , they were used to commiting the worst atrocities ( killing and raping , burying alive women when their husband was dead , not giving them ANY inheritance when their husband/son died , and way more ) . Some centuries after he died , the situation started to go out of control again . Now , westerners will take the example of Saudi Arabia , Iran or Irak when asked about a Muslim country . However , my brothers would refer to Asian , or African examples instead of the aforementionned countries ... Because of the slaves policies , the racism towards people of color ( of course , white men have a god factor ) , their money , that they refuse to share with others , their mutism towards Palestine , the religious wars between Sunnites and Chiites ... <p> Thank God , in Senegal , though there are a lot of confreries , we leave in peace . And there is not much secularism.The pleasure marriages are not done . Actually , the sexuality of women here is closer culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do almost whatever you want here , as long as the reputation of your family is preserved . Senegalese girls are very sexual <p> That pearl belt is yummy here , because you can play with it , accidentally break it , and search for all the pearls in a lot of places <p> I am sure this girl is Muslim ( 95% muslims here ) , however the Quran says nothing about wearing this <p> The author was mainly in the Middle East , but she told a funny story about some type of " Islamic Olympics " hosted in Iran where women competed . Iran wanted to avoid sending women to the Olympics so they figured , we 'll organize an Islamic Olympics and invite only muslim countries to attend . <p> Women from Indonesia , for instance , got into lots of conflicts with the Iranian morality police . In Indonesia , many of these athletes had been in the police force or the military , and did not take kindly to being bossed around by some idiot about their clothing . <p> ( 08-11-2014 11:02 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat their women as pure , while looking at non-Muslim women as whores . This often takes the form of sexual violence . That accounts for a lot of the dislike of Muslims . <p> This is no different from the average westerner non muslim joe . Unless he is comfronted daily to the whoreness of his female relatives , he will expect them as pure , or at least quite chaste ( if the guy is blue pill ) . It is just that the ones you call Muslims , whereas it 's mostly Arabs , are more prone to be violent about it . <p> Again , the amalgam that Muslim=Arabs , especially Middle East Arabs , strikes . <p> They will often be equally as violent if they see an Arabian girl get married to a black man , even if he is muslim . Just search on the internet about racism from Arabs , and the many black people killed for something lighter than this ( like refusing to give up one 's seat in the bus ) . Of course , not all Arabs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam ? Or the home culture of people , who happen to be Muslim ? <p> For me , the problem is quite simple . When the medias give us a view of Islam , they take people of Arab roots ( as expected ) . As with every religion , the " stricto sensu " principles mix with the local culture ( for example there is some folklore going on Christian Celebrations in Senegal , which I am sure do not exist in Europe ) . The Arab culture is really polarized towards itself ( and even then , some dissenssions appear ) . If you take your average Arab , explore his brain and see how does he view muslims from other backgrounds ( Africa , Asia , Europe , America , Australia ) and if he would give his daughter to a guy from these , he will for example strongly reject Black guys . White guys are likely to get a pass nowadays , if they have enough money , but even with money , a black guy will often be a no-go . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you assume this is 100% how muslims behave , whereas they call " Azziyya " black people in Morocco , and sometimes throw them rocks ? - personal anecdote from my sister and her friends ? When you see Muslim leaders , Senegalese ones , congratulate a christian elected cardinal ( Theodore Sarr ) after being nominated by Benedict XVI , if you concluded that all Muslims were like that would it be right ? When you see a country murdering itself towards religious questions like Iran , would you conclude all Muslims are like that ? <p> When you see also Senegalese people talking sometimes with desdain about other black African citizens , treating them like second-zone citizens , or Algerian men refusing to give their daughters to Moroccan men , solely because the two countries hate each other , would you say that Muslims are all like that ? <p> There comes the mistake then : if you confronted Africa , the Chechenes , the Ouighours , the Maghrebians , the Indonesians , and try to figure out the similarities , you would surprisingly find quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local culture influences the way we practice Islam . <p> However the media only shows you what 's going on in the Middle East ( or for example , in France , only look at the people of Algerian blood ) . Because it is easier to pack everyone in the same bag , and make you hate the religion . <p> For me , it 's the Arabs that Westerners hate , not Islam . Because if you were showed documentaries of Islam in the regions other than Middle East , then you might revise your opinion I think . <p> PS : I notice that often I will compare to Senegal , when I want to defend the religion . I think it is a good example , because officially 95% are Muslims , 2-3% Christians , and the rest Polytheists or atheits . <p> However , we do n't really recognize ourselves in Arabian countries for example , because of its policies and attitude towards foreigners non white ( we think it 's silly to forbid women from driving , and we do n't  like being basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , one senegalese guy was dead after arguing with a Moroccan in a bus-he did not attack him physically . Investigation conducted ? NO . Or I think the Moroccan ended with a slap on the wrist . <p> This does not prevent us from being really faithful . We celebrate the Aids , we fast , the sense of family is high , and honour killings have disappeared ( ca n't recall a single case in many years ) . <p> The country is westernized by some sides ( ex-French colony ) . And young girls are slutting it up more and more . However we all live in peace . There is no religion issue , and we often give other christians a share when we eat the mutton for the Aid el Kebir ( they give us too when it 's Easter time ) . For me , it 's very close to what was taught to us by the Prophet . <p> I already explained it in that quote . I wonder why did n't that woman go to Maghreb , SubSaharian Africa , USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , saw how sexuality worked there , then her book would have been relevant . The title should be as I said : The Hidden World of Middle East Islamic Women . <p> If I wanted to write a book on Christianity , if I only focused on what happens in Rome , would it be representative ? Of course not . I would have to include protestants , orthodoxes , and for every major branche , single 2-3 sous-branches . Then if I compare all the 8-10 streams I singled out , the results may be more accurate . However today , you can not expect people to carry all of this , because of laziness/need to feed people what they want , or at least expect to hear .

American women require significantly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not use a calm , measured , intellectual approach on an American girl and expect to succeed sexually .

She reportedly left a suicide note . <p> I 'm not directly trying to play devil 's advocate here , but out of curiosity , are there any advantages to American women vs . European women ? <p> One that immediately comes to mind for me is the aloofness of certain European women , especially those from Germany , Switzerland , and parts of Scandinavia . They are often very rigid and robotic and very quiet . <p> I 'm naturally a relatively quiet guy and I find that girls who are talkative compliment me well . I like social girls . I feel with European women , even British ones , I have to constantly do the talking which can become burdensome over longer periods of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's easier to build rapport with American girls . Once you ask the right questions , you usually wo n't have a problem to get them talking . European women seem to want to say as little as possible when communicating , even if they like you . It 's harder to build rapport with them . <p> Also , with some European women ( particularly western ) , being an alpha male is seen as arrogant and stereotypically American , which many of them hate . They come from US-bashing , egalitarian societies where every decision has to take into account how it benefits the whole of humanity . With American girls , I feel being cocky and talking about myself is likely to turn them on . There are some exceptions to this but usually being a cocky , self-assured guy is what they want , at least for having sex . This naturally plays into my favor being the man that I am . I can just be myself . I have an intellectual side , but I 'd rather not use that when communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , there are many flaws to American women , namely their lack of femininity . I 'm not sure if I 'll ever want to get married , but it would be hard to see myself doing so with an American . Kind of sad to say that because I genuinely love the country in spite of its shortcomings . <p> I think it 's important to distinguish between Germanic ( Scandinavian , Anglo-American , Dutch , German ) girls and girls from Catholic countries . I ca n't speak for Eastern European girls , but from this forum they seem to have more in common with Germanic girls in terms of pussy-accessability than Catholic ( Italian , French , Spanish , Portuguese ) girls . <p> Germanic girls are just waaaaay more slutty . <p> The more liberal attitude to sex must have a deeper cultural background , and from what I know , Germanic peoples have always distinguished themselves by being far more egalitarian between the sexes than other cultures ( a free-born Scandinavian woman could divorce rather easily , even in the Iron Age ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) . <p> As for Scandinavian uptighthness ... Laner is currently breaking the code . It 's a fine line that requires social saavy beyond what your average American is used to , but it has to do with the tight social circles that are just a pain in the ass . <p> Germanic strains of feminism can be intolerably one-sided . We need a good war of survival so the female sex can properly appreciate its vulnerability and need of masculine protection . <p> ( 03-19-2012 09:23 PM ) houston Wrote : Will I be in shock when I first step foot in Europe and talk to the girls ?

In this sense , you can repeat the same lines over and over to fcuk lots and lots of lizards with hardly any need to tweak the formula . <p> As Athlone mentioned , with Europeans , you can be yourself . You do n't have to appear ' cool ' or speak to her like you are trying to apply for a job . Just speak normally , highlight some interests and invite her out for a date ( if you are not a strong closer ) etc .

The attention whoring can throw noobs off and they might think oh because she shoved her tits in my face or sent me a pic via phone of her azz that I am in . Wrong . She does this with tens of other guys . <p> This is why game has developed in North America . In Europe ( and I lived in England ) , this was not needed . England is hardly like mainland Europe but I did n't need to crunch nowhere the same amount of numbers that I have needed to in Toronto to get lizards . <p> My game plan in Europe ( England ) was this : <p> See a lizard . Go up and say how you are doing . Talk for a bit . Ask for her number . If she gave me her number , it meant she was more than 50 percent likely to fcuk . Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the date . Invite her back to the crib . Fcuk . That was it . Lizards who did n't want to fcuk would either give a fake number or refuse to give the number 90 percent of the time . <p> And this is from Britain which is a sexually conservative country . In the freer countries such as France , Spain , Holland , Scandinavian countries etc , according to reports from my friends , fcuking was really no big thing hence even less of a need for game . <p> Over here in the tougher North American cities , the amount of peacocking needed is higher in comparison . Custom suits , cars , cigarettes , kino , all sorts of shyt . <p> So to conclude , once you have the script ( formula ) in North America , you can go through tons of lizards fcuk and dump in North America .

Ninety percent of European women ( for example , Belgian , Italian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . An Italian man was aware of this since the late 1960s ( the time of the Beatles ) because his parents explained to him almost 45 years ago . That is what he told me .

They generally have a better relationship with their European born mother and grand mother , and are better behaved than most American women and men who are raised by American mothers . The first and sometimes second generation should see no American influence . Amanda Leigh " Mandy " Moore ( born April 10 , 1984 ) is a primarily example of this , with her English-born maternal grandmother .

I can almost see the pain in her face when she 's acting . However , the masculinity oozes out anyway . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In todays America , it may even REQUIRE a more intelligent woman to think past the feminist brainwashing that seems to now be indoctrinated into society . A truly smart woman will have the emotional intelligence needed to do her part to make her relationship work and to assume the role that best works toward that end . It does n't mean not having a spine , but it does mean playing the feminine role . <p> It seems though that many middle/lower class women , at least in the USA , tend to act more masculine than ladylike . But this , of course , is n't a rule . A girl of any class and education could have a great upbringing and be a shining example of femininity . Again , intelligence and / or upbringing . <p> I think her parents behavior ultimately shape the way that she will view her role in any relationship . In countries other than the first world western countries , traditional family values seem to be better instilled in women , leading them to be more feminine . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , I bet that you will often see a masculine mother , a submissive father , or some other type of unbalanced or dysfunctional family dynamic . <p> I think many girls are forced to become this way as a means of survival in a dysfunctional family , or from a bad maternal role model . <p> Or maybe its just from an upbringing that is too liberal in terms of teaching the feminist values of the dominant and independent woman . Whatever their justification for teaching this , the end result is unhappy men and women in unbalanced relationships . <p> In any village , there can only be one chief . Any more than that will cause problems . <p> I usually try and avoid the whole the one that got away bs , because it breeds negativity , and because I rarely second guess my decisions . <p> That said , a notable exception is how I fucked up my relationship with a former Nepalese girlfriend . Got drunk , banged some girl who came onto me and who happened to be a friend of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there goes a 2 yr serious relationship . <p> Anyhow , back on point . She was exotic , US educated , really beautiful eyes , totally loyal and dependable ( unlike me ) . <p> Really , a great girlfriend , and potential life partner . It has been a few years now , and I wonder why I did it , I think a combination of not wanting to get married , and also my inner manwhore . Its difficult enough to stop looking for it , but when it comes to you ... <p> Right on Hydro , I agree with the whole upbringing femininity thing above . <p> I think your statement on the 1st world Western nations is kind of accurate , but I would add that that lopsided mother runs everything , is more common in the modern Yuppie , DC , LA , NYC kind of " urban " family . You go to more blue collar areas , not just out in the country , but less " cosmo " cities and you will still find stronger fathers who run the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with North America : Latinos have thier daughters ears pierced , dressed in pink , coming hair and playing with dolls from birth . We on the other hand seem to think we are doing our daughters a service by buying them a baseball glove and karate lessons for their 5th birthday . Fucked up huh ? <p> Funny , I remember sitting next to a guy on the plane who had shagged women all over the world , guy was uber rich and in his 50 's , he had it broke down to .... <p> Italians : make the best moms -baby their boys and take care of house/home Latinas : make the best lovers , wild and passionate Midwest girls:make the best overall wives Asians : most submissive but great home makers , loyal Eastern Europe : colder , but beautiful , feminine . <p> He had a few more , but its been about 7 years , as I have gotten older I find he is spot on . <p> I prefer women who are intelligent and have will and an opinion , but realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys here feminine . Not the NYC girls who want to fight over the pants at every battle . On a side note I will say some of the stronger women ( american wise ) just test the shit out guys and if you can keep em in check there comes a point where they bow to a mans power . Still a pain in the ass after 7 years of dealing with them . <p> I love latinas , but they cheat a lot , even the girls , hell I am here with a brasilian girl , I was with her before and after her BF was here . I hear that asian women almost never cheat . I would lean towards Filipina 's and Japanese girls due to that , tho I have never been there . I love the look of EE women , but they seem so cold and calculating . I love colombians , they are so sweet , sexy , great in bed , but I so many have cheated on me with their boyfriends ..... <p> I think when you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how easy they cheat , almost ALL of them . Its still the rare girl that I cant get past the whole , I have a BF thing and shag her . <p> I would say a nice midwest girl is probably great too , but I love how asian women keep thier bodies as they get older . Like 3am said , I always check out the mom if I am thinking long term , I should be a little attracted to the mom because she will end up looking like her mom 90% of the time . ( which is why I love Colombians , they take care of thier bodies as they get older , and just get hotter ) <p> Uhmmm I agree with part of that CLR . The part with the Latina 's is a bit skewed , because I think allot of N.American and European men go to latin countries and find gorgeuos girls hanging out in clubs and bars drinking and partying , and assume that because they are out banging all Latin women are . Another reason is ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and relaxed with their girlfriends . They are too trusting . In the twisted world of love in Latin countries if you are too hands off , non jealous and trusting they assume you do n't give a shit and move on with something / someone else . <p> There are tons of good latina 's but the ones that are going to be most loyal are probably not going to be the ones you pick up at a club . The best latin girls are most often met through family barbecues , work , school etc and usually are VERY slow moving and old fashioned , but once you get there , worth the wait . They are also very good with children and coddle male babies more than even Italians I think . <p> I think the problem with knowing women and gaming is that you become caloused . I personally catch myself gravitating with certain types of girls and just becoming comfortable with that . So instead of waiting patiently for the good girl who will be loyal and respectful to her man , I end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake tits who is open to me having a 3 some with her and her gf 's . Of course you expect her to be full of drama , non trustworhty , possibly dirty etc. but you are prepared for thta , after all its just fun . After a while , I just start to see all girls like that , but really its just me , it 's the girls I 've been selecting . Maybe I just do n't want to wait and be patient only to be dissapointed by a boring girl though ... who knows . <p> Nope , I agree with most of what you said Rocco , but I lived in Colombia for a time , and have hung out in Spanish ( mostly colombian ) communities for the past 7 years or so here in the US , I know them quite well . You are right about the hands off thing with latinas too . Simple fact is they cheat A LOT and the men it 's expected and the women hide behind , I do n't  want to hurt him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wo n't even get into the Primos ! jajaja <p> Also I agree the best girls do n't go out , you have to go to the local yearly festivals , or meet via social circles , probably even church BUT it 's because those girls do n't  get out much that they do n't  cheat IMO . Obviously I am stereotyping , but its what I 've seen , a culture of infidelity , and while I like to play the field I wo n't cheat on a GF and I do n't  want her cheating on me . <p> The other problem is the girls fall " madly in love " with EVERY BF they have . He is my life , my reason for living blah blah , next one , " he is my life , my reason for living " OVER and OVER again . They are passionate which I/we like but you do become a little jadded/ calloused . <p> ( 05-26-2010 01:15 PM ) clr Wrote : The other problem is the girls fall " madly in love " with EVERY BF they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blah blah , next one , " he is my life , my reason for living " OVER and OVER again . <p> Interesting that you put Persian women up there , since they tend to play a lot of games .

@@96059334 @259334/ <p> Okay , this may be a somewhat beta post , and it 's a topic that been touched on before , but I thought I would she 'd some more light on this phenomena . There are many aspects of the game that ca n't be quantified or qualified , there are some things that do n't always make sense on paper , but they are a real tangible thing . <p> One of these " dogmas " of the game that I have found to be true , is " catching feelings " or getting your hopes up , or building a girl up in your mind before you 've even had sex with her . This is something that I used to do all the time back in the day , in my pregame and early game years , and it 's something that I sometimes still have to conciously work hard to repress doing . <p> Often times I meet a girl , usually a really beautiful girl , that I am really attracted to and seemingly has all the qualities that I desire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some level . Now usually this is due to us seeming to " hit it off " right from the get to , things seem to really fall into place , she appears to be really into me and the prospects of us making sweet love together and spending bunches or time together looks great ... <p> Then like I said before we have n't even had sex I start to build up these grand scenarios into my mind about how things are going to be so great together , the great sex we 'll have , the time spent enjoying each others company , going to the beach , going out for sushi and cocktails , etc. etc . The time we spend falling for each other . <p> But ... In reality the little fantasy that I play out in my mind usually falls flat like a house of cards toppling over from a swift breeze . <p> Case in point , this is where the post may take a beta turn and I may delve into a lame story full of an overly detailed account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . <p> So I met this girl at the bar a little over a week ago , it was not this past Thursday , but the Thursday of last week , which is " college night " at the local bars and the best night of the week to go out and meet cute college girls . <p> This girl caught my eye immediately , she was petite , had a nice lushious perky round booty , nice big round titties , a very pretty young innocent face , with green eyes and curly black hair . She said she was a quarter black , part native American , but mostly of Russian descent , I 'd rate her a solid 8 . <p> Any how my approach hooked immediately , we seemed to hit it off , the bar was packed and there were a bunch of guys trying to say hi and talk to her , but she ignored them all , only to stick by my side , talking to me the whole night . <p> She bounced to another bar with me and we pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she made many comments about how she was kind of a shy , nerdy girl , who does n't like to go out and party a lot , and she really likes to take " things slow . " <p> At the end of the night I asked for her number and she seemed really enthusiastic about hanging out , and asked me to text her on the spot so she had my number too and told me to hit her up . I went for the kiss , but she turned her head to the side , seeming kind of self concious about kissing a guy at the bar , which I thought was lame , but I respected . <p> She was the only girl I stepped to and macked on that night , and we literally spent 3 hours hanging out at the bar talking that night , so I thought the outlook looked pretty good with her . <p> Then I did my standard , wait 3 days to send a text gambit , and sent her a text Sunday night , which she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off and said she 's a flake and not very interested , so I considered it a " dead prospect . " <p> I went out again this past Thursday and ran into her again with a couple friends , this time she approached me and started talking , apologizing for not getting back to me , claiming she was in the bay area ( which I call bullshit on ) , and told me to hit her up again . I took that as a good sign and figured that she was back " into play " and that I 'd hit her up again at the end of the weekend . <p> Okay so I went out to the bar last night with a bro , and saw her holding some guys hand and walking out of the bar with him . Admittedly I was like " what the fuck " , that 's whack , I was mildly jealous and was seriously like " that guy " , dude looked lame and certainly not as attractive as me . <p> Then my friend and I bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , plus a fat ugly friend , and another dude . It was pretty obvious that both guys were pining over her , and were just hanging out with the ugly friend by default . <p> Anyhow , decided to ignore her , but at some point not knowing where she was or really caring , I step out front to get some air and maybe see if there are any girls out front to spit to . Lo and behold the cute shorty is just chilling out front and we start talking , when she become very flirtatious and I proceed to hug her , and escalate " kino " as the PUAs would say . <p> We go back into the bar and I say " let me get you a drink " , she 's chilling at the bar with me , being super flirty and touchy feely , her " friends " are sitting in a booth directly across from us and the guys are basically starring me down with the evil eye . <p> It 's getting close to last call , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she then steps aside with him , and he 's obviously not amused , he was the guy she was holding hands with at the other bar earlier . <p> After they talk for a couple minutes she comes back over to the bar where I 'm chilling on a stool and starts talking to me agin like nothing happened . The bartender calls last call and her group comes and tries to make one last attempt to cockblock me and convince her to leave with them . She says she wants to stay and finish her drink and that she 'll walk home . <p> Well I 've been in the game for a minute so I knew this was a good sign , that fact that she was willing to ignore and ditch her cockblocking friends was a greenlight for me . <p> After we got kicked out of the bar , I told her I 'd give her a ride home and she complied , when we got to her place she invited me into her place , but went on about how she " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because she wo n't have sex with me . " I 've heard it all before and I know usually it 's just their " anti slut defense " so that they do n't look like a slut , when they really want the dick . <p> Anyway when we 're in her place she starts acting kind of weird , alternating between telling me how she thinks I 'm so cool , and how she want to hang out in the future , but then suddenly acting withdrawn , and unresponsive . We cracked some beers and watched Wilfred on netflix , I was kind of cuddling her and rubbing her thigh , kissing her neck , and putting my tongue in her ear , which she appeared to enjoy . <p> But everytime I went for the kiss she tried to avoid it and turning her head , and saying " no sorry , nothing is going to happen " . Eventually I kept trying and went kind of " caveman " and grabbed her head to kiss her . She did n't resist that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd kiss for like 10 seconds then when I 'd slip in toungue , she 'd pull back and keep asserting that , that was it and she was n't down for any more . <p> Really looking back now in retrospect I should have gone even more caveman and trying to suck her tits , finger her pussy , pull my dick out , just escalate it to that next level and try to push through her last minute resistance to try and make her horny enough to break down and give me the pussy . <p> However , she had planted the seed in my mind that she 's a " good girl " , does n't like to " move too fast " , and that she 's " shy and innocent " , all of which is probably just an absolute pile of horse shit . <p> Anyways after we make out for a bit , she asks me to leave because it 's 3 AM and she 's tired , and me trying to be a " respectful " nice guy , I oblige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprung on me , being like " we got to hang out soon , I had such a great night " , blah , blah , blah . She tries to act all concerned for me , saying that she really wants me to text her when I get home to make sure I get home okay , and whatnot . <p> All systems appeared to be a go in my mind , although I did n't end up getting the " notch . " I thought she 's a nice girl , I got to take a different angle with her , she really seems into me , and she 's most likely going to end up being girlfriend material . <p> I text her when I get home and she replies immediately , wishing me a good night , I 'm lying in bed feeling really " high " off this girl , when my thoughts begin to slip into the realm of fantasy . I 'm thinking about how I 'm going to make sweet love to this nice innocent girl , how were going to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , and I 'm going to introduce her to everyone as my girlfriend . We are going to be so happy together , I will go on road trips with her down the Cali. coast and if things really work out maybe a romantic trip to Baja or Hawaii . <p> Mind you this is all after one night of hanging out with her and a make out session , these thoughts really are n't warranted at all , but based on my interaction and everything she was telling me it seemed golden . I got 3 other girls number on this past Thursday that I was going to text tonight , but as I lay in bed trying to sleep thinking about this girl , I was like forget those other girls I 'm not going to even bother with them . <p> I had more or less made soft plans to go get sushi with this girl early this week , and the thought of me trying to schedule dates with other girls either a day before or day after , actually made me feel kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> Then this morning she sends me a text at 9 AM , simply saying " thanks for the ride home last night " . I take that as a good sign that she 's thinking about me . I was trying to snooze since I barely got any decent sleep so I waited an hour and a half , and replied with this : " For sure , no problem . It was nice hanging out with u , we should do it again sometime soon . " <p> She replies about a half hour later with this : " Thanks I really had a good time too , but to be honest there is another guy that I 'm into , and I want to bet on that . Sorry . " <p> I got to admit it was kind of a punch in the gut , because that was pretty much the last thing I was expecting . But I am a naive fool for thinking that . <p> I broke so many tenants of game with this chick , and while I typed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up about it , just a bit miffed , and to be perfectly honest I feel kind of downtrodden . <p> It just seems like every time I try to step my game up and go for top tier 8+ level women , I end up getting the run around , and have them either out right flake , or try to play me like a puppet on a string . <p> I 'm going to text my other prospects tonight , but unfortunately , my confidence in them coming through is low . However , this is all I can do , I 'm not a male 10 , I 'm not a rich guy , I 'm not a celebrity , all I can do is slog through the trenches , and keep getting cut down , and standing back up , keep trying to " keep my chin up . " Hopefully , one day I will be rewarded for my effort , but till them I continue to struggle . <p> I agree with not getting too enamored with a girl who you do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses terms like " slow " " space " is already distancing herself . The reasons she gives are meaningless . It means " I do n't want to fuck right now in my life . " <p> And the three rules of " missed " phone calls , emails , texts ( as long as you did n't see the text fail at your end ) : <p> 1 ) Never believe excuses , she 's just gaming you or trying to be nice . 2 ) Never believe excuses , she 's just gaming you or trying to be nice . 3 ) Never believe excuses , she 's just gaming you or trying to be nice . <p> Also , I 'm baffled why anyone expects girls you meet in a bar to have any character . <p> Look at your account : YOu have a very detailed description of how she looked , but all your account of her communication shows she 's hot/cold kissing/distancing you : ( 1 ) Would n't kiss whenever ( 2 ) Talks about going slow ( 3 ) Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When people tell you who they are , believe them the first time . " You 're completely going by looks and ignoring distancing behavior from her . <p> And as for " shy and innocent " , the only thing women are shy and innocent about is admitting how unbelievably perverted they are . <p> I never went to bed with a girl who could orgasm who did n't want one of the following : <p> 1 ) Rough , harsh anal 2 ) Wanted to call me Daddy while I fucked her . 3 ) Got off on calling me Master 4 ) Having her nipples hurt to the point I was afraid I would tear them off . 5 ) Wanted her ass beaten until bloody marks started to show . 6 ) to be forced to the ground by her female roommate and to eat the roommate . ( She would masturbate to that fantasy ) <p> The ones who COULD N'T orgasm , well , maybe it was because I did n't get them to do shit like the above ! ! <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same thing ! ! <p> P.S. " Tenants " are people who rent something , " tenets " are principles of some practice or philosophy . <p> Great heartfelt post OG . It 's hard to stay honest at every stage of a story at this relative length but that 's what you did . <p> Do n't let the hoes get you down too much because you have a heart and a brain , and they , well , they have other things . <p> One thing I 'd say , be careful about going too caveman even if you think it might seal the deal . False Rape Accusations are stunningly rife -- no joke -- and one word from some dumb bitch could ruin your life . No pussy is that good ... <p> You bring this up at an interesting time . Every once in a while a man just wants to believe that women are indeed good , wholesome , **28;1133;TOOLONG type ladies . <p> We know from experience that this is far from the truth for most women , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains and at times we can fantasize about what it would be like . <p> This is why I try to get sex as quickly as possible . Its only after sex that I can come back to reality about who she really is . Even if she slept with me on the first date , or first night , they can still be what I would consider high quality . But often is the case that they just no longer have anything about them that I want to be a part of . <p> That infatuation thing I do n't  think ever ends . Its hardwired into the male brain . We see something , and for whatever reason we need to have it . We start to trick ourselves into thinking how life will be once we get what ever it is that we desire . With women , often it comes out in little " romantic getaways " daydreams . So what . They main reason for this is to keep the prize as sweet as possible in the mind , so you will focus more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today about a woman I have been infatuated with . She is not my type at all , and normally I would not give her much of my time . But f*ck me , I have had my eye on her for a while now . It was strange , on the one hand she was not " hot " enough to pursue outright , yet on the other hand I would walk by her boutique and catch myself secretly hoping that she would be outside sweeping so I could catch a look at her . <p> Sometimes the former view of the world just needs to make an appearance for sake of contrast . It can be a very useful tool in the world of seduction . <p> This is a good question when i 'm thinking to myself about the subject of getting feelings for a girl I think to myself it could happen if the situations right but when I 'm actually with a girl i do n't get any feelings at all except horniness lol , i suppose i 'm just weird . <p> The hotter and more unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into feelings for them and for them to have many quality guy prospects awaiting . Its funny though , it does reinforce the higher likelihood of female hypergamy in the 8+ range , rather than outright total sluttiness , going all the way with multiples . <p> Then again , whose to say her " cache " is n't full and there is n't 3 more other guys she 's baiting , and not just 1 . <p> I believe that the 8+ range ( in the US anyways , and from my observations and experience ) , are big on social " appearance , " not necessarily physical appearance . In other words , if they are the queen bee of their group of females , and used to receiving the most attention ... or act as the social " glue " that is a focal point/person that binds the group , they are looking for a guy that has that same level of social reverence . <p> I believe that 's where I fall short with the 8+ scale . I 'm a bit too " loner " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too undefinable , thus making me a riskier prospect for them , even though I may be better looking than their other choices , or as good looking as their better choices . <p> How did you respond to the text that she said she was into another guy ? <p> Why did you buy her a drink ? <p> You should have told her you were into a girl too and sent her a pic of a hot ass girl asking her opinion . <p> I did n't reply to her text when she said she was into another guy , I toyed with the idea of sending her something along the lines of " your loss " , or " okay , but why play all the little games with me " .... But basically I thought that not replying at all is the best course of action , acknowledging her at all would be kind of a " beta " move , or at least make it look like a care a bunch and had my " feelings hurt . " Although I do like your idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll take mental note of that for the future . <p> As far as why did I buy her a drink , believe it or not or beta or not , this is actually a pretty consistent move that I pull , although it may fly directly against PUA dogma . I never buy a chick a drink if she straight up asks me to buy her one , or if I feel like she is just " fishing " for a guy to buy her a drink . The short answer of why I buy girls drinks is because I believe it develops rapport and allows me to isolate them and hook them into conversation , guys around here generally do n't have good game , but they are pirhannas when it comes to the hot girls at the bar , getting a girl a drink , getting them into isolation immediately , and hooking them into conversation is very important . <p> Specifically though I bought the shorty from the story a drink , because it was my way of isolating her from her group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth across from the bar . Buying her a drink enabled me to get her one on one at the bar while we were waiting to get our drinks and after we got them , otherwise there is a good chance she would have rejoined her group . <p> This girl sounds insane and extremely self-absorbed , i sometimes come across these kind of girls , their behaviour is unpredictable and their intentions are never clear , even to themselves probably . Usually it starts off as a very positive interaction that you think will lead to success then suddenly there is a point when you realise she 's just not quite 100% " there " mentally and it feels like you 're communicating with a non-human <p> It does n't happen to me anymore , I just remind myself that it 's really my brain tricking me , and that until I have sex with her NOTHING matters . Got her number ? Does n't matter . Hung out with her all night ? Does n't matter . Just made out with her ? Does n't matter . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember a player friend telling me about a girl he met . Cliff notes , met her at a bar , hung out all night , and at the end of the night she blew him . Next day he tries to text her , and he gets a similar text to the one posted above saying how she was into another guy . <p> Whenever I feel myself catching feelings , I think about that incident . It 's just the way things are now . Maybe 30 years ago , getting a girls number meant something , but today it 's not until I 've banged her several times ( preferably raw ) where I decide she 's officially been converted over . <p> 1 . Treat an 8 like a 5 2 . AGFTB Always go for the bang until she does a serious serious no ... the higher quality the girl the less chance you get a second shot 3 . Why building up social circle game in America is important if you are n't mad flush with cash , looks , or fame <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I recently had a girl on a string , saying how much she misses me , I made out with her and slept over at her place but never banged because she was on her period . Flash forward to now I 'm back in town after being away and she wo n't even reply to a text I send . And mind you I 've banged multiple other girls since this and it still hurts me . It seems like for us it 's all about what we " ca n't have " that upsets us . It 's something I struggle with as I try to get better . <p> IMO this is one of the major problems with the US in that in general there just are n't enough 7+s around to enable you to effectively ' play the field . ' You have to seriously drop your standards and/or develope top-tier game to work the best girls . So the average beta gets caught up in one girl who ' stands out ' from the rest . That 's what I did at least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this as the post shows . Whereas in EE I never even think about it - there 's always another option around the corner . <p> If you had tons of these types of girls hanging around you ( like she does with guys apparently ) you probably would n't even give her a second thought other than to just say email protected I missed one . ' <p> In any event , do n't get too bummed out , happens to everyone , esp back home in the US I think , and you need to generally stop yourself from over-investing too early . And although it sounds easy to say , ' not giving a sh*t ' is a great counterbalance to investing too much emotional time and energy into one girl . <p> i do n't  know how old you are but i think after a while , time just has a way of working on you to fix this issue . <p> no matter how hot , no matter how cool , they are just girls and will always act like girls . eventually once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe loved and lost again - you realize that there is always another woman around the corner . <p> and once you feel like that , they become commodities . <p> I like this definition of commodity : <p> " 1 . A basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type . Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services . The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly , but it is essentially uniform across producers . When they are traded on an exchange , commodities must also meet specified minimum standards , also known as a basis grade .

It really is n't worth feeling upset about , because it really ai n't shit . <p> After some hard months shortly after getting into the game , I landed a date with a very cute girl . She was very fun to hang out with . I do n't want to invest in describing her too much as I do n't want to dwell on the past , as I 've been through this with myself before , and although I am over it , I 'm on a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . End of the night , peak state for me , met and escalated with dance floor game , short kiss , number . <p> Met her on campus half a week later to hang out . Instantly we get along well , within minutes she initiates touching me and bumping into me as we walk . Very enthusiastic and not serious with herself . Naturally I am the same , so it provided for some awesome humor , and improv opportunities . We checked out a poster sale on campus , walked around a bit , and went into an empty classroom . All the while I kept up the touching , teasing , and it was going great . I 'd pull her close to me and play with the tension , and she 'd instantly shy away , almost betraying her seemingly extroverted nature . <p> I was a bit nervous , but eventually pulled her in for a kiss . She 'd get shy and end it early , and look down at my chest as she came close . I made sure to end some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the last bus from campus , so I said bye and we agreed to hang out again soon . <p> I was on a high from this date and combined with some other factors , two nights later I had my first ever one night stand pull from a club . Some blonde that did n't want to tell me her name . She initiated the pull , although it would have never happened unless I had some solid dance game combined with approaching with intent . <p> I met her for the second day the following week after our first . I drove to campus this time so I had the car . I took us bowling , to which I lost , twice , and then we played pool , and I lost again . We were having a great time , and she was very touchy , although we had n't done more than light kissing yet . Afterwards I took her to this waterfall trail nearby . It was late at night , and I had parked at a very low traffic spot outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took her back to the car and we made out . I told her to get in the backseat because the front is awkward . I escalated , and she gave me insane resistance . At one point she looked terrified and pushed me away , and her body language closed off , so I figured she must have had a bad experience somewhere in the past . <p> I backed off , told her I 'm not going to do anything she does n't want to do , that I do n't want her to be uncomfortable . I eased off for a few minutes and started it up again . I had her top off and she had great tits , and she started reaching for my dick . All was good until the expected resistance to take off her pants . I tried easing off , and retrying again , many times . I stopped the makeout and changed the subject . I teased her to the point she was pulling me in for a makeout forcefully as I 'd pull away . I pushed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I retried taking off her pants , it was a no . I thought I could arouse her enough , so I changed some of what I was doing . Started kissing her earlobes , payed more attention to her neck , pulled her hair , put her in doggy and kissed her from behind .. She was aroused , she moaned how she loves it from behind . <p> I was aggressive . I pulled back . I talked to her a bit . Eventually , I knew that at that point in time , I was not going to be able to pass that resistance . So I gave up on the sex , I let her play around a bit more , and then just called it . Fortunately for some reason I did not get blue balls . I still on top of this however , wanted to hang out more with her . I have never really cuddled with someone for an extended period of time and I never had the beta girlfriend experiences most guys at least get in their teen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backseat , almost us both naked , and opening up . I learned a lot about her , and she was very interested in me as well . <p> I came to the conclusion at the time that she did n't want to be used as a fuck buddy anymore . She told me she was looking for something different , maybe a relationship . I told her that I do n't have any expectations , and that I ca n't promise anything ( although in my mind , if there was an exception to getting in a relationship that I 'd make , it would be for this girl ) . <p> I dropped her off , she thanked me for a good time , kissed , night . <p> I was still confused over the whole thing . How could she deny sex when she was that aroused , but still give me a blowjob ? Surely she 's had plenty of sexual experience that she is doing this , but if she 's put out for other guys , why not me ? <p> I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that I had her too high on my mind . Another told me to consider the fact that she might actually really like me , and does n't want to put out early because she does n't want me to pump and dump her . <p> I followed the latter . It sounded great . At the time I did n't think I had one itis , but I did . I was in denial . <p> Still , I knew better than the average beta . I gave radio silence for a few days afterwards , I wanted to know if she 'd initiate conversation with me . After all , if she did really like me that much , she should . <p> Well she did n't . I texted her after the weekend , something witty and humorous . She was responsive , as she had always been to my texts . I tried to plan a hangout , but she was too busy for the two dates I tried that week . <p> I left it for the following week . Valentines day was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any day of the week prior , I did n't want it to be associated with valentine 's day , relationships , love , and all that mainstream stuff that occurs that day of the year . I wanted it to be a no-big-deal hangout like always . <p> She told me she was busy on the wednesday , and I was n't able to ask monday or tuesday , as I was busy those days . <p> So I tried thursday . <p> ' Sorry I do n't  think I can , I 've got an assignment to finish up ' <p> I knew that at this point it was probably done . I started to consider giving it two weeks of silence , then maybe retry then . Meanwhile , I was going to forget about her and try to meet some new girls . <p> So I went out that Thursday night . Club night at my college . Few of my buddies and I went , and night was progressing great . <p> Until I see her . <p> I try to force myself not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the top , but enough to be visible . She was separated from her friends , it seemed . Anyway , in between my approaches I 'd see her talking to some new guy . I thought about approaching her , but I was told by my gut feeling to just approach a new girl . However , it did hurt a bit when I saw her making out with some random dude . And a bit more when I saw her makeout with some other guy 20 minutes later . And a bit more when I saw her walking around solo approaching guys and dancing up on them . <p> I asked my buddy at the moment for advice who was beside me , as I pointed her out and told him briefly my story between me and her . I wanted to ask him specifically because he 's much older than I and he 's had around 80 notches so if there is someone I know personally who can give me wisdom in this situation , it is him . This is what he tells me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grab the next one that walks by . Or wait until that girl comes near you , and grab a girl in front of her ' . <p> Maybe it 's what I needed at the time . Maybe I 'm still unresolved by the whole thing . But I 've been accepting it more and more . I still recall her from time to time , this was just 6 months ago . <p> If you were to ask me what I think of her after all this , I 'd tell you she is adorable , great body , fun personality , and very feminine , at least one on one . <p> But hypergamous . I finally understood what it meant . And I had a hard lesson , although it could have been much worse ( my buddy 's story would rip a beta 's heart into shreds ) . It was a necessary one , as it 's probably the first actual hard lesson I 've had , when it comes to women and sex anyways . I needed to be much more alpha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she does n't have that alpha in her life , she is going to be out there looking for one . <p> I know I will get to that level of game with some time . <p> After writing this , its ironic I say I did n't want to describe her too much because I did n't want to dwell in the past , and look what I end up reflecting upon . <p> ( 09-09-2013 04:15 PM ) OGNorCal707 Wrote : This may sound a bit melodramatic , but I had some reaffirming things that occurred yesterday after writing up this post , that just showed me how chasing women , struggling with women , getting rejected by women , is really a super insignificant thing that in the grand scheme of things should n't affect us at all .

Went on a date a few months ago from a day game pick up . Good connection on the first date . Heavy make out in the car and her tits out at the end of date 1 . She had to wake up early to help her grandma move the next morning supposedly , my cynical side says she went to see another guy later that night ! No texts after that date . I thought date 2 I would have it in the bag . <p> I was immediately furious at myself as the car door closed for not pushing much harder for the bang ( drinks at my place , get so many shots she could n't drive etc ... ) and did not know why right away . Reason came to me quickly which is simple , most American girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to almost always get her the first night or it means shit especially in CA . <p> Some guys see having to go on 2 , 3 , 4 dates with a girl in other more conservative countries as a huge downside . If I was in a foreign country for 2 months or so I would have no problem with that . At least knowing if you stick with it for a few dates and enjoy partying and going out with a girl that is attractive sounds fun and somewhat relaxing to know you will get the bang sooner or later . Having that shot clock pressure to do it the first meeting is thrilling , but also taxing as I see the girl as someone I need to take down , bag , and tag before I can even THINK about enjoying her company in America . <p> Good post .

I thought I would seal the deal with her on several occasions but never could . I convinced myself she was a good girl and started courting her . I started paying for dates , I texted all the time , I dropped things I was doing to make plans with her , I imagined going on trips and stuff ... All for a girl I had only kissed . I even slept with her without banging .... I finally had a melt down and gave her an ultimatum .... Jesus that was embarrassing . <p> It sucks , but you learn from it . Do n't put pussy on a pedestal ( and especially a pussy you 've never poked ) . I even designed and made up a poster for my apartment . <p> Also , I 'd like to point out that Japanese women at the higher end of the scale share almost all of the bad qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-obsessed , flaky , you name it . I posit that American women are not inherently different or worse than women in other countries , but rather they have an inflated sense of their own sexual market value . In other words , an American 6 thinks she 's an 8 and acts as such . I blame misguided feminist ideals and maybe social media to some extent . What do we think ?

When I got home that night I told my father what the professor had said ( my father was also into politics ) , and I was in shock when my father agreed with the Professor . <p> My father said that when you have an " effective " leader in charge , a facist goverment can make tough discissions almost spontaneous , unlike a Democracy that can get boggled down in bullshit .

That 's why utopias fail--because , given unchecked power , humans will be humans and abuse that power . <p> The reason why it works with CEOs is because there is competition and limit to their power . A good CEO has to navigate company politics but also do good and create more value in his company . If his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company itself will fall . A dictator has automatic power over every issue in the entire country , with no legitimate competition to check his power . <p> I am unabashedly anti-democracy , and believe that for anything larger than a medium-sized city , monarchy is the best form of government , in the end . History shows us that it is , indeed , the government-type that has the most permanence . Ideally , governments should be structured so that they are as local as possible , so that you do n't end up with asinine policies which benefit one small minority being foisted off on an entire population of millions . A man has a chance to actually see and know his town or county officials , his circumstances do n't matter a whit to committees and legislative bodies 2,000 miles away . In the Middle Ages , something like this was the norm . The king ruled , and could get things done when they needed to get done , but he was limited in his ability to be a tyrant ( as we think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the government of their territories and were very protective of their rights against encroachment by the central government . This effectively prevented police states . Of course , because communications were so slow and difficult , and travel took so long , governments of whatever type did n't work as well , but nowadays this would not be an issue . Politicians today are incapable of solid and decisive leadership , because they are elevated at popular whim and can be removed just as quickly . They pander to public opinion , which is usually idiotic , and their own interests lie in getting as high as they can , and profiting as much as they can by their position , for as long as the rules let them . A monarch , on the other hand , is not hindered by the necessity of being popular in the short term ( he only has to prevent people from getting so ticked that they decide to revolt , which is not difficult -revolutions never actually come from " the people , " but from upper middle-class and upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to put on a facade to convince people to vote him into office . Furthermore , he is , humanly speaking , interested in having something to pass on to his children , so it 's in his interests to govern well and wisely , instead of trying to strip the country in the short time he 's in control . Instead of learning politics by convincing uneducated people to vote for him , he is generally taught from the cradle how to rule . <p> There have of course been bad kings as well as good kings , but good kings can be truly great , and I 'm not aware of very many truly " great " presidents or bureaucrats . I am , however , aware of many truly awful elected leaders , many of whom could put an " old fashioned tyrannical king " to shame . <p> Interesting historical note , by the way : in the 1930s , GM and a few other big corporations saw what was going on in Germany and concluded that the US would be much better off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached Gen. Smedley Butler to see if he would be willing to lead a coup . Unfortunately for them , he was not . <p> The US was not intended to be a centralized popular democracy . When the Constitution was drawn up , the territory and population were both much smaller , and state governments had much more ( indeed , ultimate ) control . Unfortunately , with the Civil War , ( " War of Northern Aggression " ) the question of federal or state supremacy was decided by force of arms in favor of the former , and since then states have been little more than bureaucratic divisions , while the federal government has grown into a monstrosity . <p> Most beloved president ever . Put millions of the jobless people to work . Built tons of public works . <p> Can you imagine government hiring muralists and poets to make art in 2013 ?

You 'll notice they 're part of the Lincoln monument , and the main symbol of the US Senate , appearing many places in the Capital . <p> The same idea is expressed in America with phrases like , " United we stand , divided we fall " . <p> " In unity there is strength " . <p> or Ben Franklin 's " Join or Die " used in the Colonial Revolution <p> Plato 's Republic postulates , and most scholars agree , that the most efficient form of government is a benevolent dictator . <p> But as Polybious 's discovery of anacyclosis shows , there is no " best " form of government between Monarchy , Aristocracy , and Democracy.Over time , all governmental systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Tyranny , Aristocracy into Oligarcy , and Democracy into Mob rule .

@@96059339 @259339/ <p> In this we see the conundrum of female hypergamy . Women want ambitious men , a desire which disproportionately leads them to advanced white collar professionals like doctors , lawyers , and financiers . They want men who will become accomplished and can go places later on , factors which will in turn ensure that she and any children she gives birth to will also be able to enjoy a great lifestyle . <p> The problem is that ambition is pricey . The desirable men they want are desirable to all of the other women too , which increases the risk of cheating ( read : she needs to work harder to keep him ) . In addition to this , ambition is time consuming-of all of the advanced white collar professions I listed above , lawyers probably have the most reasonable hours , and their hours ( if we 're talking about big-time NYC corporate law , which is where most of the " prestige " is ) still are n't all that reasonable .

There is a generally negative tone to them overall-the wives and girlfriends do n't seem very satisfied with the trials that their choice to be with a doctor has put on them . <p> Quote:Married 25 years to a doctor . My advice : do n't do it , unless your spouse is going to be a dermatologist or a radiologist . Being married to a doctor is much worse than being a single parent-- I call it " single parent plus " , because not only do you have to raise the kids alone , but you also have to take care of a cranky and unappreciative spouse who shows up all hours of the day and night wanting food , clean clothes and sex on demand . No amount of positive attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after spending years taking care of absolutely everything in your lives , including home , children , automobiles , finances , repairs , social events , church , school , sports , and relationships with both your families . <p> And it 's really not good for your kids , growing up with such a lopsided relationship as their primary role model . Plus I think doctors are often meaner to their kids than other parents , because their king-of-the-hill profession allows them to be demanding , impatient and autocratic all day at work , and gradually they become exactly the same way at home with you and the kids . Not to mention the pressure doctors put on their kids to be at the top of the class at all times , just like they were . <p> That said , if you are already married , here 's my advice : 1 . Know everything about your assets and finances . Insist that all assets ( home , cars , bank accts , stock accts , etc ) are held jointly--this means you must be listed as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no joke that doctors often trade in their old spouses for newer models--they really do , and they often walk away with almost everything you both have worked for . Do n't expect to get alimony or sympathy--it wo n't happen . I have seen it too many times and it is truly heartbreaking . So be prepared , even if you think it ca n't happen to you . 2 . Pay for help . Even if you are lucky enough to have family around . Being married to a doctor is a long and totally exhausting venture , so do n't even think about mowing the lawn , painting a room or cleaning the house yourself--you 've got to pace yourself or you will never survive . I know lots of doctors wives who even have drivers to take their kids to the endless lessons/games etc . Sounds ridiculous , but trust me , you need all the help you can get . 3 . Once your kids are school aged , take long and exotic vacations . Try to take at least 10 days every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to plan , pack and execute these big trips all by yourself , they will be just about the only times your family will spend together , and about the only " perk " you will get from the big doctor paycheck . Stay in huge suites in fabulous hotels and book all the side trips and activities . 4 . Stop waiting for your doctor spouse to participate and just raise your children the best you can . They will grow up faster than you can imagine , and they will love you wholeheartedly for always being the one who was there through thick and thin , and being the one who made time for them . It is not your job to beg , wheedle or nag your spouse into being a good parent . If they truly care , they will make time to be with the kids . If not , they will put their golf/tennis game , sports on TV , or million other hobbies first and just show up occasionally to do " filet of parenting " --that is , the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's theirs , and they will reap exactly what they sow . 5 . Do n't have a lot of kids . " Single parenting plus " gets geometrically harder the more kids you have . <p> Quote:if you 're just dating a doctor or med student , GET OUT NOW . It only gets worse .

( lol ) His wife somehow forgave him and now they 're building a email protected house north of SF . He 's still hitting the receptionist and looking for more ... he 'll eventually find his way to this site . <p> Yet girls perk up when they find out what I do . I laugh inside , knowing that any serious relationship I 've attempted in the past falls to pieces for a number of reasons , but mostly because there 's simply no time for that horseshit . That 's why chefs typically date girls in the restaurant industry who understand the long hours . Hostesses are a beautiful thing : their job is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad either , especially since most of them in L.A. are aspiring actresses and models . <p> I 'm not sure what their fantasy is ... that I come home after 16 hours of handling garlic , cheese , and fish , and dealing with fuckwit high maintenance customers and clueless floor staff , and that I 'll magically be in the mood to whip up some coq au vin over a candlelit dinner and swoop her off to bed ... Chefs are probably the worst partners to choose ( and also probably the worst career choice for anyone serious about PUA lifestyle . ) <p> This is not a reflection on all doctors . It comes down to an alpha/beta thing . <p> I guarantee you the women who complain are married to betas . <p> I know many doctors , and most of them have shitty lives , but not because they are in the medical field , but because they lack the balls and motivation to make a change in their lives . <p> I know an eye surgeon who works no more than 4 days a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 6 other doctors working for him , and he takes a 3 month vacation every year . I am guessing he clears well over a million a year . <p> I know a couple more dentists , a dermatologist , and a radiologist who have all done the same thing . <p> Its a universal truth , no matter how prestigious your professional field , if you do n't have the balls to be creative and create value and profit from other people 's work , you will be the bitch . You will have shitty hours and earn only a salary . <p> Quote:Women are never happy . I am a Lawyer and have heard all the same shit from my wife .

Nothing is worse than excommunication . <p> Of course , on the other hand , to be looked up to by the herd is the greatest possible reward a woman can receive .

Some beef that 's now four years old ?

Because ... despite what we 're told every day through the media , women are not only incapable of greatness , but if they were , they would choose not to be great .

@@96059340 @259340/ <p> I 'm a language nerd , I do this shit for fun , I 'm currently working on Spanish and Japanese , so I should make mention of the fact that I LOVE learning new languages and I am dead set on being able to speak at least half a dozen languages fluently within the next 5-10 years or so , so doing this sort of thing is something I do n't really consider " work " , it 's fun , I like it . <p> However , I 'm anal retentive about not wasting time on a language that will turn out to be less useful than another one I could be learning , which is why Chinese is n't high on my list ( I do n't plan on visiting China , and a lot of people in HK speak English ) nor are the Scandinavian languages ( everyone there speaks fluent English ) . <p> However , for quite a while I 've had my eye on Eastern Europe , and now with all the activity on the forum recently even more so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Czech Republic , Latvia and Estonia ... and maybe the Balkans . Just Eastern Europe in general , in other words . <p> Now , this presents quite a problem as far as languages go because Romanian is a romance language and not in the least bit related to the languages of any other surrounding countries except Moldova , which shares its language with Romania ( i.e. Moldovan = Romanian , same thing even though the Moldovans do n't like to admit it ) . Most other Eastern European countries use a Slavic language : Czech , Russian , Ukranian , Estonian . I know that a lot of Ukrainians understand Russian , but I had heard before that they HATED speaking it because it 's thought of as " the language of the oppressor Russia " , though I just read recently that people in Kiev use Russian more than they use Ukrainian , sooo .... ? ?

It 's mutually-intelligible with Macedonian ( many of the Balkan languages are mutually-intelligible ) . <p> Ah , thank you , that was VERY helpful , and I knew that Estonian was Finno-Ugric , I just had a brain fart--I believe Hungarian is also vaguely related to Finnish and therefore Estonian , as well . <p> Is English really that common in the Baltics ?

Baltics ( Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania ) : English is widely-spoken here . I think Estonia has the best English-language competency out of any CEE country . I do n't remember having any problems in Latvia or Lithuania but I also do n't remember being impressed . Bulgaria : I did n't have any problems but there were a few times that I had to pantomime and use hand gestures to communicate . <p> Actually , come to think of it , I had more problems with English in Spain when I was there in December than I did in any of the CEE countries . <p> If you know Serbian , you 'd basically be able to get around all of the Balkans , right ?

Maybe you 'd get some weird looks in croatia , but it does n't mater since you 're a foreigner . You can speak serbian to people above 30 in macedonia and slovenia and they 'll understand since they learned it in school during the yugoslav era .

In Poland I had problems communicating for sure ( I do n't speak any Slavic languages ) . <p> I do n't know anything about the Balkans . <p> At the same time , if you learn something like Romanian , which is similar in some ways to Romance languages , you could distinguish yourself from the throngs of sex tourists who come . Girls def put out more to guys who make an effort to get familiar with their language and culture . A big issue for a lot of girls is the stigma of dating a foreigner .

Contrary to them , Russian gives you access to 20 countries with beautiful ladies most of whom does n't speak English good enough , and approximately half of those countries you do n't need visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm gon na say Russian is probably the best idea for Eastern Europe ( taken as an average ) . <p> However , it REALLY depends on the country . Try speaking Russian in Czech Republic - not the best approach ( might as well start singing everyone 's favorite communist anthem ) . I guess CZ is n't really Eastern Europe , but I see way too many similarities in culture and I 'm not going to let them get away with " We 're CENTRAL EUROPEAN " no matter how clean their trams are . <p> Although to be honest , if you speak English and can slow it down and enunciate for the girls to understand , it could easily be a superior language in most Eastern European countries , where the literacy rate is so high and the level of English is high as well . This way , you 're going to get more or less the educated girls who at least speak some rudimentary English . Up until very recently , this was even a " super effective " maneuver in Mother Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia is for Russians " mantra . <p> As for the rest of E-Europe , I think you 'd have more success as a debonair foreign English-speaking " businessman " than an " enthusiastic backpacker well versed in cyrillic " any day of the week . <p> " East of the curtain , Sex is for certain " <p> My only tip for Russia : skip Moscow , head to St. Petersburg . It 's like triple distilling everything : 90% less douche , 90% less skinheads , 90% less headaches . It 's much cheaper too . Day game in St. Peter is epic , and the nightlife makes Vegas ' look pathetic . Go to a good hotel , befriend all the bartenders at 8PM and just hang around an hour or so . However , hardly anything about western/asian game applies in Russia - be alert , and be careful . Never show a thug/skinhead that you are afraid . Do n't start the fight , but do n't show them you are afraid even if you are . They are dogs and can smell fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Peter would be during the " white nights " during the summer - imagine a 24/7 party without the tourists ( most tourists are already scared of Russia , so this is less of a problem ) . Also the girls think its really romantic . Not to mention everyone ( including families ) comes out to chill during white nights , so it 's super safe . <p> I 'm new to the forums , this looks like a goldmine of a community and I hope to give/take a lot .

The authors also stated that using circumcision as a means to reduce HIV infection would , on a national level , require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit. 128 <p> As a result of these findings , the WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) stated that male circumcision is an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention but should be carried out by well trained medical professionals and under conditions of informed consent. 912920 Both the WHO and CDC indicate that circumcision may not reduce HIV transmission from men to women , and that data are lacking for the transmission rate of men who engage in anal sex with a female partner. 129130 The joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from HIV and should never replace known methods of HIV prevention .

But going out with a friend who is not down for gaming will just mean he will follow you around as you try to game because he 'll have nothing else to do and that will only scare away pussy for you . <p> When i was under 18 , i used to go to lots of under18s parties in London solo . Most of my friends were always broke and stayed around the hood , but because i used to love chicks whining on me so much , i used to go out solo and usually had a great time and never got into any trouble . <p> However the types of places that i usually like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wannabe thugs . So if you get into a fight in one of these places , you 're in serious trouble . <p> I like to day game solo but night time , i like to run with a bunch of good-bad boys type of friends . <p> I never imagined Houston as the quiet , introverted type for some reason . That 's another thing I might want to chat with you about some time , game tailored for more introverted dudes who are n't yappy like those RSD guys . Anyway , I 've gone out a couple times by myself . I had those same butterflies in the stomach feeling like you mentioned . Feeling like I was about to give a speech or something . The main problem for me though was that not having a buddy there to chat with and laugh about shit makes me withdraw into my head . Having that conversation and laughs on the way in gets your social energy up . When you 're feeling fun and sociable it 's so much easier to open conversations . That 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about having no social proof . A few months back I went to a bar where a friend was supposed to meet me but was running way late . So I was hanging there for about an hour by myself . I was talking to a set of 3 girls and one asked me where were my friends . I just told them the truth . I said , " My buddy is on his way here . " They did n't look at me strange or anything . I guess I could use that in the future . <p> How comfortable you feel though depends a lot on the setup of the venue . It has to have a setup that encourages mingling . If there 's a lot of booths and tables and few seats at the bar , then not the ideal place to be . I 'd prefer to be somewhere more on the crowded side . Otherwise girls might be more likely to notice that you are that guy standing there for the last hour alone . That 's all it takes to be labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of targets around , I sometimes just do n't know what to do with myself . So I start fiddling with my phone or something . I do n't want to just stare into space or be looking around too much . If there 's a TV with a game on I can at least pretend to be watching it until some targets are nearby . <p> I go out solo every once in a while , but usually to bars where I 've worked with the tenders and then I post up and let the rum flow . I will score , but the variance in quality tells me I need to work on my lower-bounds . <p> A good way to get into going out solo in a fun way is to memorize some " games " where you 're wagering drinks by heart - I really do n't use routines , but I like to have a few funny crowd-pleasers up my sleeve . I 'll hustle a girl for a drink or beer , it gets her laughing and you can use it on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved " , you can bounce from group to group without pressure or worrying about getting bored . <p> This is one hustle that 's kinda stupid , but it 's won me many pints : <p> Wager for a beer/drink , and the wager is you bet she ca n't repeat the same moves you 're about to make . Remind her it 's important to follow you closely . Has to be done with a glass , bottles wo n't do . Save it until 15-20 minutes into the interaction when already thinks you 're cool and you guys are having a decent convo . <p> Do everything slowly so she has a chance to follow . <p> I place my hands on the table/bar , one on each side of my glass , so does she . I move one hand forward , then back , then the other forward , then back . She 's going to think it 's a " mirroring " challenge . I take a sip from my drink , so does she . I DO N'T SWALLOW , I just keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she swallows . <p> Then I repeat the hand movement as before . So does she , wondering why I am so retarded . Then I take my glass , raise it to my mouth as if to toast ( she HAS to look you in the eyes while doing this ) . She does the same . <p> Then I spit the sip out back into my glass , and she cracks up . <p> I know some guys are going to think it 's retarded , and it is , but the girl always laugh at how silly it is , because of course , she swallowed her sip so she ca n't spit the beer out . Drink is won , she 's invested , she thinks you 're cheeky , so now it 's up to you if you take it to the next level of attraction . <p> Naturally , if you can pull off the right ironic tone , you can say : " Glad to see you 're a girl who does n't spit , but swallows , " for which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the girl had an ironic sense of humor and how seriously she takes herself . <p> Going solo for me is the only way I can get practice on my game regularly . If I always have to wait for my buddies to feel like it to go out , I 'll never get consistent . <p> Good thing for me is it 's a major money saver . The nightclubs where I 'm at are all bottle service oriented , so when I go out in groups , we usually each pitch in for bottles of whiskey at the club . When I go out alone , it 's at most one beer per venue . Most of the time , I do n't buy any drinks at all , so I only have to pay for my cab fare for the entire night . When I approach a group , if they 're receptive and see I do n't have a drink they 'll always get me a glass and pour me one from their bottle . I 'll be gaming at that group , mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " trips to the bathroom " . <p> I go out solo about 90% of the time . As Houstons post illustrates it does take determination and persistence to be able to do it comfortably and successfully-you have to want to succeed very badly . Of course , this is true of any important endeavor in life- effort and passion are requisites . Inner Game is critical-you have to be solid and confident . Women are amazingly perceptive in sniffing out weakness in men-if you are tired , distracted , questioning your worth or just not feeling it on a particular night they somehow pick up on this and you 're going to have rough sledding . One technique i have found invaluable is to have a mental model of the type of persona you want to exhibit and to refer to it frequently . My particular model is Daniel Craig as James Bond.His portrayal of Bond 's personality is very close to my natural persona- smirky , assholish , teasing , introspective , sophisticated , somewhat cold , not very talkative , tough when necessary- so it works for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not very approachable-you walk around looking like you want to kick somebody in the balls . " ( heh ) Some girls are very attracted to this type of guy , others not . So be it-you ca n't appeal to every girl . My choice of model persona certainly is not for most -use one appropriate for your personality and aspirations . It 's just a technique to help you stay " in state " as the pua 's say- when you are solo its very easy to get trapped in your own head and start generating negative scenarios . In nightclubs and " party " type bars it 's important to not spend a long time just standing around-this will start to give off the creeper vibe . Spend ten minutes getting a drink and assessing the situation and the try to approach . Even talk to guys if you have to . This is less critical at upscale lounges and events , though , and at large clubs where you can move form room to room . If you feel like you 're getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , just leave . You can always come later when the crowd has turned over and try again . Here 's my response to " Where are your friends " Me : " I do n't have any friends " while smirking and bertstaring her into submission . ( Got this from Roissy ) Works great . This question does n't get asked as much as you might imagine however . <p> Speakeasy - get at me if you have questions about being introverted . You would be shocked if you could see me at 18 . Completely different person . I talk but do n't ramble to much . I 'll always be a naturally quiet guy , but I also know that close mouths do n't get fed ... or get their dicks sucked <p> If anyone has any questions , ask them in here so everyone can get the information . <p> Damn Houston , I remember months ago when you first started posting on the forum , you have really come a long way in a short time . Now you 're GIVING the advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out solo last night , I went to 3 different places and had a great time . Granted I knew some of the background people when I showed up but , that 's how it starts . <p> ElJefe , I like that gimmick . I 'm doing it . I can totally pull off the spit/swallow comment <p> What are some good ways to approach groups at college parties ? Does the same rules apply ? For example if I were to go to a small private college party by sneaking in with some people I do n't know .. ( I 'd be by myself ) . <p> I 've done this a couple of times but trying different methods - not having a lot of success . ( Have n't read Bang though so idk ) <p> Congrats man . I 'm still working on my solo game , but I guess I 'm ok with it nowadays , but there are days that I fall back into my old patterns and fear takes over . But there are days I can do it without any problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have to say that I only started going out alone ( on some few occasions ) while away from my home turf . Boy , was that an testicle-enhancing experience ! <p> What are your taken on venue selection while going solo ? My guess is that bars and lounges are harder than clubs , where you can roam around more . What you say ? <p> ( 01-28-2012 11:05 PM ) misterstir Wrote : Unless your friend is single and into game , he will only slow you down . 99% of us do n't have friends into game , especially when we start out .

Great comment . <p> So true . Go out with your boys to drink beer and watch football . If you want to pull go solo . <p> Most of my friends are stage10 cockblocks and white knights .

You 'll lose your nervousness because there 's nothing weird about sitting at the bar and watching TV . <p> Then , when you roll solo on the weekend , get there early enough to stake out a high-traffic spot to hang out . It 'll be exactly the same , except you just open the people around you . That 's what I 've done the last week to get back into rolling solo . <p> I understand you guys completely . I have about 70 or so guys friends , mostly from high school and university who I could call up to hang out with . But of all of them , only 1 or 2 would I club with . In fact my best friend I would n't club with because I am certain he 'd cock block me without even knowing it . Only those 2 could possibly help me , and even at that I 'm most succesful when I help them get their girl and then go find my own 
@@96059345 @259345/ <p> To launch my new book , Stripclub Bible , Ive chosen this week to give you gents an excerpt from it . Never has there been a system designed to pick up strippers like the one I have put together . Strippers can be the most elusive girls to pickup , IF you do n't  have the proper game to do so . Without further ado , I present 5 Commandments of Stripclub Game . <h> 5 . Do n't  Drink <p> " What Christian ? ! You always talk about drinking while gaming " <p> You 're correct in thinking that , but I 'm not talking about Club Game right now ; I 'm talking about Stripclub Game , which is a different animal . From your energy , to how you conduct yourself , its a completely different ballgame . Thus , No Drinking and here 's why : <p> -First off , when dealing with professional cash makers , the last thing you need to be is buzzed . It affects your decision-making and will cause you to make amature mistakes , that you would n't normally make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other foolish try-hard moves that Ive seen a thousand times . Would you go into a business meeting buzzed or drunk ? More than likely not , if making money is a priority in your life . The same goes for pulling strippers : they are EXPERTS at pulling money out of men , so how do you combat that and turn the tables ? By not succumbing to what the average fucker does : drinking . <p> -Youre not going to be at the strip club long , so there 's no point in drinking and then turning around an hour later and driving buzzed . <p> -Your mental wits being on point is KEY to dealing with strippers . They are judging you from the moment you walk in from how you carry yourself , to what you say and where you sit . " Is this another john , or a playboy that I 'd like to fuck ? " , the strippers are thinking . How do I know ? Because they 've told me that exact phrase . <p> -Itll make your game that much sharper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nada . Leave the booze for that date with the Starbucks Slut , or when you 're in the club with your buddies . Stripclub Game = Zero alcohol . You heard it here first . Instead , order a soda water with lime , a Red Bull , or even a cup of coffee . <p> -The exception to this rule , is if you have a strip club On-Lock , to the point where they give you a comped bottle . In Vegas strip clubs , Im comped bottles , which is fine for treating my clients , however , it can take a while to get a strip club On-Lock and generally , a lot of strip clubs do n't  do bottle service . Even then , I 'm not a big fan of drinking the bottle myself . Let your friends and the strippers drink the bottle ; its at no cost to you and while theyll be stumbling around and trying to spit game , you 'll be razor-sharp and pulling the hottest strippers there . <h> 4 . Sniper vs . Shotgun Style Game <p> A nightclub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , is different from a stripclub . Stripclubs tend to be lounge style , with music obviously , but , instead of pounding Tiesto , they have a slow T-Pain song on , cats are sitting down and not fist pumping , and there 's a sensual vibe , instead of a high energy party vibe . <p> These major differences means that your game style will be vastly different . While in the club , you may roam around dropping flirtatious remarks to twenty different hotties , combined with a high energy fun dynamic , but in the stripclub , you 'll be like a sniper . Cool , calm , collected and picking your target with precision . Also , you 'll be getting in and out quicker , while at the club you may spend hours working different girls . <p> Stripclub Game is a calculated style and patience is a virtue . The strippers have work to do , so they 're not going to walk out with you after 5 minutes of conversation . Instead , due to 99% of stripclubs having the " Ca n't leave with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until AFTER her shift is over and then she will meet up with you . While both styles are fun in their own right , learning the difference and becoming great at both , will only add to your pussy coffers even more . <h> 3 . Do n't  Buy Lap Dances , But You Can Buy Them A Drink <p> The Number 1 question I get regarding stripclubs , is " Should I spend money on the stripper ? " and the answer is yes AND no . <p> You should not buy lap dances , private dances , or any type of physical interaction between the two of you . Zero . You are not a john and the moment you spend money on them , you become a customer . Listen closely : I have NEVER pulled a stripper having spent money on her , but I have pulled many many strippers utilizing a technique , which I 'll explain in a bit . <p> *Note : Can a cat go to a stripclub , spend hundreds or thousands on a girl and potentially fuck her later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but you 're a Player , not a Played . You 're a Casanova-In-Training , not a putz who is reliant on spending money to get to that pussy . Add to this , that no matter what my friend , you 'll never spend more than another customer she 's had . I 've had clients spend literally thousands ( $15,000+ ) on lap dances and private dances and get NOTHING in return ; while I sat back , used sniper game and wound up meeting up with the stripper later , much to the chagrin of my client(s). - Do n't  be a schmuck to fuck . <p> What can you spend money on ? Drinks for the strippers . Now think about this for a second , you go to a club , meet a hottie and buy a couple of shots for the two of you , no big deal right ? Right . Now in a stripclub , there is a certain etiquette and that includes spending SOME money in order to be there . When you see a stripper that strikes your fancy and one who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may order a non-alcoholic drink for yourself and casually ask her what she wants to drink . This does NOT make you a schmuck getting her drunk , its casual , non-expensive stripclub etiquette combined with being an effortless playboy . <p> Buying her a drink accomplishes a couple of important aspects of gaming in a stripclub : <p> 1 . The management and stripper pressure on you to buy lap dances etc , diminishes 100 fold . You are now a paying customer , not a frog on a log getting your eye candy feel . <p> 2 . Shows her you 're not a cheapfuckinskate and you can hold your own while out and about , but also , she can use the excuse to her boss that you " were buying her drinks , so she talked for a bit with you " . This is key : she HAS to make money , that 's her job . If you 're buying her a drink or two , she can chill with you while you spit game , without putting lap dance pressure on you . The burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop the mask , that strippers use so well . <h> 2 . Roll Solo <p> Afraid of rolling solo ? Cut that fear out of your life immediately . Stripclubs are perfect venues to roll solo to and in fact , it works best when you do . Rolling to a nightclub solo may be intimidating for some of you , however , if you want to get in some practice , start with stripclubs . At stripclubs , its quite common to see a cat by themselves , so its natural and almost expected . <p> here 's why you want to roll solo to a stripclub and why it works best for picking up a stripper : <p> 1 . Rolling solo with the proper body language + swagger = HIGH DHV ( Demonstration of High Value ) . Nothing screams confident , like a man who can walk into a venue of ANY kind and command the room while being by himself . This makes you a non-needy man and one who is not dependent on peers to have a good time . <p> The key here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In The Moment and Going Somewhere . <p> For example : <p> -Its 9pm on a Saturday night. - You worked out , got dressed , had dinner and are killing an hour of time , before going to a birthday party . You are at the stripclub doing some business on your phone ( not making calls , but texting , making notes etc ) . You expect to be leaving in an hour or less to go meet your friends at the birthday party . So you have a strong purpose and are not just idling sitting at the stripclub with nothing going on in your life and nowhere to go . <p> This automatically gives your physical body a PURPOSE , which controls your body language , your speech and how confident you feel . Think for a moment of those times where you had a hot date lined up for the night <p> How did you feel ? You went to the gym and on the way home stopped to pick up a steak at the grocery story . When you walked into Piggly Fucking Wiggly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confidence in your body language and speech . You smiled at the cute cashier and flirted a bit . You looked at the pimply bagger boy and actually thanked him for bagging your steak separate from the deodorant you also bought . You were a magnet . People were drawn to look at you and acknowledge your presence . Why ? Because you had a PURPOSE in where you were going and what you were doing . <p> Now back to the stripclub <p> You 're sitting in a chair away from the main stage and are handling some business on your phone . Your body language is casual , collected , non-needy and you 're not staring at every stripper like you 've never seen tits , ass and a snatch before . You are a man of VALUE and YOU are the prize . You notice a particular stripper who catches your eye and one you 'd like to bang . You motion her over casually and instruct her to sit down in the chair beside you . NOT on you right away , but beside you . <p> She sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct her to get you a Red Bull and the stripper whatever she would like . You casually drop a bill on the cocktail platter and finish up some business with your phone while half-listening to the stripper babble . Now think about that frame for a second ? YOU are in charge the entire time . YOU decide when you the conversation really starts and how its going to go . <p> If there 's one thing strippers love and I do mean love , its a dominant male leader . Fact : They tend to be lost little souls and they are very drawn to alpha men . <p> If you 're with a bumbling friend who has n't  been out of the house in a month due to his ball and chain , then odds are , he s going to do everything possibly wrong . Roll solo and reap the benefits . <p> Also , do n't  bring your guy friends around the strip clubs you got On-Lock . These are YOUR Pussy Paradises and trust me , one stupid move from your friend , can tarnish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Move Fast And GTFO <p> Part of building massive DHV with strippers is that your night consists of stopping in at a stripclub , but the totality of your night is NOT the stripclub . Its like a great appetizer , but not the main course . here 's why : <p> -Youre a busy playboy and you 're not going to sit in a stripclub for 4 hours staring at hot naked chicks for no reason . Your SOLE reason for going to a stripclub is to meet some strippers , target one of them , build DHV + Comfort and set up logistics . <p> -Your composure , as I mentioned before , is being calm , cool and collected . Imagine the smoothest player you 've seen in action or an imaginary player such as James Bond or Hank Moody . What about them is smooth ? They are Casual , Chill , Non-Needy and always On-The Go . Now of course , these two characters are fictional , but that in no way takes away from their game styles being effective in the real world . So while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , your composure is not hurried . <p> -Walk in , purvey the spot , pick a seat ( away from the main stage . I break this down exactly in my book ) , casually check out the strippers and decide on who your target is , motion her over casually ( there 's a reason why you motion her over ) , order yourself a non-alcoholic drink and her a drink of her choice , build DHV + Comfort , get her phone number and lastly set up logistics for you to meet up after her shift is over . <p> In conclusion , Stripclub Game can be very rewarding : <p> -Not 21 years old ? Does n't  matter . Most stripclubs in the US are 18+ establishments . Some are 18+ to get in and 21+ to drink . <p> -It can be as cheap as day game . Cover is always negotiable and usually free your first time . Once you develop a good rapport with management , you 'll be comped every time . <p> -Youre not drinking alcohol , so you 're saving money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> -Stripper game can be more rewarding , due to the elusive challenge of strippers , as well as the most sexually satisfying lays , because strippers , if they are anything , is that they are highly sexual girls . <p> -One of the best ways to get a threesome ? Learn Stripclub Game . <p> -One of the best ways to get a sexy little freak ?

Kind of disappointing , I thought a paid site like Match would have more serious girls than POF/OKC . What have been your experiences ?

I 'm also 6 ' 4 " , decently muscular and white . <p> I 'd like to think that I offer a good mix of badass ( pictures of me hiking , riding my motorcycle , doing manly shit like splitting firewood , hiking etc , pics of my dogs ) and boyfriend/provider ( 30 years old , engineer , own my own home etc ) . This seems to be a winning formula for that site . <p> I do see a lot of the same profiles on okstupid . <p> I 'm guessing the dudes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do as well on match . Just a guess . <p> In the end its just a tool to meet women . You still got to game them , some will bang you the first night , some will try to string you along forever . That 's all . <p> " I 've spent a lot of money on booze , birds and fast cars . The rest I 've squandered " <p> I 've done Match in Chicago and Tampa , and I think it 's is a much better option with higher quality girls than OkCupid or Tinder . That being said , most of my lays have taken 2-5 dates off Match , but if you 're an educated tall white guy with a job you 'll kill it . <p> A couple tips : <p> 1 . Actually take some time to write messages based off their profiles . It 's easy , first line is your introduction with a joke , second line is a comment about travel , third line is a comment about what kind of music you have in common . Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a date . I 'm very selective on who I send messages to - I think I get a response back around 60% of the time , and I convert almost all of those into dates . <p> 2 . If you have good judgement , gamble a little bit with girls who are 5s and 6s from their pics but have potential to be hotter . I 've banged two girls who looked like 6s from their pics and were more like 7.5s-8s in person . They complained how little attention they got on Match , and it 's because of mediocre pictures and poor profiles . This can definitely go bad if you 're a poor judge of potential though . <p> 3 . It 's a must with all girls , but even moreso with Match - establish as much comfort up front on the date as possible . Once you spook the pussy it 's over . <p> 4 . All girls can relate to music , travel , sports , and alcohol . Put those somewhere in your profile and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually fairly forward and girls are trying to meet boyfriends . As long as you 're ok with waiting 2-4 dates , you 'll bang higher quality girls . <p> I 'm in Chicago and I am having far more success on match than I am on okc , plenty of whales and tinder combined . <p> Update your profile often , I do n't know what they do but updates get you views , I only message the ones who visit my page and/or wink , a lot message me first . No lie , every girl I met on match has looked better than her pics . <p> apoclater Wrote:Exchange two more messages then say you want her number and you 've got a date . <p> What 's your line for this move ? <p> I 've had good success on eharmony ( and little on match too now ) with offering my number first : " Would you like to chat more by phone sometime , Suzie ? Let me know , here is my number ####### . Send me a text or something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works and I get a text from them or sometimes they respond with an email and give me their number , asking me to call them . <p> apoclater Wrote:Exchange two more messages then say you want her number and you 've got a date . <p> What 's your line for this move ? <p> I 've had good success on eharmony ( and little on match too now ) with offering my number first : " Would you like to chat more by phone sometime , Suzie ?

" <p> It 's a little less direct , but often works and I get a text from them or sometimes they respond with an email and give me their number , asking me to call them . <p> I find that just offering my number like that rarely works . I usually say " Hey , we should grab a drink sometime and discuss the finer points of ( insert something humorous here , or just something you 've been talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make some plans " . I ca n't even think of a time I 've been denied . Then I 'll send a text that says " Hey , let 's meet at xyz at 8 pm . Sound good ? " . <p> I think I 've been flaked on ONCE on Match . Almost every girl I 've encountered is pretty hungry to meet once you 've texted a bit . <p> ( 09-24-2014 11:01 PM ) Brodiaga Wrote : I tested Match vs OKc with identical messages , profile pics and descriptions . For some reason , the response rate on Match was much lower than on OKc . <p> I find OKCupid is a variety of girls - I primarily get the artsy hipster type . Match is more of the young professional type , a lot of teachers , nurses , and office drones . Might just be the openers you 're using or the type of girls you attract . <p> My conversion ratio on match.com has been off the hook . I like the site because it seems to have a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile on your own terms . ( I 'd post my profile here , but too easily searched and my handle is n't Anonymous123 without reason ) . <p> I 've been off match for quite awhile now , but in the email account I use I still get " you have the most refreshing profile I 've seen , it is like you are the last man that wants to be a man , I 'd love to meet you even if it does n't lead to anything ... " . Guess what : it always leads to something , because I hold the unilateral card on friend zone , and as a last ditch effort telling a bitch she is in friend zone has amazing reverse psychological effects . <p> I kicked the match.com habit as a source of leads ( Glengarry Glen Ross ABC ) , after I read an article by Christian McQueen . The article was about savoring the moment of game . This has lead me to slow down . I do n't need to compete with Soup for notches on the " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formidable competition ) . <p> Note : CMQ spelled this stuff out in writing , which is what I knew in my gut along , but did n't know how to express ( even to myself ) . <p> Bottom line , becoming more aware makes you less dependent on these dating sites . CMQ has a number of articles on this topic . MikeCF gives similar logic on being aware . <p> I gave it a test run just to see what would happen if I slowed down ( read : stop " pipelining " off dating sites ) and just played my own hand at savoring the moment as a man that understands his value . <p> Most of my bangs come off match . Com , about 80% of them . Do n't use it for 18-29 , but rather for older women . They claim they want to settle down , but after I get their number .... They want the D <p> Yes . <p> BUT <p> Do n't hold me me to it UNLESS 1 ) you are in a MAJOR City 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform you use ) 3 ) you are into kinky shit , 3somes , etc. ( meaning - you wo n't really find decent looking ' normal ' single girls on there ) . It 's mainly to fuck some guys GF while he stands there and watches . <p> if you just trying to sleep with a single girl , very few are on there are legit. it 's mainly couples and groups . <p> I 've been meaning to release a guide for it . I basically follow my friend 's advice ( he will write most of the guide ) . <p> I get laid on Match more than any other method ( match : 20 per year , tinder : 10 per year , day game : 5 per year , social circle : 3 per year ) , but I also find myself fighting guilt b/c you go into the date knowing their background , hobbies , etc . It 's a more intimate entrance/connection and I get the feeling that at least 80% of the girls are legit looking for a serious relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make bank , have good pics , background , etc. so I 'm likely more fortunate/successful that most . <p> Other Match.com guys - do you feel guilty ?

I wo n't pretend I always have , by a long shot , but do n't rationalize hurting people just for the convenience and peace of mind . Take full responsibility for deciding to fuck people over . <p> There are crowds upon crowds of easy sluts in the first world who are down to get pounded hard with no strings attached or at least have casual sex and see where it goes .

That 's a different animal completely . 49876 @qwx909876 <p> Yes , you can get laid on the Match.com , I 've gotten the bang in 4 hours . The next record is like 10 hours . Plenty of older bitches wanting to fuck on there . Matter of fact , all of my bangs in the last year were from there . Used that place since I was 17 , gotten at least 26 bitches from there . At least ..... <p> Just make it seem like you 're a fun guy and do n't rush too fast . I have moms sending me nudes and shit . Got a 20 year old from there too . <p> Today , I spam messaged on Match.com . One brazilian broad replied , she liked my vibe , gave her my number , it was going well . I did n't want to sexualize the convo and scare her so I proposed coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a call , said yes , gave me her address . So I went from First Contact to going to her place in 3 hours . She started going hamster on how she never brought someone straight to her home without meeting them . So we met in the parking lot , went to her apartment , tried to escalate but my efforts were futile . Then she made up some BS excuse on having an errand , mentioning how this was going too fast , and I bounced . <p> I do n't have a regular ( as of last week ) so I 'm out of luck on steady pussy . <p> Also , these are all from Match.com <p> TL ; DR - Had 4 bitches , 3 who wanted to bang . 2 could n't bang due to kids , one is flakey , I escalated too quickly on the other one . <p> I 'm learning that girls who give terse responses even on match are attention whores or have some hesitation about you that 's holding them back . I 've tried pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no avail . One turned down my offer to meet because she 's from the city center and thought the 45 minutes between us was too far ( translated : " I 'm an insulated city snob and I do n't date guys from the suburbs " ) . <p> I 'm meeting a quality girl for a second date this weekend , first coffee date was fairly good , not sure if she 's DTF/seduceable though . I 'd also like to get the scoop on how to seduce these more quality/cultured women on match.com . Obviously , it must work differently from fast fucks with the POF/OKC/tinder hoodrats.

Do you think the greek girl was being honest saying you were the first cheat ? <p> I have no idea . I do n't believe in fully trusting women , so she 's probably lying . She sure has no problem hiding our fling from my roommate . <p> However , if it makes any difference , she volunteered the information herself . I never asked her about her past relationship history , I just asked her , " Do you have a boyfriend in Greece ? " and she ended up giving me all sorts of other details . <p> Here 's another experience to support my theory : <p> I dated an 18 year old chick who grew up on a farm ( in Pennsylvania ? ) . She went to an all-girl school before moving to Boston for college ( thank god for Boston 's colleges ) . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her complaining about her lack of dating options in high school . Chalk up another " good girl " for " piece-of-shit alpha boy " Samseau . <p> Alpha 's get the relatively few flings good girls have , and they get the slutty pussy as well . Betas get the scraps and are lucky to bang a skank . <p> Another observation : <p> Ever notice how there are alpha 's on this forum who have claimed to banged dozens of girls and yet have no STD 's ? Roosh has never had any serious STD , and claims not to have herpes . This is because alphas fuck the less slutty girls , girls who do n't have any STD 's . <p> Then notice how you hear stories about a guy who bangs one girl and ends up with an STD ? That guy was a beta who was scraping the bottom of the barrel for pussy , and ended up with a cock-loving nympho who gave him an STD . <p> I was having a month long tryst with a young african lady . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making polite conversation I asked her if she was seeing anybody etc ... She starts to tell me about how she has been dating this one guy she " really likes . " ( Background , 2nd date bang for me , and subsequent bang on all 5 or 6 next meetings ) She goes on to say how they have been on 10 or 12 dates and have not slept together yet . I said , " do n't you think its a little ironic that you give it up so easily for me who you do n't  like as much as this other guy who is " special . " Her reply : <p> " Well , most girls want to have sex with somebody on the side while they are looking for Mr. Right . " <p> This statement has stuck with me ever since .

Wow ! <p> I did an analysis of some numbers from a big respected survey of college students , and the top 2.6% got 29% of the lays . The top 5% got 35% of the lays . It 's not quite 80/20 - a little more like 80/30 - 30% of the guys get 80% of the lays . <p> 40/ ( 40+30+20+35 ) = 32% . That is , 10% of men get 32% of the lays , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution is a lot more egalitarian than what you 'd see in reality . Keep in mind though , these are ' lays ' and not women . It 's kinda hard to talk in terms of X% guys getting Y% women when the women keep switching guys . <p> In my experience , like Samseau said , when a relatively non-promiscuous girl cheats , it is overwhelmingly with a high status guy , whether it 's game , looks , fame , whatever . Hell , alphas have a near complete lock on all quick sexual encounters . In the numbers I quoted , if you do n't count the lays of guys who only banged one girl a year , the share of the top 2.6% goes from 29% of the lays to 37% of the lays . The top 18% get about 85% of the lays . <p> Here was my analysis : <p> " Here is some info from a study that asked students about the number of partners within the past 12 months with whom they had anal and oral as well as plain old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of men and women answering 0-8 , and then 9+ . Using Excel , I found the average number of partners for the 9+ group , to make the overall sample mean what it is , 1.72 mean sexual partners per year among the men . Given that , the average for the 9+ group must be about 19 . <p> Then I multiply each group 's number of partners by its frequency ( absolute , not percentage ) in the population , and sum them all together , to find the total number of hookups that occurred in the sample . ( Eg , 3839*1 + 995*2 ) Using the 19 figure from earlier , there were 17,338 hookups reported by the men . <p> The results : The top 2.6% of men are responsible for 29% of the hookups . The top 5.4% are responsible for 40% of the hookups . The top 28% of the men are responsible for 78% of the hookups .

Not all women I bang are promiscuous . Some girls love cock-hopping , but most do n't . <p> So yes , I would agree that 20% of the women give out 80% of the sex , and it 's true for men too , with 20% of the men giving out 80% of the sex . <p> But the men giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " good girls " - normal betas have to date for a month before getting any , while the sluts who fuck tons of guys fuck lots of alphas and a few betas in-between . <p> I surmise that men learning game will first cut their teeth on these uber-sluts until their game improves enough to snag the less promiscuous women . <p> Of course , by the time you 're game is good enough that you regularly bang " good girls " , you 'll realize how little a woman 's notch count matters when it comes to seducing them , as all women are the same , and you 'll no longer care about this stuff . <p> Lying on an ANONYMOUS survey , Really ? Personal experience does n't meant much in light of empirical evidence . For one , when you take the entire population into account , the majority of girls do n't even frequent the venues ( bars , nightclubs , etc ) that expose them to players who would try to pick them up , and when they do , it 's almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bf . The girls that you see out having fun on the weekends ARE NOT the typically girls . The overestimation comes from the fact that when you go out , these are the girls that you see . Our university may not get featured on Girls Gone Wild anytime soon , but I can assume that our student population is still more promiscuous than the general population because they are in an university environment afterall ( large school in the US ) . Secondly , contrary to popular belief ( on this forum ) , the majority of girls are not open to the idea of cheating on their bf - you know , those same girls who put a limit on your approach to bang rate . Remeber all those times you got blown out ? Despite far outnumbers the times you got the bang , they are less memorable still . Of course these are college students . If we conduct a survey on a bunch of old ladies , most of them probably have a fling at one time in their lives . <p> As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't DTF . It 's best to find those that will . <p> Quote:the majority of girls do n't even frequent the venues ( bars , nightclubs , etc ) that expose them to players who would try to pick them up <p> I take issue with this . Out of hundreds of girls that I know , there are maybe 3 or 4 who do n't frequent such places , and even those are coaxed into going occasionally . Even the most intellectual girls around ( sadly ) always view wild clubbing and spending nights in smoky , noisy bars with floor sticky from alcohol as the epitome of fun . <p> And even that does n't take into account that a fact that a girl does n't go clubbing does n't necessarily make her any less of a slut of susceptible to game . One of the biggest sluts I 've known made it a big point of pride that she did n't enjoy clubs and was more of an outdoorsy type . I do n't think that a girl who does n't want to cheat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I 'd rather judge her on how often she changes " long-term " bfs ( something that also happens more often than in the popular perception ) . Girls who have had very low numbers and spent most of their time in a stable relationship with one guy have , in all of my life , been extremely rare . <p> Finally there is this study , detailing how female responses about sexual habits vary drastically ( turns out that telling them they 're on a polygraph is the only way to coax truthful responses instead of socially acceptable ones ) : LONG ... <p> Again , that has more to do with the girls you spent time with . It is like how college students overestimate the prevalence of binge drinking on campus , because that 's what gets seen , when the actual rate of binge drinking is quite low ( less than 20% ) . A good number of girls prefer to spend weekend nights with their bf than go out and get drunk . Again , the thread is n't about whether those girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most girls are bangable , but it 's about the actual statistics of girls getting banged by alpha . If you are to ask any PUA , they will likely overestimate due to the sample of girls that they are typically exposed to . Day game statistics will give you a far more representative sample and realistic estimate than night game statistics . Ever wonder why it is easier to get the bang at night for reasons other than alcohol ? A biased sample , that is why . <p> ( 02-21-2012 06:22 AM ) anewtypedude Wrote : Sorry to bust your bubble , but from our university 's data , it 's more like 10% of men are sleeping with 20-30% of women . 50% of women are stuck in purely monogamous relationships ( answered sleeping with only 1 partner in the previous year in an anonymous survey ) .

@@96059358 @259358/ <p> Millionare : Millenials ca n't buy houses because they spend too much money on Avocados <p> Home ownership among the young is at a 30-year low . Millennials are opting to rent rather than buy in large numbers . This has all kinds of negative effects for communities , since young homebuyers are what forms the core of a community 's next generation . It 's bad for the country , because homes mean larger families in a time of declining birthrates . And it 's bad for the millennials themselves , because for many generations a home has been a source of great wealth and pride . <p> There 's been a lot of speculation about the reasons for this problem : is it rising home prices pushing ownership out of reach of anyone but the wealthy ? Job instability that means you could be forced to pack up and move across the country at any time ? Zero interest rates and high taxes making it difficult to save ? <p> One Australian millionaire knows exactly what the cause is : too many millennials are eating avocados @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular superfruit beloved by young people " may be one of the reasons why some young people ca n't afford a house , according to Australian millionaire and property mogul Tim Gurner . " When I was trying to buy my first home , I was n't buying smashed avocado for $19 and four coffees at $4 each , " Gurner told the Australian news show 60 Minutes . Only 32% of home owners were first-time buyers in 2016 , the lowest point since 1987 , according to a study by NerdWallet . A recent study by HSBC found that American millennials have a homeownership rate of 35% , and in Australia only about 28% of millennials own their homes . Cost is often a major factor in millennials ' decisions to buy " the study found that a lot of young homeowners got a financial boost from their parents when making their purchase . <p> It goes without saying that this is obvious nonsense .

The old advice holds true - start at the bottom . But what they do n't tell you is that " the bottom " was bought out by baby boomers , who chucked a coat of paint on it and sold it for double the price .

He had his start only because he had thirty grand given to him by his grandfather and had the immense balls to take over a lease on a suburban gym at the age of 19 , renovating it in 4 weeks and getting it rolling again . A lot of millionaires do n't admit or heavily downplay the immense luck that factors into their immense wealth : four out of five small businesses fail in the first five years , he sold the gym one year later to some other poor sucker and went into property development . <p> But at the same time he says pretty plainly that it 's the madness for immediate high standards of houses that is pumping property prices through the roof . ( An ironic observation , because he actually sells high-end luxury apartments for a living . ) That much I can appreciate : even in 1970s Australia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good-ish area outright without a mortgage only if you saved hard and busted your arse in some mining shithole for a couple of years or so .

On the other hand , at least the houses were mostly new : millennials mostly ca n't afford to build , they have to buy the Boomers ' shitboxes . <p> I do n't think it 's a case of Millennials wanting more than they can afford . I think a lot of Millennials would gladly move into a cheaper place without granite countertops , etc. if it was available , but they simply do n't seem to be .

The biggest problems for Millenials is the preponderance of student loan debt and the cost of housing in the larger metropolitan areas .

So now , a kid who has 50-60K in student loans and then has to come up with a 50-60K downpayment for a house that you then have to pay a huge mortgage and exhorbitant property taxes for . Ca n't say I blame Millenials for not wanting to sign up for that , especially with the horrible job market and depressed wages of the last 10 years . Hell I 'm an old man and I do n't even want to deal with property ownership ever again . I 'm quite happy to be renting . <p> Another huge problem for Millenials is that many of their parents are clueless idiots who have given no advice or bad advice to them .

Going to college can still be worth it , provided you study things that you can go out into the world and get paid for , work hard in high school to grab scholarships that so many colleges do offer and forget the stupidly expensive private schools ( this is something I wish was preached a lot more because it can have a huge impact financially to have good grades opening up scholarships to lower debt burdens ) .

@@96059359 @259359/ <p> I 've been thinking about this topic for a bit now , but my disaster of a date has pushed me to finally put my thoughts in writing . <p> Backstory : I met the girl off of OKC , pretty quickly I could tell there was something abnormal about her . I could n't figure out if it was fat/ugly induced crazyness , stupidity , or a lack of social skills , but something was wrong ; I soon figured out it was a combination of all three . The thing is , I went into this date to test out a few things I had been thinking of , and to hone my skills . Practice makes perfect right ? However , I knew deep down I did n't actually want to fuck this girl as much as I wanted to use her to get better at fucking hotter girls . While there is nothing wrong with this in the earlier stages of game I have been advancing in my skills . I could have better spent my time day gaming way hotter girls or doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of girls I should be getting , I am banging lower quality girls than I should be . <p> This brings up the importance of continually going after more and more attractive girls . Sure you can bang 100 girls with a physical rating of 5 , but where does that get you ? Would those gained skills translate into the ability to bang girls of a rating of 9 ? Sure they would to some extent , but not entirely . Hotter girls are harder to game , they are inundated with beta suitors , they are more selective . To fuck the hotter girls you must game hotter girls when possible and not settle for the uglier girls . <p> A video game analogy ( games like WoW ) - you start off at level 1 , you suck unreasonably bad at doing pretty much everything ; you must kill monsters to level up . Initially you level up very quickly and are able to kill higher level monsters and explore new areas . Eventually you hit a certain point where killing the lower level monsters is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . You fine tune your playing skill and aim to kill stronger enemies . You fail at first , but eventually these monsters will be easy to kill and you will be slaying them just as easily . - an analogy could also be made using weightlifting as an example . <p> One can not continually game and bang lower quality girls in the hope of eventually banging dream girls . One must start by banging lower quality girls in order to practice basic game skills , but higher quality girls will only come if you approach them and further fine tune your abilities . <p> What determines the quality/attractiveness of girls ? - The boner test . This is good , but does n't account for your ego or the pleasure of sex . Adriana Lima will give you the same ( albeit slightly harder ) boner as a relatively chubby girl at the bar when you 're wasted and on a dry streak . Which girl will you enjoy fucking more ? The choice is obvious . <p> - 1-10 scale : similar to the boner test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misused ( guys saying they banged five 10s , or that a certain girl they have oneitis for is a 8 ) . For this reason I do n't trust the ratings a guy I do n't know has given a girl . <p> - personal standards I 'm going to call this the selector for non-physical attributes : does she have a weird tic/habit , does she do annoying things , does she smell funny , have bad skin . Basically anything you know is a deal breaker . <p> I fully agree that physical attractiveness is universal with slight variances in the higher ratings based on personal preferences ( asians or redheads for example ) , but I believe that one of the most important exercises a guy can do is sit down and make a list of what he finds attractive in a girl . Then make a list of deal-breakers or turn-offs . It is the acknowledgement of these traits that will take one 's skill to the next level of hot girls . If one does not know exactly what he wants then he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls based on the boner test . In the process he will be missing out on opportunities to bang girls that adhere more to his personal preference resulting in more enjoyable sex . I am not saying make a 367 point checklist , but have general requirements . For example : the girl I banged yesterday is slim , has full lips , clear skin , and a nice ass . The girl I made out with today was chubby , has bad skin and greasy hair . For arguments sake let 's say I banged both of them . Which bang do you think I 'll remember a week from now ? <p> Sure , you can learn the rules and some strategies by playing with fake money . But you ca n't really get better unless you 're playing with the real thing . You need to feel the meaning of loss to really appreciate victory . <p> Go for the girls that you find most attractive , or beat off . There 's got to be risk involved or you will never evolve . <p> Sure , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not perfect chicks , but I believe that if I take more risks with hotter girls , then I 'll get more acclimated to dealing with them . <p> This is my problem too . Sometimes I need to force myself to not go for easy lays with cute girls so I can approach super hot girls . One tip for night game at least is to go to really stuck up clubs where you are going to be talking to super hot girls with bitch shields all night . I probably got rejected 8 times but I ended up fucking one of the hotter girls I had been with in a while as a result of it . Sat night I did the opposite .. Same night lay with a pretty cute girl but I am not sure if the experience is getting me any closer to getting with 9s and 10s . <p> Simple solution - move to a country where you 're surrounded by hot women so you hit on them all the time . Meaning the hot women do n't have astronomical egos because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sure , you can learn the rules and some strategies by playing with fake money .

I got into it to bang more quality girls . Call me a romantic , but I enjoy spending time with non-broken/americanized girls . I get exponentially more pleasure doing something interesting with a girl , banging her that night and possibly the next instead of a one night stand .

@@96059367 @259367/ <p> I was doing some idle thinking and pondering upon this age old question : Why to black women have big butts and why do white women have skinny bulimic-esque backsides ? <p> Of course , it all comes down to the two races having differing genetic codes : white women have skinny-butt genes and black women have phat-ass-juicy-booty genes . But WHY is this so ? <p> WHY did evolution choose to follow this exact path ? Why did the Gods see it fit to bless the backside of the African children and forever curse that of the caucasian ? <p> I think I have the answer to this question and it is infact a rather simple one . <p> Caucasian women come from Europe , a place with a relatively harsh climate and very bitter winters . This extreme cold environment necessitated the caucasian peoples of Europe to develop and to begin wearing clothing for warmth . <p> This was a great development as it helped the people survive in the icy hell of Europe but however clothing also had a negative aspect . <p> Clothing meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign of their femininity which they used to attract a decent mate who could take care of her and her children . <p> But with their bodies covered up almost all the time by loose fitting clothing , white no longer needed curvy bodies and big backsides to express their femininity and to attract a mate because men could not even have a glimpse of those parts anymore . <p> Therefore , slowly ; naturally and eventually , the big butt gene began to disappear and die out from generation to generation until it became as uncommon as it is today . <p> White women instead began to express their femininity and beauty through other forms such as through jewellery , long flowing radiant hair , multi-coloured eyes and symmetrical faces . This would also explain why White women ( Slavic in particular ) have arguably a greater percentage of pretty-faced women that other races where the majority of women may fall in the 5 and 6 zone . <p> So basically , the dawn of clothing meant the end of the white woman 's butt . ( Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or peoples that wore clothes ) <p> African women on the other hand did NOT wear clothing . Before Europeans came to the continent their bodies were largely left uncovered for all to see ( blame this on the warm and humid climates or just on a lack of innovation on their behalf , it does n't really matter ) <p> So since men are visual creatures , they would naturally choose mates from the women who had the curviest bodies and biggest backsides ( because that was the most significant sign of femininity and fertility they saw ) and so these women with their blessed backsides , who would undoubtedly reproduce more than their skinny black counterparts , passed down their big-ass genes from generation to generation until the gene became as common and widespread as it is today . <p> This largely applies to Latina women too ( and by Latina I mean the women that have the genes of the native tribes of South America ) . Since the women of most of the native South American tribes wore little clothing , they continued to largely express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) which is why they have big backsides as well . <p> In conclusion I will leave a summary of this theory : the size of a woman 's ass was determined ages ago by the climate , religion , innovative thinking or any other factor that led to the development of clothing or by any other factor which led their forefathers not developing clothing at all . <p> Well , your basic assumption is that white women do n't have big asses . I 've mainly hooked up with white girls throughout my life , and a majority of them had very nice big plump asses . Maybe not Kim Kardashian asses , but I 'm not into butts that big anyway . <p> I 'd say the reason black girls tend to have ginormous asses like the following is because black guys simply prefer girls with asses like this , whereas white guys tend to prefer a more medium sized ass . <p> Ask a white guy vs a black guy which ass he prefers , and I think your answer will lie in the statistics . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them have decent backsides but a lot of them do n't . For example , big butts are virtually non-existent in Central and Eastern Europe . <p> I mentioned that climate is not the only factor influencing the size of a woman 's butt . Indians developed their form of clothing relatively quickly regardless of the hot climate ( perhaps because of religion or even just innovative thinking which I mentioned above ) which is why they have flat butts . <p> I do n't know much about Thais and the Vietnamese and whether or not they traditionally wore clothes that covered up most of their bodies but they do share a lot of their DNA with most of the other peoples of South East Asia ( Chinese , Japanese , Korean , e.t.c ) so perhaps they also inherited the flat-butt gene from them . <p> Black guys prefer women with ginomous butts because of the theory above . It carries on today because of cultural and social conditioning among black men who view big-assed women as more appealing and as ' real ' women <p> ( 08-04-2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason black girls tend to have ginormous asses like the following is because black guys simply prefer girls with asses like this , whereas white guys tend to prefer a more medium sized ass . <p> Ask a white guy vs a black guy which ass he prefers , and I think your answer will lie in the statistics . <p> I do n't mind a big ass , but it has to be big from getting slammed by squats and lunges in the gym , so that you can bounce a coin of that thing . <p> When WE came to Twin Peaks for Project Bluebook , the White Lodge spirits recognised his heart was pure and tried to possess WE to find out about the Black Lodge . To stop WL spirits from entering his body he used Haliperidol . It appeared the Haliperidol was causing insanity , but the Haliperidol was allowing his natural evil and insanity to express itself . ---DATASHEETS:Manila , Boracay , Cebu City , Bangkok , Jakarta , Saigon , Nha Trang <p> Agree with speakeasy . Black girls tend to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a black woman with the same BMI as a white woman has more lean mass ) . But if white girls squat , thrust and lunge with heavy weight , most can build a very respectable ass too . White American girls just looooove to believe that they have it harder than everyone else , so they like to think they 're at some structural insurmountable disadvantage . They also ca n't imagine putting out effort to catch a man . Putting out effort to passive aggressively compete with other women is a-okay though . <p> You 'll notice that in recent years as big asses became more socially acceptable , more white girls have them , or so it seems . Or they 're more visible . I find chicks with big asses have better personalities too - I ca n't imagine a more alien combination than a very fit woman with a flat ass , but they 're everywhere . I find traditional yoga chicks much warmer and open than the pilates or spinning types . <p> " Big Butt Theory " The first thing that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoof of Big Bang Theory with guys dressed up like nerds gangbanging a hot blonde .... Is it bad that that 's the way my mind works ? <p> This is an r-selection vs . K-selection issue . Most African populations have historically operated on the r-selection model , which means there was more direct " sperm war " competition between males having sex with the same woman . This is why black men on average have bigger penises ; it has been sexually selected since a bigger penis can more effectively scoop out competitors ' sperm . <p> The big ass issue is the same thing . With short-term mating preferences rather than a focus on long-term pair bonding , women 's pure fertility continues to be selected for . In this case , wider hips and bigger butts that make short-term mating less of a physical risk to the woman , and more likely to produce healthy babies with minimal complications . Plus it 's more likely to attract a man interested in short-term mating , so there is a lot of selection pressure making the biggest butts more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black men , the typical , skinny young white girl body is something of an acquired taste . <p> Most black men do not like bodies like the above . Show this picture to a bunch of black men and most of them will say these white girls have no ass . If black dudes are judging white girls , they are almost unanimously going to prefer this one over the above : <p> I used to be same way , was big into phat ass . But the slender small asses on the first pic are a taste I picked up in the last few years and I 'd probably go with that type of body now over the phat booty . Though I would n't complain about either . I just think long-term , a skinny girl with more subtle curves will hold up better and be less likely to get obese . Phat ass only looks good when the girl is in her 20s . By 30 that shit will be cottage cheese unless she has a good workout regimen , and many women let themselves go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls have a small timeline of being bangable . These chics will be gross as they approach the wall . <p> Keep in mind those Jets girls have bigger than average asses ( for white girls of similar thinnness ) . <p> " Phat ass only looks good when the girl is in her 20s . By 30 that shit will be cottage cheese unless she has a good workout regimen , and many women let themselves go so the majority of these " baby got back " girls have a small timeline of being bangable . These chics will be gross as they approach the wall . " <p> Lol maybe those black guys do n't plan on sticking around ? <p> Black infant mortality is a lot higher than whites or Hispanics , suggesting poverty is not necessarily the culprit . So maybe there 's a keener desire for a woman whose appearance suggests that she can healthily birth a baby . <p> In my two years of painstaking research since then , I 've developed the hypothesis that ass size is based almost entirely upon diet -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My initial observation was based upon the increasing levels of ass in white women in the American Southeast . This is also the region where many black American women originate from . <p> You could make a case that this part of the country produces the biggest " native " booties in the country . I 'm not including Latinas for the sake of this discussion simply because their cultures are a little newer and more insulated in the US . <p> Typical southern food includes stuff like fried chicken , BBQ pork , fried pig skins , cornbread , macaroni and cheese , buttery grits or mashed potatoes , etc . The food here is overall the fattiest in the US . And the women have the fattest asses . <p> Now , look over at Southeast Asia . Most of the women do n't get attention for their assets . But , in my experience , if you account for height and weight , Filipinas give any race a run for their money . Initially I played with the idea that this was due to the Spanish influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But then you look at the diets again and it 's almost an exact replica of the American south . From the tons of fried chicken and hot sauce all the way to the stuff that most cultures wo n't touch like hogs legs , frogs legs , gizzards , pork rinds/chicharron . Even sweetened iced tea , which is almost entirely exclusive to these two regions , as far as I know . <p> So you have two areas on opposite sides of the world but with similar diets producing similar ass . And the foods I described were highly influenced by African slaves/cuisine . <p> Where else is known for ass ? DR , Brazil , Colombia . Notice that they also have a large African influence . On the other hand , a country like Argentina -- which rejected Africans and their culture -- are known for less curves and smaller asses . <p> But African genes do n't explain non-Afro Latinas , white Americans , and Filipinas . That 's what leads me to believe the asses are largely based upon the diet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass on the continent of Africa , because the food brought over by the slaves is obviously highly influenced but not exactly like traditional African cuisine . <p> The different preferences between white and black guys is not a race thing , it 's an environmental thing . A black guy completely removed from black neighborhoods and black culture is n't going to be attracted to massive asses anymore than a white guy in the same circumstance . It 's the same reason that a countrywide acceptance of big ass increased as black and Latin influence on US popular culture increased . <p> ( 08-04-2014 12:32 PM ) Enigma Wrote : But African genes do n't explain non-Afro Latinas , white Americans , and Filipinas .

@@96059368 @259368/ <p> Hey guys . I get a lot of first dates using online game because I have a pretty tight profile . However , I have significant trouble getting second dates or more . <p> I think my problem is I let talkative women lead the conversation and they end up asking boring questions about my work , which is very technical and I think turns them off . <p> What do you guys do to avoid this type of problem ? <p> Also if anyone can point to a good thread on first dates I 'd appreciate it . I did a search , but could n't find anything . I know about Tuthmosis ' thread , but that 's more advanced than what I 'm looking for . It does n't really focus on my sticking point which I think is conversation . <p> I simplify what I do for a living so even a dummy can follow . Generally my career is not the topic of discussion , just own the conversation and break in when she is digging more into it . Describe it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less about interview questions than it is improvising , taking her through an array of emotions . ( happy , excited , laughing , hamster running face ) . Perfect example is " What was the last book you read ? " . Makes her think you read a lot , instant value boost and gives her no time to either look dumb founded and / or give you a new subject to focus on . <p> Ballr Wrote:Probably less about interview questions than it is improvising , taking her through an array of emotions . ( happy , excited , laughing , hamster running face ) . <p> Yes this is a major sticking point for me . I prefer conversations that exist on a purely rational level so trying to have emotional conversations feels very unnatural to me , especially with someone I just met without any existing emotional connection . <p> I used to have this problem . I diagnosed it as meeting up with girls who were such grizzled veterans of the dating scene that they could n't muster any enthusiasm for a date with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and motivation for the date are low , she drones on about boring shit and gives off zero sexual vibe . <p> The solution is to screen harder for enthusiasm on her part ( and on your part as well ) . When you find a girl that 's genuinely excited to meet you , who behaves like the date is a significant event that she 's looking forward to rather than an option she penciled into her schedule for if nothing better comes up ( and you feel similarly ) , then it wo n't take any special effort to have a fun conversation ; it will happen organically . <p> Keep strong eye contact with her ( this is a golden rule anyway ... ca n't be over emphasized ) . <p> I like to smirk slightly from time to time and intentionally make her think she missed a joke . <p> Ignore her questions and steer the conversation to where you want it to go <p> Sit next to her at the bar ... not across at a table . Let your legs " accidentally " touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her leg and they stay in contact for an extended while generally means she 's good to go ) <p> I think that 's not entirely it though because I can think of two separate dates I 've had recently where over the course of the date the girl went from seeming in to me to looking uninterested . <p> In one case the girl had open body language and was facing towards me at the start of the date , but by the end of the date she had crossed her arms and turned slightly away . <p> In the other case the girl had initially sat with her legs pointed toward mine so that they were very close and touched at times . She was also playing with her jewelry . But shortly after she asked me about my job and I told her about it , she turned the other way so her legs were further from me and she stopped holding eye contact as long . <p> Avoid talking about work ( yours and hers ) at all costs . If she brings it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new topic . You can say something like " I spend enough time thinking about work . Let 's talk about something fun . " <p> The #1 thing to talk about is emotions because chicks communicate through emotions . So you could mention how you did something exciting last week ( it does n't have to be last week , but just say it was ) and describe the rush you felt when this happened but the dread when that happened and finally the relief at the end . And then you ask her when 's the last time she experienced something like that if she 's not volunteering a story of her own . <p> While she 's telling her story , interrupt her to be a challenge , but let her draw out her emotions . You 'll want her to ramble on about whatever she 's thinking ( as long as it 's not about her job ) while you switch between being dickish and relating to what she 's saying . <p> The problem may not just be the conversation though .

You want to learn how to slowly dial up the heat over the course of the date rather than going directly from a 0 to 60 . The innuendo will help a lot with that .

A couple of principles : <p> -if she BROACHES THE TOPIC OF SEX , FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER , it is a YUGE indicator that she 's a slut and is down to fuck TONIGHT . <p> -If YOU broach the topic of sex and she goes with it , it 's also a sign shes open to it . <p> -conversely , if you mention something sexual in nature and she balks , or gives you that " are you serious " look , or even calls you out " Why would you say something like that ! ?

And it 's not " I 've been reading the manosphere blogs for 5 years and have successfully talked to at LEAST 10 girls ! ! ! " level game . And you 'll probably fuck it up the first couple times and lose some awesome girls in the process because you 're working with dynamics that most guys do n't even see let alone jump in and start juggling .

I feel bad for you if you did n't know about game when you fell for the societal " marriage and a white pickett fence " thing and promised monogamy but you 're on your own . <p> Pre-Reqs So first up you got ta ' be secure as phuck for this one . No jealousy . <p> The Rules 1 ) Your girl comes first . Consider it a Hugh Hefner arrangementhe has a Primary girl and then the rest of them . Your girl is your Primary . That means if you have plans with her , you do n't break them to fuck some other girl . That means that all your watching DVDs , cuddling , grocery shopping , holding hands , etc. shit is reserved for your Primary ( you do n't HAVE to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is how you feel/actbut you should follow it or you 'll end up giving yourself drama down the road when you start to get attached to one of your FBs lol ) . If you run into your Primary and one of your FB 's when you 're out at the bar , your Primary gets your full attention and your FB can fuck off ( you do n't play the two off eachother or anythingironically your FB will respect you more for ignoring her for your Primary because that 's some high-value shit to her ) . If you 're flirting with your FB at a bar and your Primary walks in , you ditch your FB ASAP and go spend the rest of the night with your Primary . <p> " but yareally that sounds beta and supplicating wahh wahhh " <p> No shit . What would be alpha is not having a Primary girlfriend to BEGIN with . But this guide is n't for guys who are just juggling fuckbuddies , this guide is for guys who want a long-term girlfriend they can have an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . So ya , there are some fucking rules to make it work . <p> 2 ) This shit is DISCREET . Keep your hooking up discreet from your girl ( unless she 's into hearing details , some girls are . Or unless you need to make her jealous to stoke the fires a bit , but in that situ just be super subtle like coming home late or not answering your phone on a night out with the boys etc. , you do n't have to be like " So I was eating this chick out last night and " lol ) . The discretion helps because it means she can imagine whatever she wants , so you might be railing some super hot chick in the ass 3 times in a night and fucking loving it but she 'll imagine that the girl was some fat gross bar slut and that you did n't enjoy yourselfif you tell her what went on or show her the girl , you 're gon na get drama . It also helps because she does n't really know if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're banging 10 girls on the side . If she knows who you 're hooking up with and you 're blatant about going out with those girls etc. , when those girls are n't available and you 're stuck staying home it 'll be obvious to her that you 're not getting laid and she 'll just start extrapolating that as her winning you over or you being unattractive etc. etc. and you 'll get drama . <p> The other reason to be discreet is that women fear social judgement . She 'll date a player and be fine with it , until her friends see that player out with another girl and then hen-peck her with judgements telling her she has to ditch him etc. and then suddenly she 'll have a problem with the arrangement she had no problem with before she had to face social judgement . So she gets to call you her Boyfriend and you call her your Girlfriend , and to her friends , family , etc. you 're her man and you do n't talk about other girls or about being in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , you are a traditional monogamous couple . The second any of them realize what 's going on and start to judge her , she 'll be forced by the social pressure to give you the " change or I 'm outta ' here " ultimatum and the relationship is over . <p> 3 ) When you DO get into the discussion about why you do n't want to promise monogamy and why you like open relationships and that she 's allowed to fuck other guys , communicate the rules flat out like a motherfucker. ie " condoms are a must , get tested regularly , no seeing the hook-up person more frequently than your S.O. , other people are for sex ONLY no watching movies or cuddling or getting dinner relationshippy stuff , etc . Other people are purely sex toys , there 's no emotional commitment allowed . Do n't be ambiguous about this shit because it 'll bite you in the assyou want an agreement so that if she DOES fuck around on you , it 's more likely that she 'll be safe about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy frequently and stuff . If you do n't set rules she wo n't have any guilt hanging over her head about letting the football team jizz in her or about going on lovey-dovey dates where she falls in love with another guy and ditches your relationship for a new one . <p> I know , I know , some of you guys are cringing right now . " ugh but I do n't WANT her fucking other guys ! " Shut the fuck up and keep reading , I 'll get to why they do n't fuck other guys in a minuteyou have to understand the setup first . <p> Setting The Frame : When you 're first hooking up and transitioning into making her your girlfriend you want to do it slowly and resist it so she knows the whole " having a girlfriend " thing is n't really your deal . This 'll set things up for down the road where you give her a speech along the lines of " but you 're the ONE girl who won me over ! I ca n't curb my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in my life , but they do n't mean anything to me the way YOU do . " <p> The idea is that you do n't want a girlfriend but she 's somehow winning you over and you ca n't explain it . But that you 're so " broken " that you ca n't just instantly change for her . Odds are when she met you you were playing the field , so this is n't something that 'll come out of the blue . That 's why you ca n't pull this off as easy in a marriage , because then she has years of reference experience of you being a beta monogamous dork and pitching this is incongruent and just makes her assume it 's some sort of punishment instead of " the natural way of life " for you . <p> The Equality Ruse : but hey , it 's okay , SHE 'S free to fuck other guys too ! See , babe ? I 'm compromising . I ca n't help the way I am , but I do n't expect you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with other people and expect you to be okay with it then you 're allowed to as well . That 's only fair ! <p> Sounds logical , right ? Fair 's fair and all that . You 're not being unreasonablelogically . This is a fair deal . <p> " but yareally you ca n't trust women ! ! if you let them they 'll fuck anything they want and wo n't use condoms and ahhhh1 ! 11111 ! ! " <p> ya I know . But follow me herewhat do we know about hypergamy ? We know that women always want to fuck the highest status man . Unless they 're a certain type of chick they 're generally not looking to just rack up a million notches on the belt the way guys are . They 're looking to hook up with guys that they perceive to have high value ( whether he actually does have high value or not to the rest of the world ) . <p> So think of it like this : You 've got this hot supermodel girlfriend but she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . ANY of them . As long as the girl is fat , ugly , annoying , smells bad , etc. you can bang as many of them as you want . Hell , she 'll even introduce you to them and set you up if you want to fuck them instead of her ! ! What a deal ! ! <p> are you gon na ' take it ? No . Why ? Because those girls are n't attractive to you . Ya , you have free reign to fuck them all but you 're gon na fuck your supermodel girlfriend because she 's the most attractive option . <p> Still with me ? Okay so flip the genders . Now you 're a high status badass alpha male boyfriend/husband ( the equivalent of a hot supermodel girlfriend/wife ) and you 're letting her fuck any of the not-as-high-status guys ( the equivalent of the fat ugly chicks ) around her that she wants to . She can fuck all of them instead of you if she wants , you 'll even introduce her to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gon na ' take it ? No . Why ? Because those guys are n't attractive to her . Ya , she has free reign to fuck them all but she 's gon na fuck her high status boyfriend because he 's the most attractive option . <p> So you see , the whole frame is actually kind of a ruse . It 's like offering someone part of your ice cream you do n't REALLY want to share , just to look like a nice guy , but you know they do n't like ice cream so it 's a safe offer because they 're not going to take it . They go " oh no thanks , it 's okay " and you go " okay ! " and lick away and enjoy that shithey , you offered ! <p> Why She 's Okay With This Frame : Read this next line a million times till it 's engrained in your head . If I knew how to bold , I 'd bold it : <p> ***A girl 's biggest fear is n't that you 'll fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with that other girl. *** <p> So all you have to do is assure her that any girl you hook up with is just meaningless . Ya , you fool around but you kick the girl out right after and do n't sit and watch movies and cuddle and hold hands the way you do with HER ( even if that 's not true lol ) . And you 'll always come back to her , and she 's always going to be your priorityif you 're out in public and run into both girls , your girl gets your attention and the other girl can fuck off . If you have plans with your girl and the other girl wants to make plans , too bad . etc. etc . <p> This takes some time to convince her of , and she wo n't like it at first and she 'll shit-test the fuck out of your frame . But once you 've banged a few girls discreetly on the side and you 're still the usual awesome boyfriend you are , she 'll start to accept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , sometimes when he 's out some bar slut will jump him but she does n't mean anything to him the way I do ! " As long as you 're congruent to this , it becomes acceptable and normal to her . <p> If your reason for playing the field is good ( I like to go with not wanting to have a mid-life crisis and any regrets so I have to get this out of my system etc. ) girls will even tell you they only want you but they understand you have to do what you 're doing to get it out of your system . These girls are waiting for you to grow out of it and settle down with them . Odds are you probably will down the road , or at least settle to a point where you just hook up when your office puts you up in a hotel on a business trip and such ( VS hitting the bars every weekend looking for more pussy ) . <p> Wo n't other girls mind ? Nah . It 's up to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primary . I like to live pretty honestly just because I do n't like guilt or drama and I 've been in the PUA community long enough to know that you can get away with being a lot more honest than most of society would believe . I actually have a framed pic of my GF sitting on my nightstand . I do n't turn it away or hide it when I have other girl 's over . So far none of them has been freaked out and bailed once they saw the pic , but that 's because I 'm honest from the start and tell them yes , I have a GF , but we have an open relationship and she knows I fool around here and there when I 'm on my own time . <p> You can lie and pretend not to have a GF though , they wo n't know lol But I 've done that before and I just prefer the open honesty in terms of how I want to live my life as a man ( up-front about who I am and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around trying to pretend to be whatever I think the girl wants me to beabundance VS scarcity ) . <p> Oh , and other girls main worry is actually just that your GF might be psycho and try to kill them lol I actually found that funny the first few times I heard girls say thatthey worry about the same thing a guy worries about when he bangs a taken chick " am I gon na get beat up ? ? " lol <p> Problems : 1 ) She might fuck a couple other guys , especially right at the start , just to shit-test you . You have to be congruent to the frame you set . Once she realizes you do n't care and are n't jealous she 'll go " oh , fuck , that did n't work at allokay hamster let 's figure out how to land him and focus on him 24/7 instead of other guys ! ! " If you get pissy then she 'll just keep doing it until you cave and promise monogamy ( being a beta pussy who promises shit he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the girlwhat 's next , you going to pretend to like romantic comedies and hate football ? ) . <p> 2 ) Her friends and family will fuck it up for you hardcore if they figure out what 's going on . The first few months it 's no biggie , and way down the road when she 's learned to say " it works for us " it 's no biggie , but that middle period where it looks like she 's landed you and you 're finally being won over , that 's where the social pressure grenade is gon na ' do the most damage . <p> Commanding Monogamy : Some guys would rather just say " I 'm going to fuck what I want , but you 're not allowed to fuck anyone but me . " This can be done , but 1 ) it takes a super strong frame , 2 ) you have to be prepared to lose a lot of girls who are n't down for this , and 3 ) you 're going to need a pretty submissive chick who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are more girls up for obeying this than you 'd think , yes , even in North Americathe thing is they 're only up for this with guys who are 100% congruent to it , like guys who believe 100% that this is just the way men and women are supposed to be . Guys from foreign countries with strong religious beliefs ( picture the stern authoritative brown/latin type guy who does n't debate with a girl about why she ca n't wear that slutty dress out he just said " No . Go change . " and expects her to obey ) can pull this off way easier than a computer nerd from North America who 's just learned to bang girls in the past couple years . <p> So your pool of girls up for that arrangement is smaller , and the pool of guys who can pull that off ( odds are if you 're reading this blog you 're probably not one of those guys ) is even smaller . <p> Setting the Open Relationship frame like I described above is a much higher percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , this is all field-tested by lots of PUAs and naturals over the years , including myself . If you 're not at a point in game where you believe that this is possible or that it 's something you can do consistently , that 's cool . Just understand that you 've just been socially conditioned your entire life to think that way . <p> And if you 're someone who 's going to reply with " no way because she would think this and this and then this would happen !

Most women will flat out tell you they are horny or they are wet with NO shame - especially after she has done the 3 points above . 
@@96059375 @259375/ <p> I recently tried out viagra to see if the stories I 've heard about it turning you into a human jackhammer are true . I popped half a 20mg pill and got to business . 4 nuts and a few hours later I was still horny as hell and my dick would get hard due to a change in the wind . The girl I was banging made me stop and would n't let me fuck her for 2 days because her pussy was torn up to the point of being sore and bleeding . I popped the other half of the pill a week later before I went to class ( I was supposed to take a girl back to my pad and bang between classes ) . I pulled down her panties to find she had started her period while we were sitting in class and had to go to the rest of my classes with a rock hard dick .

I would go there for a short time as a tourist , but would prefer second tier Russia for a long term stay . <p> Even amongst other Russians Moscovites are known as rude . There are also too many darker Caucasians in Moscow , who are very unpredictable . I had some conflicts with them during nightgame , but managed to escape untouched due to being able to stand my ground . I would like to avoid these interractions in future . <p> Have n't been to Kiev , but in terms of girls only , I can hardly imagine the cost difference being justified .

Please do n't expect models in heels there though . <p> Moscow is rude indeed . Bar staff often treats you like shit .

You can get a flat on the outskirts of Moscow , but still within Metro reach , for maybe 25-30k .

I normally start with the lights off and a chick flick playing ( pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end the movie I start kissing and get her naked . <p> Instead of diving right in for sex , which is what she is expecting , I go into a full body massage . After 5-10 minutes of that I start kissing her neck and exploring her body with my mouth . I avoid her obvious sexual zones and instead focus on areas that are n't used to being stimulated . You can find some spots that drive her crazy that she did n't even know about this way . Bonus points if you a day or two worth of stubble on your face to rub across her naked body . <p> Eventually you move into oral sex , but do n't rush going down on her . When you think she is ready , wait five more minutes . Start it by kissing and lightly biting the insides of her legs , and letting your mouth come within millimeters of her vagina as you move from one leg to other and back . Let her pussy feel your breath as you do this . Eventually you start eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes down there , and make sure you take it slow . <p> Fourth , it 's all in the eye contact . You 've eaten her out for a few minutes , and now your about to penetrate her . Pretend it 's your first time and she is a virgin . Get about on top of her in a missionary position , cup her face in your hands , stare into her eyes , and slowly push in . <p> The rest of the sex is pretty much this . Slow and steady missionary sex . The eye contact is what gets her . You should be making long slow and steady thrusts while looking into her eyes the whole time . You will notice her constantly opening her eyes , catching your eye contact , and closing them again . You can move your head around to kiss and bite her neck or suck on them titties or something , but for the majority of the time you want your forehead to be resting on hers as you look into her eyes . <p> This is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . She will say , or whisper under her breath , that she loves you as you are making love to her . DO NOT SAY IT BACK ! It will drive her hamster crazy . If you do want to say it back to her , wait at least 30 seconds to a minute and then quietly whisper it into her ear before going back to eye contact . <p> In conclusion , if you dominate a girl physically and emotionally she will be putty in her hands . Physically dominate by being an alpha male and regularly fucking her brains out . Emotionally dominate her by sparingly tapping into her emotional side ( and exposing yours ) through love making . Be careful to balance the two properly as too much love making makes you seem to a limp wristed beta chode . <p> Again , making love to a girl exposes her emotional side to her . Do n't do it unless you are interested in keeping the girl around for a long time as a very close regular or as an LTR . <p> Antitrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching recently ? What you are suggesting sounds awfully fake , sentimental and schmaltzy , and it makes me feel little bit uneasy . <p> I think you can fake being emotionally dominant , but females generally are emotionally dominant . <p> I spoke to a man recently , who is a known lover of many women , he said he first embodies the feminine and receptive archetype and that allows HER to have her orgasm . <p> If you can submit to her dominance , emotionally , and be that vulnerable , and secure in your masculinitiy to allow that , then this is what is going to allow the magic . No physical technique can replicate that as it is in its own realm . Or , it is its own state . <p> Yes , you can physically dominate , and that is a powerful truth . But the truth of women is emotionally dominating . <p> The caveat is a lot of women are out of touch with their own emotional power , and these are often the one 's who can not come to orgasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of women out there ) <p> Also , I 'd say love is a feeling , not so much a doing . You can simulate it , but only with the real thing is she going to be putty in your hand and you in hers . <p> That 's why I said it 's not effective if you do n't have some sort of feelings to draw off of . It 's extremely hard to properly fake that much of an emotional connection , and if you did n't have feelings it really would n't be worth your effort to do so . If the female does n't  have true feelings for you either , it wont work as well . <p> I 've found that I focus primarily on the physical aspect of sex . But the girls that treat me good , the ones that will do chores around my place , the ones that will bring me a coffee to work when I ask , then ones that go out of their way to please deserve a little more than the pure physical act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how to guide to fake an emotional connection . " I wrote itup real fast before running out the door . The techniques I mentioned illustrates normally how this situation goes down for me , not as a step-by-step doctrine . Sometimes your girl needs a hard fast fucking , sometimes she needs some slow , intimate , love making . By balancing both , the scale that is the female psyche is balanced , and she is happy . <p> It goes beyond the bedroom as well . You ca n't be the cocky alpha all the time , you have to show her the emotional side once in a while . By doing it sparingly , it increases the effect of it . I do n't always make love to the girls I care about , but I do it once in a while . I do n't always plan a romantic date for the girls I care about , but I do it once in a while .

Horan could not turn to Chicago Mayor Bill Thompson , either , for Thompson was closely linked to the Capone mob. 24 In March 1931 , an intimidated Horan made peace with Capone . By 1933 , Horan was taking his orders from Murray " The Camel " Humphreys , Capone 's liaison to unions. 6 <p> Because of Horan 's mob connections , BSEIU grew tremendously during Horan 's presidency . The mob received more money the more union members there were , so there was every incentive to bring in new members . Mob enforcers intimidated employers into permitting unionization of their employees , and existing locals swelled with members while new locals proliferated .

It 's bad for the country , because homes mean larger families in a time of declining birthrates . And it 's bad for the millennials themselves , because for many generations a home has been a source of great wealth and pride . <p> There 's been a lot of speculation about the reasons for this problem : is it rising home prices pushing ownership out of reach of anyone but the wealthy ? Job instability that means you could be forced to pack up and move across the country at any time ?

A recent study by HSBC found that American millennials have a homeownership rate of 35% , and in Australia only about 28% of millennials own their homes .

I really like doc holiday 's summary on the previous page . <p> When I started college in 2008 , there was n't much information out there about the true realities of taking out gov't loans or the student loan debt crisis . By the time I finished school in 2013 , though , conversations like this one started popping up more and more frequently . I was regretting my decision to major in anthropology ( yeah , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . In retrospect , the decision to take a useless social sciences degree might 've been excusable . " I just did n't know , " and the " truth " on the realities of debt-job market were a little harder to pin down back in ' 08 , when many thought Obama would fix everything . <p> But now -- these young kids heading off to school do know . It 's impossible to miss these conversations.They 're everywhere . And yet kids are still lining up to take the same bullshit year in and year out . Grads are signing up to fork over $60,000 to study a public administration Master 's or something , knowing full well the financial realities that will face them when they graduate . Some people just do n't want to be helped , or maybe ca n't be helped . <p> As a working class person , I 've managed to put away over $50,000 in the bank over the last 15 1/2 months of saving aggressively . Yes , I 've got loans , and I 've also got non-negotiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar job for my state , and , up until recently , worked part-time as a fry cook , dropping fries and chicken tenders by the bagful . For you coastal guys , $50,000 is laughable . <p> But , for me , this means I could lose my job , not work for 3-4 years at all , and still have money . This is enough money to disappear back to the developing world for half a decade and not really worry . <p> I 'm thinking about trying to switch into a janitorial position at my job -- or maybe an admissions gig at the front desk -- so I can get a second full-time job for a cleaning company or at a grocery store . I do n't own a car , and walk 2 1/2 miles to work everyday . When it rains , I 'll get dropped off after my shift by a co-worker . I live in a family member 's spare property with my brother and his wife . <p> When I eclipse six figures in savings , I 'll expatriate , teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while pursuing what I want to be my life 's work . <p> Point is , these jobs all suck , but with some grit and tenacity , you can make it . ( I have a disability , do you think I want to be doing this shit ? ) But , obviously , 99% of people with a degree do n't want to work these sorts of jobs , do n't want to pick up overtime , consider this stuff below , them , whatever . . . Sure , milenials are under-employed , but , grind at the bottom for a second , build some savings , build some leverage , and when you see some daylight , use that leverage to move on to something that is more appropriate given the supposed value of your dogshit college degree . <p> And then there 's attitudes towards money and savings in this country .

For the first time in his life , he had over $10,000 in his checking account . He managed to secure a higher-paying position out there , and is only paying a bit more in rent than he was here . The results ? He 's got a couple hundred in his bank account . Why ? Gambling in Mexico , weed , beers . . . <p> When it comes to buying houses , well , all the people I know who are hovering just above ' check-to-check ' level are trying to figure out how to buy a home .

It 's as if these people , most of whom finally have their heads above water for the first time , ca n't wait to drown themselves in mortgage debt .

You 're a mature , good looking guy with solid game and a Juris Doctor . You can get more of her later on . <p> There 's just no rational reason to invest so much in one girl who a ) openly admits to sleeping around ( as others have said , that 8 is probably at least a 12-15 in actuality , maybe much more ) , b ) does n't seem particularly trustworthy ( she 's had another guy for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dicking around with you on the side-what makes you think she would n't do that to you if you got her ? Wan na take that chance ? ) and c ) is n't even really that invested in you particularly ( waffles on idea of committing to you , admits feelings for other guy she 's been fucking besides you , etc ) . <p> It would take a herculean effort of game for you to overcome this chick 's naturally slutty behavior and get her to be loyal to you , overcome her feelings for another man she 's been with for half a year , keep all of those feelings from coming back , AND guard her from the legions of other men going after her . By the time you 've made the investment necessary to get all of this done ( learning all of these " specialized tactics " ) , you will have already failed . As others have stated , that type of focus on one girl is death to successful game . It breeds outcome dependence , oneitis and profound betatude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Leave her alone . Do n't bother with " specialized tactics " or any of that other BS . You can get other girls , so go and do that .

I mean if she 's doing like 2 or 3 of the above then that 's a dead giveaway . But I do n't see any of those as EXTREMELY obvious . <p> I mean if a woman has a red skirt she thinks she looks good in , she 'll wear it regardless of how horny she is . Women wear low cut shit all the time , esp if they 're proud of their tits . Lipstick - same thing - she has full lips and thinks purple or bright red looks good . If there 's music playing , girls dance - if they 're having fun they 'll be loud . <p> Sipping her drink fast is more subtle but a strong giveaway that she wants to get loose . Looking around a lot is a pretty obvious giveaway too . <p> I personally do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I want , and figure out a way to make it happen . I 've met women dressed in fucking sweaters and jeans that were horny as hell but you 'd never know it until you get them alone . <p> Looking for these cues is a bad focus imo but it can be a fun experiment to test out if you have the time and patience to be scientific about it lol . <p> If you 're new to this just fucking approach the ones you think are hot , and do n't settle for UGs until it 's last call hahahha <p> In my experience the hottest girls are n't the onse giving you personally the most signs that they 're horny and into you , so you have a choice to approach either the less hot girls that are giving you signs their dtf or hotter girls who are maybe not as dtf . Approach whoever you want , but if your time is limited or you want to know which one to focus more energy on , choose the one with more signs . Roosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " The 9 Immutable Laws of Pick Up " and " One Bitch On Your Nuts is Worth 2 Trying to Peep . " <p> In short , these signs tell you more in what order to approach than who to approach , as well as what your chances of success are , but approach whoever you want . To me it would make more sense to approach girls in order of perceived interest level rather than attractiveness that so I do n't waste time/ lose my confidence vibe if it does n't work out with the hotter/less dtf girl , unless almost all the girls are ugly as hell or you 're running that game where you talk to the hottest girl first and then talk to the other girls about how that hottest girl was so superficial and bitchy . <p> If you EARNESTLY approach the hotter girl first and get rejected , that affects your game and vibe and lowers your confidence , consciously or subconsciously , making you run worse game and/or making that original girl , who was dtf , less attracted to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you leave the interaction before the hotter girl has a chance to reject you , you might get some social proof with those chicks that were giving you signs from before , so they get even more horny for you because they think they 're snagging a man who 's regularly a tier above them and regularly bangs hotter girls than them ; but that might be overkill . In addition though , that original hot chick who you ended the conversation with early might see you with these dtf chicks ( and girls can tell when other girls are trying to get the dick and turns them on ) , and see that as social proof . So you have the dtf girls seeing your approach with the hot girl as social proof , and the hot girl seeing the guy who left her to talk to more dtf girls as social proof ( assuming they 're at least decent ) in a two-way street of horny jealousy . <p> Btw , if anyone has used this strategy of ending a conversation with an attractive chick early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other girls in order to create jealousy within that attractive girl , do you find leaving her for more attractive girls or less attractive girls works better ? My thoughts are that if you leave her for a more attractive girl , she 'll feel more insulted than horny , but if you leave her for a less attractive girl , that will fuck with her mind/instincts so much that she 'll try to pull you back . <p> If you earnestly approach the girls who are giving you signs rather than the hotter girls , you have a better chance of going home with a girl for the night , but if you try to hop to the hotter girl in the middle , as roosh says , it wo n't end well . <p> ( 11-16-2011 05:12 AM ) XXL Wrote : i like to think that every girl is down to fuck until proven innocent : ) <p> Do what Ted from How I Met Your Mother did , assume she 's an escort whose already been paid to fuck your brains out at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good tip to put you in the right mindset especially for newbies . <p> - you 're paying for it . avoids pedestalization and approval seeking behaviors - you do n't have to be nice ( within reason ) = asshole game - you 're in the mindset that you will be fucking this girl regardless of what happens = confidence and aloofness . <p> ( 11-16-2011 05:12 AM ) XXL Wrote : i like to think that every girl is down to fuck until proven innocent : ) <p> Do what Ted from How I Met Your Mother did , assume she 's an escort whose already been paid to fuck your brains out at the end of the night .

My assumption is that any dude who is getting laid probably does this . So why did it help with those girls orgasm like it did ? <p> More on the eye contact : I had girls talk about how alluring and deep my eyes were . I merely have dark brown eyes , nothing special . But I would gaze hard with them , especially during sex . <p> One other thing I noticed is that the three girls I bonded hard with and said they came from penetration for the first time , I eventually came inside of - usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I wonder if your seed bonds girls to you and deepens the connection <p> I 'm not exactly a sexpert , and when I was racking up my notches - shortly after losing my virginity and trying to simply get some sexual experience in , I made girls orgasm from penetration . Several of these girls told me they had never came from penetration with any guy before . <p> My dick is about 6 and a half inches , so nothing insane . At the time , I was still relatively clueless as to what I was doing , so I did n't think it was anything besides me having good stamina and maybe having my dick shaped just right . To add to that I had only gone down on two of them and they came from penetration before I went down on them . <p> One of the girls had slept with over 15 guys and had never come from penetration before me . I knew she was n't lying about it because I could feel her orgasm hard on my dick . She ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ) My wife for instance - a FWB at the time- had only slept with one other person and was literally addicted to me . <p> During that time , I had been reading through Daniel Roses ' " Sex God " and he advocated a strong connection with women that involved physical , mental , and an emotional connection . Since I had newly lost my virginity , perhaps I was able to " bond " easier with girls and had n't experienced the burnout yet . ( Sex God is a must read . I managed to find a pdf of it , as it is insanely expensive online . ) <p> I used to get really into it with girls that I did fuck . Unusual shit . Hard deep eye contact . Choking , and then switching to gentle caressing and to a new position . I would even throw in Spanish phrases in and try to say them in a slight Antonio Banderas accent .

If a girl gets on top for at least ten minutes ( often much less than that ) and is able to move her hips , it 's almost 100% that she will have at least one orgasm in my experience . From me being on top alone , the percentage is far under 100% , but it does happen pretty often .

Send me a text whenever you are horny . " <p> Hey phoenix , <p> Putting all the morality of cheating aside , I think some women repress their sexual desires . This is why they do n't cum . It has nothing to with your physique or the rough sex . <p> Once you mentally touch the pleasure spot in her brain with some talk , she 's yours in bed . Then you fuck her tight and rough . <p> Women are not easily reverse-engineered . You can not make simple reductionist arguments like this . It 's more complex and variable from woman to woman . That does n't stop articles like these from coming out because men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These examples are from personal experience ( not mentioning them to brag , just to pass along info ) . <p> There are women out there who are highly orgasmic . It 's just part of their physiology . If they cum that easily it really wo n't matter if it 's their own fingers or an inept beta between their legs . Technique and story context does n't matter for women like this . They are wired more like men and therefore sex with them is an effortless endless spigot . ( Based on my personal experience with one , they do n't make good LTR material , but boy do I wish they did . ) <p> On the other side , there are all these studies that talk about how infrequently women cum from traditional intercourse . These studies tend to boil this down to physiology and not technique . Personal experience leads me to believe it is simply a matter of technique . <p> The thing with women , at least a significant chunk of them , is that they will develop their own sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moved by the men in their life . They can read all this mindblowing stuff in Cosmo but if reality does n't match the fantasy , then these kinds of women blame their bodies and just assume that 's as good as it 's gon na get . <p> I do n't know if this is the case with the younger hookup culture crowd . This just tends to be what I 'm running into with 40+ women who keep telling me boring tales of turn-taking--where the guy gives her 1 orgasm with simple finger on clit technique and then hops on for 5 minutes or less of missionary and then roll over and go to sleep . But just because younger women are on the cock carousel does n't necessarily mean the younger guys they 're with are so much more skilled .

What works for me is to err on the side of being slower , gentler , maintain more sensual touch and kissing , more full body contact , shallower thrusts with more pelvic-bone on pelvic-bone mashing . And most of all , you have to become a jedi at evaluating her body language while not becoming so focused on her that you lose your own arousal . <p> Also , I 've taken it as a given that a woman is going to have at least a 2:1 ratio of orgasms to mine , and those extras are going to happen either during foreplay or anytime I 've lost my erection , either because of the refractory period or because I allowed myself to focus too much on her .

@@96059400 @259400/ <p> A research on the relationship between ejaculation and serum testosterone level in men <p> Abstract The purpose of this study is to gain understanding of the relationship between ejaculation and serum testosterone level in men . The serum testosterone concentrations of 28 volunteers were investigated daily during abstinence periods after ejaculation for two phases . The authors found that the fluctuations of testosterone levels from the 2nd to 5th day of abstinence were minimal . On the 7th day of abstinence , however , a clear peak of serum testosterone appeared , reaching 145.7% of the baseline ( P &lt; 0.01 ) . No regular fluctuation was observed following continuous abstinence after the peak . Ejaculation is the precondition and beginning of the special periodic serum testosterone level variations , which would not occur without ejaculation . The results showed that ejaculation-caused variations were characterized by a peak on the 7th day of abstinence ; and that the effective time of an ejaculation is 7 days minimum . These data are the first to document the phenomenon of the periodic change in serum testosterone level ; the correlation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pattern and characteristics of the periodic change . <p> I find that my testosterone levels are higher when I 'm eating well , working out hard , sleeping well and encountering hot chicks in everyday life . When I 'm having sex they also seem to be higher expect for during the refractory period . <p> A week between jerk offs works best and if you 're meeting a chick and think you 'll be fucking her , save up so you 'll enjoy it more . Higher testosterone also leads you to be bolder in approaches because your brain really wants it much more than if you 've just jerked off . <p> A week is hard for any man but it can be done and when it is , it 's handsomely rewarding . I like to avoid jerking off often so I 'm always 100% ready for anything . Of course you 're always ready to fuck a hot chick but it 's much better to be at your peak . Just my 50 cents . <p> So is there concrete evidence , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testosterone is a huge deciding factor in a man 's muscle development , does that mean a guy could see improvements in the gym from not jerking off ( and thus maintaining a higher testosterone level ? ) I definitely am guilty of too much self satisfaction with high speed internet at my fingertips . It would be beneficial for me to take a break to increase my motivation with women , but if it will help with gains in the gym , then that will increase my focus and determination that much more . <p> I rememeber there was one guy on the mASF forums named ijjjji who was a proponent of holding back the jizz . I think he was mainly into holding back because of some far-eastern philosophy about certain energy forces being lost , but with this article I think it is pretty clear that not cumming ( at least from masturbation ) can be good for a guy . Testosterone is the male life force , and the more testosterone we have circulating through our veins ( metaphorical talk , not scientific , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article I 've given up on bating for a while and I feel a lot more desire , but according to the article there is n't actual pronounced testosterone increase until after day 7 so we 'll see how it will be a few days from now . <p> Okay , I 've heard about this whole " testosterone peaks on the 7th day " thing for awhile now and I 'd like to share my results . <p> Question : Does waxing the dolphin lower testosterone levels ? <p> Test : Only beat off on Saturday nights if no sex during that week . Do this for two weeks . <p> Control : Beat off every day and stop on Wed . Do this for the next week afterwards . <p> Results : <p> Week one . Insanely productive .

Regardless Saturday gave me nothing . <p> Week three . Jerk it Sunday , Monday , Tues , Wed . Did n't do much the entire week . Porn felt boring by Wed . The weekend was terrible ; I made few approaches and they went nowhere . I also notice my standards for the boner test were higher than normal . <p> Early Conclusions : <p> Both sex and masturbation lowered my energy level . After banging a girl on Friday for week-2 , I was quite passive the following night . Not masturbating , like it says in the Bible , seemed to be good for me . I 'd say not masturbating improved my game significantly . By keeping your ball sack full , interactions with women are less of a chore and your body is telling you " GO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Additionally , although sex with women drains you , just like masturbation does , of motivation to pick up new girls , banging a girl has the advantage of giving you experience and confidence with future interactions . So obviously the trade-off 's of banging a new girl are worth the diminished sex drive . <p> I continue to do the " no masturbation " technique . Not easy but it teaches self-control and promotes your ability with women . While it did n't improve my lifts , it definitely gave me more motivation to be at the gym . <p> ( 06-26-2011 02:21 PM ) Samseau Wrote : Okay , I 've heard about this whole " testosterone peaks on the 7th day " thing for awhile now and I 'd like to share my results . <p> After hearing similar things , I ran a pretty serious , extended experiment on myself a few months ago . <p> I went about eight weeks without jerking it all , adding the additional layer of religiously avoiding even an askance peek at porn or near-porn .

I sense some serious sexual confusion in that crowd . <p> Personally I 'm not into girls for their tits . I 've slept with and dated girls with tiny tits and girls with huge tits and frankly I do n't care much for really big breasts , especially if she 's not built right elsewhere . My favorite girls had medium to small breasts . I 'll take an athletic girl with a great ass and legs with A-cups over the typical top heavy chick I see every time .

On one hand they 're actually fairly conservative and family-oriented compared to the West , but most of their porn is full of weird fetishes that most Westerners would find bizarre . <p> I 've seen some of that transexual hentai porn .

@@96059412 @259412/ <p> Gentlemen , welcome to one of the most important blog posts you 'll ever read . All of the effort you 've put out in developing your game comes down to one final aspect : can you fuck her so good , that shell keep coming back for more ? <p> If you 've had any doubts about your sexual prowess , this article will lead you to the pussy promise land and will ensure that you have some tools to take it up a notch . Pun intended . <h> 5 . Focus On The Psychological , Not Just The Physical <p> I get emails weekly from readers who ask what is the best position to fuck a girl in and how long they should have sex for before cumming . Hear me loud and clear : fucking a girl properly is only partially physical . The rest is psychological . <p> Turning her on physically is a part of the process , but turning her mind on and getting into her head is what you want to do . This separates you from the boys who are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Guess what ? You 're not impressing her , in fact , she 's sick of switching positions every two minutes . <p> How do you get into her head and turn her on ? <p> There are two main aspects of this : <p> 1 . Talking Dirty To Her : open your mouth and vocalize the interaction . <p> " You like that do n't  you ? " <p> " That pussy feels so good " <p> 2 . Lead Her Through Commands <p> Do n't  do this : <p> " Would you like me to fuck you hard ? " <p> " Do you want to do doggy style ? " <p> No no no . You are an alpha caveman and you command her . She is there to please you . <p> Do this : <p> " Suck my cock hard . Slobber on it . " <p> " You 're my slut " <p> " You 're my dirty girl . Eat my cum " <p> " Open your mouth . Open your mouth my little whore . Swallow my cum . " <p> " Spread your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( doggy style ) <p> Note : Use " my " to provide ownership of her . Just saying " you 're a slut " does n't  help create the connection that Deep Conversion sex creates and can also put in her mind that you 're judging her , which will close her legs faster than a barn door in a tornado . Always use " my " . <h> 4 . Dominate Her Physically <p> Get the concept of the two of you lying on a bed of roses and gently having missionary sex out of your head , if you ever want to keep her around . That shit does n't  fly . You have to manhandle her and always be dominant , leading , and taking control . <p> Read closely : Women want to be taken by a man . <p> When she hops into bed with you , she 's hoping that you 'll know what you 're doing and will rock her body , not ask what position shed like to try next . If you could get a glimpse into a womans mind you would be stunned : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more so . <p> There 's a reason why the best selling book 50 Shades of Grey has women wet all over the world : they love this shit . <p> Any alpha playboy in development should know these few core positions and utilize them . Anything other than these is gravy , but these are great dominating positions that have served me well for over a decade . <p> Havent had any complaints , just compliments . <p> Doggy Style <p> The Jackhammer ( best G-spot position ) <p> " Ride My Cock " ( or commonly known as Cowgirl ) <p> Anything more is fine , but these are great tried and positions that allow you to dominate and to rest in the last one . Usually girls get off from riding a cock as well , so if you actually want to make her cum , then sit back and let her ride you for a bit . <p> Note : Clearly there 's tons of other positions that you can use , but start practicing with these . Practice makes perfect . <h> 3 . Get Rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being frequent porn viewers themselves and sexual experimentation to the 9th degree . What alpha males get , is that women actually fantasy and enjoy rough consensual sex . This is a part of the desire to be taken by a man and ravished like its the last time on earth that two humans have sex . here 's some tips : <p> -Pull Her Hair : <p> Grab towards the base of her head , not at the end . <p> If she has longer hair , you can wrap it around your hand while fucking her doggy style . Do a couple of hand wraps with her hair and pull consistently . Guaranteed she gets wetter than Free Willy . <p> -Choke Her : <p> When I say choke her , I mean apply some pressure on her throat with your hand , but ensure that she 's down for this by gently grabbing her neck during sex . If she freaks , then she 's not ready for it , or may simply not like it , but I have only met 2-3 girls out of the hundreds I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but test the waters . <p> -Spit On Her : <p> I 'm not talking about hawking up a lugi and spitting it in her eyes , I 'm talking about gathering a small amount of spit in your mouth and spitting on her tits , pussy , mouth and face . Start with spitting on her pussy , then nipples , then have her open her mouth by commanding her ( " Open your mouth my little slut " and spit in her mouth . This is highly fucking erotic . <p> If you shoot your load on her face , then odds are some cum will hit the floor . Cum on a mirror , the floor , or a glass coffee table and grab her by the hair/head and have her lick it all up on all fours . <p> Say this while doing it : " Eat my cum up . That 's my good whore . Lick it up , lick it up . Good girl " . Shell eat it up and be eating it up in her mind too . Do n't  be a pussy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods will survive just fine . <p> Rest assured gentlemen , the most innocent looking girls are the most slutty in bed . Unleash her inner slut with these moves . <h> 2 . Do n't  Try To Please Her , Have Her Please You <p> This is a big one gents . You have to get it through your head that by using frame and dominance , her pleasuring you , provides pleasure for her . Alpha males are dominant and get what they want from women . <p> They are not pussy footing around , eating a girls pussy out for an hour trying to make her cum . There 's a time and place for that , but not in the initial stages from ONS to repeat hookup partner . <p> To put this in simple terms : girls love to suck and fuck an alpha males cock and biologically have the instinct and craving to get his seed . <p> In other words , bitches want your cock n cum when you 're a High Value Male . Period . This is a fucking fact that will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their pussies . This has always been this way and always will . <p> She is your plaything and you should treat her as such . Fuck her like its the last time you 'll ever have sex again and do it for your pleasure , not hers . Ravish her , dominate her , open her mind by looking her in the eyes and talking dirty to her and you will rock her fucking world . <p> Many a time , I 've had sexy sluts tell me , " I love how you just take me and you 're like a wild animal while were fucking " . Think about that : " wild animal " . You sure as hell wont get a girl worked up by lying under the covers and gently penetrating her in the missionary position . <p> Note : I 'm not saying every sex session has to be pussy pounding time , but for one night stands you should focus on the techniques Ive laid out for you . These are tried and true and once she 's hooked , you can venture into mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know where my least favorite place to fuck a girl is ? A bed . Yep , its fucking boring to me . My favorite place is a public restroom in the handicap stall . At my pad ? Her bent over my bathroom counter facing the mirror . She has one leg on the counter and I 'm behind her fucking her while pulling her hair and maintaining eye contact with her in the mirror . Powerful stuff . <p> Want to really turn on a girl , get her wetter than Niagara Falls and have her truly get hooked on your sexual prowess ? Get Spontaneous . <p> The reason why sex gets predictable between partners is because they get into routines . You have to live in the moment . <p> Pull in her the alley behind a dumpster up against the wall , hike her skirt up and go to town . <p> Slip into a one toilet restroom , lock the door and bend her over the counter . <p> Obviously be smart and make sure you 're not within plain sight , but mix it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex at the drop of the hat provides them and you will too , if you stop thinking of sex of always having to take place on a bed . You 'll find that as you incorporate mixing up where you have sex , that itll unleash an animal like instinct in you , and you 'll ravish her body . <p> Take advantage of my temporary lapse in sanity and get my system for 30% OFF in my Memorial Day Weekend Sale .
