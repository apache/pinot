Beginning in the early 1920s , Stew helped his father deliver milk and other dairy products and took over the dairy when his father passed away ; Stew was just 21 years old . A state-of-the-art dairy by the standards of the time , with a pasteurizing and bottling plant , Clover Farms was a fixture in the neighborhoods of Fairfield County , known for its farm-fresh products and delivery trucks that were crowned with plastic cows that " mooed " when neighborhood children waved . <p> From Clover Farms , Stew traversed many changes-those brought by the state , others by the marketplace-to forge what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving millions of customers every year , employing 2,500 Team Members , and selling annually 3 million half gallons of milk , 4 million bagels , 500,000 pounds of lobster , and 50,000 Christmas trees . As an industry leader , Stew Leonard 's is studied in university management programs around the country , and is visited by scores of companies every year to understand its practices , bringing a reputation for business leadership to Connecticut . <p> Stew Leonard 's has remained a family business . To ensure that his children would find a role in the business and carry it forward , Stew worked with each to help them find a passion that could be unleashed within the company . Eldest son Stew Leonard , Jr . earned a master of business administration at UCLA and in 1987 took over as President and CEO . Stew 's daughter Beth founded Bethy 's Bakery , the largest in-store scratch bakery in the country . Stew 's daughter Jill is Executive Vice President of Culture and Communication , helping 2,500 Team Members to not only do a great job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his son Tom , who opened and served as the president of the Danbury store , set off create his own franchise , opening Tom Leonard 's Farmers Market in 2004 in Richmond , Virginia . Like their father , Stew Jr. , Beth and Jill are all Connecticut residents who contribute regularly to business forums and seek to improve the business climate of the state . <p> Stew Leonard 's , in addition to being known for its business success , is also widely known for contributions to local and national charities . Stew always sought to give generously and regularly to both worthwhile causes and to recognize the achievements of others . From donating turkeys at Christmas to local families who needed them , to donating each day 's unsold goods to local churches and soup kitchens , to rewarding Team Members with turkeys at Thanksgiving , giving back to the community has been a closely held value from the earliest days . In the 41 years since , Stew Leonard 's has built a reputation in our local communities as a generous and giving corporate neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal and professional enrichment , for both his Team Members and for the larger community . From hosting the bestselling author Tom Peters in a local speech at the Longshore Country Club-to which Stew invited hundreds of local business leaders as well as the leaders from his store-to underwriting Dale Carnegie coursework for more than 1,500 of Stew Leonard 's Team Members over the years , to creating a tuition reimbursement program that allowed many Team Members to pursue higher education , Stew has always sought to encourage and support the aspirations of those around him . As a result , Stew Leonard 's boasts a management team that is home-grown : 88% of company leaders have been promoted from within , many starting on the front lines at the cash registers or serving customers in the deli or produce departments . <p> Stew is still very active in the business and is a strong believer in the power and value of the family business .

Stew and his wife Marianne , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and personal time to not only mentoring their children , but also their 13 grandchildren , to ensure that they each find a passionate and rewarding path at Stew Leonard 's . <h> Professional Accomplishments <p> The path to becoming one of the retail industry 's most recognized and celebrated leaders was the result of Stew 's enduring desire to serve his customer in the best possible way . In the late sixties , Stew realized the milk delivery business was changing--going the way of the iceman , he said . He believed that it was time for a fundamental change in the way his dairy operated , an idea that was driven home when the state informed him that Clover Farms Dairy was in the path of the expansion of a new highway , Route 7 . Faced with this challenge , and yet wanting to maintain the supply of fresh dairy to Connecticut ( when most other available dairy came from farms far away and was sold in super markets ) Stew 's dream was to bring the dairy experience to a retail store . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottled , where they could see the farm animals that produced the milk and eggs , and that offered customers the freshest possible products , all in a farmer 's market atmosphere . In December , 1969 , Stew Leonard 's opened its doors as a 17,000 square foot store carrying just eight items . <p> Stew Leonard 's has grown at an amazing pace since 1969 . With 30 additions to the original store , and with three additional grocery stores and nine wine stores , the company generates more than $400 million in annual sales . The path to success , which has been studied and touted in the business press and in best-selling books , including in the +G-In Search of Excellence ' series , springs from Stew 's deep and ongoing desire to create new and better ways to serve the customer . The company has become known for constantly pushing the standards of excellence and customer service to new heights and its leadership in food trends , resulting in not only a great place to shop , but also a great place to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy business and marketing with his core philosophies of quality , integrity and empowerment , which have shaped the mission of the company .

In fact , unlike traditional grocery stores that sell an average of 30,000 items , each Stew Leonard 's store carries only 2,000 items , chosen specifically for their freshness , quality and value . The company opened a second store in Danbury in 1991 and a third Connecticut store in Newington in 2007 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal shoppers is largely due to their passionate approach to customer service : " Rule #1 -- The Customer is Always Right " ; Rule #2 - If the Customer is Ever Wrong , Re-Read Rule #1 . " This principle was born soon after the store opened in 1969 , and one that Stew wanted to be sure that no one missed , so he had it etched into the face of a three-ton granite rock at the store 's entrance . <p> In 2009 , Stew penned an autobiography , My Story , with co-author and Greenwich resident Scotty Reiss . In it , he tells the story of his relentless search for and unwavering commitment to excellence , explaining how the store 's dedication to customer service , its reputation for fresh-from-the-farm products , and its renowned and entertaining retail environment came about .

What size turkey should I buy and how far in advance can I buy it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet everyone 's needs ! Our turkeys weigh in anywhere between 12lbs toget ready for this28lbs ! - Now that 's a big bird ! - But I think that having leftovers is just as important as the big meal itself , so I always make sure that we have a bird that allows for 2lbs. per person. - If you 're not a fan of leftovers though , I think that 1.5 lbs per person is just fine. - Our fresh turkeys can be purchased 10 days in advance , giving you more time to prepare for the big day ! <p> Q. What 's the difference between the different turkeys you sell ? A. Our fresh turkeys are from the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and have no artificial ingredients added to them. - My family always gets our all natural free range Naked Turkey to put on the table- these turkeys are fed a 100% vegetarian diet and are NEVER given antibiotics or added hormones. - We like cooking this bird because it has 20% more breast meat and 55% less fat than regular turkeys ! - Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started offering kosher as well as Organic turkeys . <p> Q. How should I store my turkey prior to cooking ? A. Once you have your turkey home , it should be stored in the coldest part of your refrigerator , which is the bottom back corner. - Keep it wrapped in the plastic until just ready to begin preparing. - Our chefs also recommend putting the raw turkey on a plate or in a pan just to make sure no juices accidently drip inside the refrigerator . <p> Q. How do I prep my oven and turkey before cooking ? A. I always follow a few simple guidelines to make sure our turkey is cooked to perfection . Prior to the big day I make sure the oven is clean as this helps concentrate the heat . Second , I make sure the oven is fully preheated- I generally turn the oven on when I take the bird out of the refrigerator to begin preparing it. - That way , a bit of the chill is gone from the turkey giving it the opportunity to cook at a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh the temperature reads 180 degrees F.- Oven temperatures vary , so I always start checking my bird 45 minutes before I think it might be done just in case we can start eating earlier ! <p> Q. Does your family stuff the turkey before roasting ? - I 've heard it 's not safe but everyone seems to be doing it ! A. We like to use our chef 's Turkey Marinade inside of our bird- it gives the meat a wonderful flavor and the aroma is incredible ! If your family really prefers to stuff your turkey , just be sure to place fully cooked stuffing in the turkey right before roasting , never the night before ( this could grow bacteria ) , and make sure the stuffing is 165 degrees F before removing from the oven . Keep in mind that when you stuff the bird the cook time increases slightly , up to 5 extra minutes per pound of turkey . <p> CHEF MICHAEL 'S PERFECT TURKEY Executive Chef Michael Luboff joined Stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Thanksgiving turkeys over the course of his 40 year career overseeing kitchens and culinary teams at casinos and resorts. - His secret for a juicy bird is to cook it low and slow ! <p> Directions : - - - Mix Stew Leonard 's Aromatics ( onions , celery , oranges , apples , garlic cloves ) with the bay leaves. - Season the mixture with salt &amp; pepper . - - - Stuff the aromatics mixture into turkey cavity . - - - Rub the outside of turkey with extra virgin olive oil and then season it with salt &amp; pepper . - - - Cover turkey with a double layer of tin foil , tucked into the sides of the roasting pan . - - - Cook turkey under foil in a 400 degrees F oven for 45 minutes then drop the temperature to 300 degrees F for about 2 hours , give or take . - - - Remember : all turkeys will cook differently ! - Be sure to insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh and cook until the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stew 's Catering teams offer a number of turkey options for Thanksgiving Dinner. - For families who want their entire dinner catered from soup to nuts , there 's a Dinner for 8 priced at $140 that includes a medium roasted turkey , stuffing , a choice of two sides , turkey gravy , cranberry orange sauce , snowball rolls , and either an apple or pumpkin pie. - Oven ready turkeys start at $70 for a fresh turkey from the Shenandoah Valley or $90 for a Naked , free range turkey ; all oven ready turkeys can additionally be cooked at Stew 's for an additional $25. - For smaller gatherings or for extra turkey for your holiday table , Stew 's chefs also offer roasted sliced turkey breast ( $70 ) or sliced boneless turkey thigh ( $50 ) . <p> This is in addition to a dozen home-style side dishes , including new offerings like Corn Chipotle &amp; Honey Pudding as well as local Butternut Squash with Honey. - Perennial favorites , like Idaho Mashed Potatoes , Sweet Potato Mousse , and Brussels Sprouts with Bacon are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au gratin , and other delectable vegetable dishes. - - Stew 's homemade Cranberry Orange Sauce is cooked up fresh with real cranberries , white sugar , cinnamon and an orange peel while the Old Fashioned Turkey Gravy is made with fresh turkey stock seasoned with fresh herbs and garlic .

I came up with this one playing around in the kitchen before a pumpkin cook-off , and , would you believe , it won that big old blue ribbon . It 's different " with a whole lot of flavors and textures " but they 're all balanced . In each slice , you get the chocolate from the Oreos on top , the crunch of the mixed nuts , and then the smoothness of the cake . The mixed party nuts sound a little bit crazy , but , I promise , they work " they give every bite just a bit of a distinct flavor from the last one . Greek yogurt makes a real rich batter , and the lemon-flavored kind is just so good with the pumpkin . <p> Make the cookie crunch : Butter four 9-inch cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until finely ground .
