@@83647612 @5147612/ <h> Thursday , 17th July 2014 <p> Tableau has a myriad of direct connectors to different data sources , including a convenient Google Analytics connector ( it " s still using Core API v2 instead of the new v3 though ) . However , what Tableau does n't  have is a direct connection to Adobe Analytics ( formerly Adobe SiteCatalyst and Omniture ) . In this post , I 'm going to show you a relatively simple workaround to building an automated SiteCat dashboard using Tableau Online or Server , especially if you are not ready for the full featured data warehouse options . <p> There are many ways to get data out of SiteCatalyst including downloading from the interface , extracting from Ad-hoc Analysis ( formerly Discover ) , creating Data Warehouse requests , or utilizing the Report Builder add-in for Excel . Consequently , there are three main options for an automated data pull from SiteCat : <p> Setting scheduled Data Warehouse requests to an ftp and then feeding these data pulls into a data warehouse . <p> Scheduling Report Builder to send out refreshed data to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for massive data and reporting needs ; the second for raw data pull and basic Excel chart . The third option gives you the full visualization power of Tableau Desktop while avoiding dependencies on data warehouse developers . ( fyi , I 'm using Tableau Desktop and Tableau Online . Also , our executable file is a . vbs file scheduled to run daily . ) Now let 's do it ! <p> To install Report Builder , sign in to SiteCatalyst , go to Analytics &gt; Report Builder , and follow the instruction . This should install the COM add-in in Excel . <p> Go to Excel , click on the Add-ins Tab , sign in to SiteCat , then click Create . Here you can specify your report suite , segment , type of report , time frame , granularity . Make sure to choose either rolling dates or dates from cell so the data refreshes according to the refresh date . You can use customized expressions ( see below ) for rolling dates . <p> Click Next , and in the next window you can select metrics , dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . You can format and filter data by clicking " Format " or " Top 1-10 " ( the default filter ) in the Row Labels next to the dimension names . Hit finish when you 're done . <p> Wait for the data to be retrieved . Feel free to tweak the requests until you are satisfied . For Tableau purposes , each sheet should only have one request . <p> 2 . Create an Excel macro to refresh all Report Builder requests . <p> The first step to running report builder was to create a macro to run it . <p> To setup your excel workbook well begin by enabling developer mode in excel . - To start , click the button in the upper left hand corner of excel as you would to open a new workbook , only were going to select " excel options " . - Youll want to make sure you have a check next to the " Show Developer tab in the Ribbon " option . - From here you 'll want to click on the developer tab ( its right after view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once on that tab , click on " View Code " ( towards the middle of the available options ) . - This will launch a new blank space for your code to go . - For ours , we put the code into a module which can be accomplished by right-clicking the VBAproject , mousing over " insert " and selecting " Module " . - Once there , simply paste and save your code/workbook . <p> I 'm not going to walk through most of this code since its not something I wrote , however I do want to point out the line UnProtectAll ( line 2 ) of the macro. - We were having some trouble getting report builder to run due to the sheet being in a " Protected " state. - This is another macro I cant take credit for , but if you google " UnProtectAll macro excel " you should be able to find code similar to the macro were calling. - If you 're doing this from an Unprotected workbook/worksheet , then there should be no need for this code . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tableau Online or Server . <p> Open Tableau and connect to the appropriate Excel file . Choose the extract all data option . Once you have all of your data extracts , right click on each of them and select Publish to Server . You can select a project , rename the data source , change authorization before hitting Publish . <p> 4 . Connect to the published data sources and create your dashboards . <p> You can close all of the extracts as soon as you publish them . Go to the Data window and the published data sources should be on the right hand side . Connect to all the appropriate ones to build your dashboard. - Make sure that you are using the published data sources and not the original data extracts . <p> Once completed , publish the dashboard to Tableau Online by going to Server &gt; Publish Workbook . You are almost done ! The last step is to schedule Report Builder to refresh and push the data to Tableau . <p> 5 . Creating a . vbs file to refresh the data requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vbs file was the most challenging part of this project for us due to the difficulty we had testing it ( the file we worked with was large and it took report builder roughly 15 minutes to run per trial ) . - The code is posted in its entirety here . <p> Running the Macro <p> Jumping right in , the first part of this project was developing a script that could run the Report Builder macro. - I had a few options for languages , but ended up going with VBScript ( I was more familiar with this than Batch Scripting , and this seemed to have more support and more documentation out there to get it to interact with Excel ) . - So I setup my . vbs file and began with my first subroutine RunMacro(). - There are 4 main areas of interest here : <p> 1 ) On line three , you 'll want to update the FILEPATHFILENAME line to point to your excel spreadsheet. - The extension should stay the same . <p> 2 ) Line 5 you 'll need to update FILENAME with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 ) Line 7 , WScript.Sleep puts the program to sleep while report builder runs. - The number that follows this is in milliseconds , so adjust accordingly. - Youll need report builder to completely finish before Saving and Closing , otherwise you 'll end up with some blank pages and pushing bad data ! <p> 4 ) xl.Quit quits all open instances of xl. - If you have other workbooks open and you want it to stay that way , consider removing this line. - The sheet itself should still close . <p> Pushing to Tableau <p> Once we had report builder running from our script , the next step was pushing the data to tableau . <p> The second subroutine is PushData(). - To do this , we need to run tableau from a command line. - The first two lines of this script ( 16 and 17 ) set all of that up for you. - Its worth noting that the current directory needs to point to a Tableau 8.1bin. - This is currently set to where tableau default installs , but if you have it installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Line 18 is where we handle the actual push. - This was a little long to screen shot , but there 's a bunch of stuff you 'll want to update here as pointed out in the code ( anything in caps will need to be updated with your information ) . - - You can also set up this portion of the code yourself by visiting the tableau site here , - then just paste in the working version after cmd /k ( this sets it up for the push ) . <p> Calling the Subroutines <p> The final part of all of this is just calling the subroutines themselves . <p> At that point , the macro will run then push the data to the tableau server ! <p> 6 . Schedule the . vbs file to run daily/weekly/hourly or as you wish . <p> On your computer , go to Task Scheduler , click " Create Task " and give it a name . <p> Go to the Trigger tab , click on " New " and modify the refresh schedule as desired ( mine is set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click " New " and choose " Start a program . " Use Browse to navigate to the . vbs file and hit ok . <p> Feel free to tweak the task until it fits your needs . <p> And you 're done ! <p> Now every day at your specified time the Excel file will open , refresh the SiteCat data pulls , save , then push it to Tableau published data sources . Any dashboards that use these data sources would be automatically updated with the data . Congratulations , you 've set up a " direct connection " from Tableau to SiteCatalyst . The data will be as fresh as your scheduled updates . 188226 @qwx808226

As simple as it sounds , sample size is fundamentally important to statisticians because the size of a sample can make or break an analysis . Too small of a sample , and the results may not be significant . Too large of a sample , and the data can become unwieldy and difficult to manage . <p> In the marketing world , it is always important to be mindful of sample size , especially with all of the recent buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that data sets are only growing ; I will have the opportunity to work with a data set that has upwards of 400 million records . In a situation like this , sampling will come in handy because it will reduce processing time and make for a quicker analysis . <p> Generally speaking , sampling 10% of the population is a good rule of thumb in statistics . <p> 2 . Mean/median <p> The mean and median are both statistics used to measure the center of a sample . The mean is what most people refer to as the average , and the median is the middle data point ( or spot between two middle points if the sample size is even ) . These two statistics can have similar or different values depending on the distribution or shape of the data . Conversely , knowing the mean and median can allow the distribution of data to be determined if it is unknown . <p> In the image below , three different distributions are presented : symmetric , right-skewed , and left-skewed . A symmetric distribution has the same mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of data toward the left ( skewed right refers to the direction of the tail ) , so the mean is greater than the median . The opposite is true of a left skewed distribution . <p> In marketing , I have found the mean to be the appropriate measure more times than the median , but that does not mean the median can not be used . The mean is more sensitive to outliers and influential points , while the median is more robust . That is why the mean gets pulled in the direction of the tail for a skewed distribution . Therefore , when there are many extreme data points , the median should be used instead . <p> For example , in a traffic by source report ( direct , banner ad , search , referral , social networks , etc ) one can determine where people are coming to the site from . If there are normally 30 visits from social networks but one day there is a jump to 2,500 visits due to a widely popular post of Facebook , the visits from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would falsely inflate the year-to-date mean number of visits from social networks , so using the median would be useful in this case . <p> 3 . Correlation/causation <p> " Correlation , not causation " is a catch phrase commonly used by statisticians . Knowing the difference between correlation and causation is one of the most important concepts in statistics ( and life ) . Many people do not know their proper definitions and often confuse the two . <p> Correlation occurs when two or more variables have a relationship with each other . For example , height and weight are positively correlated because as height increases , weight generally increases as well . These variables display correlation , but not necessarily causation . Height and weight may seem directly causal , but there are other confounding variables that have an effect on a persons weight such as health , gender , race , diet , exercise , and so on . <p> Causation is similar to correlation in that it occurs when two or more variables are related to each other . However , it differs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in other variables , while with correlation that is not necessarily the case . For example , the greater amount of time you exercise , the more calories you will burn and this is a direct causal relationship . These variables display both correlation and causation . <p> It is so important not to confuse these two concepts . Unless you know for sure that two variables have a causal relationship , always assume correlation and not causation . For example , a company may launch a new marketing campaign with a lot of banner advertisements and then receive a lot of traffic to their site . However that same week there was also a Facebook post by that company about winning a free prize . While the number of ads and number of visitors to the site are positively correlated , it is not correct to assume that the ads themselves were responsible for increased traffic because the Facebook post is a confounding variable most likely causing the traffic . <p> With a new understanding of these three statistical concepts , you are now ready to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next networking event , why not strike up a conversation about correlation ? Some will chime in , and those who do not will just think you are really smart , so its definitely a win-win .

Otherwise , you could be suspected of leading the witness. - Your job when presenting analysis to executives should be to present ALL the facts as you see them and subsequently help guide them to making a sound decision on their own not to make the decision for them . <p> At the risk of seeming contradictory , make an exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case , you should absolutely be ready to give it. - Just make sure to emphasize that there may be multiple ways to interpret the data . <p> #2 Provide Context <p> No analysis is done in a vacuum. - Theres always a reason for conducting it , as well as a plethora of factors that go into what data is used , where the data comes from and the methodology you choose to approach it . <p> Explaining the story of how you got from point A to point B will go a long way toward helping executives understand how and why you reached your conclusions , and to their being able to effectively and independently reach a conclusion of their own. - Without that history , your analysis is at risk of being misinterpreted , downplayed or even dismissed . <p> It may even help to outline as many alternate ways to interpret the data as you can . - Touch upon the possible benefits/implications of each. - If you 're asked , explain why you might favor one interpretation over another. - Doing this gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enabling your audience to better judge the outcome for themselves . <p> #3 Obsess Over Accuracy <p> Mistakes are only human. - But nothing torpedoes the results of an analysis ( and your credibility ) more than errors , especially careless ones. - And they can run the gamut from missing data to incorrect calculations to a misplaced decimal point to using the wrong dates . <p> Nothing torpedoes the results of an analysis ( and your credibility ) more than errors , especially careless ones . <p> Unfortunately , the room for error is almost endless. - To mitigate the risk of getting something wrong , you should obsess over getting it right. - Your reputation is at stake. - Executives will appreciate that you did n't rush your work out the door. - Spend the time to double , triple and even quadruple check your work . <p> Take a step back , put yourself in the shoes of your audience and try to question your numbers the way they would question them. - Does everything add up ? - Does everything make sense ? - Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else for one final review before you take it to your executive team . <p> With time , patience and attention to detail , I promise that your chances of success will increase greatly. - We call this process " Quality Assurance . " - And to earn executive trust , its a must . <p> #4 Admit Your Mistakes <p> If being accurate helps build trust , admitting it when you 're not reaps similar rewards. - This might sound difficult if your impulse is to hide your mistakes. - But believe me when I say that you will get far more respect for owning up when you 're wrong than if you cover it up and are caught . <p> You will get far more respect for owning up when you 're wrong than if you cover it up and are caught . <p> Honesty is always the best policy , with no exceptions . - And that does n't  just go for your data or your analysis ; it goes for what you know and what you do n't  know. - No one expects you to know everything. - If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Just say so and that you will find out . <p> Admitting mistakes and being honest applies to everything you do at work and at home. - This includes ( but is not limited to ) the hours you say you put in , reasons you say you 're late , what you say happened to your computer , etc. - Integrity is so important that its even one of- MaassMedias- core values . <p> #5 Be Thoughtful About How- What and When To Communicate <p> How , - what- and- when- you communicate can have a major impact on how trustworthy you are perceived to be , too . <p> On- what- you communicate , it is important to know your audience and explain yourself clearly in terms they will understand. - For instance , whether you are delivering a message by email , phone or in person you should refrain from using jargon just to sound smart ( smart people will think you 're full of it ) . - Talking too much or being long-winded can turn people off and be a sign that you do n't  listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people off and be a sign that you do n't  listen . <p> You should also be respectful no matter the audience. - Personally , anyone who treats the people who take out the office trash with the same courtesy they show toward the CEO is held high in my esteem. - My best advice on- how- you communicate is to be authentic , but aware . <p> Bear in mind , it does no one any good to spend an hour speaking or writing only to leave your audience scratching their heads wondering what the heck it was that you just said. - A professional who is good at his/her job will reduce confusion , not create it. - The time you spend to gather and effectively articulate your thoughts is time well spent . <p> Lastly , - when- to communicate ? - The simple answer is , early and often. - If you get an email at 5:37 AM requesting your help , do n't  wait until 4:00 PM to respond , even if you do n't  have an answer or the time to find out. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sent the email could be sitting there growing anxious by the minute . - She might be concerned if you even got her message , much less why you have n't responded . <p> At the very least , you should acknowledge you got the request and that you will be back in touch soon. - That buys you some time to prepare an appropriate answer and creates the impression that you 're on it. - Then as the day goes on , consider sending an update or two about your progress. - Executives deserve timely responses to their questions- and will appreciate your diligence. - Thus , they 'll likely be more receptive should you need their support down the road . <p> #6 Follow-Through <p> Missed deadlines. - Broken promises. - Forgotten details that somehow slipped through the cracks. - You do not want a reputation as someone who does n't  follow-through. - Consistently doing what you say you will do demonstrates that you are someone who can be depended upon , and it builds trust . <p> Stray from that standard more than a few times and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Plan your daily schedule around commitments that have the highest priority <p> Plan ahead <p> #7 Semper Paratus <p> This is my last tip. - Remember that kid the teacher called on in class who did n't  know the answer because he had n't  done his homework ? - Its embarrassing. - Do n't  be that kid. - Professionals expect professionals to be prepared . <p> Remember that kid the teacher called on in class who did n't  know the answer because he had n't  done his homework ? Do n't  be that kid . <p> For meetings , spend a few minutes before learning the agenda , reviewing the names and backgrounds of attendees , gathering your research , and coming up with some questions to ask . <p> For analyses , make sure you fully understand what the business questions and goals are before you start collecting data. - Also , ask enough clarifying questions to make sure everyone is aligned on what success looks like . <p> Being prepared means anticipating what your audience wants and needs. - If you take the time to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft answers and solutions that will hit the mark and earn trust . <p> Preparation is so important that its even the U.S. Coast Guards official motto , - Semper Paratus , or " Always Ready . " - You would like your audience to trust you and your analysis the same way you trust the Coast Guard to save your drowning ass , right ? - Incorporate a similar philosophy on preparedness into your own professional practice and I guarantee it will not go unnoticed . <p> If current events have thrown the world into a crisis of trust , the last thing any of us needs is for that to affect our own personal and professional lives. - After all , trust helps hold our families and friends together. - Trust helps us get and keep our jobs. - And for the purpose of this post , trust matters when presenting data to executives if being heard and believed is important to you . <p> Follow the seven tips I outlined above on how to be a beacon of truth in an era of alternate facts and earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I promise it will go a long way towards you having a successful career , no matter your role or industry , one of which you can be proud . 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647633 @5147633/ <h> Tuesday , 10th June 2014 <p> Hello and welcome to the first installment of the phila-data blog . The only blog dedicated to everything Philadelphia using data to make things fun . Enough with the boring introductions , let 's get into the data . First up .. BIKES ! Biking in Philly has taken off in the past 5-10 years . Weve seen the introduction of numerous new bike lanes and racks , as well as bikers all over the city . Besides getting into an accident , one of the worst things that can happen to a biker is having his whip stolen . ( whip = stylish name for ones bicycle ) Fortunately , I can say this has never happened to me but there are a lot of folks who have lost their precise rides . So let 's take a look . Overall , bikes thefts have clearly been on the rise and should continue an upward trend through 2014 . Interestingly we see a cyclical effect as each year bike thefts peak during the summer months . This makes sense ; as the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more inventory and more opportunity for thieves . This is a view of all reported bike thefts in the city of Philadelphia over the past 3.5 years . The red dots are all of the reported stolen bikes by longitude and latitude . The blue/green shading is just population data . As you can clearly see the majority of bikes are stolen in and around center city . Let 's take a closer look . Above is a close up view of the same 3.5 years worth of data . I filtered by location for places where 5 or more stolen bikes have been reported . You might want to remember this image next time you 're thinking about leaving your bike locked up outside over night . Now these next two locations were hottest spots in the city for reported thefts . First up , city hall ! Yes , you heard me correctly but I think that the data may be a little skewed in this case . One factor that may have led to this being number one is that you can usually find a police officer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen within a few blocks you may be looking for a cop and stumble upon one at city hall . Even if that is the case , this is still a hot bed for thieves . The entrance to the Schuylkill River trail comes in at #2 for the highest number of reported bike thefts in the city . This totally makes sense as a lot of bikes come through here so definitely be careful when locking up your whip and leaving it here . ( Also of note , the most expensive bikes are being stolen from this location . ) So besides location data and where bikes thefts are occurring I found out some other interesting facts . First off , it does n't  look like there is any correlation between where bike racks are located and where bikes are stolen from . My assumption is that this may be the case because riders lock up their bikes everywhere : fences , poles , gates , railings , etc. and not just on traditional bike racks . Second , the number of reported stolen bikes increases throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report is filed and not when the actual theft occurred . ) Before the analysis my assumption was that we would see a much higher number in the morning . People wake up to find their bikes stolen and file a report , but actually we see theft reports peak between 3pm 8pm . So do you know where you local police district is head quartered ? You should , but if not you can find it here : **26;84;TOOLONG . Anyway , below are thefts by police district over the past 3.5 years ( 2013 was not complete when data was acquired ) .

@@83647649 @5147649/ <h> Tuesday , 10th June 2014 <p> So like many other residents of this region I am a Philadelphia sports fan . Ive been a fan of all four major sports since I was a young kid . I remember the 93 Phillies , Allen Iverson dragging us to the NBA Finals , Eric Lindross bad back , the Flyers inability to beat the Devils in the playoffs , and the list goes on . <p> One criticism that we hear from outsiders a lot is that Philadelphia fans are not loyal . They support their teams in the good times , but not the bad . So is this really true ? Are we flighty as a fan base ? Also , are fans of one sport more loyal than fans of another sport ? I decided to take a look at these questions using some data . The most direct way we can measure loyalty is through fan attendance . It takes effort and money to get yourself down to the ballpark . Immediately I had to remove the outliers ; the Eagles and the Sixers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 've been sold out for as long as I can remember . The polar opposite Sixers have been abysmal since Iverson left and there really is n't anything to cheer for . ( If you take issue with these exclusions please feel free to comment or email me directly . ) This leaves the Phillies and the Flyers . <p> Above is a breakdown of home attendance stats for each team by year . I also include their playoff records by individual year . My thinking by this was as such : If a team has a good year , which would be determine by their playoff run , are fans more loyal ? <p> We can clearly see this correlation happening with the Phillies . Attendance peaked for the Phils in 2011 with a home percentage of 104% and an average game attendance of 45.4K . <p> 2006 was a low point for the team attendance wise . The team had missed the playoffs for a number of years and attendance was down to 79% or 34.2K per game . As the team improved and eventually won the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was riding high off of the championship win and attendance remained up in the next few years . <p> Last year the team was bad , real bad . And this was the first year we saw a significant drop off as attendance was down to 85% . I did look at the data so far for 2014 and the number is even worse , just about 70% . I decided not to include this data as I 'm not sure if there are cyclical patterns around MLB attendance , i.e higher numbers as the weather warms and the season moves into summer , but so far things do not look good . <p> The Flyers on the other hand have a solid track record of strong attendance over the eight years examined . Only one year did they fall below the 100% attendance mark and that was in 2006 . Since that time theyve remain at or above the 100% mark , that 's pretty impressive . During that span the Flyers did not win a championship , but they did have a solid playoff track record and also made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some factors that do not make this a 1 to 1 comparison : arena size , length of season , league strikes , etc . If you have thoughts about factoring for such things please feel free to shoot me a message with your ideas . To level things out I decided to look at the two teams and compare them to the rest of the teams in their respective leagues . <p> Surprisingly , the Phillies have been killing it compared to the rest of the majors . I was unaware that MLB attendance was so low . Over the period measured the Phils managed to fill about 85% of the seats compared to the rest of the majors who are filling only 65% , a 20 basis point difference . That is significant . <p> The Flyers on the other hand were only slightly above the rest of the league averaging about 100% attendance compared to the league attendance rate of about 97% . This does tell us something . Its much easier to fill the seats in the NHL . Is this because of arena size or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we do know that the NHL has a really strong fan base overall . <p> So does this data prove anything ? I 'm not really sure , but it does help to move the conversation forward and give us sports fans something to talk and debate about . And is n't that all we really want anyway ? <p> Gregory Kaminski is a data analyst and client manager with MaassMedia and has 15 years of experience in data and analysis .

@@83647658 @5147658/ <h> Friday , 13th September 2013 <p> Its that time of year again and I know all of you fantasy football fans are out there trying to set your lineups . Week 1 has passed ( I won my match up , thank you ) but there is still a lot of season to go and lots of line up tweaking to do . <p> I 'm assuming like everyone else you troll all of the typical fantasy sites to find out " insider " information on what players are going to be hot that week . Then you take that information and make a best estimate on who to pick . This is standard protocol for most fantasy competitors . So why not take the guess work out by using data , analytics and maybe a little bit of statistics ? <p> 1 . Getting Data <p> So one option is doing all of the heavy analysis lifting yourself . Do you have Excel ? Awesome , because its actually a really powerful analysis tool . Before we get to the analysis though we need the raw data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can download raw data in CSV format which works really well in Excel . <p> Once you download the data in CSV format you can just use the " Text to Columns " function under the data tab to clean it up for analysis purposes . <p> If you 're going to analyze a group of running backs I would grab at least three years worth of data . Then pick some metrics that you want to focus on : age , rushing attempts , rushing yards , total yards , touchdowns , fumbles , etc . Once you get the data cleaned up and in a usable format you can move on to the analysis . <p> 2 . Analysis Tools <p> Excel comes stock with some data analysis tools that can be really useful and easy to manage . Two that I use on a regular basis are located in Functions : Forecast and Correl . <p> The Forecast function returns the predicted value of the dependent variable for the specific value , x , of the independent variable . What does this mean ? If you have several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict future values e.g. rushing yards in 2013 . This obviously is not fool proof , but the more data points that you have the more accurate it can be . <p> The Correl function in Excel Returns the correlation coefficient of two groups of data . You can use the this to determine the relationship between two properties . For example , I may look at data on running backs to try and determine if a players age is a factor in their performance . I could compare age with rushing yards or total fantasy points last year to determine if there is an age range or specific age of a running back that generates the most fantasy points . <p> 3 . Add-Ins and 3rd Party Tools <p> Besides the stock functions that Excel comes with , there are a lot of other analysis tools out there being built by developers ( some come from Microsoft directly ) that are free . These are usually referred to as " Add-Ins " . You can find a whole group of them here . <p> The Data Analysis Add-In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data . You can get this for free from the Microsoft site . Once installed it will sit on your data tab to the far right of your screen . Some of these are quite complicated and use advanced statistics , but there are a few that are easier to understand and useful for the novice Excel user . <p> Another great tool is a fantasy football draft optimizer built by a PHD student located here . This is a front end tool that uses statistics in the background to help a user select the best fantasy team . I know that were past draft time , but you can tweak it to find gems off of the waiver wire as well as select your lineup from week to week . <p> It may take some time , but if you put a little analysis behind your fantasy team if can pay off in the end . Also , since there are such a wide range of data tools for free out in the market you do n't  have to be a statistician to get started . Have fun and good luck ! 188226 @qwx808226

If being launched with a phone number , it " s possible to track leads generated by offline and online advertising to call centers , whether it " s direct to site traffic , referring websites , or advertising networks .

Charles Proxy is my software of choice for debugging SiteCatalyst code , and I highly recommend it to other web analysts . In my experience , its much more powerful than any browser add-on . I even prefer using it over the Omniture Digital Pulse Debugger , which is specifically designed to debug SiteCatalyst code . You can also use Charles to easily debug other scripts and image requests at the same time . <p> When I am starting a project for a new client who has already implemented SiteCatalyst code , I begin with an audit of their tagging using Charles . During this audit , I check each page and document which KPIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to track them ( i.e. : eVar , Prop , event , custom linking ) . My audit also ensures that traffic sources are being reported correctly , and I note any custom campaign codes being used . <p> Next , I take a look at the code by saving their scode in a client-specific folder on my desktop and reviewing the entire file in a code editor like Notepad++ . Anywhere that I see room for improvement or places where I will make additions , I mark with a comment ( For example , /*Internal Search Tracking to be placed here Matt Hopkins 092712*/ ) . <p> After Im finished auditing and annotating the scode , I start coding . This is where the Map Local tool in Charles comes in handy . <p> As a developer , you want to be able to test changes to your code immediately and efficiently to ensure the code is working as intended and you are not hurting the previous solution . Charles allows you to do this in a few simple steps : <p> Go to whatever website you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code and copy its location to your clipboard . <p> When- the dialog box appears , paste your scode location into the host box and click the " choose " button ( Its next to the text field labeled " Local Path " ) . Choose the saved version of the scode in your client folder . Click " OK . " Make sure your new location is checked , and click " OK " again . <p> Make- a hard refresh on the website . View the source code , and click into the scode file to make sure its the local version on your PC . <p> That 's it ! You are now ready to make scode changes and check them instantly on a production website using Charles . <p> But , before you get started , here are some best practices to employ : <p> Make sure you use a " Test " Report Suite in SiteCatalyst . You do n't  want to send bogus image requests into a production report suite . <p> Test your changes one at a time . This is a standard coding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to find out when you 're finished that it does n't  work , identifying the problem will be like finding a needle in a haystack . Testing one section at a time allows you to find and fix complications as they happen . <p> Save your work as often as possible . Always be prepared for the worst . In this case , were talking about a power outage , the blue screen of death , your overweight cat who likes to walk on your keyboard , or anything else that could cause you to lose your work . You should also know that the Map Local feature uses the last saved version of your local file . So if you do n't  save your work and you try to debug your latest additions , you wo n't see them in your QA . <p> Charles is an awesome tool , and this is just one of the many great features it has to offer . Although it is n't free , the Map Local feature alone makes it worth the minimal license fee .

@@83647672 @5147672/ <h> Tuesday , 24th March 2015 <p> For a number of years I 've been hearing executives , analysts and industry peers a like talk about customer segmentation . This is not a new topic , but a topic I feel is somewhat overlooked and deserves a fresh look . <p> In the digital analytics field the latest talk around customer segmentation has been focused on creating custom individualized experiences for each unique visitor to one 's site . In theory this sounds great and I know some analysis tools are moving in this direction , but in reality most businesses are not nearly this sophisticated . <p> Understanding Cluster Analysis The goal of cluster analysis is to find objects that are more similar to each other in comparison to others in the same group . In the diagram below we can easily see which data points fall into which clusters as I colored them accordingly , but when you 're working with rows and rows of raw data it 's not as simple to recognize those clusters . <p> How Clusters Are Chosen So the first step in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done in a number of ways using statistical software packages like R , but the most straight forward is to find the Euclidean distance using the Pythagorean Theorem . <p> Below we have 3 data points , say out of a total of 10 . These were different offers that were converted on by various customers . The 3 conversions below have been grouped together because they share a cluster center with the smallest distance in comparison to the 7 other data points . This is calculated by looking at all 10 data points and determining which data points seem most similar based upon their center distances . <p> Writing the Equations So let 's get moving in Excel . First you need to create a matrix with your data . Below we used a simple matrix with Customer and Offer . ( 1 = conversion , Null = no conversion ) Then setup- the associated equations which we highlighted . <p> What we 're calculating here is the distance to the cluster centers for each customer and each offer . Then we 're finding the minimum cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this step the distance to cluster center will be the same for each cluster 1-3 per customer because we have yet to calculate the cluster centers themselves . ) Then just copy down all of the formulas in each of the customer rows . <p> Using Solver The Solver tool is a great add-on to Excel and is located in the data tab . If you do n't see it in your version of Excel just go under Options and make sure it is enabled . Also , I 'm using Excel 2013 so if you 're using an older version my screen shares may look different . Read more about Solver here . <p> Enable the settings in Solver shown exactly as above including the formulas . What we 're doing here is asking Solver to find the cluster centers . <p> Next , go into the Options settings of the Evolutionary solving method . Adjust the settings according to the image below . Then hit OK ' and then hit Solve ' . <p> Assigned Clusters Voila ! You 've now got your Assigned Clusters . Our example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of customers and just 3 clusters , but we did this on purpose so that visually you could see why the clusters were chosen . If you look at the matrix now and compare with the assigned clusters you 'll probably recognize some patterns within the matrix . <p> Now it 's time to have some fun . Since you have a cluster assigned to each customer you can begin looking for patterns in your data set to try and understand why certain customers convert on different offers . Once you begin to understand this behavior you can customize those different offers to the segments you selected in order to increase conversion . And again , we only performed this operation on a small data set , but for example , you could look at all email offers for all customers over a selected period of time and really begin to build a customer segmentation strategy based upon their engagement . The possibilities are almost endless so have fun with it . <p> Find out- more about how MaassMedia can help- analyze your organizations data , resulting in quality analyses that you can trust . 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647674 @5147674/ <h> Monday , 16th July 2012 <p> After successfully passing the Adobe Certified Expert SiteCatalyst Implementation Exam , I thought I would help out my future ACE professionals with this blog documenting the method to my madness . <p> When I signed up for the ACE Implementation Exam , I first reviewed the list of topics that were to be included on the exam . The volume and breadth of topics covered on the test were initially pretty overwhelming . To prepare , I searched for blog posts and other resources . I found a few good ones , including this one written by my predecessor here at MaassMedia . Church Mojo and Apothes posted helpful articles , as well . <p> Everyone prefers a different study method . I like to print out my study materials and make notes on the pages . There are four main categories of topics in the list I mentioned , so I made a study guide for each category . To fill each study guide , I went in to the knowledge base and searched each topic , then I copy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a Word document that I cleaned up to make my study guides . Some bloggers suggest watching videos and studying the implementation guide , which are also good ideas . <p> Below are some of the more important topics the exam focuses on . <p> Written Section : Know the Products String ! <p> I cant stress enough that you need to know the SiteCatalyst products variable and all of its syntaxes . The majority of written questions were based on the products string , and almost all of them asked you to omit the category in the string . <p> There were also a good amount of multiple choice questions about product variable syntaxes . One question provided five versions of a product string with a different syntax and value in each , then asked which two of the five strings were syntactically correct . <p> The exam will also ask you to do simpler tasks , like properly define a traffic variable with an event . This was one question that wasnt worded clearly , so make sure to look out for buzzwords to avoid confusion. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to know what city people are from that go to- this page , and this data should be- correlated with geo-region . Also , an event should be launched on this page . In this example , " this page " and " correlated " refer to s.props , so keep that in mind whenever you see those keywords . <p> Multiple Choice : Know the Details ! <p> The multiple choice questions cover a variety of topics . Keep these 14 tips in mind : <p> Memorize character limits on all major variables . <p> Know the state variable ( Obscure , I know , but there were at least three questions about that variable alone ! ) . <p> Props can be correlated , eVars are sub-related . <p> You can have up to 15two-item data correlations . <p> There were several questions about link tracking and its syntax . <p> Know what can be activated manually in the admin interface vs. done through Client Care . <p> Remember , you must go through Client Care to get eVars fully sub-related . <p> Learn the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what s.linkTrackVars does . <p> Know how to use numeric events and merchandising eVars with the product string . <p> The exam will ask you which Adobe tools are best for certain situations , so its a good idea to learn the various functions for VISTA , Data Warehouse , Data Sources , Discover , SAINT , Excel Client , etc . <p> Memorize all predefined e-commerce events ( scAdd , prodView , scRemove , etc ) . One specific question I had to answer : If you do not set a specific event with the products variable , what is the default event that will launch ? ( FYI , the answer is prodView ) . <p> My exam did not have any questions about the interface , so you do n't  need to memorize anything about it other than admin capabilities . <p> There were not any questions about the different reports within SiteCatalyst either , so you wont need to correlate variables to reports . <p> The most important advice I can give to help you pass the ACE SiteCatalyst Implementation Exam is study the details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but make sure you can distinguish traffic variables from conversion variables , and know their character limits . The multiple choice questions will test your knowledge of all the topics , so remember : DETAILS , DETAILS , DETAILS ! Make that your mantra . Good luck ! 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647679 @5147679/ <h> Monday , 9th July 2012 <p> For any online or offline company , collecting the opinions of customers is crucial to understanding which aspects of business work well and which need improvement. - Online surveying has become quite popular for e-commerce , content-based , and conversion-driven sites. - Most surveys are in the form of a pop up window upon entrance to or exit from a site or a questionnaire sent via e-mail and both methods are proven effective for gathering data . <h> Types of Online Surveys <p> There are several different types of surveys a company can implement on their site : <p> Panel surveys use carefully selected groups of people that are diverse yet representative of the " universe " of people being measured. - For any survey , the vendor will segment their existing database of respondents into a sample that is applicable to the scope of the specific survey. - For example , a survey focused on the attitudes of senior citizens towards public transportation will use only respondents that fall into the senior citizen demographic. - The company Survey Sampling International will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand upon a companys already existing panel by increasing its membership base. - Global Marketing Insite ( GMI ) uses fraud detection , location verification , and de-duplication technology to ensure the highest quality of respondents from five different regions of the globe . <p> Customer satisfaction ( C-Sat ) surveys measure exactly thatthe level of satisfaction a customer has with their experience on the site , a recently purchased product , or even an encounter with customer support. - The questions are usually formatted with scaled response values ( i.e. 1-10 ) and/or corresponding positive and negative descriptors ( i.e. agree , strongly disagree , neutral ) . - A companys C-Sat score is a numeric value that can be compared with national industry averages as reported by the American Customer Satisfaction Index ( ACSI ) . - For instance , the June 2012 ACSI release for Transportation reported an industry average of 67 ( out of 100 ) for airline customer satisfaction , with Southwest at a 77 and United at a 62. - ForeSee and iPerceptions are two popular C-Sat survey vendors that offer similar services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users to enter suggestions , report a page error for a specific page , and rate the quality of the site on a numeric scale. - The comment card is a non-intrusive pop-up that is either served at the end of a visit , or triggered manually via an internal site link . <p> Kampyle is another feedback survey vendor that allows customers to opt-in to fill out a short form. - Visitors can provide feedback for sales , marketing , or support and include an optional screen capture of the specific issue . <h> Beware ! Limitations of Online Surveys <p> While there are many advantages to using online surveys , companies must be aware of questionnaires inherent pitfalls. - The main caveat of web-based surveys ( except for panel surveys ) is that the sample of visitors is rarely representative of the population because respondents are voluntary and not randomly sampled. - In general , those who opt-in to surveys are more engaged with the website content and more inclined to take surveys. - Therefore , any hypotheses formulated about the population based on the sample would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usable , but keep this drawback in mind when interpreting the results . <p> Another downfall of surveys is their tendency to contain biases . Nonresponse bias can occur in surveys with low response rates ( According to market research by SurveyGizmo , average response rates for external surveys like C-Sat and feedback are around 10-15% ) . <p> Nonresponse bias refers , not only to the inability or unwillingness of chosen individuals to participate in the survey , but also to respondents who fail to answer one or more questions. - Both factors contribute to the inaccuracy of the sample in statistically representing the population. - To reduce this bias , increase the sample size to at least 10% of the population , and consider offering an incentive for participating. - Also , make the survey as simple and straightforward as possible by reducing the number of questions and time it takes to complete ( The same SurveyGizmo study shows that surveys that take longer than 11 minutes to complete have significantly higher abandonment rates than that take 10 minutes or less ) . <p> Survey questions wording and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be phrased in such a way that they inadvertently ( or purposefully ) lead a respondent to a certain answer. - Similarly , questions that contain vague words can confuse respondents , leading them to select answers that do not reflect their true feelings , or skip the question altogether . To avoid this , make sure the questions are clearly stated and use neutral , specific language . <p> For the advanced surveyor who has already mastered the basics , there are several ways to enhance simple surveys to gather more meaningful information. - Overlaying survey data with behavioral data from a web analytics platform like Google Analytics or Site Catalyst can help a company understand , not only what people say , but also what they do. - For example , someone who reports a low C-Sat score may not have reported a difficult experience using the shopping cart . Matching the respondents survey answers to web analytics data can reveal this hidden information . <p> A conditional structure is another option for enhancing basic surveys. - For instance , respondents who say they purchased a product can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who did not purchase may see different questions about consideration of the brand. - Conditional questions can also arise when certain website actions are completed. - If a visitor watches an embedded video , it is possible to immediately serve questions regarding the visitors experience with that video. - Using this type of branched model will allow for deeper diving into areas of interest . <p> Whether you 'd like to offer a survey to your customers , draw actionable analyses from your survey responses , or integrate web analytics with survey data , MaassMedia can help you use online surveys to allow your organization to reach transformative insights .

Or , will you wait until they organically flock to your online stores ? <p> We would love to hear your thoughts ! Happy 4th of July from all of us at MaassMedia , LLC . <h> Monday , 2nd July 2012 <p> Just about anything on a website can be tracked with web analytics . While its good to thoroughly tag your website , it is also easy to drown in a massive sea of data . That 's why its important to distinguish meaningful metrics from vanity metrics . <p> Vanity metrics is a phrase made popular by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup . These are metrics that might make your business look good ( especially when they go up ) , but in reality do n't  provide much insight to help your business grow . <p> Save time on your web analytics reporting by taking these 5 misleading metrics with a grain of salt : <p> 1 . Visits <p> Executives love a good spike in traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is doing something right . While that may be the case , number of visits alone does n't  provide any indication of what the company is doing right . Often , a business will attribute a traffic spike to a recent project , like new ad campaign or change to the website . The problem is that the design team could be high fiving each other for the success of their new feature , while the marketing team celebrates their effective social media strategy . And when traffic plummets , no member of the team wants to take responsibility . <p> Causation and correlation are not one and the same . It is crucial to determine how and why visitors come to your websiteor do n't  come to your websiterather than make assumptions . Once you can pinpoint the actual cause , you will have a more sound idea of which techniques work and which do n't  . <p> 2 . New vs . Returning Visits <p> In theory , it makes sense to monitor the ratio of new to repeat visits . Visitors who return to your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with your site . Unfortunately , it is possible for repeat visitors to be counted as new visitors ( or " unique " visitors ) and vice versa . That is because information about which sites a person has visited is stored in a browser cookie . Clearing cookies from a browser deletes any record of a prior visit , so a returning visitor who has cleared his or her cache will be counted as unique . Additionally , if a visitor switches browsers , IP addresses , or devices when returning to your website , he or she will be counted as a unique visitor instead of a returning visitor . <p> On the other hand , if a new visitor uses a shared computer to view your website , and if that website has been previously viewed on that device , the new visitor will be counted as a repeat visitor . <p> 3 . Traffic sources <p> At a glance , a breakdown of traffic sources can provide a general idea of how visitors find your website . Maybe they use search engines , click links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their browser . Instead of providing answers , this information only raises more questions : What keywords do visitors use to find your website on search engines ? Which traffic sources refer visitors who typically convert ? Why do some visitors come directly to your site ? <p> To find more meaningful insights , take the time to tag your marketing channels ( display , paid search , e-mail , etc. ) and focus on referrals from each source . If your business uses print ads , use a vanity URL unique to the ad to see which campaigns brought the most visitors . <p> 4 . Pageviews <p> This metric is directly influenced by your content and navigation , but does n't  tell you if your website is any good . A visitor searching for something specific might visit several pages if the content is difficult to find , while another visitor might be presented with engaging content that keeps him or her clicking around your site . Both of these visits would increase your number of pageviews , but only the latter visitor has a positive experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of your sites content and navigation . <p> 5 . Time on Site/Time on Page <p> Like pageviews , time on site can go up or down without indicating why . A person who finds interesting content on your site could spend just as much time as a frustrated visitor who ca n't find the content he or she is looking for . <p> Another reason to take these metrics with a grain of salt is their accuracy Time on site and time on page are inherently skewed . For exit pages , time on page is recorded as 0 seconds because there is no server request when a visitor leaves your site . So , if someone spends 2 minutes on your homepage , clicks an article that they spend 15 minutes reading , then clicks offsite or closes their browser window , their time on site will be recorded as 2 minutes . <h> Monday , 25th June 2012 <p> Youve just finished a basic implementation of your analytics platform , and now you want to customize it . Where should you start ? Here are 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box implementation that need to be tracked with custom events or variables . <p> 1 . ) Onsite Search This is an often overlooked website action that can provide key insights into how people are browsing your site . It will also provide an indication of the content visitors are having a hard time finding through regular navigation and identify missing content that visitors might expect to find . If I am visiting a site to find something specific , I 'll often use the search tool . If I do n't  find what I am looking for , I move on to another site . <p> TIP : Track the number of times the search function is used in an event , along with search terms in a custom variable . <p> 2 . ) Navigation Tracking navigation elements is just as criticalif not , morethan tracking onsite search . Tracking your top and side navigation will tell you visitors most common paths , as well as the most popular links in each directory . You can use custom link tracking or custom link IDs on all of your navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight . Make sure the click map picks up any drop down or hidden links . Also , tracking previous page clicks can be difficult if all of your links are n't  unique on each page . <p> 3 . ) Social Media There a few different ways to incorporate social media into your web content , and each is tracked differently with different limitations . The first and the more common method is a small logo linked to your websites Facebook or Twitter page ( or LinkedIn , Google , etc ) . These can usually be tracked by setting up custom exit link tracking . The more difficult buttons to track are the interactive share buttons that allow visitors to post to Facebook and Tweet without leaving your page . These actions should be captured in a custom analytics variable . My earlier blog post explains how to implement social media tracking into Google Analytics , which can give you a sense of how your visitors are using social media to interact with your organization . <p> 4 . ) Onsite Marketing Visitors might choose to shop or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or product messaging on it . If you are not tagging your creative with unique IDs , as well as with a custom event , you wo n't know which are most effective . <p> 5 . ) Conversion For most websites , conversion is the most important metric . Whether it be e-commerce , lead conversion , or ad generation , your site should be tracking conversions with detailed custom implementations . On a lead generation site , you need to launch a serialized event on your confirmation page . E-commerce sites need to launch an event through each step of the checkout process , as well- as capture all product and cart information in a custom analytics variable . When you do this , you will be able to track the website actions that lead to each purchase , which is very helpful . <p> The reason these 5 things are so important is that they are all relative . Do n't  you want to know who clicked on a promo message before purchasing , or who Tweeted your blog post after leaving a comment ? You wont be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  track them with some custom implementation , and that can keep you from seeing the bigger picture and revealing transformative insights . <h> Monday , 18th June 2012 <p> So , you 've got data . But what is it telling you ? Digital analytics is about more than just reporting the numbers , its about taking those numbers and turning them into transformative insights that lead to improved user experiences and , ultimately , a greater ROI . <p> The first and most important aspect of generating actionable digital analytics insights for your organization is correctly tagging everything you want to track , making sure to keep the tagging uniform across all channels and campaigns . Next , you 'll want to pull your data from whatever platform you 're using ( Google Analytics , SiteCatalyst , etc ) . Its a smart idea to double check your numbers before deep diving into your analysis . <p> Once you 've collected your data , break it into groups for each time frame . For example , monthly reports should have monthly data groupings with backdated data also grouped monthly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods . <p> Compare your current data to data from yesterday , last week , last month , and this time period last year . Look for significant percent changes from the compared time periods . If you find a sizable increase or decrease in a metric , make sure the percent change is n't exaggerating the significance on the business . <p> If , for example , visitors from a particular channel increase 100% when compared to the previous month , but there were only 2 visitors this month and 1 visitor last month , the increase is n't exactly something youd want to pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate . <p> Next , look for meaningful trends over time within your data . I look for any kind of trend that has happened over 3 time periods . Finding trends and cycles can help you know what to expect from your audience and more accurately predict their behavior both on and offsite . <p> Once you 've identified potential insights , you 'll need to figure out why they happened . This is where you dig deep into your data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can start finding answers by examining data at the following levels : website , page , link , channel , campaign , ad group , keyword and landing page . <p> Be sure to look at potential outside influences other than marketing that could have caused spikes in data . For example , Company A buys Company B , causing a 2-day spike in site traffic . This increase is not attributed to any marketing tactic , so the jump in traffic is an anomaly and is not actionable . <p> The chart above reminds me of a similar issue I dealt with at MaassMedia . I noticed a downward trend in a clients shopping cart conversion . Upon taking a closer look , I was able to pinpoint the abandonment to a particular step in the shopping cart path . I then thoroughly examined that page , looking for broken links , images and content errors , but everything was working properly . This problem required me to dig deeper as an analyst . I actually went through the process completely , ordered something from the site , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers had filled out , I was noticed a recurring complaint during the same timeframe as the downward trend . The client had stopped shipping to Army Post Offices ( APOs ) , and shoppers did not discover this until after they had entered their shipping address . This explained the drop-off , and our client was able to take this information and make the necessary changes to accommodate these customers . <p> Once you nail down the techniques that produce valuable insights , present your findings so actions can be duplicated or eliminated in the future , leading to more efficient digital marketing spending . <p> This process is one method of generating useful insights from your data , but there are many alternatives- depending on the organizations goals and needs .

@@83647692 @5147692/ <h> Monday , 20th August 2012 <p> Redesigning a website is n't only about giving it a fresh look and feel . A redesigned website should deliver a better overall experience to your visitor , and that goes much deeper than aesthetics . Your digital analytics can help you understand what your visitors are doing on your website , while also distinguishing content that works well from content that does n't  . <p> Before looking at your data in Google Analytics , Adobe SiteCatalyst , or whichever analytics platform you use , take a moment to review the goals youd like your website to accomplish . For example , a content-heavy website like the Huffington Post or The Onion might want to keep visitors engaged with interesting articles , in which case , a goal for pageviews and time on site/page would be relevant . A new brand or budding startup company might be interested in gaining more recognition through social media , so they might create goals around social elements like share widgets . An e-commerce site like Amazon or Zappos aims to make sales , and for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an extension of your organization and should work toward achieving your business objectives , just as a store or spokesperson should accomplish this offline . <p> Here are a few metrics to consider before redesigning your website : <h> Internal search <p> What is it ? <p> If your website has a search box , visitors can use it to find specific content within your website . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> You might think you know what your visitors want , but checking your internal search keywords is a good way to know for sure if your website is lacking content or products that are in high demand , or if that content or product is difficult to find on your site . At MaassMedia , we tipped off one of our clients when we discovered a large number of internal searches for thumb drives . The client did not sell thumb drives , but added the product to their inventory when they realized their visitors were looking for them . <h> Clickmap <p> What is it ? <p> A clickmap is a visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent and/or number of clicks to each link on the page . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> Clickmaps allow you to identify the links that are performing best and worst , which can help you evaluate the effectiveness of your call-to-actions . Some platforms offer more advanced clickmaps that can follow mouse movement and scrolling in addition to clicks . There is even an emerging technology that can follow a visitors eye movement on a page . Knowing which parts of a page draw the most attention can help you identify the most appropriate spots to place content on a page , as well as spots that do n't  perform as well . <h> Screen resolution <p> What is it ? <p> Screen resolution refers to the size of a visitors screen in pixels . Screen resolution can be modified on most computers , and it differs from the screen resolution on a tablet or mobile device , which is significantly smaller and often has different proportions . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> Tech savvy readers may recall a time long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen resolution . Prior to that , 800+600 pixels was the norm . Today , however , screens come in all shapes and sizes , and resolution can be customized to a number of dimensions . It is important that your website looks and functions its best on any device at any screen resolution . <p> You can optimize your site for themost common resolution(s) and redirect visitors to a version of your site fit to their screen , or you can implement a new technology called responsive design . <p> A website with responsive design changes to fit your browser width . Content can move around or be hidden completely , and fonts and images can resize accordingly . Not only does responsive design work on various screen resolutions and devices , but it also adjusts if a visitor simply resizes their browser window . The Boston Globe is an example of a website with responsive design . Test it out by visiting the site and resizing your browser window . <h> Bounce rate <p> What is it ? <p> Not to be confused with exit rate , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave your site- without visiting any other page . After landing on a page , the visitor either clicks offsite or closes his or her browser window . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> A high bounce rate- is n't necessarily a bad thing , depending on the purpose of the page . If a visitor is able to find everything s/he needs on a single page , that bounce is an indication that the visitors needs were met . Most websites , however , are structured in a way that the visitor must visit several pages before conversion . <p> On an e-commerce site , for example , a visitor might click on a category of products , then a product detail page before adding the item to their shopping cart and , ultimately , making the purchase . In this case , it would be considered a loss if the visitor left the homepage without visiting any other pages . If you take a look at the pages on your site with the highest bounce rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start thinking of solutions for improvement . <h> Time on page <p> What is it ? <p> This one is pretty self-explanatory : Time on page calculates how long visitors spend on a given page , on average . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> As with bounce rate , a page with a low average time on page is not always a downfall . If the page is n't particularly content-heavy and quickly gets to the point , a visitor might only need to spend a few seconds on it before moving on . <p> However , unusually low time on page can be a red flag that it needs some work . Visitors spending an average of 10 seconds on a page with your 5,000 word bio might be turned off by the number of words on the page , a lack of images , and/or your ego . On the flip side , visitors spending 10 minutes on a smaller page would be an indication that they can not find what they are searching for . <p> Are you considering a site redesign ?

@@83647693 @5147693/ <h> Tuesday , 16th August 2016 <p> Foot races have been part of the Olympic Games since the- Ancient Olympics- that date back to 776 BC . One of the most popular Olympic events continues to be the Men 's 100 Meter Race . Because we love data , we decided to take a look at race times in the Modern Olympic Games . As we expected , we found that times have improved greatly since Tom Burke posted a 12 second time in the 1896 Athens Games . <p> We did a bit of research on Burke and found he was 21 years old when he won that gold medal , and that got us thinking about the ages of other gold medal winners . We hypothesized that younger racers ( those 21 years and under ) would tend to post faster times than racers over 21 . In looking at the data , however , we found the opposite is actually true . As the speeds of the races have progressively gotten faster , the ages of the racers have progressively gotten older . <p> The graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1896 " 2016 along with the ages of the winners . Note how the trend line for the race times moves- down , while the trend line for the winner 's ages moves- up : <p> To encapsulate the runners ages and race times , we built a Race Time / Age Index by dividing the racers age by the racers winning time . The highest index score goes to Linford Christie who is a Jamaican-British sprinter . Christie posted a 9.96 time at the age of 32 in the 1996 Barcelona Games . Christies index is followed by ( interestingly enough ) Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt who posted a 9.81 time in this years Rio games at the age of 30 . The chart below depicts the indices for all gold medal winners since 1896 . <p> Taking it one step further , because we truly do love data , height ( cm ) and weight ( kg ) were added to our dataset . With age already showing a strong indirect relationship with time , we hypothesized the build/stature of the athlete must be correlated to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this week 's highlights on ESPN , we hypothesized that a tall and thin athlete would have the recipe to win over a shorter and heftier athlete . <p> To our dismay , the data concluded that both height and weight increased together , directly proportionate to each other and indirectly proportionate to time . We had to reject our hypothesis and conclude athletes are becoming taller and stronger over the decades . Thomas Burke at age 21 had a BMI of 18 while Usain bold has a BMI of 21.94 . There were outliers within the dataset like Linford Christine and Hasely Crawford whom 's BMI were &gt;24 ! , but never the less the data 's trend showed modern athletes are taller and stronger than ever before . <p> We know the what 's , but not all the whys . <p> Advances in training , nutrition , and equipment have undoubtedly helped to make times faster , but why have the ages of gold medal winners increased over time ? We hypothesize the influence of technique , modern science , standards of training , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their late 20 's and into their early 30 's . We know that age causes a decline in athletic ability , but modern advances may in fact help today 's athletes peak later than prior athlete 's did . The full set of these answers are most likely found in a sport journal . What we can say with certainty in this post is what the data shows . <p> The table below is the full data set for the Men 's 100 Meter gold medal winners from 1896 to 2016. - At MaassMedia , we see data differently even when its moving at 12.4 meters per second ! 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647696 @5147696/ <h> Thursday , 27th February 2014 <p> Intro to Mobile Analytics how does it differ from the fixed web ? Now that we are into 2014 I am sure all of you understand how important mobile is to your business . But just in case you have been in a cave or under a rock for the last 4 years , here are some pretty staggering statistics about the Mobile web . <p> So as you can see mobile is here , it is growing and it needs to be part of your measurement plan . However , measuring mobile is not the same as measuring your website . Why ? Well the user experience on a mobile device is completely different then the experience on the fixed web , especially if you are using an app . Not only is the user experience different but the data collection method is different depending on which tracking software you use and which platform your mobile app is available on , such as iOS or Android . Along with data collection differences there are also metric differences . Apps do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactive and therefore how we measure and report on these applications is different . But what is n't different ? Your customer does n't  change from the web to mobile so having a plan in place to measure customer behavior across devices is important to your long term success . <p> Mobile SDKs what they are and how to use them Just as you would create a tagging plan for your website , you need to create a tagging plan for your mobile application . This should begin while the app is still in wire frame development and you should meet with the business stakeholders to get an idea of everything that you want to track inside the application beyond the basics . Once you have a tagging plan in place you can have your developers track everything necessary and you can move into the QA stage . <p> The first part to any mobile measurement plan is to ensure you are collecting the correct data . The mobile SDK ( Software Developer Kit ) is the code that you will use to implement your tracking on your mobile app and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed website from a high level standpoint . What I mean by it being similar to the website tracking code is that they both collect data about user interaction and send that data back to your analytics servers . The way they are implemented and the code itself are actually completely different but they both accomplish the same goals . Each analytics platform , such as Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics , has its own SDKs and these could vary from operating system to operating system . For example , Adobe currently has 8 SDKs available in their admin section , two for iOS , two for Android , one for Windows8 , one for Blackberry , one for Symbian and one for Silverlight and Xbox . <p> Mobile QA How do I QA an app on my phone ? So you have created your tagging plan for your app and your developer has taken this wonderful tagging plan and implemented it in the app and sent you the latest build of the app to test . But you do n't  have Charles or Fiddler ( or any other web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to see what data is being passed in your app ? Great question ! You can actually proxy your phone through your computer and see the server calls that are being generated from the app in real time through your web debugging program . How do you do this ? It is fairly easy and below is a step by step process . We have also created a video that explains these steps which can be found here . LONG ... One Make sure that both your phone and your computer are running on the same network . Next you have to know what your IP address is of the computer you are going to use to run the web debugging software . Step Two Once you have the IP address , you then need to set up manual proxy on your phone . This is basically the same process on both iOS and Android . You need to go to your settings on the phone and then to your wireless network . You need to change your proxy setting from off to manual which is usually done through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will input the IP address of your computer and most all web debugging programs run through port 8888 so you will need to enter that also . Once that is done you are all set . Open up your web debugging program on your computer , then open the app on your phone and you should start to see all the requests from your phone in the web debugger . Happy QAing ! <p> Measuring mobile Reports and Analysis So you created your tagging plan , your developer implemented the SDK , you QAd the code and everything is being collected correctly . Now it is time to create some reports for your app . What types of metrics should you be using in your reports ? What do you consider success in your mobile app ? Success is going to differ from app to app but if you are reporting just unique visitors and app starts you are n't  doing it right . So what metrics make the most sense for mobile apps ? Here is a good list for a start : User Activity Rate this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your app . You want to divide the amount of app installs by the amount of unique users you have over a certain period of time . User Activity Rate = App downloads/Unique Visitors This sounds simple but not every download occurs on the same day so you will want to use segmentation to find out your retention rate . For example , you would create a segment of users that downloaded the app on in the first week in September and then run a unique visitor report for the month of October with the September segment applied . This will give you the amount of unique users that downloaded your app the first week of September but are still coming back in October to use the app . You can set your time periods to whatever you like , just remember to use segmentation . Retention Rate this metric will allow you to understand if users are retaining or deleting your app . It is calculated as follows : Retention Rate App Downloads/App Uninstalls Very simple yet effective metric . If this metric is negative then you know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app than installing and you need to figure out why , and fast ! Engagement Rate this metric will allow you to understand how many of your users are actually engaged with you app . This is actually a combination of metrics that make up a segment which can be then trended over time to find out if you are gaining or losing engaged users . Engagement Rate = ( F or TS or UI ) What does that mean ? It states that engagement is equal to a certain threshold of frequency(F) , time spent(TS) or user interaction(UI) . You need to define what your threshold is for each of these items . How often do you think an engaged user should open your app ? Every day ? Twice a day ? How frequently should they return ?

Week 1 has passed ( I won my match up , thank you ) but there is still a lot of season to go and lots of line up tweaking to do . <p> I 'm assuming like everyone else you troll all of the typical fantasy sites to find out " insider " information on what players are going to be hot that week . Then you take that information and make a best estimate on who to pick . This is standard protocol for most fantasy competitors . So why not take the guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of statistics ? <p> 1 . Getting Data <p> So one option is doing all of the heavy analysis lifting yourself . Do you have Excel ? Awesome , because its actually a really powerful analysis tool . Before we get to the analysis though we need the raw data . I use **26;173;TOOLONG for all of my stats because you can download raw data in CSV format which works really well in Excel . <p> Once you download the data in CSV format you can just use the " Text to Columns " function under the data tab to clean it up for analysis purposes . <p> If you 're going to analyze a group of running backs I would grab at least three years worth of data . Then pick some metrics that you want to focus on : age , rushing attempts , rushing yards , total yards , touchdowns , fumbles , etc . Once you get the data cleaned up and in a usable format you can move on to the analysis . <p> 2 . Analysis Tools <p> Excel comes stock with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage . Two that I use on a regular basis are located in Functions : Forecast and Correl . <p> The Forecast function returns the predicted value of the dependent variable for the specific value , x , of the independent variable . What does this mean ? If you have several years of rushing data this function will use linear regression to predict future values e.g. rushing yards in 2013 . This obviously is not fool proof , but the more data points that you have the more accurate it can be . <p> The Correl function in Excel Returns the correlation coefficient of two groups of data . You can use the this to determine the relationship between two properties . For example , I may look at data on running backs to try and determine if a players age is a factor in their performance . I could compare age with rushing yards or total fantasy points last year to determine if there is an age range or specific age of a running back that generates the most fantasy points . <p> 3 .

Every day , analysts and marketers are inundated with enormous amounts of information about consumers , including shopping patterns , attrition , engagement , annual spend , and more . Then there 's product data , which allows retailers to know which items generate the most margin or brand loyalty . And we cant forget competitor data , which is essential for keeping tabs on the industry and staying one step ahead of the rest . Theres customer survey data , which can measure brand awareness . Then on top of that , you 're regularly being offered new tools to measure all of these metrics . <p> Sometimes , we need to slow things down to find clarity . Step back from the noise and take a look at the Big Picture , not just the Big Data . When you see things from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters to your business from the information that does n't  produce actionable insights . <p> In this post , I will outline my process for developing a marketing plan across multiple channels based on ROI . This is not intended as an " End all , be all " formula . Its more so a way to get you thinking about your marketing and guide some of decision-making when it comes to your marketing budget . <h> Step 1 : Take a look back <p> Historical data is an analysts best friend . When you know what happened last year , you can easily use that data for future planning purposes . Keep in mind , one data point does not make a trend . You ca n't count on that new promotion to keep returning high response rates just because the first campaign was successful . It may have been one and done . I like to use at least three data points for directional purposes , but more are always better . <h> Step 2 : Level the playing field <p> Although different marketing channels often have very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because this is where we remove the noise ! ) . With email , you have opens , click throughs , bounces , etc . With direct mail , you might look at metrics like in-home rates and coupon redemptions . You get the point , but to calculate ROI , you 'll need to tie the marketing contact back to a purchase . I know this can be difficult , but once you tie back the purchases you can then use common metrics like response rate , average order , margin % and cost per contact to do comparisons across channels . <h> Step 3 : Plan in chunks <p> Most businesses are affected by seasonality in some way or another . Just because your mobile campaign performed well over summer does n't  mean customers will respond the same during the holiday shopping season . Use data from comparable time frames year-over-year . I like to build my plans quarter by quarter , but you may need to use different time periods based on your business strategy . <h> Step 4 : Determine what is driving your marketing plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me guess , you need more sales and margin , more customers and higher retention , but your budget was cut this year . That might be a problem , but it does n't  have to set you back . Ask yourself this : Do you need sales today , or can you afford to spend a few dollars on branding ? As marketers , we tend to address the immediate needs of the business , often pushing aside the long view . This is where ROI can really help . Take a look at the chart below . <p> ROI Calculation : ( Margin " - Cost ) /Cost <p> Above are Sales and Margin projections , by channel , based on historical data . Metrics like RR% , average order and margin % are based on prior campaigns , adjusting for seasonality and fluctuations in customer counts . Each channel can have different customer counts according to their nature ( i.e. opt-ins for email and mobile ) . Customers opting in to different channels may have different values ( i.e. sale per contact and margin per contact ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other factors . <h> Step 5 : Execution <p> Let 's say you have $500K to spend for a month-long campaign . Where would you put it ? <p> Heres what I would do : <p> Direct mail would get the bulk of the budget because its the largest driver of sales and margin per contact , even though it does n't  generate the highest ROI . Mobile has a great ROI , but there are n't  enough customers yet to drive a month-long campaign . Email could be used to reinforce direct mail or to promote a secondary offer in case the initial offer becomes stale . <p> Print is not being utilized in this campaign due to its low ROI and low margin per contact . This plan is really looking at the " short run . " The business requires sales now and cant spend funding on print . Although this might be a tough pill to swallow , your ROI analysis could spur a conversation with higher-ups about branding , which may necessitate a future budget increase . <p> At MaassMedia , we believe its insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis does n't  present an opportunity to change what you 're doing for the better , what use is it to you ?

@@83647729 @5147729/ <h> Friday , 30th October 2015 <p> It is my not-so-humble opinion that the advent of Tag Management Systems are the best thing to happen to Digital Analytics since high-speed internet connections . Tag Management Systems have removed much of the complexity and overhead of managing page tags , and have allowed marketers the ability to change and adapt tagging with amazing speed . During my career , I have used or been exposed to every major TMS in the analytics industry , and I develop my favorite tools and biases . Recently , I was tasked with updating some tags for a client that uses Adobe Tag Management.After the implementation , I started thinking about not just the UI and workflow differences between tools , but more of the differences between the logic behind various TMS tools . It occurred to me that Tag Management Systems fall into two broad categories ( which Adobe coincidentally named their products ) : Tag Management and Dynamic Tag Management . In this post I will compare and contrast these two TMS categories , so you can make informed choices about which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is tag management , and why are we so hyped about it ? Tag Management Systems are online programs that you use to manage any/all of your websites ' third-party tags . The primary purpose of a TMS is to manage your analytics ( Adobe Analytics , Google Analytics , Web Trends , Target , etc. ) , but you can literally put any tag ( Optimizely , ObservePoint , Live Person ) into your TMS . When you put a tag into your TMS , you can make edits and updates through- an online console rather than having to go to your developers and get in their development life cycle . This cuts down turnaround time and resource overhead . <p> This also comes with a tremendous responsibility , as you now have the power to inject code directly on your site , which can slow down or even break parts of your pages . Most TMS administrators sit between marketers and developers . The best TMS admins are familiar with both worlds and can translate the language of the two . <p> The categorical difference between Tag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Static Tag Management Systems employ the use of containers that are put on your web pages , and all the different third-party tags you want to use are placed inside of the containers . These tags contain all of the code that captures your interactions , and if you want to change the way Adobe Analytics captures a button click , then you change the Adobe Analytics scode ( e.g. , the Adobe Analytics tag ) . You also have a container with Dynamic Tag Management , but instead of a tag that contains all of your interactions , you create a series of tags that track interactions . Instead of placing raw javascript in the scode of a tag , if you want to track a button click in a Dynamic Tag Management System , you would create a rule based on that element on the page . Both systems accomplish the same goal . In one system you write the code , and the other system is more point and click . Both of these systems have their own merits and their own drawbacks . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the way we would track a button click in each . <p> Installation <p> Use Static <p> write the code based on button click Create a rule for button click <p> Less coding knowledge needed . <p> Which type of TMS is right for you ? A better question probably is which type of TMS is best for your organization ? 188226 @qwx808226

He has worked predominantly in the hotel and retail furniture industries . In his free time he enjoys watching movies and following his favorite sports teams . <p> You can not manage what you do n't  measure , and that certainly applies to marketing . Measuring how well each marketing channel drives traffic to a website is imperative to any companys success , and analytics allows you to do that . Because my background is predominantly in hospitality , I 'd like to demonstrate how analytics can benefit the hotel industry . <p> 55% of all leisure and business reservations are expected to be made online for 2013 ( PhoCusWright ) , which means measuring and optimizing a hotels digital marketing is more important than ever before . <p> Although monitoring standard web metrics like visitors , page views , and average visit duration is useful , that information is just the tip of the iceberg . Truly Transformative InsightsG that change the way your organization manages its marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web traffic , but also from a variety of marketing channels . <p> The average conversion rate for hotel websites is about 2% . In other words , approximately 98% of visitors to a hotels website leave without making a reservation . This suggests that the hotel industry could be doing significantly more to capitalize on visitors interest . It is imperative that hotels utilize the right data in the right way to paint a clearer picture of how their audience interacts with their marketing . <p> The key to understanding your audience is segmentation . Were not necessarily referring to segmenting visitors by age , gender , or geographic location ( although , depending on your business goals , those qualities might be important ) . At MaassMedia , we strive for more granular segmentation to understand each visitors intentions , then serve each visitor a unique digital experience optimized for conversion . <p> With analytics , you can measure where each visitor stands in the purchase consideration spectrum . Some visitors may have their minds made up about booking a room , while others might be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website and tracking visitors who complete these actions can reflect a visitors propensity to buy . Additionally , analytics tracks metrics like how recently or frequently a visitor views the website , which can help identify which visitors are ready to book a room and which are undecided . Using this information , hotel websites can then personalize the content that the visitor sees , raising their likelihood to book . <p> For example : Let 's say a prospective guest has visited the hotels site on numerous occasions in a short time span without making a reservation . We can establish that the guest is probably significantly interested in booking a room , but might need some added incentive to make the decision . Using analytics , the hotel could identify these visitors and display a time-sensitive offer only for those visitors who are on the fence . <p> Only visitors who need incentive to purchase are shown the time-sensitive offer <p> Data can also be collected from interactive content , like internal search terms and filters . If a visitor consistently books or views hotels costing over $500/night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only would this increase the likelihood of a larger sale , but the purchasing experience for the guest also improves tremendously because they do n't  have to filter through the hotels that do n't  interest them . <p> Hotel franchisors can also capitalize on trends in their data . For example , if there is a substantial increase in searches for a particular destination , brands can recommend that their franchisees in that location raise their rates because of the spike in demand . This could substantially improve the revenue that the franchises website generates . <p> Although opportunities to customize or modify the website may be limited for branded hotels ( franchisors may not give complete freedom to alter or add content to their website ) , independent hotels and resorts have significant opportunities to use analytics to their advantage . Even if they can improve their conversion rate from 2% to 2.5% , that 's still a 25% increase in conversion rate . <p> Many independent hotels have n't implemented any data analytics on their websites .

Are guests searching to sign up for loyalty membership ? Do they want to book meetings or events in a particular city or region ? Are they more or less price sensitive ?

One such holiday , Groundhog Day , occurs every February 2nd . On this day we let a groundhog pop out of a hole in the ground in order to predict how much longer winter will last . If he " sees his shadow " then there will be 6 more weeks of winter , and if he does not then spring will come early . Sounds crazy , but this holiday has been celebrated since the 1800s . <p> There are many groundhogs in different locations that make predictions , but in Philadelphia we look to Punxsutawney Phil for our forecast . Up to 40,000 people gather to watch Phil each year making Philadelphia home of the largest Groundhog Day celebration . People trust in his predictions even though he only has 39% accuracy , according to StormFax Weather Almanac . Below is a picture of the cute little ( not so little ) guy helping answer interview questions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28th January 2013 <p> Viraj Patel is working with MaassMedia as part of Cornell Universitys externship program . He has worked predominantly in the hotel and retail furniture industries . In his free time he enjoys watching movies and following his favorite sports teams . <p> You can not manage what you do n't  measure , and that certainly applies to marketing . Measuring how well each marketing channel drives traffic to a website is imperative to any companys success , and analytics allows you to do that . Because my background is predominantly in hospitality , I 'd like to demonstrate how analytics can benefit the hotel industry . <p> 55% of all leisure and business reservations are expected to be made online for 2013 ( PhoCusWright ) , which means measuring and optimizing a hotels digital marketing is more important than ever before . <p> Although monitoring standard web metrics like visitors , page views , and average visit duration is useful , that information is just the tip of the iceberg . Truly Transformative InsightsG that change the way your organization manages its marketing spawn from pulling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also from a variety of marketing channels . <p> The average conversion rate for hotel websites is about 2% . In other words , approximately 98% of visitors to a hotels website leave without making a reservation . This suggests that the hotel industry could be doing significantly more to capitalize on visitors interest . It is imperative that hotels utilize the right data in the right way to paint a clearer picture of how their audience interacts with their marketing . <p> The key to understanding your audience is segmentation . Were not necessarily referring to segmenting visitors by age , gender , or geographic location ( although , depending on your business goals , those qualities might be important ) . At MaassMedia , we strive for more granular segmentation to understand each visitors intentions , then serve each visitor a unique digital experience optimized for conversion . <p> With analytics , you can measure where each visitor stands in the purchase consideration spectrum . Some visitors may have their minds made up about booking a room , while others might be on the fence . Defining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who complete these actions can reflect a visitors propensity to buy . Additionally , analytics tracks metrics like how recently or frequently a visitor views the website , which can help identify which visitors are ready to book a room and which are undecided . Using this information , hotel websites can then personalize the content that the visitor sees , raising their likelihood to book . <p> For example : Let 's say a prospective guest has visited the hotels site on numerous occasions in a short time span without making a reservation . We can establish that the guest is probably significantly interested in booking a room , but might need some added incentive to make the decision . Using analytics , the hotel could identify these visitors and display a time-sensitive offer only for those visitors who are on the fence . <p> Only visitors who need incentive to purchase are shown the time-sensitive offer <p> Data can also be collected from interactive content , like internal search terms and filters . If a visitor consistently books or views hotels costing over $500/night , the website could recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this increase the likelihood of a larger sale , but the purchasing experience for the guest also improves tremendously because they do n't  have to filter through the hotels that do n't  interest them . <p> Hotel franchisors can also capitalize on trends in their data . For example , if there is a substantial increase in searches for a particular destination , brands can recommend that their franchisees in that location raise their rates because of the spike in demand . This could substantially improve the revenue that the franchises website generates . <p> Although opportunities to customize or modify the website may be limited for branded hotels ( franchisors may not give complete freedom to alter or add content to their website ) , independent hotels and resorts have significant opportunities to use analytics to their advantage . Even if they can improve their conversion rate from 2% to 2.5% , that 's still a 25% increase in conversion rate . <p> Many independent hotels have n't implemented any data analytics on their websites . Without even a basic implementation , hotel owners are missing out on important insights about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assortment of packages to their guests , but if hotels are n't  using analytics , they cant know which packages are most and least popular with certain types of visitors . By tracking purchases only , they miss out on seeing how many guests viewed the package but chose not to purchase it . <p> Similarly , if the hotel offers services like banquet halls or catering , web analytics can she 'd light onto visitors level of interest and the best ways to market those services online . Are guests searching to sign up for loyalty membership ? Do they want to book meetings or events in a particular city or region ? Are they more or less price sensitive ? Analytics enables hotel brands to gather data that can answer these questions . If utilized correctly , it can be a tremendous asset to improving a revenue management and building a customer relationship management ( CRM ) system . <p> Analytics in the hospitality industry provides a way to better understand guests purchasing and staying behavior , as well as audience engagement across a variety of marketing channels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industries .

@@83647746 @5147746/ <h> Thursday , 26th June 2014 <p> So let me just say this first : I love the new Google Sheets , I hate the new Add-ons for Google Analytics . <p> Let me explain . <p> One of my favorite things about Google Sheets is its ability to retrieve Google Analytics data through the Core Reporting API without any complicated coding . All you need is the Google Analytics Report Automation ( Magic Script ) . The script used to be available under Tools &gt; Script Gallery ; you just need to set up and authorize it to access the Analytics API . It has since been replaced by the new Google Analytics Add-ons , but in this post I 'll show you how you can still use the old script along with its awesome automation options ( not available yet in the new Adds-on ) . Ill throw in a bonus solution for an execution time error you might run into when calling for a large number of APIs . <p> Ive used Magic Script for a good number of ad-hoc analyses , especially when bumped against custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , though , is that Magic Script let 's me set up scheduled API calls so my dashboards and reports automatically update . Fast forward to December 2013 , when the new Google Sheets was introduced . The new Sheets is a thing to behold : it is much faster , the formula editing more convenient , the formatting options more flexible , and the old sheet limits basically nonexistent . As the new features were rolled out , the old script gallery was replaced by the Adds-on store , and the Magic Script was replaced by the Google Analytics Adds-on . <p> Okay , the GA Add-ons is a great tool . It looks great , and it takes care of the API authorization part for you. - However , its missing an important factor : the ability to trigger API calls on schedule . My opinion ? Leave the GA Add-ons for one-off , ad-hoc calls , or when you have to teach someone to pull some GA data really quickly . In order to regain the trigger options , follow these easy steps : <p> Click on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well <p> Now you 're ready . Go back and refresh your document and a Google Analytics tab should appear . From here you can click on Create Core Report , put in the GA view i 'd ( if you do n't  know the GA i 'd , you can use the Find Profile/ids option in the Google Analytics tab ) , start and end dates , metrics , dimensions ( and filters and dimensions , if you want ) , and the sheet name . Then go to Google Analytics &gt; Run Reports and watch magic happen . <p> If the Google Analytics tab disappears for any reason , just type the information in ( see above ) , go to the Script Editor , click on Select Function , choose Get Data , and then click the " Run " arrow to the left of " Select Function . " That is the equivalent of clicking " Run Reports . " <p> In order to enable triggers , go back to the Script Editor , go to Resources &gt; Current projects triggers , then add a getData Time-driven trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 and 6am . <p> Now the only limitation to the magic script is that it only runs for 5-6 minutes , so if you are automating a giant dashboard , like I unfortunately was , it could become a bit of a problem . <p> What I ended up doing was to split my APIs into two different Sheets , each with an ungodly number of calls , and use the function IMPORTRANGE to copy the data I needed from one Sheet to another . IMPORTRANGE , coincidentally , is one- of the formulas that had a great boost from the new Google Sheets . You used to be able to have only 50 IMPORTRANGE functions in one Sheet , now its basically unlimited . Thank you , Google . To be specific , say you want to copy A1:C5 from Sheet1 of Spreadsheet1 to B3:D7 of Sheet 1 , Spreadsheet2 , do the following : <p> Clear B3:D7 on Sheet1 , Spreadsheet2 ( otherwise you 'll get an overwrite error , and your formula will never work ) <p> Copy the URL of Spreadsheet1 ( in the old Sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Sheet calls for the whole URL ) <p> So that 's how you can set up scheduled API calls in the new Google Sheets , and overcome the maximum execution time error , if you run into that problem . I also observed that the new Sheets calls GA data much faster than the old sheet even when using the same scripts . Curious about the new Google Analytics Add-ons ? Its a fast , simple way to overcome the GA custom report limitations . Simply open a new Sheet , go to Add-ons &gt; Get Add-ons , then search for Google Analytics . The report layout is very similar to the Magic Scripts layout , so it should n't be a shock . <p> Thanh-Trang Hoang-Le ( a.k.a . T ) is a Data Analyst and Statistician at MaassMedia .

@@83647761 @5147761/ <h> Tuesday , 5th November 2013 <p> In my last post I explained what online engagement is and why it should be measured . In this post I am going to show you how to measure engagement online and the ways it can , in turn , help your business . The first step in measuring online engagement is to define what engagement means to you and your organization . Which user actions and attributes would make you believe that she or he is engaged with your website/mobile site/mobile app ? These actions and attributes can be broken down into four ( 4 ) main parts : <p> Acquisition sources ( BARV ) <p> Visitor Loyalty ( VL ) <p> Content Consumption ( PV TOS ) <p> Content Interaction ( VI ) <p> If you are a mathematician and would like to see a formula defining visitor engagement , then your wish is my command : VE = ( ( PV TOS ) and/or ( BARV ) and/or ( VL ) and/or ( VI ) ) I know , not really a mathematical formula but it looks interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is equal to a combination of page views and time on site of specific content ( PV TOS ) and/or a brand aware returning visitor ( BARV ) and/or visitor loyalty ( VL ) and/or visitor interaction ( VI ) . Fairly simple , right ? I bet most of you are already probably measuring most of the items listed here . The tricky part comes when you have to define thresholds for these parts . For example , do you consider a person that returns once a week to your site engaged ? What about twice a day ? What is the correct threshold to define a visitor " s engagement ? That question can be answered by analyzing your past data . What about content interaction ? What actions on the site do you consider to be a sign of engagement ? Watching a video , sharing a story , commenting ? Possibly a combination of some sort ? This is what needs to be decided in order to create the threshold . Why do we even need to create a threshold , you might ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to understand your engaged users , you must segment them from the rest of your audience for further analysis . The wonderful part of my formula above is the plethora of opportunity it gives you to segment your audience . Each one of the parts of the formula can be used as a separate segment . By doing this you can trend the segment over time to see if your engaged audience is growing or depleting . You can even create a complex segment with AND and OR statements to see how many unique visitors are engaged with your site . Okay , so all of this measurement and segmentation is great , but does it pass the " so what " test ? Now what is the " so what " test ? Well , let " s take an example . Say you come to me and tell me that our engaged visitor segment increased month over month , my answer would be " so what ? " What can I do with that information that will help me increase my bottom line , either through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how can measuring and reporting on engagement be turned into an action item to positively impact the business ? Lucky for you , I have a couple of suggestions . Let " s say you have content site that doesn " t sell a product but generates revenue mainly through the sale of advertising placed on the site . It seems extremely logical to measure engagement on this type of site because there is nothing to sell , right ? What if , after measuring engagement , you realize that your engaged audience generates 10x the amount of ad impressions than the average visitor . Also , what if you could prove that your engaged audience was 5x more engaged with the advertising on the site ? Your goal then would be to acquire , retain , and develop as many engaged visitors as possible . How can this be done ? Firstly , by segmenting your engaged audience you can begin to understand where these visitors are coming from and spend your marketing dollars on those acquisition sources in order to increase your engaged visitors . Secondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , by creating segments based on engagement will help you understand the type of content that your engaged visitors value the most . Personalized content may then be delivered through a targeting tool that head toward your end goal , which is to increase visitor engagement with your site through acquiring new engaged visitors , to retain our current engaged visitors , and to drive the visitors you currently have to engage more with your content/site/brand . I have laid out a good basic framework for you to begin measuring engagement and have explained how it can be used in the media vertical for content sites . What about ecommerce sites ? Should they measure engagement or is it good enough to just segment for purchasers ? Ecommerce sites should , without a doubt , measure engagement . I would go so far as to argue that it is even more important to do so in an ecommerce site than in sites that don " t sell a product . My next blog post Measuring Engagement for an Ecommerce Site , will discuss the topic in details . 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647767 @5147767/ <h> Monday , 21st January 2013 <p> In todays world of Big Data , simplicity is being lost . Every day , analysts and marketers are inundated with enormous amounts of information about consumers , including shopping patterns , attrition , engagement , annual spend , and more . Then there 's product data , which allows retailers to know which items generate the most margin or brand loyalty . And we cant forget competitor data , which is essential for keeping tabs on the industry and staying one step ahead of the rest . Theres customer survey data , which can measure brand awareness . Then on top of that , you 're regularly being offered new tools to measure all of these metrics . <p> Sometimes , we need to slow things down to find clarity . Step back from the noise and take a look at the Big Picture , not just the Big Data . When you see things from afar , you can discern the kind of information that matters to your business from the information that does n't  produce actionable insights . <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing plan across multiple channels based on ROI . This is not intended as an " End all , be all " formula . Its more so a way to get you thinking about your marketing and guide some of decision-making when it comes to your marketing budget . <h> Step 1 : Take a look back <p> Historical data is an analysts best friend . When you know what happened last year , you can easily use that data for future planning purposes . Keep in mind , one data point does not make a trend . You ca n't count on that new promotion to keep returning high response rates just because the first campaign was successful . It may have been one and done . I like to use at least three data points for directional purposes , but more are always better . <h> Step 2 : Level the playing field <p> Although different marketing channels often have very different KPIs , there can be common metrics ( Pay attention , because this is where we remove the noise ! ) . With email , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct mail , you might look at metrics like in-home rates and coupon redemptions . You get the point , but to calculate ROI , you 'll need to tie the marketing contact back to a purchase . I know this can be difficult , but once you tie back the purchases you can then use common metrics like response rate , average order , margin % and cost per contact to do comparisons across channels . <h> Step 3 : Plan in chunks <p> Most businesses are affected by seasonality in some way or another . Just because your mobile campaign performed well over summer does n't  mean customers will respond the same during the holiday shopping season . Use data from comparable time frames year-over-year . I like to build my plans quarter by quarter , but you may need to use different time periods based on your business strategy . <h> Step 4 : Determine what is driving your marketing plan <p> This is where things can fall apart . Let me guess , you need more sales and margin , more customers and higher retention , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , but it does n't  have to set you back . Ask yourself this : Do you need sales today , or can you afford to spend a few dollars on branding ? As marketers , we tend to address the immediate needs of the business , often pushing aside the long view . This is where ROI can really help . Take a look at the chart below . <p> ROI Calculation : ( Margin " - Cost ) /Cost <p> Above are Sales and Margin projections , by channel , based on historical data . Metrics like RR% , average order and margin % are based on prior campaigns , adjusting for seasonality and fluctuations in customer counts . Each channel can have different customer counts according to their nature ( i.e. opt-ins for email and mobile ) . Customers opting in to different channels may have different values ( i.e. sale per contact and margin per contact ) based on their purchase history , loyalty or a number of other factors . <h> Step 5 : Execution <p> Let 's say you have $500K to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Heres what I would do : <p> Direct mail would get the bulk of the budget because its the largest driver of sales and margin per contact , even though it does n't  generate the highest ROI . Mobile has a great ROI , but there are n't  enough customers yet to drive a month-long campaign . Email could be used to reinforce direct mail or to promote a secondary offer in case the initial offer becomes stale . <p> Print is not being utilized in this campaign due to its low ROI and low margin per contact . This plan is really looking at the " short run . " The business requires sales now and cant spend funding on print . Although this might be a tough pill to swallow , your ROI analysis could spur a conversation with higher-ups about branding , which may necessitate a future budget increase . <p> At MaassMedia , we believe its insights like these that are most valuable .

@@83647774 @5147774/ <h> Friday , 23rd December 2016 <p> What are your plans for Christmas and New Year 's ? If you are travelling and staying in a hotel , you might have contributed to the price fluctuations of hotel rooms during this holiday season . The hotel and hospitality industry caters to many holiday travellers every year . In the past several years , analytics has brought many changes to the industry . <p> While the new data available enables hotel executives to build more flexible pricing models and increase revenue through returns on strategic marketing and customer loyalty programs , consumers are always on the other side of the equation.At MaassMedia , we help our clients drive actionable insights from data . Through this indexing project , I took a data-driven approach to examining how a traveller might make smarter decisions about when to buy his or her holiday travel tickets . <p> According to Business Insider , the best time to book hotels during the December holidays varies by global destination . The article also points out that for US hotels , November is the best time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tested to see if this is true based on data extracted from Expedia.com , and- used import.io , a web data extractor , to collect the prices of hotel rooms for several cities . The cities I collected hotel data from are New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago , Washington , Boston , Seattle and Philadelphia , covering several metropolitan areas on both the East Coast and West Coast . Each data collection search was based on a standard room for 2 people for the dates of December 23 December 30 . <p> The index in this project evaluates the performance of an aggregated grouping of hotels , using star ratings and locations as key indicators to divide submarkets . Room availability and customer demand are two leading factors in hotel pricing models , because for hotels to maximize their revenue they need to set rates according to demand at a certain time . While past historical data is taken into consideration , the actual daily price fluctuations reflect the hospitality market responding to the changes in demand happening right now . <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of central tendency , because a few outliers in high hotel price points can have a huge effect on the average and maximum prices . I used the median hotel prices available on the day of data collection to compare eight different cities . By taking the median hotel room prices from eight cities , I visualized the price fluctuations for 3-star and 4-star hotels . The pricing trends for 5-star hotels were not investigated due to small sample size . <p> Overall , the 4-star hotel submarket has larger variations than the 3-star submarket . For instance , median hotel prices in New York increase 14% from November 4 to December 2nd . In Philadelphia , the median prices for 4-star hotels drop 40% during the same time period . If you have several 4-star hotels in mind , you are more likely to get a better deal if you wait until Black Friday . If you are considering booking a 3-star hotel , make your reservations during the week of Nov 18th ( one week before Thanksgiving ) . The median hotel prices in New York show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a surprise given New York 's popularity as a Christmas and New Year 's destination , it is still interesting to see the consistency between 3-star and 4-star hotels . If you are going to New York for New Year 's , keep in mind that prices rise substantially the later you book . <p> I also ranked the variability of hotel prices in different cities to quantify price fluctuations for submarkets of each destination . It turns out that the 4-star hotel submarkets in Philadelphia and Chicago are the ones with the most price variation . In the 3-star hotel submarket , San Francisco is the top city for price variability , with Chicago right behind it . Although the ranking of price variability is not exactly the same in 3-star and 4-star hotel submarkets , there is a strong correlation between the two groups . Since higher hotel prices in 4-star submarket encourage travelers to consider more 3-star options during December holidays , the 3-star hotel submarket could have larger price fluctuations through an increase in variability of 4-star submarket . <p> This price variability data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booking hotels based on their travel destinations . For example , if a 3-star hotel at Philadelphia is $150 per night in early November , you should confirm your hotel bookings as long as the room price is around $117 ( a 22% drop ) , since they are not likely to go below that range . On the other hand , book ahead if you are checking out the 3-star hotels in Los Angeles . Since the prices do not usually change much , watching for a better deal is waste of time . <p> Given the holiday trends in 2016 , do you have a game plan for booking your hotels during the holiday season next year ?

In order to reach significance in the Monetate setup , each challenger page must have its own designated set of default traffic to use for comparison . <p> In our example , each challenger page receives 25% of total traffic , and each would be compared with a 25% portion of the traffic to the default .

They should focus on the top 20% of their viewer base . <p> If we consider the 80/20 rule ( otherwise known as the Pareto Principle ) , 80% of a company 's revenue will be generated by 20% of its customers , and here at MaassMedia , we consider those 20% of customers to be a great segment to research .

Here are a few to get you started : <p> 1 . What shows get the most consumption per high-value viewer . <p> You most likely know your most popular shows in terms of overall views .

Over the next few weeks we 'll be posting a few new blogs all related to the big event and using a variety of data sources . <p> To begin with , we 're going to take a look at crime during the Papal visit . With an estimated 1-2 million people expected to attend the outdoor mass there will obviously be a huge influx of tourist in the city for at least a few days . That got us wondering : Will criminals take advantage of all the religious folks wandering around our great city or will there be a sense of brotherly love ? <p> To answer this question we built a dashboard using crime data that you can find on OpenDataPhilly.org here . The first chart is a line graph comparing all crime incidents during the month of September over the past five years . The second visualization is a map of downtown Philadelphia . Each colored dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papal visit we will update the entire visualization each morning , as luckily the good folks at Open Data Philly maintain this data set and refresh it each day . The line chart will allow us to see if there is a spike in crime compared to previous years and the map will obviously point out those specific incidents . <p> **UPDATED 10/5/15** <p> The big event is over and we all survived . The Pope came and went , and now its time to look back to see what , if any , effect the event had on our city . <p> The initial idea I had in writing this blog was to answer one question : Would the influx of religious pilgrims cause a change in the citys crime rate , either up or down ? With opposite forces in tow , I was n't sure in which direction the crime rate might move . On one hand , we had a massive amount of people entering the city over a brief period of time which can be difficult to manage . On the other hand , could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city if for only a weekend ? <p> So the data is in , and with not too much excitement , I have to announce that we did n't  see a change in the trend . Overall crime in the city has been on a downward trend over the past five years and that continued through the Pope weekend . When I looked at the moving average I did see a slight dip in the weekend compared to previous years , but nothing too far out of the norm . We did see a reduction in crime along the Ben Franklin Parkway . If you take a look at the crime map you wo n't see too many red dots around the Parkway . This makes sense as the Parkway was basically on Police lock down which must have pushed some crime activities out to other parts of the city . <p> Gregory Kaminski is the Senior Manager of Digital Analytics at MaassMedia and has over 15 years of experience in the fields of data analysis and web analytics .

Well why not take this idea and adapt it to your business regardless of what you 're building ? <p> Sidebar : This past Spring at Philly Tech Week I attended an event titled The Future of Digital Marketing where Robert Moore of RJMetrics presented a narrative in which his team executed just such an idea . I thought it to be a brilliant idea and took it back to Maass to begin planning immediately . Just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's walk through the process of planning this out for your organization . <p> Step 1 Pick a Date You 'll need an entire day to host the hackathon so choosing a day when your team wo n't be bogged down with too much work is key . Leading into a holiday is a good choice because their minds may already be elsewhere . <p> Step 2 Brainstorming A month before the hackathon have your team brainstorm on things that they are passionate about , but just have n't been able to find the time to work on . Here are a few ideas to get you started : <p> Produce a collection of webinars for eLearning on your website . <p> Create a culture deck for on-boarding new employees as well as maintaining satisfaction for existing team members . <p> Build and promote a mobile app . <p> Create a social media and PR strategy for the coming 12 months . <p> Volunteer for a community service project . <p> Perform a competitive analysis for your business . <p> Step 3 Selecting a Project Let your team members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on . So here you can go one of two ways . For ultimate creative freedom , you can allow each team member to work on any project that they are interested in . You may have many individuals working alone so watch out for a bit of chaos in this scenario . <p> Here are Maass we choose to break up into two large teams . That way we were able to harness the collaborative power of each team member while still giving them a bit of choice in the project they found most appealing . <p> Step 4 Planning Do a bit of planning before the big day . Putting a few rules into place will help to guide your teams in the right direction . For example , each project should be 65-80% complete so that your company can take the idea and run with it if you choose to do so . Also , teams should keep in mind the potential positive impact the idea may have on your business and how that impact will be measurable in some way . Lastly , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your teams well fed and hydrated so that they can focus all of their energy on their specific project . ( Coffee &gt; Water &gt; Alcohol ) <p> Step 5 The Wrap-Up So at Maass we reserved an hour at the end of the day for each team to present their project to a panel of outside judges . This is where the competition portion of the day came into play . ( We actually called our event The Analytics Apprentice ' as we knew there would be some judging involved at the end . ) The judges voted on the idea that they felt was most feasible , exhibited the most creativity and could be maintained with a reasonable amount of effort . <p> For your hackathon you may not be able to have a panel of judges , but you should at least allow some time at the end of the day for each team and/or individual to present their project no matter how much they completed . Some teams are going to fail , and that 's ok , because at least they tried something new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're probably curious , so I 'll let you know that the winning team in our hackathon created a robust internship program to help develop and cultivate new talent in the digital analytics space . In one day , they laid out an entire strategy for contacting colleges and universities . They created and printed collateral to be distributed to potential interns . They built from scratch several new pages on our site that described the program as well as built an online application form for potential interns to apply . It was all pretty amazing . <p> And finally , you should reward your team in some way . It could either be the winning team or everyone who participated . That 's your call . We decided to give our winning team each a $50 Amazon gift card for their creativity and extreme hard work . <p> Questions about this or other analytics tools ?

@@83647817 @5147817/ <h> Wednesday , 13th July 2016 <p> Digital analytics practitioners from all over the country gathered the eMetrics Summit in Chicago in June to discuss how to realize digital marketing efficiency and effectiveness . With four keynote presentations and 24 speakers , this Summit was more intimate than the Adobe Summits of the world , which is one of the things I most enjoyed . <p> The presentations gave participants two tracks from which to choose . The Cornerstones track focused on strategies and frameworks , with leading brands and consultants offering advice for the full lifecycle of digital analytics , from the collection and integration of data to testing and reporting . The Applied Science track provided practitioners with tips on managing data to help organizations achieve a data-driven culture . <p> As an introvert , one of my favorite parts of the day was actually the speed networking , a concept that appears to be unique , at least amongst analytics conferences , to eMetrics Summits . Two rows of attendees were seated facing each other , with one minute to introduce themselves . When the one-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing us to meet about 15 people in 15 minutes . I was surprised by the number of attendees that failed to bring business cards ; not sure if that was due to the millennial mindset or the fact that many of the participants were first being introduced to the analytics field , with some in their first job ever . Until we can mind-swap LinkedIn profiles , you too must fill your bag with a stack of cardboard cards . <p> Another difference between the eMetrics Summit and many digital analytics conferences was the opportunity to participate in small group discussions . In the first roundtable , Nobody Knows the Trouble I 've Seen , we discussed problems that we face and , in a supportive environment with other people that understand our pain , arrived at some solutions to those problems . My table discussed whether the analytics leadership should be on the client side or with independent consultants . With three consultants and two client-side practitioners , it was an interesting discussion . I was surprised to hear the perspective of the other two consultants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being part of an analytics-focused consultancy , whereas the other two were with full-service agencies that have an analytics component . From being on both the client side and the consulting side over the years , my personal opinion is that when consultants are involved , the analytics leadership ultimately works best when it resides in the client organization . This helps to develop a data-driven culture , with analytics champions within the organization , and consultants serve as an extension of that team by supporting the client in all of the same ways as the organizations ' employees . <p> The second roundtable , The One Weird Trick I Wish I 'd Known Sooner , allowed us to share the wisdom we gathered throughout our careers . The tables had 30 minutes to share advice and decide which tip was the best . The top idea from each table went head to head on stage , with $100 up for grabs for the top tip . Of course each table cheered loudest for its designated member , so the scoring was pretty even , and each member ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications theme , and my contribution did as well . While not really a trick , the one thing I wish I 'd known sooner is how important it is to communicate with other teams . I 've learned to go outside my comfort zone and reach out when I do n't know the answer to a question , need clarification , or just to develop relationships within my own team and the teams with which we 're intertwined . As analysts , we often work in our own little bubble , happily engulfed in code , Charles logs , and reports , with headphones blocking out the outside world . While this is necessary for many of us to concentrate , I recommend that all of those in the analytics field , new or seasoned , develop stronger relationships with marketers , developers , project managers , and any other teams that play a role in building the analytics practice at your organization . <p> There will always be people who love data and those who hate it . When approaching anyone in your organization with results , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The latter can come across as condescending , while the former focuses on your customers and is more impartial . <p> Being creative can be as good as being smart . Look at the big picture to help you reach your goals , whether that is to get head count on your team or to help stakeholders trust data . <p> Integrating data can have synergistic effect . Voice of customer integrations , such as ForeSee and Adobe Analytics , can provide context to your data , making it even more powerful . <p> What you choose to analyze is key to your success . Look for key performance indicators in which a significant rise or fall results in someone being promoted or fired . Sounds harsh , but it 's true . <p> Just because you can track something , does n't  mean you should . I do n't know how many times I fought this battle over the years , and it continues each and every day . Just because you max out your variables does n't  mean you have an amazing implementation ! <p> Business requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Always start by understanding the business requirements , then you can build out your solution design reference ( SDR ) and the rest of your implementation plan . <p> Knowing how to use your analytics tools is more important than you think . It 's amazing how many practitioners do n't actually know how to use the tools at their disposal . Master these tools ; giving people wrong data is worse than not giving them data at all . <p> Perception is reality , so guard your teams internal reputation . <p> Always , always QA . My own presentation was quite heavy on this concept . It is better to have 10 metrics you know are right than 100 you think are right . <p> Do n't  sit in your cube like Milton . As I said a few times throughout this post , get away from your desk once in awhile and see how you can better collaborate with the larger cross-functional team at your organization .

With this insight , you can optimize your subject lines for better open rates . <h> Bounce Rate 188225 @qwx808225 <p> This is the portion of subscribers who did not receive your email . There are two types of bounces : a soft bounce and a hard bounce . A soft bounce happens when a recipients inbox is full or their email server is down . These messages are often delayed temporarily and will eventually be delivered . A hard bounce is the result of a nonexistent email address , and these emails do not reach the intended recipient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  want to miss out on an opportunity to reach them ( especially if they 're engaged enough to register for your emails ! ) . <p> Take a look at the email addresses that are bouncing .

You can also lower your email campaigns bounce rate by adding an email verification step to your registration process . <p> Many bounces are sent to changed or deactivated email addresses . If your CRM stores additional contact information for your customers , you can try following up with them via phone or snail mail to update their email address , reclaiming valuable prospects and customers . <p> You should also make it easy for subscribers to notify you about a change of email address by providing a link at the bottom of each email .

@@83647819 @5147819/ <h> Monday , 15th October 2012 <p> My last blog post about Multi-Channel Funnels outlined the Overview , Assisted Conversions , and Top Conversion Paths reports . Here in Part 2 , I 'll explain how to use the Time Lag and Path Length reports to help you find Transformative InsightsG into how your audience is converting on your site . Time Lag The Time Lag report is a great way to analyze visitor loyalty in relation to conversion . At a glance , you can see how many days have lapsed on average between a visitor 's conversion and the last time they visited the site . The shorter the lag between last visit and conversion , the better your site is performing.Put yourself in your audience 's shoes : Why might a visitor convert on a later visit ? What is keeping visitors from converting today ? These are questions that can help you optimize your site for quicker turnaround on conversions . You can also use the Time Lag report for testing and optimization by comparing the lag before and after making changes to your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change was not beneficial , whereas a decrease in time lag could signal an improvement . In this report , there are several columns to understand : <p> Time Lag in Days is the number of days between the last visit and the visit upon which conversion took place . <p> The Conversions column displays the number of conversions that occurred for that specific time lag . <p> Conversion Value is the sum of the values of all the goals completed for that specific time lag . This is calculated based on goal values previously set ( Goal values can be set in the Admin menu under the Goals tab ) . For an e-commerce site , this is usually a monetary value . <p> In the Percentage of Total column , you can easily visualize what time lag is responsible for the greatest percentage of conversions and conversion value . Both Conversions and Conversion Value as percentage of the total are displayed as horizontal bars . These percentages should always be relatively close to each other . If they are not , double check the values assigned to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another has an extremely low value , this could skew the percentages . <p> In the example below , conversions most commonly occur on visitors ' current visit , or with a time lag of zero days . In fact , about 72% of conversions occur on the current visit . That means that 27% of conversions occurred when visitors returned one or more days after the current visit . This is a valuable insight for a company that relies on conversions to drive business because it means they are successfully driving conversions immediately on the site . This could be a result of marketing campaigns influencing visitors to come to the site already prepared to convert without hesitation . TIP : By default , Google Analytics groups together time lags of 12 or more days in the " 12+ " category . This can be expanded to show 12-29 days of time lag by clicking on the plus sign on the left , which could be useful if your organization averages a longer conversion time lag . Like the other Multi Channel Funnel reports , you can customize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types , toggle between All conversions , only AdWords conversions , or only DFA conversions , and choose to either include or exclude display impressions . Refer to Part 1 of Using Google Analytics Multi Channel Funnels for more details about these options . - Path Length The Path Length report is similar to the Time Lag report in appearance , but shows a different , yet equally important , measurement . Path length is the number of touches ( display , paid search , organic search , referral , etc ) that a visitor encounters on their path to conversion . Recall the Top Conversion Paths report , reviewed in Part 1 , which shows the top paths responsible for the most conversions . The Path Length report simply takes the path lengths from that reports and categorizes them into buckets by numeric length . This report can be used to identify the " sweet spot " for number of channel touches visitors encounter before converting . In general , the less channel touches necessary to get a visitor to convert , the more successful your campaigns efforts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with display campaigns . For example , if you toggle results to display only DFA conversions , you can easily determine the average number of display advertisements visitors need to see and/or click before deciding to convert . Bring that knowledge to the department responsible for display and they can decide how to optimize the media budget based on this ideal number of ads . In the Path Length report , the columns are the same as the Time Lag report and are pretty self-explanatory . Like the Time Lag report , the Path Length Report also allows you to choose one or more conversion types , toggle between conversion type ( All , AdWords , DFA ) , and select or de-select to include display impressions in the total reported conversions . In the example below , conversions occur with one touch only 2.55% of the time . Interestingly , the path length with the greatest percentage of conversions is 2 touches , with about 20% of total conversions occurring at this path length . This means that 20% of the visitors needed to interact with two channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not allow for further investigation , but you can use the Top Conversion Paths report to drill further down into your data and see exactly what these multiple touches are .

Here are 5 important website actions not tracked with an out of the box implementation that need to be tracked with custom events or variables . <p> 1 . ) Onsite Search This is an often overlooked website action that can provide key insights into how people are browsing your site . It will also provide an indication of the content visitors are having a hard time finding through regular navigation and identify missing content that visitors might expect to find . If I am visiting a site to find something specific , I 'll often use the search tool . If I do n't  find what I am looking for , I move on to another site . <p> TIP : Track the number of times the search function is used in an event , along with search terms in a custom variable . <p> 2 . ) Navigation Tracking navigation elements is just as criticalif not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation will tell you visitors most common paths , as well as the most popular links in each directory . You can use custom link tracking or custom link IDs on all of your navigation links , but click map data usually provides enough valuable insight . Make sure the click map picks up any drop down or hidden links . Also , tracking previous page clicks can be difficult if all of your links are n't  unique on each page . <p> 3 . ) Social Media There a few different ways to incorporate social media into your web content , and each is tracked differently with different limitations . The first and the more common method is a small logo linked to your websites Facebook or Twitter page ( or LinkedIn , Google , etc ) . These can usually be tracked by setting up custom exit link tracking . The more difficult buttons to track are the interactive share buttons that allow visitors to post to Facebook and Tweet without leaving your page . These actions should be captured in a custom analytics variable .

If you are not tagging your creative with unique IDs , as well as with a custom event , you wo n't know which are most effective . <p> 5 . ) Conversion For most websites , conversion is the most important metric . Whether it be e-commerce , lead conversion , or ad generation , your site should be tracking conversions with detailed custom implementations . On a lead generation site , you need to launch a serialized event on your confirmation page . E-commerce sites need to launch an event through each step of the checkout process , as well- as capture all product and cart information in a custom analytics variable .

Clearly , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . How do we do that ? Behavioral targeting is a practical and smart way to personalize the website for different types of visitors upon return . <p> Behavioral Targeting is a term that sometimes makes people feel uncomfortable , but knowing how targeting works will help you understand why its important to your website performance .

When you visit a website , you get " cookied " and your visit details get stored .

Depending on your bucket , you 'll be presented with different content upon your visit compared to other website visitors whose behavior is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to acknowledge your insight on their interests and needs , and when done effectively , it also can be a very powerful tool in building a long-term relationship with your customers . <p> However , marketers must beware that when targeting existing customers , there is an increased burden to be more precise with your messaging .

Targeting based on actual collected behavioral data and not implied behaviors may provide a middle ground that 's likely to yield more effective results than non-targeted efforts , but does n't  cross the line of creepy .

But if you have defective code or havent tagged the proper KPIs , your data ( and , consequently , your insights ) will suffer . <h> Monday , 20th August 2012 <p> Redesigning a website is n't only about giving it a fresh look and feel . A redesigned website should deliver a better overall experience to your visitor , and that goes much deeper than aesthetics . Your digital analytics can help you understand what your visitors are doing on your website , while also distinguishing content that works well from content that does n't  . <p> Before looking at your data in Google Analytics , Adobe SiteCatalyst , or whichever analytics platform you use , take a moment to review the goals youd like your website to accomplish . For example , a content-heavy website like the Huffington Post or The Onion might want to keep visitors engaged with interesting articles , in which case , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A new brand or budding startup company might be interested in gaining more recognition through social media , so they might create goals around social elements like share widgets . An e-commerce site like Amazon or Zappos aims to make sales , and for them , conversion is the ultimate goal . <p> Your website is an extension of your organization and should work toward achieving your business objectives , just as a store or spokesperson should accomplish this offline . <p> Here are a few metrics to consider before redesigning your website : <h> Internal search <p> What is it ? <p> If your website has a search box , visitors can use it to find specific content within your website . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> You might think you know what your visitors want , but checking your internal search keywords is a good way to know for sure if your website is lacking content or products that are in high demand , or if that content or product is difficult to find on your site . At MaassMedia , we tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of internal searches for thumb drives . The client did not sell thumb drives , but added the product to their inventory when they realized their visitors were looking for them . <h> Clickmap <p> What is it ? <p> A clickmap is a visual outline of a page within a website that displays the percent and/or number of clicks to each link on the page . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> Clickmaps allow you to identify the links that are performing best and worst , which can help you evaluate the effectiveness of your call-to-actions . Some platforms offer more advanced clickmaps that can follow mouse movement and scrolling in addition to clicks . There is even an emerging technology that can follow a visitors eye movement on a page . Knowing which parts of a page draw the most attention can help you identify the most appropriate spots to place content on a page , as well as spots that do n't  perform as well . <h> Screen resolution <p> What is it ? <p> Screen resolution refers to the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on most computers , and it differs from the screen resolution on a tablet or mobile device , which is significantly smaller and often has different proportions . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> Tech savvy readers may recall a time long before mobile and tablet browsing when 1024+768 pixels was the standard screen resolution . Prior to that , 800+600 pixels was the norm . Today , however , screens come in all shapes and sizes , and resolution can be customized to a number of dimensions . It is important that your website looks and functions its best on any device at any screen resolution . <p> You can optimize your site for themost common resolution(s) and redirect visitors to a version of your site fit to their screen , or you can implement a new technology called responsive design . <p> A website with responsive design changes to fit your browser width . Content can move around or be hidden completely , and fonts and images can resize accordingly . Not only does responsive design work on various screen resolutions and devices , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . The Boston Globe is an example of a website with responsive design . Test it out by visiting the site and resizing your browser window . <h> Bounce rate <p> What is it ? <p> Not to be confused with exit rate , which is simply the percent of visitors who leave a specific page , bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave your site- without visiting any other page . After landing on a page , the visitor either clicks offsite or closes his or her browser window . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> A high bounce rate- is n't necessarily a bad thing , depending on the purpose of the page . If a visitor is able to find everything s/he needs on a single page , that bounce is an indication that the visitors needs were met . Most websites , however , are structured in a way that the visitor must visit several pages before conversion . <p> On an e-commerce site , for example , a visitor might click on a category of products , then a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , ultimately , making the purchase . In this case , it would be considered a loss if the visitor left the homepage without visiting any other pages . If you take a look at the pages on your site with the highest bounce rates , you can quickly identify pages that are underperforming and start thinking of solutions for improvement . <h> Time on page <p> What is it ? <p> This one is pretty self-explanatory : Time on page calculates how long visitors spend on a given page , on average . <p> How can it influence website redesign ? <p> As with bounce rate , a page with a low average time on page is not always a downfall . If the page is n't particularly content-heavy and quickly gets to the point , a visitor might only need to spend a few seconds on it before moving on . <p> However , unusually low time on page can be a red flag that it needs some work . Visitors spending an average of 10 seconds on a page with your 5,000 word bio might be turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of images , and/or your ego .

To avoid overwhelming a potential customer with too many ads , test different frequency caps for exposure . <p> Don " t just focus on clicks .

Happy 4th of July from all of us at MaassMedia , LLC . <h> Tuesday , 22nd May 2012 <p> As testing and optimization become even more influential to a websites success , it is important to choose the platform that is right for your business model . I specifically want to talk about the difference between Monetate and Test&amp;Target . <p> Each platform has its own positives and negatives . Depending on how robust your testing program is or how focused you are in certain areas of your business , you may find that you 're using the wrong tool for your situation . <p> I am making the assumption that you have already implemented your tool and are just starting your testing program .

In Monetate , you will need to request that the " action " be developed on that particular section of the homepage . Once Monetate has finished the action development , the test setup requires no additional coding . After uploading your creative , the rest is pretty much just checkboxes and final approval . <p> Test&amp;Target distinguishes itself with the ability to run a test that splits traffic evenly between the challenger pages and the default . In order to reach significance in the Monetate setup , each challenger page must have its own designated set of default traffic to use for comparison . <p> In our example , each challenger page receives 25% of total traffic , and each would be compared with a 25% portion of the traffic to the default . So , essentially , the default is getting 50% of total traffic .

If you are looking for in depth reporting with custom success metrics , Test&amp;Target is most likely the tool for you . Monetates reporting interface is difficult to read and only allows five custom metrics per campaign ; however , if you do n't  have a dedicated developer with - JavaScript experience , and you do n't  have additional custom metrics you want added to each campaign , Monetate is probably the better solution for you . Overall , Test&amp;Target is more robust and easier to work with if you have a technical background and an interest in analytics . <p> ( Monetate Reporting Interface notice the scrolling you need to do if you have custom metrics ) <p> ( Test&amp;Target Reporting Interface Easy snapshots that can be graphed within the interface ) <p> If targeting or segmentation is important to you , you may want to keep in mind that Monetate does not allow you to target at the offer/experience level . Let 's say you have two promotional offers : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Monetate , you would need to set up two separate campaigns for California and Pennsylvania because you can only target at the campaign level . Using Test&amp;Target , however , you have the ability to target both regions in the same campaign at the offer level . Also , Monetate only allows for up 5,000 different zip codes per campaign , which is something to keep in mind if you have large zip code lists . <p> Overall , Monetate still has some work to do to provide a better user experience , while Test&amp;Target has a lot of great features but requires a higher degree of technical competency in order run a robust testing program . While neither tool is necessarily " better " than the other , each has its pros and cons . Weighing these against the needs of your business will help you choose the better tool for testing and optimizing your companys online experience . 188226 @qwx808226

Subscribers who receive text-only emails stripped of HTML and images are not counted as opens . Mobile users reading your email on their phones usually receive text-only emails , so their opens are not always tracked . <p> Also , many email platforms allow users to quickly scroll through or preview emails using their keyboard . When these emails are marked as " read , " they are counted as opens even if a subscriber skimmed past it . <p> Still , measuring how your open rate fluctuates over time can be a good indicator of how well you are optimizing your emails. 188224 @qwx808224 <p> A low open rate indicates you are n't  getting your recipients attention .

With this insight , you can optimize your subject lines for better open rates . <h> Bounce Rate 188225 @qwx808225 <p> This is the portion of subscribers who did not receive your email . There are two types of bounces : a soft bounce and a hard bounce . A soft bounce happens when a recipients inbox is full or their email server is down . These messages are often delayed temporarily and will eventually be delivered . A hard bounce is the result of a nonexistent email address , and these emails do not reach the intended recipient . 188224 @qwx808224 <p> Your customers are valuable , and you do n't  want to miss out on an opportunity to reach them ( especially if they 're engaged enough to register for your emails ! ) . <p> Take a look at the email addresses that are bouncing .

You can also lower your email campaigns bounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . <p> Many bounces are sent to changed or deactivated email addresses . If your CRM stores additional contact information for your customers , you can try following up with them via phone or snail mail to update their email address , reclaiming valuable prospects and customers . <p> You should also make it easy for subscribers to notify you about a change of email address by providing a link at the bottom of each email . Its also a good idea to check for replies to your emails , as some subscribers may respond to your emails to update their email address . <h> Click-Through Rate 188225 @qwx808225 <p> This is the number or percentage of subscribers who clicked one or more links in your email . 188224 @qwx808224 <p> Once you 've gotten a recipient to open your email , the next step is leading them to your site using relevant , targeted messaging . <p> A low click-through rate suggests that the content of your email needs fine tuningwhether its by making your links stand out more , reducing blocks of text , changing the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unsubscribe Rate 188225 @qwx808225 <p> The number of subscribers who terminate their subscription to your emails. 188224 @qwx808224 <p> A recipient could unsubscribe from your emails for any number of reasons . Maybe they feel annoyed by too many emails or uninterested in what you 're saying . You can attempt to find out why youre losing a subscriber by asking them to take a survey . <p> You do n't  have to lose touch with unsubscribes . Consider adding a preference to receive emails less frequently , or offer alternative options for staying up-to-date with your organization , like SMS or snail mail . <p> While these tips will help you find actionable insights about your email campaigns , they only scratch the surface . More importantly , you need to understand how your audience interacts with your organizations digital media across all of your marketing channels . <p> Merging data from your email campaign with data from other channels opens up a multitude of insights about your audience .

@@83647845 @5147845/ <h> Tuesday , 7th June 2016 <p> Companies spend a lot of money on marketing all of the time without knowing how effective it is . This is because marketings goal is to drive incremental sales lift , and that " incremental " term is very challenging to measure . Incremental sales driven by marketing can be considered ( Actual Sales Sales that would have happened without marketing ) . How can companies know if a sale would not have happened without marketing ? <p> In the analysts dream scenario , there would be two identical worlds where the only difference between them was that one of the worlds had marketing ( world 1 ) and the other did not ( world 2 ) . If this were possible , companies could simply do ( Sales in world 1 Sales in world 2 ) and know the true incremental value to their marketing . Unfortunately , these two worlds do not exist and this is not possible. - Instead , what analysts do is try their best to build world 2 through qualitative surveys , statistical techniques , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects , but also fails in some way to build the exact world without marketing . <h> Qualitative Surveys <p> One way to try and construct the world without marketing is to simply ask the people who purchased if they would have purchased without your marketing . If they say no , you can consider their sales to be incremental due to your marketing . This type of measurement is simple to execute and easy to understand . Unfortunately , there are a few concerns with using survey data : <p> Non-Response Bias The people who are willing to respond to the survey will share common attributes ( like possibly a love of your brand/marketing ) . If the analyst assumes that the survey respondents are speaking the opinions of everyone , then that could lead to inaccuracy as it is probably not true . Also , it is possible that the message advertised actively caused people to not purchase , and those folks will never be surveyed . <p> Inconsistency in Human Response Survey responses can change based on peoples mood , interpretation of the question and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ http : //bit.ly/1jzGRT5 , " Surveys that are administered in person or by phone tend to result in higher scores than identical surveys distributed by email , snail mail or on the Internet. " - The survey can be a great source of data , but it is important to keep these pitfalls in mind when building a measurement strategy to ensure you are getting as close to creating that " No-Marketing " world as possible . <h> Statistical Techniques <p> Another popular technique to create the " No-Marketing " world is to build a model representation of the world , remove advertisements from the model , and then project sales . This technique has high potential because , if you do build a good model , you can use it to not only see your effectiveness , but you can project how you would perform at other levels of marketing spend . Unfortunately , it is very challenging to understand if your model is an accurate representation because of a few factors : <p> Unrepresented Data Marketing is one of many factors impacting sales that should go into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to represent with data . If those factors exist and are not included in the model , it is probable that the model will over-assign impact to the factors that were included in the model . For instance , if there was a news story promoting your product ( not-marketing ) that occurred during the same time as a marketing campaign , but was not recorded in the data , the model would attribute credit to the marketing campaign . <p> Highly Correlated Data Models have difficulty discerning impact when multiple events are occurring at the same time , and it can lead to wild variation in the models credit to each of the correlated data points . For instance , if the company is a seasonable business and does marketing at the same time as their busy season begins , the model can randomly assign too much or too little weight to the marketing campaign versus the season because they occur at the same time . <p> Inability to Express Causation Let 's say an analyst is attempting to understand the amount of people who will be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in the model , it is probable that the model will say something along the lines of , " For every Ice Cream Truck appearance in the day , we would expect 1,000 people to be on the beach . " Without thinking critically , the analyst may assume that in order to get more people to the beach , we simply need to increase the number of ice cream trucks . Unfortunately , this is incorrect . The ice cream trucks and the number of people on the beach have a common cause , " nice days , " and it is important to understand these types of relations before coming to any causal conclusions based on the model . <h> Experimental Design <p> The third technique to build the " No-Marketing " world is to purposely not market to a select group . This has the potential to provide great insight into performance if the design of the experiment creates similar populations to which you market and do not market . Here are a few of the common problems with using experiments : <p> Difficult to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believe will have a positive ROI , it is challenging to convince them that the money " lost " by not spreading their message to as many people as possible is worth it to better understand if the marketing efforts are working . <p> Difficult to control who sees and does not see an ad Sometimes , it can be difficult to ensure that your " Non-Marketing " population does not actually receive your marketing messages . For instance , let 's say your company wants to test the success of a 40% off email promotion , and selects half of the email list to target with this promotion . It is possible that somebody who receives this promotion will post the code on a deals forum or on their social networks , and then people in the no marketing group will see the deal and purchase , and the experiment will underestimate the impact of the promotion . <p> Difficult to build a replica of the people who did see the marketing It is important that the group who did see the marketing is as close to identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not identical , it is possible that their innate differences are the " cause " of differences in behavior , and it is not actually the marketing causing the change . This can lead to findings that are incorrect , which leads to poor decision making . <p> Understanding causality is something that humans have struggled with since Aristotle first discussed his " Four fundamental types of answers to Why . " With the explosion in data collection and storage capacity , we did not magically find an answer . It is a challenging task that takes hard work and time , especially in complex systems that involve human decision making . The use of surveys , analytics , and experimentation can certainly help improve this understanding , but it is important to think critically about how the " Non-marketing " representation of the world is failing and how that impacts the results of the analysis . Without thinking about these factors , your business would probably be better off just making decisions based on instincts than basing decisions on faulty measurement . 188226 @qwx808226

I came to find out that neither of those questions were really the issue , the issue was how I was calculating the bounce rate . Continue reading &gt; 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647853 @5147853/ <h> Friday , 21st December 2012 <p> It might seem like measuring traffic from every visitor collectively will create a holistic view of audience behavior , but that " s not actually the case . Without segmenting your traffic into groups of visitors with similar traits , it " s impossible to find those Transformative InsightsG that change the way you do business . <p> If you haven " t segmented your traffic at all , you " re probably feeling pretty overwhelmed by what you see in your analytics platform . Don " t panicit " s easy to get lost in your data . Breaking down your traffic into chunks of visitors with similar characteristics can not only make your analyses easier , but also open your eyes to insights you wouldn " t see in a pool of data of all your visitors combined . <p> Think of it this way : Imagine you " re a store manager , and it " s your goal to convince shoppers to make a purchase . After enough experience interacting with the various people who come into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique for closing the sale with every shopper . So you start asking targeted questions to uncover each customer " s needs , then suggesting products to meet those needs . <p> Some customers are looking for something your store doesn " t carry , or for whatever reason they simply can " t be convinced to buy anything at all , no matter how hard you try . You do what you can to help those customers ( maybe suggest a different store ) , but focus on engaging those who are more likely to buy . Over time , your sales increase as you become more familiar with the different types of shoppers and the sales experiences that work most effectively in various situations . <p> Now take that whole scenario and put it online . The store is your website and your content is the manager who identifies visitors and presents each with a personalized , targeted experience that is optimized for conversion . It " s the ideal retail experience for both the shopper and retailer , and it can continually be optimized as the retailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in both the online and offline scenarios is identifying customers and creating a shopping experience that caters to their needs . <p> Segmenting traffic , targeting visitors , and optimizing content for increased conversion isn " t a simple science , so let " s take a look at the logic behind the process : <h> Separating Qualified from Unqualified Traffic <p> Let " s be realisticEvery single visitor on your website isn " t going to convert . You don " t even have a shot with some visitors . Maybe they " re not in your target audience . Maybe they accidentally clicked an ad to your website . Maybe they have their hearts set on buying muffin tops , but your store only sells whole muffins . Whatever the case may be , a portion of your traffic is unqualified for analysis and should be filtered from your data . <p> To figure out who these visitors are , you " ll need to take a look at the customers who don " t convert and find the qualities they typically share . You might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else on the site ( bounces ) , spend less than one minute on your site , come from an unqualified traffic source , etc . <p> By filtering the unqualified traffic from your data , you get a more accurate picture of engagement with your target audience . This will help you focus on the traffic that actually holds potential , and your numbers will start to look much more promising . <p> TIP : Make sure visits from your internal staff aren " t being lumped into your traffic . In any analytics platform , you can filter visits from specific IP addresses . <h> Segmenting Qualified Visitors <p> Once you 've separated the wheat from the chaff , you can divide your qualified traffic into groups of visitors with similar characteristics to observe how each interacts uniquely with your website . If you have an online clothing store , for example , it " s safe to assume that visitors in New York aren " t shopping for swimsuits in January . In that case , your business might benefit from segmenting visitors by geographic location . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how apt they are to convert . <p> Each qualified visitor to your site falls somewhere on a spectrum of conversion likelihood . Some visitors have decided before even visiting your site that they " re going to make a purchase ( if that " s how you define conversion ) . Others might be on the fence . And then there are those visitors we discussed who will simply never convert . <p> Measuring visitor engagement can reflect conversion likelihood , and grouping visitors together by levels of engagement sets the stage for deeper , more focused analyses . <p> Before you can measure engagement , you " ll need a list of Key Website Actions ( KWAs ) . These are visitor characteristics and behaviors most closely associated with conversion . It could be watching a product overview video , spending more than X minutes on your site , returning to your site more than X times , viewing current promotions , etc . If you " re not sure what the KPIs are for your site , you " ll need to do an analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once your KWAs are defined , you " ll need to track each one with custom implementation . From there , you can segment visitors based on how many engagement criteria they meet . <h> Test , Target and Optimize to Increase Conversion <p> With this implementation in place , you can measure how each group of visitors , ranked by engagement , fluctuates over time and set goals for increasing conversion in each group . However , moving the needle requires some work , and you won " t reach your goals without making changes to your content . <p> Try making small changes ( or , if you " re gutsy , try a large change ) , then measure how conversion fluctuates within each bucket of visitors . If your conversion rate increased , you made a change for the better . If it decreased , you should probably try something different or revert to the way things were . <p> You can take your analytics a step further and target visitors within each group with specific content .

@@83647855 @5147855/ <h> Monday , 20th August 2012 <p> In the world of digital analytics , a conversion is generally defined as the successful completion of a specific goal online . <p> It is easiest to tie goals to an e-commerce transaction , but in reality only about 28% of websites offer the ability to buy. - So how can and do the remaining 72% of websites measure success without the ability to count revenue as a metric ? <p> If your site falls into the 72% and you cant easily show how visitors to your site translate into sales , fear not as there are many other ways to measure success . <p> With any web analytics tool , lead generation sites , content publishers and brand ( or information only ) sites can instead track successful conversions through other metrics like clicks , downloads and registrations . <p> Historically , companies have focused on measuring and optimizing conversion rates by looking at only the end goal conversions , like the examples above. - These can be considered macro conversions. - Macro conversions are usually the final action a visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads . <p> However , by identifying additional micro conversions , which are any key website actions that visitors complete prior to the final conversion , companies can use metrics other than just revenue or number of leads to better measure success and increase ROI . <p> Comcast Business Class does not sell directly online because it is a lead-generation website . Their ultimate goal is generating leads , so a visitor filling out the form to be contacted by a sales representative is considered a macro conversion .

This information can be very important for an organization , but only if it answers the question " Why ? " . - Let 's say I run a report on display ads for a client , and I notice a few campaigns perform significantly better than the others , so I advise the client to end the display ads that performed poorly . Even though there is supporting data , my suggestion is based on a hunch because I have n't pinpointed the reason why certain campaigns are more effective than others . <p> Phase Two : Data Mining <p> Data mining helps uncover more information about why the effective ads performed well . Continuing with the same example , let 's say I take a closer look at the ads and use every type of data point possible in a data visualization tool like Tableau . With this program , I am able to drill down into the data , which shows that square ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . This extra knowledge adds more validity to the suggested marketing decision because it pinpoints the campaigns shape/size and message as reasons for success . <p> Phase Three : Statistical Analysis <p> Running data through statistical analysis software like SPSS or SAS not only ensures that your data is statistically significant , but can narrow down more specific insights . In the example of the the display ad campaigns , I used software to discover that the ad messaging is statically significant to success , while the size of the ad is not .

Limitations of Online Surveys <p> While there are many advantages to using online surveys , companies must be aware of questionnaires inherent pitfalls. - The main caveat of web-based surveys ( except for panel surveys ) is that the sample of visitors is rarely representative of the population because respondents are voluntary and not randomly sampled. - In general , those who opt-in to surveys are more engaged with the website content and more inclined to take surveys. - Therefore , any hypotheses formulated about the population based on the sample would not necessarily be accurate. - The survey data may still be usable , but keep this drawback in mind when interpreting the results . <p> Another downfall of surveys is their tendency to contain biases . Nonresponse bias can occur in surveys with low response rates ( According to market research by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feedback are around 10-15% ) . <p> Nonresponse bias refers , not only to the inability or unwillingness of chosen individuals to participate in the survey , but also to respondents who fail to answer one or more questions. - Both factors contribute to the inaccuracy of the sample in statistically representing the population. - To reduce this bias , increase the sample size to at least 10% of the population , and consider offering an incentive for participating. - Also , make the survey as simple and straightforward as possible by reducing the number of questions and time it takes to complete ( The same SurveyGizmo study shows that surveys that take longer than 11 minutes to complete have significantly higher abandonment rates than that take 10 minutes or less ) . <p> Survey questions wording and composition can also be biased . Oftentimes , questions can be phrased in such a way that they inadvertently ( or purposefully ) lead a respondent to a certain answer. - Similarly , questions that contain vague words can confuse respondents , leading them to select answers that do not reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To avoid this , make sure the questions are clearly stated and use neutral , specific language . <p> For the advanced surveyor who has already mastered the basics , there are several ways to enhance simple surveys to gather more meaningful information. - Overlaying survey data with behavioral data from a web analytics platform like Google Analytics or Site Catalyst can help a company understand , not only what people say , but also what they do. - For example , someone who reports a low C-Sat score may not have reported a difficult experience using the shopping cart . Matching the respondents survey answers to web analytics data can reveal this hidden information . <p> A conditional structure is another option for enhancing basic surveys. - For instance , respondents who say they purchased a product can be directed to additional questions about that product , while those who did not purchase may see different questions about consideration of the brand. - Conditional questions can also arise when certain website actions are completed. - If a visitor watches an embedded video , it is possible to immediately serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of branched model will allow for deeper diving into areas of interest . <p> Whether you 'd like to offer a survey to your customers , draw actionable analyses from your survey responses , or integrate web analytics with survey data , MaassMedia can help you use online surveys to allow your organization to reach transformative insights .

Leave a comment to share your thoughts . <h> Monday , 2nd July 2012 <p> Just about anything on a website can be tracked with web analytics . While its good to thoroughly tag your website , it is also easy to drown in a massive sea of data . That 's why its important to distinguish meaningful metrics from vanity metrics . <p> Vanity metrics is a phrase made popular by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup . These are metrics that might make your business look good ( especially when they go up ) , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow . <p> Save time on your web analytics reporting by taking these 5 misleading metrics with a grain of salt : <p> 1 . Visits <p> Executives love a good spike in traffic . To the untrained eye , more visits means the company is doing something right . While that may be the case , number of visits alone does n't  provide any indication of what the company is doing right . Often , a business will attribute a traffic spike to a recent project , like new ad campaign or change to the website . The problem is that the design team could be high fiving each other for the success of their new feature , while the marketing team celebrates their effective social media strategy . And when traffic plummets , no member of the team wants to take responsibility . <p> Causation and correlation are not one and the same . It is crucial to determine how and why visitors come to your websiteor do n't  come to your websiterather than make assumptions . Once you can pinpoint the actual cause , you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  . <p> 2 . New vs . Returning Visits <p> In theory , it makes sense to monitor the ratio of new to repeat visits . Visitors who return to your site later are hopefully doing so because they had a positive experience with your site . Unfortunately , it is possible for repeat visitors to be counted as new visitors ( or " unique " visitors ) and vice versa . That is because information about which sites a person has visited is stored in a browser cookie . Clearing cookies from a browser deletes any record of a prior visit , so a returning visitor who has cleared his or her cache will be counted as unique . Additionally , if a visitor switches browsers , IP addresses , or devices when returning to your website , he or she will be counted as a unique visitor instead of a returning visitor . <p> On the other hand , if a new visitor uses a shared computer to view your website , and if that website has been previously viewed on that device , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Traffic sources <p> At a glance , a breakdown of traffic sources can provide a general idea of how visitors find your website . Maybe they use search engines , click links from other sites to yours , or type the URL into their browser . Instead of providing answers , this information only raises more questions : What keywords do visitors use to find your website on search engines ? Which traffic sources refer visitors who typically convert ? Why do some visitors come directly to your site ? <p> To find more meaningful insights , take the time to tag your marketing channels ( display , paid search , e-mail , etc. ) and focus on referrals from each source . If your business uses print ads , use a vanity URL unique to the ad to see which campaigns brought the most visitors . <p> 4 . Pageviews <p> This metric is directly influenced by your content and navigation , but does n't  tell you if your website is any good . A visitor searching for something specific might visit several pages if the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented with engaging content that keeps him or her clicking around your site . Both of these visits would increase your number of pageviews , but only the latter visitor has a positive experience . Therefore , deeper analysis would be necessary before determining the quality of your sites content and navigation . <p> 5 . Time on Site/Time on Page <p> Like pageviews , time on site can go up or down without indicating why . A person who finds interesting content on your site could spend just as much time as a frustrated visitor who ca n't find the content he or she is looking for . <p> Another reason to take these metrics with a grain of salt is their accuracy Time on site and time on page are inherently skewed . For exit pages , time on page is recorded as 0 seconds because there is no server request when a visitor leaves your site . So , if someone spends 2 minutes on your homepage , clicks an article that they spend 15 minutes reading , then clicks offsite or closes their browser window , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647859 @5147859/ <h> Friday , 1st February 2013 <p> There sure are some weird holidays in the United States ( and Canada ) . One such holiday , Groundhog Day , occurs every February 2nd . On this day we let a groundhog pop out of a hole in the ground in order to predict how much longer winter will last . If he " sees his shadow " then there will be 6 more weeks of winter , and if he does not then spring will come early . Sounds crazy , but this holiday has been celebrated since the 1800s . <p> There are many groundhogs in different locations that make predictions , but in Philadelphia we look to Punxsutawney Phil for our forecast . Up to 40,000 people gather to watch Phil each year making Philadelphia home of the largest Groundhog Day celebration . People trust in his predictions even though he only has 39% accuracy , according to StormFax Weather Almanac . Below is a picture of the cute little ( not so little ) guy helping answer interview questions for Channel 6 News . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Groundhog Day based on past data ? I set out to investigate this by compiling a database of variables that might affect whether or not Phil sees his shadow . <p> The obvious variables to include were weather factors such as average temperature , humidity , wind speed , dew point , amount of precipitation , sea level pressure , visibility , and heating degree day ( the amount of energy needed to heat a building , related to outside temperature ) . I guessed that these variables will have the most significance . <p> Other interesting variables I included in the model were day of the week , percent moon visible , whether or not it was a leap year , and the party of the incumbent president . I did not really expect any of these wildcard variables to have a significant contribution , but it was still fun to investigate . <p> Just for kicks , I threw in a variable I named " number of Bill Murray movies " for each year , to appease those who have seen Groundhog Day and enjoy the undeniable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Method In order to build a model to predict the outcome of Groundhog Day 2013 , first I had to compile my database . I used 40 years of data ( 1973-2012 ) and included 13 different explanatory variables . The response variable was whether or not the groundhog saw his shadow . <p> With this database in place , I was able to start building a model . Since my response variable is binary in nature ( two possibilities : yes or no ) , I have to treat it differently from a regular linear model response variable . This means I will have to round my final output up or down to the nearest integer . <p> First I created 13 different models each with one of the explanatory variables to find the best one-variable model . I put the most significant variable in the model and then added each of the 12 remaining variables to find the best two-variable model . I repeated this process to find the best three-variable model , however additional variables were not significant therefore the two-variable model was the best . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of Groundhog Day were dew point ( in degrees F ) and amount of precipitation ( in inches ) that occurred on that day . Unfortunately , the number of movies that Bill Murray acted in that year was not a significant contribution to the model . Sorry , Bill ! <p> Both variables had negative coefficients , indicating that as they increase , the likelihood of the groundhog seeing his shadow decreases . In other words the more precipitation in inches and the higher the dew point , the less likely it is that Phil will see his shadow and the more likely that spring will come early . <p> In order to predict the outcome of this years Groundhog Day , I will use historical temperature data from the past two weeks for the dew point prediction and forecasts from multiple weather sources for the precipitation prediction . <p> To predict the dew point for Saturday , I used temperature and dew point data from the past 2 weeks . Even though temperature is not included in the final model , it trends similarly to dew point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrows dew point . In the graph below , the temperature for tomorrow is predicted to be about 32F , an increase from todays temperature . Therefore I believe the dew point will increase similarly , so my best guess is that the dew point will be 19F . <p> According to Accuweather.com , Yahoo ! Weather , the Weather Channel , and NBC Philadelphia Weather , there is a low chance of precipitation for Saturday , February 2 ( around 0-10% ) . All sources predict that the precipitation will most likely occur in the evening , so for my purposes I am going to use a precipitation amount of 0.0 inches . <p> I plugged these two numbers into my final model . If the result is greater than 0.5 , then the groundhog will see his shadow . If the result is less than 0.5 , the groundhog will not see his shadow . The final calculation is:Shadow = 1.158317 0.014294*19 0.728101*0.0 Shadow = 1.158317 0.271586=0.886 <p> Since the model output a value of 0.886 which is greater than 0.5 and relatively close to 1 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means 6 more weeks of winter weather !

@@83647862 @5147862/ <h> Monday , 4th June 2012 <p> In February , the Obama administration proposed an to allow consumers more efficient control over the data being collected about them online . Last weekend , the UK began requiring all websites to block the transmission of browser cookies unless a visitor opts in . Now , Microsoft is the latest to jump on the data blocking bandwagon . <h> Friday , 25th May 2012 <p> What would happen to your business if the vast majority of visitors to your website blocked cookies ? How would it affect the economy ? Would consumers privacy be any less at risk by avoiding specific cookies ? Here in the US , these questions are all hypothetical . The UK , on the other hand , is about to find out what happens when visitors must opt-in before a website can place certain cookies in their browsers . <h> Tuesday , 22nd May 2012 <p> As testing and optimization become even more influential to a websites success , it is important to choose the platform that is right for your business model . I specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Each platform has its own positives and negatives . Depending on how robust your testing program is or how focused you are in certain areas of your business , you may find that you 're using the wrong tool for your situation . <p> I am making the assumption that you have already implemented your tool and are just starting your testing program . For the purpose of comparing apples to apples , we will use the example that you are testing a new home page hero image . You have two challenger heroes that you are testing against the default . All the art is finalized and you are about to start the test setup phase . <p> In Test&amp;Target , you do not need to upload the creative into the tool , and if you have the technical background you can code the challenger pages yourself using custom JavaScript . In Monetate , you will need to request that the " action " be developed on that particular section of the homepage . Once Monetate has finished the action development , the test setup requires no additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much just checkboxes and final approval . <p> Test&amp;Target distinguishes itself with the ability to run a test that splits traffic evenly between the challenger pages and the default . In order to reach significance in the Monetate setup , each challenger page must have its own designated set of default traffic to use for comparison . <p> In our example , each challenger page receives 25% of total traffic , and each would be compared with a 25% portion of the traffic to the default . So , essentially , the default is getting 50% of total traffic . In Test&amp;Target , you are able to have an even traffic split between all three experiences , which allows you to more quickly gain significance . <p> As for reporting , Test&amp;Target has a clean reporting interface with the ability to set up multiple custom success metrics . If you are looking for in depth reporting with custom success metrics , Test&amp;Target is most likely the tool for you . Monetates reporting interface is difficult to read and only allows five custom metrics per campaign ; however , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and you do n't  have additional custom metrics you want added to each campaign , Monetate is probably the better solution for you . Overall , Test&amp;Target is more robust and easier to work with if you have a technical background and an interest in analytics . <p> ( Monetate Reporting Interface notice the scrolling you need to do if you have custom metrics ) <p> ( Test&amp;Target Reporting Interface Easy snapshots that can be graphed within the interface ) <p> If targeting or segmentation is important to you , you may want to keep in mind that Monetate does not allow you to target at the offer/experience level . Let 's say you have two promotional offers : one for people in California and another for people in Pennsylvania . With Monetate , you would need to set up two separate campaigns for California and Pennsylvania because you can only target at the campaign level . Using Test&amp;Target , however , you have the ability to target both regions in the same campaign at the offer level . Also , Monetate only allows for up 5,000 different zip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind if you have large zip code lists . <p> Overall , Monetate still has some work to do to provide a better user experience , while Test&amp;Target has a lot of great features but requires a higher degree of technical competency in order run a robust testing program . While neither tool is necessarily " better " than the other , each has its pros and cons . Weighing these against the needs of your business will help you choose the better tool for testing and optimizing your companys online experience . <p> Getting certified as an individual is advantageous for anyone in digital analytics and related fields . Besides the fancy certificate and warm fuzzy feeling of accomplishment , you 'll find the test most rewarding because it provides the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of Google Analytics while gaining an edge in the industry . <p> " It helps build a core understanding of analytics , " says William McGowan , Senior Measurement &amp; Reporting Analyst at MaassMedia , " Understanding where things are located in Google Analytics , as well as understanding what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help our clients faster and more efficiently . " <p> MaassMedia Data Analyst , Abbe Lefkowitz , believes having a Google Analytics certification makes us more qualified in the eyes of our clients . " Why would they consult us if we are n't  the best at what were doing ? " she asks , adding , " Having the GA certification gives clients a sense of security and also confidence in the analytics we provide . " <p> If you 're on the fence about getting certified , here 's what to expect from the test . <p> About the Test <p> The test costs $50.00 , and you 're allotted 90 minutes to answer all 70 multiple choice questions . That gives you a little over a minute to spend on each question , and some questions require you to choose more than one answer ( i.e. " Check all answers that apply . " ) - <p> In order to pass the test , you 'll need to score an 80% or higher . In other words , you 'll need to correctly answer at least 56 of the 70 questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test at any time over the course of five days . Be advised that the question disappears when you pause the test , and taking screenshots or copy-and-pasting parts of the test are not allowed . <p> How to Prepare <p> Like any important test , the Google Analytics Individual Qualification Test requires some studying . If you do n't  already have a Google Analytics account , sign up and install the tracking code on your website . While you 're at it , you might want to register with Google AdWords . Exploring both of these tools will help you learn about their functionality and how the two integrate with each other. - <p> Your main resource for getting brought up to speed will be the- Google Analytics IQ Lessons ( formerly called Conversion University ) . The lessons are composed of a series of videos , totaling about 2 hours . Most of the videos have transcripts in the " notes " tab , which are really helpful to reference during the test . <p> Everything on the test can be learned from these videos , so make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a good idea to watch the videos a second time and practice what you learn in Google Analytics . <p> TIP : Instead of copy and pasting the notes from each videowhich can be tedious , considering some videos are extremely shortyou can find the full Google Analytics IQ Lessons transcripts here:Part 1 and- Part 2 . <p> The test questions are different for everyone , but the recurring themes I saw were : <p> Cookies <p> AdWords integration <p> Campaign values <p> Tracking domains and subdomains <p> In addition to the Google Analytics IQ Lessons , you might find these resources helpful when prepping for your test : <p> Once you 're ready to take the Google Analytics Individual Qualification test , it " s helpful to have a strategy . To use my 90 minutes efficiently , I- skipped questions I did n't  know , - marked questions I was unsure about , and- crossed out the answer options I knew werent correct . Once I finished going through each question , I was able to go back to those I had marked and left unanswered. - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You passed , and now you 're a Google Analytics Certified Individual for 18 months . Print out your certificate and show it off proudly . <p> If you did n't  pass , you can re-take the test as many times as you want . Be aware that the test costs $50.00 each time you take it . Also , you can only take the test twice within a 30-day period , and you have to wait 14 days between tests . <p> Re-taking the test does n't  mean you 'll be asked all the same questions , so make sure to study all the topics in the Google Analytics IQ Lessons . <p> Take your knowledge a step further with MaassMedias Google Analytics training .

Post your thoughts in the comments . <h> Monday , 7th May 2012 <p> Custom variables in Google Analytics can be useful on many levels. - For example , if you are analyzing data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what zip code visitors are coming from in order to calculate the different shipping costs , you can define a custom variable to capture this . <p> A great feature of Google Analytics is that it allows users to define up to five custom variables outside of the standard metrics offered. - These variables can be on the visitor , page , or session level and must be implemented specifically via customized page tags ( Google Analytics Custom Variables ) . <p> If you already use custom variables in Google Analytics , you are probably familiar with creating your own custom reports to access these variables. - You may have also discovered two major limitations of Google Analytics custom reports : <p> 1 . You can only view a maximum of two custom variables at once <p> 2 . You are limited to displaying a maximum of 500 rows of data in one view <p> Custom variables are considered dimensions by Google Analytics and you can only view a maximum of two dimensions at once in a flat table . <p> In an explorer table , you can select up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the level of granularity is higher than that of a flat table . <p> However , it still does not deliver the optimal data view because , of the five dimensions , you still can only view two side-by-side using the " secondary dimension " display option . <p> Additionally , Google Analytics only allows you to view 500 rows at a time. - This becomes frustrating when dealing with data composed of thousands of rows because if you want to work with the entire file in Excel , you have to page through the data and export each page separately , then combine the multiple files manually . <p> There are several tools to overcome these limitations. - Excellent Analytics is a plug-in for Microsoft Excel that outputs GA data into the current Excel spreadsheet. - It is able to leverage the Google Analytics API ( application programming interface ) to extract raw data directly out of Google Analytics and bypass the native reporting interface that is available online . To get started , log into your Google Analytics account through the plug-in , select the appropriate profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Google Analytics interface , you can change the date range and select what metrics and dimensions you would like to appear in the report . <p> However , unlike in the Google Analytics API , you can select up to 10 metrics and 7 dimensions to be displayed in one report. - Additionally , there are no limitations to the number of rows that can be displayed at one time like in Google Analytics. - Excellent Analytics also allows you to apply filters to the data and display reports for multiple profiles at once . <p> Another tool , called Analytics Canvas , does everything Excellent Analytics does but in a standalone user interface. - In other words , it does not need Excel to work . <p> A great feature of Analytics Canvas when creating new queries is the " Refresh " option , which allows you to preview the data your query will produce before you actually submit it . <p> This makes it easier to revise a query with an incorrect metric or dimension , and will save time when dealing with queries containing several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the longer it will take to create the query . <p> Analytics Canvas also allows you to create a number of data " blocks " and connect them to each other : <p> There are several different options for manipulating the data blocks , including merging by common dimension , making pivot tables , sorting and filtering , creating calculated fields , and segmenting . <p> Like Excellent Analytics , Analytics Canvas currently only allows access to custom variables one through five. - However , in the near future , users subscribing to Google Analytics Premium will be able to access up to 50 custom variables . 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647868 @5147868/ <h> Monday , 24th September 2012 <p> Last week , Will looked at the similarities between web analytics and fantasy football . As it turns out , the secret sauce to success is similar for both . This week , I 'm comparing web analytics to dating to help you achieve the ultimate double whammy status : - Winning web analyst with a winning partner . <p> Here are a few tips to get you there : <p> 1 . Experiment <p> Trying new things is a great way to learn what works and what does n't  . A/B and multivariate testing are methods of pinpointing effective digital content in web analytics , and you can apply similar techniques to dating . <p> I once went to a movie on a first date . The movie was great , but afterward I realized I did n't  learn much about my date except that he uses a lot of napkins when eating popcorn ( Not that there 's anything wrong with that ) . For the second date , I suggested grabbing a bite to eat . By the end of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person I was dating because we were in a more social setting . <p> If the movie date was Test A and dinner was Test B , Test B most definitely performed better . From that point on , I have always avoided movies as first dates and suggested an activity that promotes conversation . <p> 2 . Cast a wide net , then narrow your focus . <p> Routines can make it difficult to meet new people . Maybe you take the same train to work every morning , but how likely is your soul mate to sit down next to you ? In fact , you probably see a lot of the same people on that train every day . And that bar you and your single friends frequent ? Its not suddenly going to become a hotspot for date-ables if it is n't one already . <p> If you 're experiencing a lull in your dating life , it might be time to look to other sources , even if it means going on a blind date with a friend of a friend . I 'm a big fan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site has ( relatively ) the same end goal of finding a partner , and looking at users profiles gives you the opportunity to decide if someone is worth meeting . <p> Finding valuable insights in web analytics also requires using multiple sources , then reducing the data to salient points . Creating a holistic view of your audiences interaction with your organization means integrating data into your analytics platform from email marketing , paid and organic search , CRM , and whatever else you have collecting data , then trying lots of different correlations and combinations . From there , you can better understandand optimizethe path to conversion . <p> 3 . Be proactive <p> Success is n't something that happens to you , but rather , something you make happen . At MaassMedia , we exceed clients expectations by taking a proactive approach . In addition to regularly scheduled and ad-hoc reports , we monitor data for new insights that would have otherwise gone undetected . <p> For example , we noticed visitors to one of our e-commerce clients sites were using the internal search feature to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed this information onto the client , and they decided to carry the product . Had we not notified the client of this insight , they may have never realized the demand for that product . <p> It pays to be a proactive dater , too . Whether you 're male or female , you have a better chance of scoring a date if you approach someone and start a conversation rather than wait to be approached . Someone has to initiate a conversation , and you can ensure it happens if you are proactive . <p> 4 . Know what to look for , then go find it . <p> For singles , its not uncommon to be told that there are lots of fish in the sea . The problem is , not every fish meets your standards . <p> Its important to know what to look for in a potential mate , and everyone has different standards . If sharing common interests is something you consider important in a relationship , enroll in a class or project that interests you and you might connect with another participant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few local shows and talk to the band afterwards ( local musicians are usually more than happy to talk to fans ) . <p> On the other hand , you should also know what you- do n't  like . Maybe high- maintenance- people irk you to no end . In that case , you probably should n't start flirting with the girl at the mall wearing a designer handbag. - Something else to look out for and steer clear of for obvious reasons : Wedding rings . <p> Finding insights is a lot like finding a potential mate . Useful insights are often buried in data , so you should n't expect to find anything useful unless you know where to look and what to look for. - Begin with a goal , or at least a business question , then go hunting for the answer . <p> At MaassMedia , web analytics is a way of life ( which explains why we relate it to everything from fantasy football to dating ) . We recognize that not everyone is as obsessed as we are with finding insights in data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't helping you increase ROI and deliver better audience interactions , give us a call . You may find we make a good match . 188226 @qwx808226 
@@83647869 @5147869/ <h> Wednesday , 26th June 2013 <p> Since the rise of " big data " in the 1970s , digital marketing has seen enormous amounts of data generated every day . These databases of information on markets , customers , and competitors have the potential to uncover valuable insights and new ways to engage with customers and clients on new , personalized levels . With the continuous development of analytics platforms such as Google Analytics and Adobe SiteCatalyst , generating data reports is easier than ever . However , these reports offer little more than numbers , and wise business decisions must be made based on informative analysis . Analysis is well-selected numbers plus words . Performed by experts with years of experience and a wealth of business knowledge , analysis provides context and delivers insights to help businesses make informed investment choices . A great step up from computer-generated graphs and charts , an analysts report outlines particular correlations customized to each business marketing needs and concerns . Here 's an example of a standard business question that may come from an executive and the different ways in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis . The website in question sells personal computing products . <p> Question : Which keywords are generating the most revenue ? <p> 1 . Standard report generated from web analytics software This is a basic report that can be generated from the software application . The context is unclear ; the correlation is simplistic ; and the report fails to provide any insights into future actions . <p> 2 . Customized Report with Additional Metrics Here , additional metrics are added to give a greater picture of website actions and behaviors related to keywords and purchasing . A basic understanding of these metrics may offer some insights into the effectiveness of keyword searches , though inconclusive . <p> 3 . Standardizing Metrics Here , the data are exported and a number of metrics are standardized to draw comparisons between keywords . The following observation can be made : Although average page views for company laptop ' are on the low side , this keyword is driving the highest conversion rate . It also has oneof the higher AOVs , which means customers coming from this keyword are highly focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase . They 're not shopping all over the site and then leaving . They visit a few pages and then make a purchase . However , this conclusion lacks underlying , conclusive insights that may drive further business decisions . An analyst will make decisions to approach this data in different directions to gain better perspectives . A comprehensive report should contain customized graphs and verbalize actionable recommendations . <p> 4 . Analysis First , when beginning this analysis I would remove the keyword company ' before doing any comparisons . This keyword is by far driving the most revenue and will skew any comparisons . Company ' as a keyword tells us only that they are interested in our brand , but not which product and/or service . We may choose to do some further digging , which is possible and probably quite useful , but will be saved for a later time . Second , the data should be clear , concise and presentable . Not every analysis has to be visually stunning , but if you spend the extra time to remove the noise , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be actionable . Here are the steps that I took to build this dashboard : <p> Think about the initial question , but further , think about why the stakeholder is asking it . If possible , ask why they want to know the answer . Do they have certain expectations ? Are there goals , objectives or budget issues involved ? The more information that you gather up front the easier your job will be . <p> Grab a handful of metrics , anywhere from 5-10 that are related to the overall project . You may <p> Try and find trends that stand out to you , good or bad . The good ones can be highlighted and used as a reference point for correcting problem areas . <p> Know your business . You need to know what you 're selling , why you 're selling it or why the website you are examining even exits . Of course , it is possible to do analysis without knowing the business but if you have no context , you may be barking up the wrong tree . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be some opportunity to grow there . Well if I come to find out that in 3 months the company will no longer be selling desktops then I 've just wasted everyone 's time . <p> Finally , make it look nice . Seriously . Food is more appetizing when it is visually appealing ; the same goes for data . If it looks boring the end user will automatically assume that it is either uninteresting or too difficult to understand . 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647874 @5147874/ <p> Like any industry , there are misconceptions in the field of digital analytics . And while resources like Snopes and MythBusters are great for debunking urban legends and pop culture rumors , it " s not always as easy to confirm or deny myths about digital analytics . <p> Here are a few popular digital analytics myths , along with facts to set the record straight : <p> MYTH : Offline data can not be tracked with digital analytics . <p> FACT : MaassMedia " s founder and Managing Director , Aaron Maass , likes to say , " Anything can be tracked with digital analytics . " So far , none of our clients has proven him wrong . Digital analytics can be used to track phone calls ; TV , print and radio ads ; CRM data and more . In fact , you SHOULD be tracking marketing and other initiatives across all channels , all the way up to sales . We call this " closing the loop , " and it is especially important when following the path of a lead to conversion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has already happened . <p> FACT : Obviously , it is impossible to analyze data from the future . But past data can be indicative of the future . Right now , we are developing a predictive model for one of our clients . By tracking website actions and metrics that are most correlated to conversion , the model can actually predict which visitors are likely to make a purchase . <p> FACT : Adding the basic code from Google Analytics or Adobe SiteCatalyst ( or whichever digital analytics platform you choose ) won " t tell you much more than basic metrics . To uncover insight that can ultimately boost your ROI , you " ll need to do some deeper diving into your data . Tagging key website actions , as well as marketing across all channels ( paid search , e-mail , ad campaigns , etc ) will tailor your reports to track specific elements outside the default analytics implementation . With more granular metrics , there are more options for overlaying data and creating more customized goals . <p> TIP : Think outside the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , including form fields , Flash , and internal searches should be tagged for tracking . <p> FACT : Many people don " t trust digital analytics because they don " t understand its purpose ( That " s one reason Microsoft is pushing for a default Do Not Track setting in its latest browser ) . Yes , digital analytics relies on information collected from cookies , but none of that information is personally identifiable . Data from digital analytics includes information like the amount of time you spend on a page , which pages you visit , if you have visited before , your general location , which browser you use , etc .

@@83647882 @5147882/ <h> Thursday , 2nd January 2014 <p> As a developer/analytics engineer/solutions aficionado , I find myself having my hands in many different projects at any given point in time , each of which have their own requirements . Whether it 's a project for work , a side venture or a school assignment , each different undertaking will present its own specific challenges . So how do we stay in top coding shape while moving from one project to the next ? Here are some tips I have to help you stay sharp . <p> 1 . Always remember to warm up . <p> Like a pro baseball player in spring training or a concert pianist playing scales before a show , it helps to warm up before starting any new task . One site that I like to use as a refresher before jumping in is http : //www.codecademy.com/ . Sure , you 've probably heard of them before and even taken a few of their courses . Do n't start at the beginning , but jump right into a more advanced course that will help you brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will help you recall nuances you 've learned before and give you confidence going into any new endeavor . <p> 2 . Know your strengths . <p> We all have our strengths . Knowing these is important , especially when working in a team where you and your colleagues can play off of one another 's strongest skills . However , we do n't always work in teams and we ca n't know everything . Finding ways to boost your knowledge on the fly is almost as key as knowing what you 're great at doing . For example , I have discovered the sites http : //www.myregextester.com/ and http : **30;308;TOOLONG which help me turn problems into solutions once I have the tools I need . Browse your way into finding sites that help you get better results . <p> 3 . Make it Visual . <p> In my teaching days , I liked to give my students the task of drawing out their problem , be it linked lists , trees , graphs or user interfaces . I take my own advice and always sketch out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to see the full picture . It helps break things down into smaller , more manageable pieces and can even help you create a list of tasks . To draw , I prefer a whiteboard , but you can get all sorts of crazy with graph paper , a conference room table or even a sketching app on your smartphone or tablet . Seeing things laid out visually can help you see aspects you might have missed if you launched into working on the problem straight away . And you might end up with some art to hang on your wall . <p> 4 . Never Stop Learning . <p> In the ever changing field of computer science and information technology , one of the most important things we can do is to try and stay ahead of the curve . In this day and age with new tech and toys being thrown at us monthly , this may seem like a daunting task , but it 's important to remain vigilant in our learning . Lately , I 've been enjoying a few of the courses through https @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products through four different rolling courses they offer throughout the year . https : //www.coursera.org/ also offers a good number of online courses on various topics that you might find interesting , like programming for Android mobile devices . And of course there 's always the official Google Analytics Academy at LONG ... <p> Ultimately , what matters is that you find tricks that work for you to stay sharp and on the top of your game . If you have any tips of your own , I would love to hear them in the comments section , or feel free to let me know how these work out for you . Happy coding ! 188226 @qwx808226

@@83647890 @5147890/ <h> Friday , 14th March 2014 <p> I have been doing analysis in the digital space for almost 10 years now . One question that comes up more than any other is " How can I lower my bounce rate ? " I cant explain to you how much I despise that question . Bounce rate as a standalone metric , like most standalone metrics , are basically pointless and definitely does n't  pass my " so what ? " test . <p> Going even further and adding segmentation to your bounce rate reporting is good , but there was always something nagging me about bounce rates and I could never quite put my finger on it . For example , on one particular media site I worked on , bounce rates on article level pages were always very high . Did that mean that the article pages needed a redesign ? Were people not interested in reading related content or watching related videos ? I came to find out that neither of those questions were really the issue , the issue was how I was calculating the bounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site at the article level , 99% of the time they are coming from an outside source . People are not typing LONG ... into their browser . They are usually searching for information and they click on a link that brings them into your site at the content level , or perhaps you have a Facebook fan page and you post links to some popular stories in your news feed . However they get there they are coming for a reason ; they want to read the information and content they searched for and they want to read it on your site . But what if they found exactly what they wanted and then they leave ? Not only did they find exactly what they wanted , but they realize your content was good and a day/week/month later they come back to your site . Should they be counted as a bounce the same as someone who accidentally came across your site and has zero interest in it ? If you are using the normal bounce rate your analytics tool provides then you are counting them the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . First let me define each new bounce metric . A hard bounce is a new visitor who comes to your site and views one page and does n't  return in the next 30 days . A soft bounce is a visitor who comes to your site , views only one page , but has visited your site in the past or returns to your site in the next 30 days . For a content site , measuring soft and hard bounces should be mandatory , not recommended . For instance , one media client I worked with had a hard bounced . In other words , 82% of your bounces are actually visitors who have been to your website previously . <p> Once you have created your segments for hard and soft bounce visits , you can then look at your problem bounce rate pages such as article level pages . I bet you will be pleasantly surprised at what you find . The hard bounce rate for the article level pages on the aforementioned client was almost 50% less than the normal bounce rate . This just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come to your site . However , they will always come and navigate your site on their own terms , no matter how many related stories you throw at them . 188226 @qwx808226 
@@83647891 @5147891/ <h> Monday , 10th December 2012 <p> This fall , Google Analytics quietly introduced a new " tablet " segment as a subset of mobile traffic .

@@83647892 @5147892/ <h> Thursday , 26th September 2013 <p> Most businesses demand a 360 degree view of how their companies are performing and aim to grow with every angle . This requires multiple data analytical platforms like Google Analytics , Omnniture etc . Enterprises need to manage large volumes of data efficiently and then transform and present that data in a meaningful and structured format . <p> However , integrating structured and unstructured data remains one of many challenges facing these companies . The use of multiple analytical tools would help to understand customers , customers actions , as well as discover potential opportunities and develop business predictive modeling . <p> Some of the most popular tools are Google Analytics , Omniture SiteCatalyst , Webtrends , Salesforce , Eloqua , Alexa , and social media analytical tools like Radian 6 and SM2 . Google Analytics , Omniture , and Webtrends help to provide insights based on web behavior , while Eloqua and Salesforce organize and manage leads in one place and allow us to focus on potential business growth in specific areas . <p> Some examples from the big players <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A basic insight from this graphic is the drop-off places for customers during a purchase process for a particular product or service .

There 's also support for A/B testing , which compares pages with one set of elements and those with another set of elements . <p> The rise of social media tools <p> Social media tools are quickly becoming focus of marketing for small businesses as they build a community of people who have similar interests or face similar difficulties . It has become relatively easy to target potential customers and raise awareness about product or services in minimal time and at minimal cost . <p> There are a number of tools like Batchgeo ( which is a Google tool ) , Mapalist , etc. that let enterprise better understand their business geographically .

In my opinion , Mapalist is the best option to present vendor locations , provider locations , campaigns , natural resource surveys , etc . <p> You can compare the map tools in Mapalist and Google in the following image : <p> The power of coalitions <p> As powerful as these tools may be , nothing beats the collaborative efforts that combine their strengths .

@@83647894 @5147894/ <h> Monday , 1st October 2012 <p> Collecting data from your digital media brings you one step closer to those valuable insights that change the way you do business . But if you have defective code or havent tagged the proper KPIs , your data ( and , consequently , your insights ) will suffer . <h> Monday , 16th July 2012 <p> After successfully passing the Adobe Certified Expert SiteCatalyst Implementation Exam , I thought I would help out my future ACE professionals with this blog documenting the method to my madness . <p> When I signed up for the ACE Implementation Exam , I first reviewed the list of topics that were to be included on the exam . The volume and breadth of topics covered on the test were initially pretty overwhelming . To prepare , I searched for blog posts and other resources . I found a few good ones , including this one written by my predecessor here at MaassMedia . Church Mojo and Apothes posted helpful articles , as well . <p> Everyone prefers a different study method . I like to print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are four main categories of topics in the list I mentioned , so I made a study guide for each category . To fill each study guide , I went in to the knowledge base and searched each topic , then I copy and pasted all the whitepapers , resources , and other materials into a Word document that I cleaned up to make my study guides . Some bloggers suggest watching videos and studying the implementation guide , which are also good ideas . <p> Below are some of the more important topics the exam focuses on . <p> Written Section : Know the Products String ! <p> I cant stress enough that you need to know the SiteCatalyst products variable and all of its syntaxes . The majority of written questions were based on the products string , and almost all of them asked you to omit the category in the string . <p> There were also a good amount of multiple choice questions about product variable syntaxes . One question provided five versions of a product string with a different syntax and value in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syntactically correct . <p> The exam will also ask you to do simpler tasks , like properly define a traffic variable with an event . This was one question that wasnt worded clearly , so make sure to look out for buzzwords to avoid confusion. - - For example , a question might ask : Someone wants to know what city people are from that go to- this page , and this data should be- correlated with geo-region . Also , an event should be launched on this page . In this example , " this page " and " correlated " refer to s.props , so keep that in mind whenever you see those keywords . <p> Multiple Choice : Know the Details ! <p> The multiple choice questions cover a variety of topics . Keep these 14 tips in mind : <p> Memorize character limits on all major variables . <p> Know the state variable ( Obscure , I know , but there were at least three questions about that variable alone ! ) . <p> Props can be correlated , eVars are sub-related . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several questions about link tracking and its syntax . <p> Know what can be activated manually in the admin interface vs. done through Client Care . <p> Remember , you must go through Client Care to get eVars fully sub-related . <p> Learn the difference between basic sub-relations and full sub-relations . <p> Be familiar with what s.linkTrackVars does . <p> Know how to use numeric events and merchandising eVars with the product string . <p> The exam will ask you which Adobe tools are best for certain situations , so its a good idea to learn the various functions for VISTA , Data Warehouse , Data Sources , Discover , SAINT , Excel Client , etc . <p> Memorize all predefined e-commerce events ( scAdd , prodView , scRemove , etc ) . One specific question I had to answer : If you do not set a specific event with the products variable , what is the default event that will launch ? ( FYI , the answer is prodView ) . <p> My exam did not have any questions about the interface , so you do n't  need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There were not any questions about the different reports within SiteCatalyst either , so you wont need to correlate variables to reports . <p> The most important advice I can give to help you pass the ACE SiteCatalyst Implementation Exam is study the details . You may be able to define all the major variables , but make sure you can distinguish traffic variables from conversion variables , and know their character limits . The multiple choice questions will test your knowledge of all the topics , so remember : DETAILS , DETAILS , DETAILS ! Make that your mantra . Good luck ! <h> Monday , 25th June 2012 <p> Youve just finished a basic implementation of your analytics platform , and now you want to customize it . Where should you start ? Here are 5 important website actions not tracked with an out of the box implementation that need to be tracked with custom events or variables . <p> 1 . ) Onsite Search This is an often overlooked website action that can provide key insights into how people are browsing your site . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard time finding through regular navigation and identify missing content that visitors might expect to find . If I am visiting a site to find something specific , I 'll often use the search tool . If I do n't  find what I am looking for , I move on to another site . <p> TIP : Track the number of times the search function is used in an event , along with search terms in a custom variable . <p> 2 . ) Navigation Tracking navigation elements is just as criticalif not , morethan tracking onsite search . Tracking your top and side navigation will tell you visitors most common paths , as well as the most popular links in each directory . You can use custom link tracking or custom link IDs on all of your navigation links , but click map data usually provides enough valuable insight . Make sure the click map picks up any drop down or hidden links . Also , tracking previous page clicks can be difficult if all of your links are n't  unique on each page . <p> 3 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media into your web content , and each is tracked differently with different limitations . The first and the more common method is a small logo linked to your websites Facebook or Twitter page ( or LinkedIn , Google , etc ) . These can usually be tracked by setting up custom exit link tracking . The more difficult buttons to track are the interactive share buttons that allow visitors to post to Facebook and Tweet without leaving your page . These actions should be captured in a custom analytics variable . My earlier blog post explains how to implement social media tracking into Google Analytics , which can give you a sense of how your visitors are using social media to interact with your organization . <p> 4 . ) Onsite Marketing Visitors might choose to shop or browse a website by clicking on different creative with promotions or product messaging on it . If you are not tagging your creative with unique IDs , as well as with a custom event , you wo n't know which are most effective . <p> 5 . ) Conversion For most websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be e-commerce , lead conversion , or ad generation , your site should be tracking conversions with detailed custom implementations . On a lead generation site , you need to launch a serialized event on your confirmation page . E-commerce sites need to launch an event through each step of the checkout process , as well- as capture all product and cart information in a custom analytics variable . When you do this , you will be able to track the website actions that lead to each purchase , which is very helpful . <p> The reason these 5 things are so important is that they are all relative . Do n't  you want to know who clicked on a promo message before purchasing , or who Tweeted your blog post after leaving a comment ? You wont be able to relate these website actions to each other if you do n't  track them with some custom implementation , and that can keep you from seeing the bigger picture and revealing transformative insights . <h> Tuesday , 22nd May 2012 <p> As testing and optimization become even more influential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform that is right for your business model . I specifically want to talk about the difference between Monetate and Test&amp;Target . <p> Each platform has its own positives and negatives . Depending on how robust your testing program is or how focused you are in certain areas of your business , you may find that you 're using the wrong tool for your situation . <p> I am making the assumption that you have already implemented your tool and are just starting your testing program . For the purpose of comparing apples to apples , we will use the example that you are testing a new home page hero image . You have two challenger heroes that you are testing against the default . All the art is finalized and you are about to start the test setup phase . <p> In Test&amp;Target , you do not need to upload the creative into the tool , and if you have the technical background you can code the challenger pages yourself using custom JavaScript . In Monetate , you will need to request that the " action " be developed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished the action development , the test setup requires no additional coding . After uploading your creative , the rest is pretty much just checkboxes and final approval . <p> Test&amp;Target distinguishes itself with the ability to run a test that splits traffic evenly between the challenger pages and the default . In order to reach significance in the Monetate setup , each challenger page must have its own designated set of default traffic to use for comparison . <p> In our example , each challenger page receives 25% of total traffic , and each would be compared with a 25% portion of the traffic to the default . So , essentially , the default is getting 50% of total traffic . In Test&amp;Target , you are able to have an even traffic split between all three experiences , which allows you to more quickly gain significance . <p> As for reporting , Test&amp;Target has a clean reporting interface with the ability to set up multiple custom success metrics . If you are looking for in depth reporting with custom success metrics , Test&amp;Target is most likely the tool for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only allows five custom metrics per campaign ; however , if you do n't  have a dedicated developer with - JavaScript experience , and you do n't  have additional custom metrics you want added to each campaign , Monetate is probably the better solution for you . Overall , Test&amp;Target is more robust and easier to work with if you have a technical background and an interest in analytics . <p> ( Monetate Reporting Interface notice the scrolling you need to do if you have custom metrics ) <p> ( Test&amp;Target Reporting Interface Easy snapshots that can be graphed within the interface ) <p> If targeting or segmentation is important to you , you may want to keep in mind that Monetate does not allow you to target at the offer/experience level . Let 's say you have two promotional offers : one for people in California and another for people in Pennsylvania . With Monetate , you would need to set up two separate campaigns for California and Pennsylvania because you can only target at the campaign level . Using Test&amp;Target , however , you have the ability to target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , Monetate only allows for up 5,000 different zip codes per campaign , which is something to keep in mind if you have large zip code lists . <p> Overall , Monetate still has some work to do to provide a better user experience , while Test&amp;Target has a lot of great features but requires a higher degree of technical competency in order run a robust testing program . While neither tool is necessarily " better " than the other , each has its pros and cons . Weighing these against the needs of your business will help you choose the better tool for testing and optimizing your companys online experience . <h> Thursday , 29th March 2012 <p> As the social atmosphere grows , clients become more and more eager to leverage these channels . However , I have found most are very cynical towards the idea of social media being able to drive dollars to their business .

Social media is about the conversation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to better your brand , interact with customers ( or users ) , and find out what people outside the company brain trust think about your business .

Let " s get started on changing that . If you are a coding expert , then Google Code offers a great resource and explanation on implementing social analytics . If you feel like ( Insert Jersey Shore cast member here ) in math class , then hopefully you find my explanation a bit more helpful . Keep in mind this solution is for the interactive buttons that allow you to tweet , like , or share on your website . <p> Once your buttons are fully operational , follow the steps below : <p> Step 1 : Use Google " s JavaScript file and place it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the below code in the &lt;head&gt; tag modify the file to fit your needs ) . <p> Step 2 : Facebook Insert this script : <p> &lt;script&gt; ga.trackFacebook() ; &lt;/script&gt; <p> directly after the function that calls the facebook API in the &lt;head&gt; tag ( Facebook API should have this line of code in it js.src = LONG ... <p> That 's it ! Wait 24 hours and you should start to see your tweets , likes and shares in the social analytics reports , under the audience tab in Google Analytics . Not only will you see the exact social action that is being taken on your site , but you will see what pages are being shared as well as any secondary dimensions you wish to apply . 188226 @qwx808226

If you plan on trick-or-treating Halloween night , you might want to dress in a costume that includes a poncho ! <p> The map below from The Weather Channel shows the location of the storm at a category 1 near the Bahamas on Friday October 12 at approximately 8 AM .
