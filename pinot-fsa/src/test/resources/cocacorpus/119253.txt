I heard of the " cupped fingers " method ( you should be able to " cup " your fingers over the end of the jacket when your arms are hanging from your sides ) , but I also heard this can be inaccurate . What 's the correct method ? Tim M. <p> A : - For the most part , if you use the " cupped fingers " method to determine appropriate jacket length you 'll be okay. - However , this method may not only be vague to some , it also obviously depends on arm length of an individual ; since arm length can vary even amongst gentleman of the same height , this can sometimes lead to jackets that are slightly longer or shorter . Technically , the jacket length should be approximately half the height of the distance between the point that is the base of your neck down to the ground . Here is what we mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths that are proportional to our height , if you measure from the point at which your shoulder meets your neck down to the point between your Basilar joint and your first thumb knuckle ( proceeding image ) , your jacket will come back at the appropriate length . <p> Below is an image of a Black Lapel suit with the ideal jacket length . - Also , be sure to check out our jacket length measurement video tutorial . <p> If you have any specific questions or comments about this topic or any others , do n't  hesitate to shoot us an email at concierge@blacklapel.com ! 4797 @qwx624797 <p> We 'll send you style advice and intel for the modern man . <h> 21 thoughts on " Proper Suit Jacket Length " <p> why cant i find a suit or jacket with the body longer than the normal length of down to the finger tips . if there is a suit or jacket like this what is the style called please . hope to hear from you regards kevin <p> Youve already found suits and jackets cut exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of custom suits and jackets that are all made to your measurements . <p> But the bigger question here is why would you want a jacket cut with an extra long body ? Unless you 're going for the Steve Harvey circa 1999 look , we do not recommend making a jacket extra long . <p> By the way , Steve has stepped his style game up significantly since the old Kings of Comedy days ( Exhibit A ) . He credits his wife for helping him upgrade his look . And since that 's her in the photo with him in Exhibit A , we 'd trust any advice shes giving on looking good . <p> What is W7 and SE fabric/ material as shown on the inside pocket label of my Brioni suit and what is 100% Cupro in the same suit.I am a little worried as I paid a lot for it and do n't  want ending up with an ordinary sort of fabric/material <p> Figured I 'd answer Shahids questions even though its off topic of the thread . The meaning of W7 is , W is wool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SE is silk , so your jacket is a wool silk blend . I was once told that W3 is super 150s which is Brionis standard fabric so I would guess that W7 might be Super 16os or 170s . The lining is Cupro which is a type of rayon made by dissolving cotton cellulose with cuprammonium salts and spinning the resulting solution into filaments . This is the material you would find the lining made of in many of the highest end suits . You 're not getting regular fabric by any stretch of the imagination as Brionis fabrics are top stuff . Enjoy ! <p> I have read a few online style guides , including GQ and Esquire , odd enough , each of them have different views on the proper length of suit jacket . GQ overtly promotes shorter suit , while Esquire prefers suit should be long enough to be " cupped " . Conservative stylist on styleforum.com , on the other hand , prefer classical lenght suit . I am totally confused . I own a suit that covers my buttocks , but in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this suitable because most models Ive looked online have their front part dangling above their privy . I guess maybe they are models , so they have longer torso , while I am shortly built , about 170cm , that 's why the suit looks longer in front . <p> There are definitely some differing opinions out there , Gabriel . The best part is , they 're all correct . The " rules " governing suit jacket length are really rules of thumb and do n't  need to be adhered to strictly . <p> Everybody is different because every body is different . What works on models in magazines may not work for you . If your jacket covers your butt and you 're happy with the way it looks , do n't  fret over it . And , of course , be sure to order your next suit from us so you can specify exactly what length jacket you 'd like = <p> That is the Charcoal Herringbone suit , David . As the name implies , its charcoal , but there is a small herringbone pattern that adds just a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

If you mean , that when you reach for a door handle you 're afraid you 're going to bust through the fabric like The Incredible Hulk , that 's a problem . You 'll need to see a tailor for specifics , but chances are there 's some fabric there to alter your jacket . <p> If , on the other hand , you mean that when you extend to block a three-pointer in your suit with your jacket buttoned you 're feeling a little stretching , the problem may not be the suitthe problem may be that you 're playing pickup ball in a suit .

" James D.- <p> A : Not all things in menswear are clean-cut , and the difference between a suit jacket and a blazer is a prime example of this . Traditionally , a blazer meant a jacket of a solid color ( usually navy or black ) with gold or silver metal buttons , patch pockets and a softer construction . Think nautical , as the blazer really took off in the 19th century when the british royal navy changed their uniforms to something that closely resembled the modern-day blazer . A suit jacket , on the other hand , has always meant the jacket of a suit with matching pants .

Were here to educate so no worries . Although the style has trended lately , we do n't  really recommend rolling up blazer sleeves ( its not the best way to treat your custom threads ) , just your casual or dress shirts . Blazer sleeves can definitely be rolled up , and you can read some rules on that here . And while we are n't  experts on Indian wedding attire , we always recommend you follow the dress code instructions on the wedding invitation . This would be a good outfit if the wedding is established as casual attire . Hope this helps you out some more . <p> It is important to note , however , that all T-shirts are not created equal . Do n't  wear a fine wool suit with a faded white undershirt and expect the same results as you see on our Instagram . As for the suit , though , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Black Lapel suit . <p> The " perfect " color combination depends on one key piece of information that we could n't possibly have , how it looks on you . Here are a couple of guidelines that will help you answer this question for yourself , though : <p> If you 're tall , you can wear a pretty strong contrast between your jacket and your pants , but if you 're on the short side , be careful . The contrast between that royal blue jacket and white pants will visually split you in half . If you 're vertically challenged , this will only make things worse . <p> If you have light hair the lighter jacket will work well . If you 've got darker hair , go with the darker jacket . <p> For the royal blue jacket , combine it with blues classic partner , gray . Or go for a more earthy look and pair it with brown/khaki . <p> Ash color goes well with other grays . Play around with tonal combinations like charcoal gray pants with a light gray jacket like this . <p> Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the perfect combination . We can offer suggestions , but without knowing how it looks on you and what you look like , were fairly limited . You , on the other hand , probably own a mirror and can see what looks best on you . Do n't  sell yourself short . Trust your gut . If it looks good to you when you see it in the mirror , we say wear it . After all , confidence is your best accessory . <p> Before answering , well share our interpretation of your question . here 's how we read it : " I have a pair of navy blue slacks with black stripes . Please suggest a jacket to wear with them . Then suggest a shirt to wear with them . " <p> If that 's what you 're asking , here 's our answer : <p> Striped pants should be worn with the matching jacket . Splitting up pinstripes always looks half-done and rarely looks stylish . So we suggest wearing these pants with the matching jacket . If there is no matching jacket , they 're probably not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually like a pair of chinos . <p> As for shirts , a white shirt is always option #1 . We recommend that all men have plenty of white shirts and wear them regularly to keep your style from getting out of hand . When you are ready to branch out , do it smart . Do n't  just get shirts because they look cool on a mannequin in some store , get the shirts that look the best on you . Follow that rule and you 'll never have to worry about what goes with what again . <p> That depends , Dorian , on a lot of factors , way too many to go into here ( What 's your definition of casual ? Where would you wear it ? What would you wear with it ? etc . ) . <p> We cant give you a definitive answer without some context , but we can say that it takes a bit of imagination to see how you could make this jacket work with a casual outfit . If you 're regularly asked " whered you get that ? " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , then youve probably got the style chops to pull this off . If you 'd categorize what youd usually wear as " nothing special " then we 'd encourage you to take baby steps towards casual style rather than trying to take a giant leap . How ? Start by learning how to Rock a Blazer Like a Pro and go from there . <p> One bit of advice we can give you , regarless of how it looks on you , is to stick with subdued shirt and pants colors and patterns when wearing an orange blazer . Why ? Because orange is going to be the star of the show no matter what else you 're wearing . When you 've got a vibrant color like orange in an outfit , you should avoid competing colors and bold patterns or the whole look will come off a little loud . <p> We do n't  recommend wearing a gray suit jacket with jeans .

We like to pair them with dress pants like we did here and stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Assuming you 're talking about a collar pin , Mofe , our answer is yes .

But to clarify your current inquiry <p> There 's no specific name for this chain that I know of . When you see a chain on a vest , its usually connected to a fog/pocket watch .

What is appropriate for how you 'll wear it , where you 'll wear it , what youve already got in your closet and , perhaps most importantly , how you 'll look in it . One of our stylists can give you specific advice if you email us at concierge@blacklapel.com . That said , a bit of general advice is to choose blue over black . Blue pairs well with much more and is appropriate for both day and night . As for pattern , as a first blazer , a solid is a safe choice , but a subtle pattern can add a little depth to your look . Although it is about creating the right suit for you , the concepts in this article apply to blazers as well . <p> Alas , John , we do n't  think your plan will work out . Trying to pass off two different fabrics as a suit is nearly impossible . The chinos and jacket will look off when paired together because one will have a different texture and sheen than the other . <p> But we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solution to the problem is simple . Change the color of one of the items . You could wear the black blazer with a pair of gray pants like these extremely versatile slacks that you 'll find yourself wearing with almost everything you own . Or you could keep the black chinos and go with a lighter , more casual blazer , like this gray one . When the jacket and pants are different shades , their contrasting textures will actually work in your favor . <p> Okay , I get what you are saying . I bought a navy blue jacket ( tropical fabric ) with designer buttons , and I pair it up with a dockers khaki , dockers grey trouser and skin colour trousers . I 'll buy a suit as well . <p> My question for now , can Dockers Khakis , and pleated cotton trousers be used for office dressing ? <p> Cotton chinos are acceptable in many business casual offices . That one , again , comes down to what your office dress code is . If there is none , play it safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your boss is a man . We would n't want you rolling in to work in a dress . ( Unless you 're into that kind of thing in which case , why are you wasting time reading about menswear ? ) <p> The choice to go with pleats is mainly a personal preference , but we will say this : if you 're interested in a modern look , flat fronts are the way to go . <p> Other options include gray and other neutral shades of dress slacks , corduroys in earthy browns and a couple of accent colors like oxblood red and olive green and , if the office is truly casual , dark jeans . All of these can work with blazers and can be mixed and matched with many shirts and casual accents like knit ties . <p> Suit jackets SHOULD be long enough to CYA " cover your a** " , so from the back or sides , your suit jacket should cover your butt , or 90% of it . This looks OK ( i.e. not too long ) because a suit jacket has matching pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit shorter . They do n't  have matching pants , so a blazer would look too long for you , and youd appear to have very short legs . For this reason , you SHOULD get a blazer that 's 1 ? -1.5 ? shorter , or short enough so that your blazer only covers 50% of your butt . <p> The other difference is that a suit is typically made of a fine wool ( or linen , I suppose ) , and may have a shinier appearance . A suit should be paired with only a dress shirt . They should always be trim and fit your body well , while the sleeves should only go up to your wrist ( just enough to cover a well-fitting watch ) . <p> A blazer can be a bit bigger so that you can fit a sweater ( or whatever ) underneath , while the sleeves can be a bit longer ( if desired ) because you may wear it as a jacket and never pair it with a shirt and tie . The type of wool , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for suits . Sure , some people will buy bright orange suits , but that 's definitely not the norm . Look around . Suit colours are quite basic , even if the patterns vary slightly . <p> Mind you , in recent years , slightly shorter suit jackets have been in fashion , but that may look silly in 5 years , and make you look out of place at work . It depends on how trendy you want to be . In my profession ( in a hospital ) , wearing a slim , well-fitting suit is " different " enough that I already stand out from the crowd . I 'm pretty young , but I would stick with a jacket that covers your butt . To me , it looks better in a work environment . <p> If I have to dress up for the office in winters , and I go for a dress pant ( black , blue , charcoal , khakis ) with a dress shirt ( plain , striped ) , sometimes with or without a tie . Now to put on a layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) A jacket/blazer made up of thin tropical material and not the thick winter material , in charcoal , blue and black either with pattern or plain . <p> Or <p> 2 ) I should just buy a suit , and wear it in the winters ? <p> In summers , I do n't  usually put on a suit , I just go with a pant shirt and tie . <p> This is very informative since i came from a country that does n't  usually wear suits and blazers . I 'm pretty much naive on the difference so I made my research . I am about to buy a suit for the purpose of attending a debut and wedding of my nephew this coming october . . . Which color do you recommend on buying for this occassion ? considering also , after the occassion I can use them to wear in the office ? . . . thank you . <p> Choosing a great suit color depends , in part , on your own hair and skin coloring , so we 'd suggest using our concierge service to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , one go-to color for these types of occasions is Royal Blue . Itll work for just about any mans natural color . Not to mention it looks pretty fly ! We love this color so much we gave it a whole feature on The Compass here . And since this is still a solid blue suit , its also a great choice for the office after the special events are over . <p> The button stance neednt change between a blazer and a suit jacket , John . The navel principle applies to blazers just like suit jackets . You are a bit more likely to spot a one-button blazer than you are to see a one-button suit . The one-button will have a deeper V shape , so those do come together lower . <p> A word of caution , though , John . Proportion is dependent on your body type . A guy with a short torso and long legs will have a higher navel than a longer torso guy . So take the rule of thumb with a grain of salt . Of course were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make Black Lapel jackets are the key to getting your proportions right . <p> Wow this is great info .. u coulnt tell the difference .

Best part ? 2 pairs of Jordans = 1 BL custom blazer ( just about ) . Pretty affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shafkat , some blazers do have more casual detailing . It varies from one designer to another . <p> As for the buttons , you should be able to button the top button on a two button blazer , but buttoning the bottom button on either a blazer or a suit jacket wont work ( and will make you look like a rube ) . <p> The British very often pair pinstripe , and heavier chalkstripe , jackets with jeans and casual trousers , as well as bold windowpane tweeds . With the British , well English , its often not about matching , per se , but rather complementing colours . <p> I notice on your site , most of your blazers also have matching pants to form a suit . That 's fine if the fabric has some texture and pattern to it . But I find a solid colored worsted wool suit jacket looks out of place when used as a blazer ( the same with some patterns such as pinstripes ) . It looks like the wearer has his suit pants at the drycleaners . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately for the very reason you mentioned , Gaz . As for the solids , well just have to agree to disagree on that one . Of course , nobodys saying you HAVE to wear the jackets separately , you can always stay suited . <p> Shakil , we 'd love to answer your question here , but our concierge team will give you a more in-depth answer and personalized recommendation via email ( concierge@blacklapel.com ) . In the future , if you have any style-related questions , do n't  hesitate to reach us at that email address ! <p> You 're right , Stevemostly . A shawl lapel is an option for tuxedos , but its only one option . A more traditional formal tuxedo will generally have jacket with a peak lapel . Both styles work . <p> While , traditionally tuxedos are black , the world of tuxedos is opening up to blues like this one from Black Lapel which , by the way , has a shawl lapel . The dinner jacket can also be white for daytime affairs , while the pants remain black . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are some gray areas . That 's why were working on a feature story on black tie options for The Compass . Stay on the lookout for that story coming soon . <p> I know next to nothing about style , but what Ive gotten so far from googling the internet is that ; I think the main difference between a blazer and and a suit jacket is the material and pattern . The difference is similar to the way Khakis , Chinos , and even jeans can be cut similarly to a formal/ suit pants . Yet the Khakis , Chinos and Jeans are still categorized as casual/ non-formal pants . <p> Oscar , the type of pattern and fabric can definitely be a telling sign of a suit jacket vs. an odd blazer . Certain tweeds , for example , will often be more characteristic of a blazer , while worsted wools are typically used in suiting . As for patterns , pinstripes should always belong with a suit . That said , nothing is always that cut-and-dry ! In practice , doubling that solid navy suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its good to have a unique set of preferences Jovan ! We hope you can still get some more mileage out of your BL suit jacket independently of the pants even though it does n't  quite fit into the above criteria ! <p> Brian , great question . A lot of companies these days use the term sport coat and blazer interchangeably , causing a lot of the confusion between the two terms . However , traditionally , the the blazer and the sport coat had very distinct origins and characteristics . While blazers were defined by its preppier , nautical roots , the sport coat was a more rustic , hunting jacket . True to its outdoor functions the traditional sport coat was made of heavier fabrics such as tweed , had pockets with flaps , sometimes an upper ticket pocket and a generally softer shape than a suit jacket . Hope that clears things up a bit ! <p> I was literally on my way out of the house to shop for a blazer when I saw this . You guys are amazing , and so helpful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea what I was doing . Please keep up the great work !

It identifies him as a Croat and includes a pattern that indicates his home town . The way he ties it will come to be synonymous with him .

With the advent of silk printing processes and floral and paisley designs , ties reached their most frilly stage . The pendulum of tie style had swung as far away from its sartorial ancestors as possible . <p> At Black Lapel we 've got no problem with a little embellishment but when it comes to ties we 've seen stylish men moving away from the woven silk ties and toward a more rugged option .

The knit tie has been around for decades . Everybody from Sean Connery , as the that stylish rogue 007 , to Cary Grant , as that stylish rogue Cary Grant , rocked the look back in the day . So maybe the correct term for what 's happening is a knit tie renaissance .

And for a long time , people used stripes to blend into the scenery on Wall Street too , where the stuffy old bankers were all clad in pinstripes .

And so , inspired by the father of evolutionary theory , Charles Darwin , we went out on an expedition to discover and classify all the new species of striped suit wearers . <h> Color is Key <p> The distinguishing trait of this new type of striped suit wearer was that , unlike the pinstripe wearing men of the past , he features lighter , unexpected colors .

" Joe H.- <p> A : - While not always the case , a higher price tag on a pair of dress shoes will usually signal a higher quality of leather and construction. - A well-crafted , high-quality pair of leather- dress shoes is a long-term investment . With the proper care ( cleaning , polishing , conditioning , using shoe trees , rotating wear and resoling ) , a pair of well-crafted dress shoes can last 20+ years ( and in many cases , a lifetime ) . That said , $300 ( or more ) is still a lot of dough to drop on a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> $300 at 20 years , with $10 worth of shoe care product per year and 6 resolings at $50 = $40 per year <p> When you compare that to the $1,000 the average American spends on coffee per year it does n't  seem like quite so much ! <p> You may be right about the whole burnished toe thing . Of course , since a well made pair of shoes lasts a long time , the time frame of a " fad " is relative . You 'll probably be seeing them on well-shod men for another five or ten years before its time to give the burnished toe an official farewell . <p> I gave away 5 or 6 pairs of shoes in the last 6 months to make more room but there 's one pair I cant seem to part with . Would you still wear alligator spectators that are squared-toed ? They look great with 2 outfits I wear but those wide squared toes I wonder . Do I look ridiculous but Im deluded or what ? My wife tells me to keep them but I might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have 16 pairs and counting . <p> Alligator spectators are n't  going to make our list of must-have shoes anytime soon but as a 16th pair of shoes , its not like you 're going to be wearing these shoes all the time . With that in mind , we say if you 've got the space , go ahead and keep some spectators in the collection . <p> That being said , spectators , with their high contrast look , call attention to themselves . So , if you 're looking to " get away with " some square toe shoes , these are not the ones to try to do it with . Why not replace the outdated square toes with a rounded-toe spectator that will never go out of style , like these beauties from Loake ? <p> Disregarding pricing ( because i regularly see $300+ shoes with cemented soles and using polished leather AKA corrected grain ) and the use of a goodyear welt . <p> At the upper price levels it seems that it gets murky , how can you tell the difference between a $500+ shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind test ( no brand logos , etc ) with two pair of shoes , could you accurately guess which is of higher quality and why ? Let 's assume a pair of Churchs vs Loake 1880s , both shoes made in England . <p> I 've often heard things like " finishing " and " quality of the leather " but when pressed for examples , people typically start stuttering , evade the question or tell me to go find out myself . That suggests that some people at least are hopping onto the bandwagon and just using buzzwords <p> Hard mode : How do you judge the quality of a shoe online , with only access to pictures ? <p> There are two things to focus on when judging the quality of a shoe , Gabriel . Aesthetics ( an ugly shoe is an ugly shoe no matter how its made ) and durability ( will it hold up to wear and tear ) . The former is subjective , though we think all of the shoes in our piece on building your shoe wardrobe are damn good looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good indicator of how well a shoe will hold up . A Goodyear welt is virtually waterproof and makes the shoe extremely easy to maintain ( resole ) over the years , which makes for a durable shoe . <p> Of course there are some well-made shoes that are NOT Goodyear welted , but its a good benchmark for a shoe that was made with quality craftsmanship in mind . <p> That 's odd , ive been told by a lot of people that leather soles , even when goodyear welted , do not work well in rain and are hardly water proof . Unless there 's a intervening cork layer or something . <p> What about the leather quality ? Even if a shoe is advertised as full grain leather , there are different grades of full grain leather . <p> This is mostly for comparing two classic goodyear welted shoes against each other . Both shoes are well made , but they are placed at different price points and one is supposedly much higher qualitybut why ? And how can you tell ? <p> To answer your question about leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather soled shoes to avoid rain/water problems . <p> As for leather quality now you 're getting a little deeper than information you can get from a website . As we said , price is a decent yardstick to determine shoe quality , but its not as simple as that . There are many factors that can lead to differences in price between similar quality products ( varying production costs , marketing budgets , pricing strategies , labor costs , and shipping costs to name a few ) . <p> The moral of the story : do n't  take the price differences too literally , Gabriel . Go with the shoe that 's made to last , fits you well and you like the way it looks . <p> I second the rack . I 've picked up 3 pairs of allen edmonds there over the years and never paid more than $100 a pair . It costs more to recraft them than what I paid , which I just got done to my first buy after 5 years of wear . Good deal . <p> Shop Nordstrom Rack . Their shoe stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is a half season behind . Just picked up some very nice tan Cole Haan wingtips for $130 ( $275 original ) <p> True , Rich , there are lower prices at the Rack and other similar discount and outlet stores . But , and this is a big but ( we like big buts and we can not lie ) , do n't  be dazzled by the discount . As we said , a higher price often goes with quality leather and good construction , but a high price plus a deep discount can be a sign of a shoe that was overpriced to begin with . Look for quality . <p> A telltale sign of a shoe that will stand the test of time is a Goodyear welt . These shoes can easily be resoled so they 're capable of going a good twenty years in your shoe rotation . Even at full price , as we showed above , these are often the best deal over time . <p> We suggest talking to your cobbler first and coming up with a gameplan . A heel insert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for you in certain brands that run small but only an expert , looking at your foot in-person , could tell you that for sure . As you know , going up to a six would open up an entire world of choices to you . <p> I guess I better not mention what I pay for shoes because someone who thinks $300 is money for shoes , then that person will think I 'm insane . However , no fine dresser can be completely dressed with terrible shoes . Suit yourself . <p> For the record : I have a pair of J&amp;M moc toe shoes that are 25 years old that I paid close to $200 back then . That was a good piece of change 20 yrs ago however I knew theyd last . They 're an unusually thick leather with seriously robust stitching . They have been resoled once and their life has benefited by a dozen pairs or so I rotate . When the more square toed shoes were happening the moc toes got shelved for a short time . I 'm old enough to have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd wear them again . And probably MOST important to me is that quality shoes are much better for your feet . <p> Hi , its not really related but I was wondering on the colour matches for shoes and suits/bottoms . Like for example I 've read that brown shoes should never be worn with a charcoal suit ? If there was already a post about this I might have missed it <p> Gray and brown makes for a great combination , DK . Black is an easy combo with gray , but we like brown with a Charcoal Gray suit to add a little richness to our look ( that 's " richness " as in " having a pleasantly deep and strong color , " though a fat wad of cash is not the worst accessory we can think of ) . One caveat is to keep the brown shoes dark if you 're wearing them with a dark gray . <p> $300 dress shoes are absolutely worth the investment . I 've spent significantly more on shoes ( i.e. , John Lobb ) knowing full well I will have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality pair of shoes , take care of them and they will last you . <p> Youd be surprised at the quality of some of these shoes after a long period of time . I managed to grab some old ( circ. 1980s ) Johnston &amp; Murphy tassel loafers at Goodwill for $7 . All they needed was a good oil/polish treatment and they look brand new . My father even still has his J&amp;M dress shoes from the 70s . I recently spent around $300 on a pair of Allen Edmunds cap-toes that I plan on keeping for quite some time . I read in another article that if you 're wearing a suit , the shoes should cost just as much if not more . <p> I realize that budgets and priorities vary , but $300 is hardly a lot of money for a shoe . Allen Edmonds is generally considered to be the entry level of quality shoes and most of their models start around $350 . True quality shoes from the traditional English makers are generally upwards of $1000 . This may seem like a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quality shoes last decades ( even a lifetime ) when properly cared for . Additionally they will never go out of style and they will look better and better with age as the full grain leather develops a patina . The corrected grain leather used in lower quality shoes only looks worse with age . <p> Shoes are very important to ones wardrobe because they anchor everything down . Having bad shoes not only will cause the leg pain ( blisters , bunions , etc ) it could destroy the style too . I had quite many shoes above $300 price tag , as well as those from highstreet . To be honest , the pricier shoes are truly worth the investment . They last longer and aged better with time . The material is of high quality if its leather , high-end shoes uses best leather compared to highstreet , as they 're much softer and supple and does n't  bite the foot . Ive been wearing the high-end shoes for the past 5 years , and it still feel amazing despite the sole has worn out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style for everyday . Have bought blazers in blue and gray colors , both in wool . Do you have any suggestions for some blazers that fit in the summer . I do not know what to buy on . I have five shirts . six chinos in blue , beige , olive . Also Shorts in white , blue and red . Have some sweaters in black , blue and gray . Also classic shoes in brown leather , but do not know what to buy to get a better look . <p> If you 're buying a pair of dress shoes ( at any cost ) that will be dated in a few years , you 're doing it wrong . Dress shoes should be timeless ; that 's the difference between style and fashion . <p> With that said , if you only plan on wearing them two or three times a year well then , buy a cheap pair in a classic style . Investing in quality is great , but after only a dozen wears a pair of $80 shoes will hold up as well as a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can still get high-quality shoes for cheap , though . I have four pairs of dress shoes . Black and dark brown cap-toe oxfords , burgundy shell cordovan wingtips , and a pair of walnut monk straps . All are Allen Edmonds and all in great shape . I bought each of them them on eBay and have spent about $250 on the four pairs combined , including shipping . <p> Black Lapel , you get major props for espousing traditional shoe styles and an investment in quality . <p> I 've seen some guys trotting about in shoes that are 5 , 10 , and even 20 years old and not looking dated . Some of the severely chiseled or narrow/pointy styles are going to date badly , however , and I 'm not sure why some men are buying these at Edward Green prices . <p> I 'm not sure why those damn square toed shoes are still around . Theyve more or less been preying on the style ignorant since 1999 . I suppose they 're this generations Beatle boots ? <p> Yes , absolutely 100% it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better when you are willing to spend over $300 . Obviously you should n't buy expensive shoes just because they are expensive , but there is no question that you get what you pay for . <p> Allen Edmonds says that recraftable shoes can typically be done twice . BTW , not all shoes are recraftable . BL hit the nail on the head , having a few different pairs that can be rotated will not only help the shoes last ( not to mention you will have another pair or two to wear while getting heels replaced ) .

The details can be a very heuristic tell of the suits quality . Perhaps the most well known feature of a high quality suit and one of the hallmark details of custom suiting are " Working Cuffs " , aptly named for suit sleeve buttons that are functional and work . <h> Working Cuffs ( AKA " Surgeons Cuffs " ) <p> They are also known as " Surgeons Cuffs " , after military surgeons who had to unbutton and roll up their sleeves to work in the field .

First the obligatory technical definition : kissing buttons are buttons that touch slightly as opposed to being spaced apart . Popular with Italian suits , stacked buttons or " waterfall " buttons , are a type of " kissing " buttons that are slightly overlapping one another . A lot of tailors will simply use the term " kissing buttons " to refer to this type of stacked arrangement . The charm of the stacked buttons is to imply that the buttons are ever so " imperfectly " aligned , suggesting the suit is handmade ( and not machine made ) .

But if you 're a subscriber to The Compass ( you 're reading this article and that 's a sign that you 'll like what we publish so- you really should subscribe ) , you know that we believe taking care of your stuff is about as manly as it gets . From changing a flat to shaving your face , the manly arts are all about doing stuff with your own two hands and knowing how to iron a dress shirt should be at the top of any sharp dresser 's list . <p> That 's just one reason it makes sense to know how to iron a dress shirt . There 's also the fact that washing and ironing your dress shirts at home can save you some cash or that you 're not dependent on your dry cleaners ' schedule to have a freshly pressed shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , but the days of depending on your mother or your wife to iron you your dress shirts are long gone . So man up and learn how to get the wrinkles out of a dress shirt with these step by step instructions . <p> To follow along at home here 's what you 'll need : <p> Hardware : <p> An iron , and ironing board . <p> Software : <p> A clean but wrinkled dress shirt . <p> Different shirts require different settings but a quality 100% cotton dress shirt can handle a hot iron . To play it safe , pick a wrinkle down at the bottom of the shirt where it will be tucked in , set your iron to a medium/low setting and dial up the heat until you the fabric respond and wrinkles disappear . Once you 've determined your setting , proceed to <p> Iron The Yoke <p> Start with the inside of the yoke of the shirt ( that 's that top area of the shirt that connects- the collar to the back , chest and sleeves that gets filled out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Once you 've done the inside , iron the outside of the yoke . Ironing the inside of your shirts as well as the outside gives them an added crispness and only takes a minute . <p> A note about the order : <p> While some suggest starting with the collar because it is such a key spot to get right , we suggest leaving the collar until last so that you do n't wrinkle it in the process of maneuvering and ironing the body of the shirt . Realistically , ironing order really does n't make a ton of difference to the final outcome if you 've done a good job . <p> Iron The Upper Chest <p> On most dress shirts , ironing the upper chest is pretty straightforward . On shirts with a pocket on the chest , be sure to move the iron from the bottom to the top of the pocket so that you do n't bunch the fabric and accidentally iron the creases into the fabric . <p> Iron The Stomach &amp; Placket <p> Ironing the lower front of the shirt is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to pay special attention to the shirt 's placket ( the strip of fabric that overlaps where the buttons and buttonholes meet ) . Most irons a made with a lip so you can slide the hot iron around the buttons and get the wrinkles out of the fabric without pressing the buttons . <p> Iron The Back <p> Like the chest , the back of a dress shirt is pretty simple to iron . Some shirts have pleats in the center or on the sides of the back . To iron the pleats , start by ironing the lower part of the folded fabric , then , starting from the top of the shirt , iron the crease formed by the pleat down the shirt until it naturally flattens out . <p> Iron The Sleeves and Cuffs <p> Lay the sleeve down and press the cuffs flat first . Then spread the shirt sleeve out as flat as possible before pressing the shirt . This is important because while you 're ironing one side of the sleeve you 'll be pressing against the other side and potentially creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist and often have pleats where they meet the cuff . Treat these pleats as those on the back of the shirt and iron under the folded area first , then iron the from the wrist back up the sleeve toward the body , forming a small , crisp crease . <p> Iron The Collar <p> You should have removed any detachable collar stays before washing , but if not , remove them now and lay the collar out flat on the ironing board . Iron the collar from the center of the collar out toward the points . For a finishing touch , fold the collar for wear and run the iron over the edge of the collar to help the collar hold its shape . <p> Congratulations Ironman <p> No you 're not an Ironman triathlete or Iron Man from the comics , but you now have a skill that is almost as valuable as being able to swim , run and cycle great distances or shoot energy from your palms , you can make any dress shirt look great with just the touch of your iron .

Let the shape of your head/face determine your knot-size , not your collar . A spread should almost always be worn with suits , whereas a point or semi-spread are far more appropriate for casual appearances and outings in sport coats . With suits that are properly fitted , a spread collars peaks or " tips " will JUST reach the inside edge of the coats lapels and create a negative inset that serves to draw focus to the tie and knot as well as create a fluid and defining shape below the wearers face . In essence , the spread collar in combination with a coat creates a frame within which the tie is seated . Nothing less than a half-windsor should be used with a spread-collar as a four-in-hand looks sloppy and can be seen as childish when offset by such a wide collar .

If you see yourself in a mirror and love how you look in a point collar , wear point collars . The experts at Black Lapel know their stuff , and I frequently refer my customers to the site for further advise outside of my locale , but much of this is opinion as is even my own post now .

While were still not convinced , that a spread collar and windsor knot is the only choice for anyone wearing a suit , we appreciate the thought and energy you put into your comment , M.P . <p> As recommended above , an oval face means a semi-spread collar is your best bet . Since you 've got a large neck , do n't  over-emphasize it with a spread collar that will make your neck look even wider . <p> A four-in-hand knot will likely be dwarfed by your large neck and look odd .

If the jacket were a lighter blue or another shade , the solution would be simple : wear a pair of black tuxedo pants and youd end up with a non-matching dinner jacket &amp; pants combo . The problem is the jacket you 're describing is so dark you would lose the sharp contrast between jacket and pants and end up with a mushy combination of black and navy . So we recommend that you DO NOT buy a navy blue dinner jacket without the matching pants . If you 're going to wear a navy tux it should be a full tux .

However , suspenders are not a replacement for a cummerbund or a waistcoat ( vest ) . Tuxedos are not to be worn with belts so suspenders do the job of holding your pants in place . A cummerbund or waistcoat ( formal vest ) does n't  have anything to do with holding up your pants . They are worn with a tuxedo because the jacket only has one button and opens up below that button .

At Black Lapel , we 've seen a strong predilection towards blue . <p> Common Suit Colors Breakdown <p> A little more information leads us to some reasons why blue might be dominant . For one , a navy blue suit is great foundation piece . Second , the ways men use suits are different now . Suits are less of a workaday uniform than they were a generation ago .

This rule yields great results . But interpreting this rule is the trick . It DOES NOT mean that if you have brown hair you must wear only brown suits . Instead , focus on matching your hair 's shade to your suit 's shade . If you 've got dark hair , dark suit colors naturally frame your face and will look better on you than someone with light hair . If you 've got dark brown hair , a dark brown suit will work for you , but so will a dark gray suit or a dark blue suit . The key word is dark . <p> Rule #2 Go in order <p> When you are first building a wardrobe , start with foundation colors like the classic blues and grays . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors . <p> Rule #3 Play to the base <p> This advice is n't just for political candidates .

A gray plaid suit is still , all-in-all , a gray suit . Does the windowpane pick up the blue on your eyes ? Great . The pinstripes are in your favorite color ? Good for you . But there is almost always one dominant color in a fabric . That 's the one to focus on when you 're building your collection . <p> Do n't overthink it <p> Remember a suit is just one ingredient in the dish called an outfit .

Here 's what NOT do with a black shirt . <h> 1 . Do n't wear it to the office <p> Black shirts are casual shirts . Yes , you may have seen some guys wearing them to the office . Not to stereotype but they 're probably in the IT department . <h> 2 . Do n't wear a tie <p> Because black shirts are casual , they do n't lend themselves to being worn well with ties . Furthermore , your tie should n't be lighter than your shirt or you start to look like you 've got on a 30s gangster costume . So we say skip the tie altogether with a black shirt . <h> 3 . Do n't go overboard with the black <p> The blackout look " a black shirt with a black suit with black socks and black shoes " is okay , but a little predictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <p> Okay , whew , now that we 've gotten that off our chests we can move on to what we 're all here for , the answer to the question <h> WHAT TO WEAR WITH A BLACK SHIRT <p> There are two basic approaches to figuring out what to wear with a black shirt . The first is a monochromatic approach . Mono-what now ? Do n't worry we 'll explain that below . The second approach is to use the black shirt to create contrast . <h> What to Wear With a Black Shirt For A Minimalist Look <p> We 're overachievers here at Black Lapel , so we never thought we 'd be advising anyone to do the minimum , yet here goes . That word that we used above : monochromatic . It means consisting of only one color . When black is in the outfit , it 's monochromatic if it 's made up of only black and shades of gray , like this Rivington Gray suit with a black shirt . <p> Using the fewest possible colors is a surefire way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that the average guy misses when getting dressed : when it comes to color , a little restraint can go a long way . <h> What to Wear With a Black Shirt When You Want to Stand Out <p> For a more advanced move , try pairing a black shirt with a strong color , like red , in a muted saturation , like burgundy . The result is what you see above . Why is this an advanced move ? It takes a good eye to find the right amount of saturation . Too strong of a color and you end up with a jarring contrast with the black , like yellow with black . Too weak of a color and you end up with a muddled combination , like navy and black.How to strike the right balance ? Nothing beats a mirror . You can discuss color combinations until you 're blue in the face but the best way to know whether a color combination works for you is to try it on in front of a mirror . Of course , if you want to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new deep burgundy suit for yourself . <h> Your Turn <p> So if you 've been wondering what to wear with a black shirt , you should be inspired and encouraged by what you 've read . Want to get the look ? Choose the suits or shirt below to learn more . <p> Good call on the gray blazer . If you have the matching pair of pants to make a full suit , we suggest you wear those and nice black dress shoes . If not , a pair of black slacks is next best . Again , stick with black shoes . <p> Yes to the first question , Fabian . All of the pants you mentioned would work . <p> As for the knitwear , that 's a trickier look to pull off . The rule of thumb we cited above about not wearing a tie that 's lighter than your shirt , could also be applied to a sweater . A light colored sweater atop a black shirt is going to look a bit loud because of the contrast of the color and the black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but can kill the inherent cool of the black shirt by covering it up with more black . <p> But even more important than color is the texture . The reason why the shirts and suits we featured above look so good is the harmony between the smooth cotton shirt and the smooth wool suits . When you mix in the rougher textures of sweaters , the whole look may suffer . <p> As with everything we publish , take all of this advice with a grain of salt . There are exceptions to every rule , but our advice is to avoid knitwear with black shirts . <p> I 'm inclined to disagree that a black shirt is inherently casual The fabric and details tend push shirts to one end of the spectrum , vs. the other , not the color necessarily .

Alas , sometimes we still have to speak to the majority and for the majority of our guys , we would not recommend wearing a black shirt and tie to the office . <p> I love black shirts as they are flattering to the figure and forgiving to the odd mark you are bound to pick up during the day , so delighted to read your comments . As I am a fan of suspenders , do you have any tips on what colours to wear with a black shirt and maroon suit ? <p> Glad to have drawn your interest . A maroon suit with a black shirt ( like the outfit above ) is n't meant to be a formal look and , in our opinion , suspenders add formality . We typically only pair suspenders with a tie or bow tie too , but we do n't  recommend a tie for this outfit . So if you use suspenders for utility purposes ( aka to hold up your pants ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan of suspenders because they 're stylish , a maroon pair to match the suit is the best way to go . <p> I love to read such an awesome and informative post who suggest very well on mens dressing style .

Is this a common issue or could this be a sign that I need to lose 2 inches from my waist ( there is pull at the buttons when I am sat down ) <p> One of the problems with buying vintage is that its like buying clothes off the rack , you can only alter them so much . The tie bunching up is likely due to the lack of room . while a tie bar may solve the problem , wearing one around your stomach is definitely not something youd want to be visible . So it keeps you in the jacket the whole time you 're wearing the suit . <p> All of these problems are not problems when the suit is custom made to your measurements and fits you flawlessly , like a Black Lapel suit . We can make any of the fabrics into a double-breasted suit , so you 've got options . <p> whilst it is true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rack , or worse if you are buying a suit that is old enough to have been custom made for someone else , although it is nice seeing who something was made for .

However I imagine nothing will compare to a custom made suit , one day I will save up for one . <p> You 're right , James , there are some really cool aspects of vintage clothes .

Its pretty damn awesome . <p> Its a common misconception that double-breasted suits make a big man look bigger . Yes , there is an extra layer of fabric across the front , but if that half-inch of fabric is n't going to make the difference between you looking trim and looking too " full " . In fact , larger guys benefit from the sweeping lines of the double-breasted lapels which give the illusion of more verticality to a man de-emphasizing the horizontal lines . The key to proportion is letting the lines of your clothes work for you and the double-breasted suits got plenty of diagonal and vertical lines to help you out .

A silk solid colored tie or one with very fine and dense stripes or very small and dense geometric patterns will work best .

Maybe it was the tie I as using , what sort of tie do you find works best ? <p> Qui , we find that a solid colored tie or one with very fine and dense stripes or very small and dense geometric patterns will work best . You should avoid ties with wide stripes , patterns , or florals/paisleys .

The Trinity knot does n't  work too well with very busy ties . It seems to work best with bright solids and ties with small , consistent patterns .

@@77670788 @6370788/ <h> Anatomy of a Collection Fall 2015 Suits <p> Published on September 4 , 2015 <p> When the style gurus in our product design team started building the latest collection from Black Lapel , we sought inspiration from classic patterns and textures . <p> There 's something to be said for the classics , particularly when the summer humidity gives way to a brisk fall breeze and we begin to add layers to our outfits . Crisp bright solids are relegated to the rear of the closet and matured tones and subtle textures make their way into mens fall fashion . <p> This collection of suits is our reinterpretation of the classics and we break down how we arrived at each new addition below . <p> First we re-envisioned the dark blue suit . We decided to build on a rich blue hue by layering on a very fine herringbone design that is almost more texture than pattern . It 's what gives this suit its signature striated appearance . We like this fabric so much we created it in a classic two-piece silhouette and added three-piece and double-breasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously could n't . <p> Not finished with blue yet , we sought out a unique shade for our full-sized herringbone offering . What we found was a Persian blue . Saturated and strong , we knew this deep blue was the perfect choice for a herringbone weave because of the way light bounces off of it . No other suit in our collection straddles bold and elegant this comfortably . <p> The herringbone , a nod to traditional tailoring , made a third appearance in this collection , but this time it surprised even us . We found this gray herringbone quietly residing beneath a subtle and fine blue windowpane pattern . The resulting combination is to the eye what a Mozart symphony is to the ear , layered with rich textures and complexities that work together in precise harmony . But if your tastes run more to Mos Def than Mozart , think of this as an homage to the classics , like that time Nas sampled Beethoven in " I Can " . <p> Speaking of music , putting out a gray pinstripe suit is like covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it or why bother ? We wanted something with a more modern spin that could still reflect the wearer 's intent to get down to business . We found it with this tightly-spaced stripe that is the perfect cloth to she 'd the stodgy reputation of a pinstripe . It 's enough to make you want to " Twist and Shout " . <p> Of course , we love birdseye for its subtly texture and luxurious feel . So it made sense that we anchored this collection with a sensible hearty gray version of the classic birdseye pattern . Not only does this birdseye round out this collection , but it adds to the Black Lapel birdseye offering , complimenting our Light Gray and Blue Gray versions . Always sophisticated , birdseye continues to be both a customer and a stylist favorite . <p> Up Next : we 'll break down the new collection of shirts for Fall 2015 from Black Lapel .

Of course not , just close , like we did in the pants/sock combo seen here . <p> But if you asked us for the real answer , we say , to hell with matching your socks with either .

@@77670799 @6370799/ <h> The Right Tie Knot For You <p> Published on September 26 , 2014 <p> When was the last time you considered your tie knot ? If you 're like most guys , you 're still doing the same tie knot you learned the first time you ever tied a tie . Its time to give your tie knot a second look . Why ? The proper tie knot keeps everything in proportion around your face . Proportion , the cornerstone of mens style , is mostly a matter of tailoring , but when it comes to ties , the perfect tie knot balances out your face and let 's you keep peoples focus and attention on you , not your tie . Well break down the pros and cons of the most common tie knots by face type- so you can pick the tie knot that works for you . <h> Tie Knots for Medium-Sized Faces <p> Most guys fall somewhere in the middle between slim and full faces . Their faces do n't  warrant a substantial tie knot like a full Windsor knot but they are n't  so slim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot either . That 's where a middle of the road tie knot comes into play . This can be achieved by modifying another tie knot . Some guys tweak the four-in-hand they grew up on to give it some girth ( results may vary , though , depending on the tie fabric and cut ) . Other guys go with the tried and true half-Windsor- tie knot . Think of the half-Windsor like an undefeated welterweight . Its not as big as others of its kind . It may not be all over TV like its bigger tie knot brethren . But it steadily , relentlessly and thoroughly , kicks ass . <h> Tie Knots For Slim Faces <p> The most common tie knot , the tie knot most guys start with , is probably the least useful tie knot to know . The four-in-hand knot creates a smallish knot , like the one featured here , that is . While this is a standard tie knot , and looks great on guys with slim faces , smaller tie knots like this can get lost under a fuller face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a little beef in the cheeks ? Should you avoid ties altogether ? Nonsense . You just need to learn to tie a thicker tie knot . A- - bigger tie knot , like the Windsor knot shown here , will balance out a wider jaw and keep things in proportion . <h> Tie Knots and Collar Types <p> We would be remiss if we did n't  put some context around the tie knots we 've discussed here . After all , your tie knot does n't  exist in a vacuum but on a collar . Traditionally men with round- faces have been told to go with point collared dress shirts , while men with angular ( read : thinner ) faces have been encouraged to opt for spread collars . We stick by that advice ( hell , weve even dispensed it ) . Some will protest that a spread collar requires a larger knot and , therefore , slim faced guys should wear Windsor knots . We could debate the merits of that theory for days , but why do that when we can offer a simpler solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large knot , slim enough to not leave too much empty space when you 've got a smaller- tie knot , its the most versatile collar out there . <h> Alternative Tie Knots <p> Of course , some of you out there might be reading this and wondering if you have any other options besides the three knots above . The answer is , most resoundingly , yes . There are hundreds of tie knots out there . We 've highlighted a couple of our favorites , the- Eldredge Knot and the Trinity Knot in the past with instructions on how to tie them . Of course , these tie knots are not exactly your everyday knots but they 're great for special occasions . <p> Do you swear by a tie knot we did n't  even cover ? Tell us about your favorite tie knot ( from the exotic to the simple ) in the comments below . <h> 12 thoughts on " The Right Tie Knot For You " <p> In my humble opinion , I always go for and also recommend the sadly too often forgotten Pratt knot . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining at a medium size ( which does n't  require longer ties like a Windsor nor lots of time to tie every morning ) . <p> The Pratt knot will fit nicely on most collars , from Italian to French . It may even pull it off on certain club collars . <p> To me the Pratt is optimized for most men , a wide variety of collars and every tie fabric ( tight enough to avoid silk to loosen and easy enough to tie with knit ties ) . Its a masterpiece of a knot = ) <p> The Pratt knot is a nice alternative to the Windor for the guy who likes a bigger knot and wears spread or cutaway collars . Clearly , that 's not news to you , Piers . One thing we would add is that tying a Pratt knot pretty much guarantees a nice dimple in your tie . <p> Our first bit of advice is not to wear a tie with a black shirt . We believe black shirts are casual and should n't be worn with suits and ties unless you 're going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Van Wijk " tie knot , right Xavier ? That 's the cylindrical one that comes out super skinny . When tied tight , this ultra slim knot will accentuate the jowls of all but the slimmest faced men , so beware if you have a fuller face . As far as collar type , this knot is slim enough to fit into a point collar and would work with a semi-spread collar as well . We 'd advise against a cutaway or spread collar for this knot since it is so cylindrical and skinny . <p> I 'm the guy who 's using the same four-in-hand I learned as a kid Guilty ! But the half-windsor is only one step extra and quite easy to shift into without too much reprograming to the years of muscle memory . I 'll give it a go . Ive been using collar-bar and tab collars so the smaller knot of the four-in-hand was ideal there . Now starting to buy semi-spread collars and liking them a lot , so this is perfect timing . Thanks folks ! <p> All excellent points , Joe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were smart to go with the four-in-hand when wearing them . Now , in your semi-spread collar days , you can easily make the transition to the half-Windsor once you get into the habit . <p> Despite my thin face I go full Windsor . It is based on different types of proportion though : tie width and tie length . Like John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell , ties and belts should be the bests of friends . Never leave too much space between them and never let them cross each other over . They need to meet and have a just barley touching relationship , kind of like a solid high five as opposed to holding hands . <p> The key with width is where you start your knot . Most ties progressively get wider . If you are around the neck and skinny portion meets slightly less skinny portion at the knot point , a full Windsor will have the thickness of a half Windsor but more badass look of a full Windsor . <p> But this is what works for me and my my 59 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are on the skinnier side and that also keeps my knots thinner . And as you mentioned , material matters too . Full Windsor with a thick wool tie gives the short tie clown look . I go with a thin knot to keep the tie long enough to endure a healthy friendship with my belt .

The only way I could put some personality into my outfits was through my tie , my pocket square and maybe my socks , depending on who my boss was . Nobody , including myself , wants to wear the same ties over and over again , so I got about 10 guys together at Merrill Lynch and I put together an informal tie swap . Everyone brought in three ties that were in good shape but they did n't  really want anymore . Everyone passed ties to their left and everyone had three new ties to them at no charge . About two months later a few of the guys came up to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that was a great idea. That was my first realization that we may be on to something here . <p> BL : So before you started the company did you have a giant collection of accessories ? <p> DG : Before this company I was a pretty average guy . I appreciated and enjoyed fashion without it playing a major part in my life . I am someone who can be impulsive and likes to change frequently and express all my different moods and personalities by my clothes so I think that lead toI do n't know if I 'd call it collecting or hoarding . <p> DG : There is demand for the big brands and we have the supply of the big brands , but we always reserve about 25% of our collection for niche , independent , often handmade in the U.S.A. designers .

Maybe what patterns to look for or what colors work well together . <p> David Goldberg walks his dog , Kiley , in style . <p> BL : So what do you say to that guy who , maybe , is tired of wearing the same outfits over-and-over ? <p> DG : Thats what happens when you own ties .

My style advice would be get very high quality , well tailored basics . Your suit , your white shirts , your blue shirts , a nice pair of shoes a nice pair of dark slim fit jeans . Then with accessories and things that are trendy , go with quantity because the whole point of an accessory is to add a little bit of personality to an otherwise pretty standard outfit . Nobody wants to see you in that random bow tie or quirky hat over and over again . That defeats the purpose of being an accessory . <p> Want to skip the reruns in your own accessories rotation ?

When it comes to black suits that obsession goes into overdrive . Why ? Because there 's no place to hide a bad fit in a black suit . Other suits may dazzle with patterns or thrill with colors but your black suit better fit you flawlessly or your whole look will be off . <h> Black Suit Rule 3 : Keep accessories simple . <p> There 's a reason priests , the Amish and others who are devoted to dressing modestly wear black .

Still trying to learn everything since I 'm still new to the whole suit game . <p> Weve been there , Daniel . To answer your question about black suits in the office , no they 're not forbidden , it just limits a lot of your choices . <p> To make things easy on yourself work with those limits .

That 's not something you want to half-ass . That 's why we never suggest black bow ties for anything but black tie outfits . <p> To make this outfit work , ditch the bow tie and go one of two ways : either go without a tie at all , in which case you 've got a dark and brooding laid back look with the maroon shirt , or go with a necktie and change the shirt to white .

Thanks ! <p> A black suit is n't interview material in our opinion . It can look too serious and more often than not , guys royally screw up the shirt and tie combination to go along with it . We recommend grays and blues for interview suits . We think your best bet is to wear your navy suit again , but with a different colored shirt and tie .

You do you . If it works with your coloring and it does n't  fit you flawlessly , the whole look still is n't going to cut it . Finally , if you nail the other rules and then top off the whole look with a beaten up pair of shoes you 'll still just have a near miss . But if you go back through the article above and can honestly say you 've followed the rules , you 're bound to look good . <p> Stop equating Black to the other main color suits that men wear . Black is in a league all by itself . A pitch Black Suit is the darkest and BOLDEST color a man can wear . I agree with Black Lapel 100% . Stick with a Black , Grey or MAYBE a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright orange , etc. ties with A Black Suit and a white dress shirt . Those brighter ties are to be worn with navy blue or grey . Black is a separate animal all to its own . <p> Hey , John . A lot of your confusion can be solved by looking at the wedding invite for the defined wedding dress code . If the invite states black tie , black tie optional , or cocktail attire , count the black t-shirt out . We recommend you wear a tie to any wedding unless " casual " is specified on the invite . If casual is acceptable , you could rock your black suit with the black dress shirt and no tie . Its a good look for a night wedding , but it would be too harsh for , say , a warm weather wedding . So if that 's the case , opt for the white dress shirt and no tie . If the dress code suggests a more formal setting , we recommend your white dress shirt and a simple , non-shiny , monochrome tie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a 15 year old rapper , you can bend the rules of formality and go with a black T-shirt . <p> Hip-hop has always borrowed from other genres from the early days of sampling , so stylish rappers have always been inspired by style icons too . From the early B-boys who combined running gear and ostentatious jewelry ( windbreakers and fat gold chains ) to A$AP Rocky appearing in GQ in a nautical inspired double-breasted blazer and captains hat , rappers have always been given some leeway to pull from different styles . So , in essence , do n't  worry , he cant go wrong . <p> Hello ! I have a wedding and just bought a nice black suit ( very faint striped texture ) . I 'd prefer some dash of color instead of the more formal black&amp;white look , but nothing extravagant . Would any kind of green tie work ? I already have a deep red one , but I 'd rather try something different . Thanks ! Oh , and would coloured socks work ? <p> Its no secret , if you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans of bright colors and black suits . The effect is straight up clownish and we do n't  recommend it . But were not against all colors with black . Muted colors , added with restraint can work . <p> Overall there is a good dose of color in this look as a whole . By drizzling the red tones over the whole outfit like olive oil , not smearing it on like butter , we were able to keep the whole look classy . If you do add color , that 's the way to do it . <p> Like , white sneakers casual ? You can reference the suit + sneakers section we wrote about here , but we have some more styling tips in addition to what we wrote about there . If you want to wear casual shoes , that casual theme should carry throughout the rest of your outfit . So a black or white t-shirt or sweater is the way to go instead of a dress shirt and tie . Hope that helps . <p> G00d evening , I have an interview coming up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after reading this article I feel that i have been shooting myself in the foot . I do not like to wear white shirts ; blame it on catholic school . I wanted to wear a red/tangerine shirt with a simple shiny black tie . I am 61 ? about 215 , nice build and I want to look dashing . I am coffee brown skin , yo know with a little bit of milk added . Do you have any smashing suggestions to help add to my confidence . Thank you in advance . <p> In general , we do n't  recommend black suits for job interviews . A ) Theyre particularly limiting as you 've noted , and B ) they 're extremely serious/formal . If a dark suit works for you , we 'd suggest charcoal gray instead . Charcoal gray is still a dark suit but allows you to wear bright colored accessories , a larger range of shirts and brown shoes ( a no-no with a black suit ) . <p> As for the disliking wearing white shirts , you MUST get over that . Look at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts regularly . Of all of the scarring experiences associated with Catholic school ( we know , a large contingent of the Black Lapel team went to Catholic schools ) a fear of wearing white shirts should not be one of them . White shirts are the foundation of all stylish mens wardrobes . <p> As we recommended above , strong colors and black suits just do n't  mix . That goes double for a job interview . A tangerine colored shirt and red tie is loud in any setting . The goal of an interview suit is to keep the interviewer focused on you . Against a black suit , this combinations is like wearing a blinking neon " Look at me " sign on your chest . Keep the shirt and tie simple to keep the attention on your face , not your clothes . <p> Hey i need your opinion , i 'm about to wear a black suit with a green shirt , its almost like lime green but not the electric one its the calm one , and a black bow ties , should i wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about color matching with my girlfriend for her prom . She will be wearing a pale pink dress and I will put on a black suit , probably white shirt and black bow tie . What about pale pink handkerchief ? Would a colorful bowtie ( pale pink , but in that case I would take a white handkerchief ) be possible for this opportunity , or would it be too much ? <p> If there are two things you 'll hear repeated in our advice they are as follows : <p> Do n't  try to add too much color to a black suit , and <p> Do n't  worry about matching your date . <p> Rule #3 above shows the right way to wear a black suit and the way that makes you look like a clown . How do you avoid looking like a clown ? Stick with black , white and gray , like well dressed men do ( see Tom Ford ) and you 'll be fine . <p> As for the matching your girlfriend , we generally tell guys who ask about this that you 're her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually giving grown men this advice because the whole matchy-matchy thing is a little cutesy for our tastes . Since this is the prom and we know how teenage girls can be about this kind of thing , we 'd understand if you went with a pink pocket square to coordinate with her dress . We 'd recommend leaving it at that , though and sticking with a stylish black or gray tie . <p> Our advice is , if you 're supposed to be in black tie , you should either bite the bullet and get yourself a tuxedo or just abstain and go in a suit . Do n't  half-ass it by wearing a shirt that really belongs with a tux but not wearing a tux . The only thing worse than not wearing black tie to a black tie event is wearing part of a black tie getup to a black tie event . That basically says " I understood the dress code but did n't  care enough to really follow it . " At least if you show up in a suit you can just plead ignorance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get confused with the tie I have to wear . Looking to try black suit with light pink shirt . What texture and colour of tie would be perfect with this ? Read it on other website to go with blue or red tie but I did n't  like the combination . <p> Well refer you to rule #3 above . There 's really no reason to add a red or blue tie to this outfit . A pink shirt against a black suit is already pushing it with a black suit ( wed recommend swapping for white ) , adding a colored tie will just call attention to the jarring contrast of color and black . When in doubt , limit the color palette . Making the outfit strictly black , white and employing shades of gray for contrast is always stylish . <p> Although men with darker skin can pull off black suit combinations better than most , this sounds a little too matchy-matchy . Pick your bold accessories wisely , and by wisely we mean just add one in this scenario . You should choose between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . <p> Wouldnt recommend wearing an solid black silk tie or even a black silk tie ( with accent colors in it ) with a black shirt . The tie blends right in with the shirt and is not showcased at all . No point even wearing a tie . A solid black tie or a black tie ( with accent colors ) works best against a white shirt . Case Closed . I agree with the Black Lapel author . <p> Are you hoping well okay this outfit because of the white polka dots ? Sorry , but we still consider this outfit going overboard with the black . Actually , it may even be worse since the polka dots will just call more attention to how flat the rest of the outfit is . <p> Our solution , swap the shirt out with a white one and you 're done . Simple , right ? <p> I 'm dark skinned yet was thinking about going low contrast with a black suit , burgundy paisley bow tie with minor colors of orange and grey . Undecided on if the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts on this look ? <p> As we said in Rule #3 above , strongly colored accessories and black suits do n't  mix well . Without seeing the accessories in question , we cant say for sure , but when we read words like paisley and orange we fear you might be treading on thin ice . We recommend you limit the colors in your outfit , Andre . <p> Well assume you mean that the shirt is gray , not that your black jacket has gray sleeves . In that case , sure , a gray shirt and a black suit are okay to wear together . As we stated above , its all about who 's wearing it . If you 're just not cut out for wearing black , no amount of finagling the rest of the outfit will change that . <p> I 've seen some great contrasts with black suits ( sometimes with peak lapels ) and an odd but black waistcoat . I think the black pinstripe vest can give the black suit an added look . What are your thoughts on that ? <p> Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Were advocates of wearing an alternating vest with a suit " its modern and smart . The idea behind adding a black pinstripe vest to a black suit is good , but tread carefully . Pinstripes are mainly to be worn together , and interrupting the lines can make your body look disproportional . Although this effect only really takes form when breaking up a pinstripe suit jacket and pants , if the pinstripe vest you mention is n't cohesive with your black suit , you could be at risk of this faux pas . Then again , there 's the potential for this outfit to look totally gangster . Like we said , tread carefully . <p> Hi , I also have a 3 piece black suit that I am interested in wearing to a company Christmas party . I am fair skinned in color . Should I trade the vest for another color than black ? What about the shirt and tie ? I was thinking a dark crimson tie and white shirtbut your advice is appreciated in helping me look good for this event . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest idea . The key is not to make the contrast too jarring ( no brightly colored vests , please ) and not too timid ( no charcoal gray vests either ) . Think of the vest like an accessory and follow the advice we gave above , either keep the color somewhat muted or go with a stronger contrasting gray . <p> Same goes for the tie , make sure that crimson is dark enough and that your shirt is white and you 're good to go . If the reds too bright , try a gray or black tie to keep things simple . <p> Hello , I have a job interview and I only have a black suit . I want to use with a white dress shirt and gray striped tie , black shoes and dress socks charcoal ( not sure of colored socks ) Do you think that 's okay ? or should I use another color tie ? <p> We think this is a very professional-sounding outfit , Fabian . Although , in full disclosure , a black suit is n't our first recommendation for a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all you 've got . Wear it with confidence and you 'll look powerful . Anyways , if you get the job , then you can splurge on your next suit = <p> I am attending a wedding in about a month . I have chosen to wear a black suit , but I am not too sure about the colors for shirt and tie . I am darker skinned with black hair and brown eyes . Should I go for with low contrast colors ? If so , what colors do you recommend ? <p> If you go back to Black Suit Rule #1 , you 'll see that men with darker complexion/skin can pull off low or high contrast colors . Its up to you . A classic , high contrast combination is black and white . Black suit , white shirt , black tie . That look will stand out more than a look with subdued , low contrast colors ( like gray ) so it depends about how hard you want to throw your sartorial punch for this wedding . <p> Keep it classy , Chris . Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special events . That being said , opt for a white dress shirt . If you want to match your wife , you could wear a subtle , silver tie in a muted tone . On the flip side , you can continue with the black and white theme and knot up your best black tie . <p> A traveler that has a black suit for meeting purposes but going to a Ekka horse racing event asking for much need fashion knowledge how to mix it up from office wear to race wear with that hint of fashion ? Help appreciated <p> A black suit is a tough one to wear to the races where folks tend get decked out in bright colors . If its the only option , perhaps only use the pants at the races and pair them with a sharp white polo shirt and black loafers for a laid back look . <p> I 'm going for an interview tomorrow and was torn between the black suit/white shirt combo , or the all black suit/shirt combo but I am unsure if tie choice with both outfits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , Mark . Stick with a black or dark gray tie on a white shirt . All black would be going against our recommendation in Section 5 above . Plus it would be inappropriate for a job interview unless its a goth office . <p> Keep the attention on you , not your outfit , and you go ace that interview . <p> Hi there ! I am getting married this summer and the groom and groomsmen are wearing black three piece suits . A friend suggested each groomsmen have a different tie ( while maintaining the same material and color scheme ) . What are your thoughts on this ? Any suggestions on where to go ? <p> We also need to figure out how to make the groom stand out . Would a white vest and tie go or be too much ? <p> That 's a lot to chew on , Stephanie . Probably more than we should try to handle here in the comments section . So , we encourage you to speak with one of our stylists by emailing us at concierge@blacklapel.com . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the wedding party . <p> Ah if it were only that easy , Bill . Sadly , we cant give you a blanket answer . The idea of matching yourself to your clothes is all based on contrast . You feature more than one color . You may be dark skinned , but your hair has another color than your skin . Your eyes have yet another color , as do your lips . If these differences are subtle , you have a low contrast appearance . <p> Apply the same logic to your clothes . You do n't  just wear a black suit or a gray suit and nothing else ( at least we hope you do n't  ) . How much contrast should there be between your shirt and your suit , your tie and your suit , your pocket square and your suit ? If you 've got a low contrast look , you want a keep the contrast in your outfit from being too strong and overpowering you . <p> If you 're a lower contrast guy a lower contrast outfit like a blue shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher contrast guy , a higher contrast outfit like a white shirt and black gray suit will work better for you but the only way to figure this out is to look in the mirror . <p> That 's a no-go from us , Khan . You 're contrasting in all the wrong places here . If anything , a black blazer with a white shirt and blue tie would look better . Still , as we illustrated above , keep your accessories simple and remember that a white dress shirt is your best friend ( especially when wearing a black suit/blazer ) . <p> Your options are limited here , Prakhar . A black suit really only looks best with the most simple accessories , as we illustrated above . A good option is our Black Silk Knit Tie , a classic color with the texture of a modern tie . <p> Black suits serious and formal by nature . Making one look more casual is not easy but it can be done . Step one , lose the tie . Step two , wear it with a dark shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resist the urge to add a " festive " color . When it comes to black suits , people who try to make them look festive often make them look clownish . Keep the look simplified and monochromatic ( all blacks and grays ) and do n't  go overboard on the black ( see #5 above ) , remember less is more , and you 'll be home free . <p> I 'm going to prom this summer . I am ordering a black jacket , trousers and shoes but i 'm at a loss with the shirt and tie . I do n't  want to dress in black and white and i am terrible at matching colours . My favourite colours are red and purple but i 'm told that green is my colour . If the colours are a bad idea just say . I have white skin ( lightly tanned ) and dark brown ( long ) hair with a tint of red ginger . I would rather have colour than not because i do n't  tend to optionally look the same as everyone else ( i have been called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry to break it to you , Tyler , but if you do n't  want to dress in black and white , a black suit is probably not for you . As we highlighted above , black can be extremely difficult to wear with strong colors because the contrast can be quite jarring . <p> So we suggest that if you 're dead set against a white shirt , steer clear of strong colors and go with either a gray dress shirt or a pale blue dress shirt . Then a simple black tie is the smart choice . <p> Congrats on the wedding . Knowing that you chose plum as the main color , is it necessary to wear that color in shirt form ? A plum shirt is a going to create a very dark , heavy look . Whens the wedding ? For example , a lot of times you 'll see a full plum/maroon suit paired with a white shirt and black tie . This is a clean , crisp and slightly fashion-forward look , but excellent for a late fall/winter wedding . <p> Another way to incorporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket square , and/or socks ! All of these would pair well with a classic black wedding tux . <p> Our son is getting married on 2nd July so i have purchased a black 3 piece suit , black shoes . I am a large guy with greying hair , blue eyes and a more white than dark beard . What colour shirt and tie would you suggest . <p> Ah , a summer wedding in the English countryside . Sounds picture-perfect . Not to burst that bubble , but a black suit does n't  give you that many color options for your shirt and tie . Definitely keep things simple with a white dress shirt , but the tie choice is a little more complicated . You wo n't want to wear any bold , bright colored ties because thatll create too much contrast for your hair and skin coloring . We recommend very light , muted colors like pale blue or green . These are light enough to work with a black suit and also summer-appropriate . <p> Hey , im having a prom this week , and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have black shoes , black suit , black tie , and idk if i should wear black or white shirt . All young friend are telling me to go with black cus i look more powerfull , and all older friends are telling me to go with white cus of my face . What should i do ? <p> Well refer you to #5 above , Rieder . The whole black shirt , black tie , black suit thing is a little played ( exhibit A ) . Your older , wiser friends are correct . Wear the white shirt , not just because itll avoid looking like Regis hosting an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , but because its formal enough to wear to your prom . Black shirts are , by nature , casual and should be worn without a tie . At your prom , keep it classy , go with a crisp white shirt . <p> Hi ! I am getting married in June and our groomsmen are wearing black suits , white shirts , black tie and the groom , bestman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light pink pocket square look fine ? I have pink in the flowers . Thank you . <p> As we mentioned in #3 above , keeping the accessories subdued is the name of the game . The reason is that strong saturated colors can be jarring when set against a black suit . Pink , being so light , is likely to create a strong contrast that will overpower the outfit . <p> If there will be pink boutonnieres for the men in the wedding party , the rest of the outfit can be monochrome anyway , so we 'd suggest sticking with white pocket squares for a classic and classy look . <p> Thank you for the great info ! I am getting married this summer and the groomsmen and myself are all wearing black suits &amp; white shirts , and bridesmaids all have black cocktail dresses . I am thinking subtle textured black ties for the groomsmen , and to make myself stand out from groomsman , can I do a dark blue tie with small polka dots like you have as an example on your Tie Bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ? Any other ideas ? <p> The outfits sound sharp and your idea about wearing a different tie is a smart one . We would n't recommend dark blue with black . The combination on the tie bars article worked because it was a charcoal gray suit . Gray and dark blue complement each other much better than black and dark blue . <p> Instead , we 'd suggest going with a light gray tie with black dots , like this one from Bruno Piatelli . This works well with your monochromatic outfit and will set you apart from the groomsmen . Yes , a dotted tie is considered slightly more casual than a solid tie , but its also more distinguishing and more festive , which is fitting for the groom . We say go for it . <p> We kid , but like all jokes its rooted in a truth . A black suit and a dark blue tie is a weak combination because the suit and tie are an almost match . We suggest pumping up the contrast a little with a not so dark tie in gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties , let 's talk about this brown shoes and black suit thing . We encourage you to reconsider . As the first line of section four says " Wearing a black suit means wearing black shoes . " That 's a rule we very rarely break and when we do , its only with oxblood shoes , never brown . <p> As for a shirt and tie , we like keeping things monochromatic ( as in black , white and shades of gray ) . A white shirt and a solid gray tie is a forceful minimalist look . You can , of course , add patterns , if you like . How ? That 's more than we can answer in a comment reply but we wrote a whole article about how to mix patterns with confidence for just this ocassion ! Go forth and conquer , Dante . <p> If you 're going to a red carpet event , the closer you can get to a tuxedo the better . Therefore , wear your finest white dress shirt ( one like this ) and a solid black neck tie . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audacious attempts to stand out . When the fit is flawless there 's no need for pyrotechnics . <p> Hi I 'm going to a school ball and I have a black jacket with black pants , but also a dark red shirt . I 'm blond with blue eyes and fair skin , yet black jacket and pants is my only option . I was wondering what colour tie could go with the red shirt , or if I should ditch the red shirt and you could please suggest another shirt/tie combo ? Thanks <p> As we mentioned in the first section , Sam , black suits present challenges for certain guys . With fair skin , blond hair and blue eyes it sounds like you fit the profile of " certain guys " precisely . Since you do n't  have a choice about the suit , though , there is a way to pull the look off . here 's how : <p> Yes , ditch the shirt . Red and black is a devilishly difficult combination to pull off and most guys do n't  do it well . Stick with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red for a white or light gray shirt to give the whole look a cohesive monochrome vibe . But in your case , that harsh contrast between black and white will only draw attention down from your face to your clothes and away from what they should be focusing on , you . <p> Since you have blue eyes , reinforce them with a blue shirt in a similar or slightly lighter shade than your eyes . <p> Finish off the look with a tie that incorporates the blue of the shirt and your eyes as well as some black or dark gray like this one and a pocket square that also includes blue and hints of black like this one . <p> Hello . My son is wearing a nice black suit to his prom and he would like his tie to match his dates red dress . Since he s not wearing a tux , what kind of tie should he wear to look more formal ? Is a solid red more appropriate or formal than a patterned tie ? What about fabric choice ? Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of grown men who are trying to play the match game with their dates at events . We always respond by stating " you 're a man not an accessory . " The reason we say this is not just because we believe men should n't be dressed by their dates like so many toy poodles that get carried in purses , but because it leads to poor such poor choices . We firmly believe in dressing from the inside out and that means wearing the color combinations that accentuate your best features , not your dates . We usually follow that up by reminding men that their date wont be upset if he does n't  look all matchy-matchy with her but looks incredibly good . <p> Of course , that 's all advice we give grown men and its a lot for you to pass along to your impressionable young son , Maria . But what is prom but another step towards manhood ? And we say young men should start off on the right foot and learn to dress themselves well . How to do that with this outfit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a solid black tie is the most formal look you can wear with a black suit and looks great on anybody with medium to high contrast between their skin and hair . If he s got less contrast between his skin and hair , still keep it simple , just lighten the tie to a gray to help bridge the gap between the black of the suit and the white of the shirt . <p> The beauty of these simple combostheyre neutral so he wo n't get any complaints from his date about clashing with her dress . <p> Hi . I have a black suit and black shoes . I also have pale accents in my various range of shirts . Now the issue I am having is that I have a very important formal meeting in a few days . I want to show that I mean business but also want to show character and personality in my attire . I 'm light skinned and have mediocre light to dark hair . <p> My favourite colour is red but I do n't  wish to come across like hit man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white /ivory shirt with maybe deep burgundy neck tie and pocket square . <p> Or maybe you have a better suggestion . Please help . I like the look of white shirt black tie but the meeting in which I am attending requires both my formal approach as well as the ability to speak and come across a human with purpose and character . I feel the right attire can than create this sense of ease . <p> A black suit can be pretty intense . Black , with its super-formal and dour connotations can come across a little strong . So first off , well say consider going with a still dark charcoal gray or navy blue suit instead . If those are not an option , do n't  fret . Just keep things simple , like we suggested above with a white shirt and a dark , muted tie in a color like maroon or dark gray . Against black saturated colors tend to create stark contrasts that can easily overpower a light haired , fair skinned guys face . So stick with dark and somber accessories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tuxedo at my brothers wedding reception party at nightm confused bout what color shirt , necktie and pocket square to wear with my suit so that I can stand out in the party . <p> With most outfits which pieces you combine are simply a matter of preference and style , but with a tuxedo the choices are all made for you . Black tie has a specific set of parts that are customary . Check out our Black Tie 101 article to see how it all comes together . <p> Hi , I 'm a little dark complexioned guy with dark brown eyes and black hair and after 4 days I 'm having my Farewell party.So i have decided to go with a black suit and black tie and dark brown shoes , but I am unable to think about the colored shirt which I should go with ? Please help me out as I am really stuck in this messs and do n't  wan na ruin my farewell with a bad attire . <p> Sorry Shaffan , but as we said in section four above , black suit means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recipe for a fashion disaster . <p> As for the shirt , well refer you back to section three above . White shirts always work with a suit . A bright , saturated shirt color with a black suit can turn a look from classy to clownish in a second . <p> It sounds like you 're wondering if a patterned shirt and tie would be look good with a solid suit . The answer is yes . <p> Black suits are unique . We prefer them with simple , shirts and accessories and so we photographed them with solids . As we said in section three above , we like the modest look of a black suit and a white shirt but that 's just our style preference . If you like a patterned shirt and tie with your black suit we wont try to stop you from wearing it . <p> Hello , I like this guide a lot , but I have a question . I am dark/black haired with very dark brown eyes , almost black , but have a lighter complexion , not too pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my look ? Thank you in advance ! <p> We still do n't  recommend a black suit for light-skinned guys . There are so many other options out there " all different shades of blue and gray " that are going to be much more complementary to your coloring . <p> This was super helpful . But Ive run into a problem . I 'm going home for a weekend to attended my girlfriends college formal . I was originally going to wear my semi-formal dress blues but opted not too as I would 100% be the only guy there in a military uniform . I 'm a pretty fair skinned guy with brown hair and blue eyes and I realize that a black suit might just make me look even whiter But , my lady got a black dress . Should I stick with a black coat and pants and get a under shirt that yall have previously mentioned in step 1 or , should I scrap the black and go with a completely different color suit ? Remember her dress is black <p> Hey , Dustin . If you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these photos is also fair-skinned with blue eyes , his hair is probably just a little lighter than yours . So , our point being , a black suit is n't going to work with your coloring either ( why we 've " x-ed " his look on the right ) . But , his look on the left is something you should consider for yourself . A medium to light gray suit matches with a black dress and will look much better with your coloring . Check out how we 've styled this light gray suit on a model with your similar coloring to get an idea of how it would look on you . You could even rock this suit with black shoes as another way to coordinate with your lady . <p> The simple black and white look seen in section #2 above is an excellent choice for prom , Mario . Our main suggestion is just what it says there : nail the fit . The simpler the outfit the more noticable a bad fit will be so make sure its tailored to fit you flawlessly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist the urge to " jazz up " this outfit with strong colors . If you 're doing black and white , do black and white . Do n't  half-step and do black and white and then add in something silly like red socks . Keep it classy and follow through , trust us , no prom goer ever complained " my date did n't  wear enough color . " <p> We do have one suggested change you make , but it does n't  necessarily have to do with matching your girls dress . We think you should replace the black dress shirt with a white dress shirt for a more mature , classic formal look . Changing to a white dress shirt could potentially help you match better with your date if she is wearing a lighter colored dress than black . <p> Yup . See #5 above . Ease off the black , Miguel . Plus , the black shirt is casual by nature . A white shirt will dress this look up . In a little while when you hit the clubs , a black shirt without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the classic more formal look . <p> I never had problems with styling and matching suits , shirts and ties . But now I got one . I want to wear a black suit , with a navy shirt with white buttons . But I do n't  know if it is possible , because the shirt is not a regular shirt for a suit , but it is really slim fitted and you see the mussels in my arms and chest . I was thinking to wear it without a tie , and if I have to , maybe light grey or dark green . What would you recommend ? And sorry for the bad english . <p> Wearing t is shirt without a tie is a smart idea , G+khan . Dark shirts are more casual by nature and with a black suit there 's no need for a tie . Wear this look for a summer nighttime look and you wo n't miss the tie at all . <p> Hey , I have an evening ball coming up and was wondering what I could do to make my black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown hair , I was thinking of maybe wearing a white shirt and maybe a kind of green tie to match my eyes which are kind of a hazel light green . Would this work ? If not , I guess I 'll just stick with the black tie and white pocket square <p> Well encourage you to review #1 above . Judging by your description , it sounds like a black suit is going to be working against your coloring . In fact , you 're pretty much exactly who we suggested NOT wearing a black suit . Having green eyes gives you a great opportunity to really punch up your style with color . Do n't  waste that by covering 80% of yourself in black with a black suit . We recommend you choose suit colors that harmonize with your own coloring . We 'd recommend navy blue or charcoal gray instead of black for you . <p> Of course , despite all of our urgings , not every man has a navy blue or charcoal suit . If all you 've got is black what do we recommend ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tie . That 's usually our advice . But strong colored accessories with black suits tends to come off a little too jarring . A green tie that adds a pop of color to a gray suit and can make you come off a little tacky when presented with a black suit . Instead of betting big on a saturated color in your tie , subtly turn down the contrast on your outfit with a pale blue shirt and dark tie like this guy . <p> I 'm going to a business conference . I have a black suit . I have a white , light blue , and a blue and white striped LONG ... dress shirt . I have a red tie with thick dark red stripes and a blue tie with thick dark blue stripes . Lastly , I have a white pocket square and a red pocket square that matches the primary shade on my red tie . I have black leather shoes to go along . What combination of suit , dress shirt , tie , and pocket square would you reccommend . <p> Not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if the groom is wearing a red tie , then you guys ( the groomsmen ? ) probably should n't wear red ties unless the idea is to coordinate . As for shirt color , definitely go with white at a wedding . If you guys are the groomsmen , we 'd recommend you check back in with the groom so that the grooms bride-to-be can let him know what color tie to tell you guys to wear If you are n't  the groomsmen , a black suit and white shirt still does n't  lend many tie options . We recommend light gray or light blue , but not black because you would n't want any of the wedding guests to confuse with the help . <p> You 're a man , not an accessory , Mac . Women reserve the right to make the small dogs they carry around in their purses match their clothes but we think the notion that grooms must dress in lockstep with their betrothed is ludicrous . Wear what looks best on you , not what highlights her . <p> Now , would we recommend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necktie ? Nope . We believe that black tie requires wearing an actual black tie and that it should be a bow tie . There 's something about a long necktie that cheapens the look of a tux . We recommend you bend some other black tie rules but keep the bow tie . <p> So if you 're asking whether you should wear a black tuxedo or a gray tuxedo to your wedding ? That depends on your own personal style . Traditionally black tie means a black tuxedo . If you 're wondering how to pull that off , check out our story on Black Tie 101 . If you 're looking to stretch the boundaries of black tie a bit , we 've got a lot of ideas , which we highlighted in our Beyond Black Tie article . <p> To be honest , the pink shirt limits your options . The only thing we can really envision looking good is a gray tie .

We are going to a " formal " , however , the dress code is not strict and ranges from semi to formal . My wife will be wearing a full-length satin gown . I have a wide range of suits , but not a tux and I also do n't  have a waistcoat . Should I wear black with black tie or bow tie or stay with my dark navy ? Maybe I could match her red dress with a tie too ? Not sure . <p> Either a black suit or midnight navy suit would be appropriate , John . That 's why the midnight blue tuxedo is almost as old of a tradition as the black tuxedo . So we say wear the one that fits you the best . <p> As for a tie , stick with the long necktie . A dark suit and a bow tie can look like you 're trying to pass off your look for a tux . We recommend you wear a suit proudly rather than approximating a black tie look and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were not fans of couples matching their outfits , because colors and textures that look good on one of do n't  always cast the other person in the best light . Red may be her color but in most cases a red tie on a dark suit will overpower your whole look and draw everyones eyes down to your chest . Your clothes should frame your face , not draw attention away from it . Stick with an evening appropriate black or gray tie for a cohesive look . If your wife balks at the idea of you not matching her , remind her that letting her wear the red gives her the spotlight so that she can shine and everyone can be jealous of how great she looks . <p> Great article , but it sounds as though you might be leaving out those of us who like to channel our morbid sensibilities into wearing black suits with pale skin . An example of the look would be Nick Caves classic black suit with white shirt , which he wore well into his decrepitude even though he s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow who makes his living as an editor and horror writer . My spare smattering of fans fancy the visually vampiric even when ( as in my case ) the object of their affectations refuses to discuss or write about vampires .

What are your thoughts on that albino-tinged option ? <p> You bring up an excellent point . The above advice is geared toward the majority of our readers and Black Lapel customers , guys who are wearing their suits primarily to their offices and working in traditional suit-wearing fields . However , when referring to entertainers , all bets are off when it comes to personal styling . You see a much wider range of styles from the preppy-influenced style of the bebop jazz cats to the in-your-face plaids of punk . Writers have definitely gotten in on the act too , see the white suited dandy Tom Wolfe or the monochrome uniforms of screenwriter/director David O. Russell . The point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing boundaries . In those cases , the guidelines above still apply but are extremely flexible . <p> No need for confusion ! Pulling off a black suit is quite simple once you understand your pairing options are limited , which is seems like you do . You can wear either shirt you mention , but if you 're set on that maroon tie with black pattern then wear the white shirt . If you 'd rather wear your sky blue shirt , a tie that incorporates blue , black , and/or white will be a better option ! <p> Hey guys ! How you doing ? First of all congrats on the amazing job you 're making helping and giving tips to us , appreciate it , and I need some assistance My graduation from colleague is next month and I will wear a solid black suit with a little detail on it and i want to wear a black bow tie , I do n't want to look like it 's my wedding so I do n't know if I can wear a shirt other than white or i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance . I 'm brown skin , black short hair and I wear glasses , keep the good job ! ! <p> Hey there , replying to both of your comments on this post First off , thanks for your praise ! Now , down to business . There are a few ways you can avoid looking like its wedding instead of your graduation . Not wearing a white shirt is an easy fix . You should n't wear any bold colors , but switching a stark white shirt out for a light blue or gray dress shirt will look less formal . Next , if you 're looking to incorporate a vest into your black suit , see how we wear a non-matching vest with a suit . You can also think about wearing a fun pocket square or pair of socks to liven up your look . Hope this helps ! <p> We do love a waistcoat . In fact , we just published an article about the remixed three-piece suit ( in which the waistcoat is made from a different fabric than the suit ) . There you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a deep , dark red knit tie and maroon accents throughout the outfit . <p> That being said , we do n't  recommend a black suit with brighter red accessories . Strong , saturated colors can be jarring set against black . Gray , on the other hand , provides a neutral canvas that 's perfect for brighter bolder colors . <p> Hey ! This article is impressing and it served as the best one I was looking for ! I have my farewell coming up next week and I bought a black tuxedo type blazer yesterday .. I 'm planning on wearing a black pant but I 'm confused with 3 things . I 'm 6 feet tall , brown complexion ( i.e. not so dark , the typical south Indian. ) and dark black hair . I 'm neither thin nor fat . 1 ) Black shirt or white shirt ? ( You could suggest something different too. ) 2 ) Normal tie or bow tie ? And what color for what shirt ? ( I was thinking about a red colored one. ) 3 ) Is pocket square or a cummerbund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're having trouble distinguishing between what constitutes a black suit for a black tie look ( aka a tuxedo ) . If you 're wearing a suit , the above advice all applies , but it sounds like you 're putting together a black tie look . If so , there are a more rigid set of rules that you should follow . We went went through those rules in detail in our Black Tie 101 article , which we recommend you read before putting together a black tie look . <p> Black tie dress codes ( aka when you wear a tuxedo ) are a whole different thing than black suits . The above guidelines are guidelines , but when you 're wearing a tuxedo , there are more strict rules to follow . One of those rules is that you do n't  wear a long tie . Another is that your shirt be white with french cuffs . That 's just the tip of the iceberg , though . That 's why we devoted a whole article to Black Tie 101 and a whole story to how to break those rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think this article is very good . However , I do disagree with the fact that a black shirt and a black suit ca n't be worn with a tie . I have done that once before with a royal blue tie , and I think I actually pulled off the look as some others told me I look really good . I have also seen that a pink tie looks good with a black shirt . <p> White . You should have more white shirts than you know what to do with . You should stuff your closet with as many white shirts as you can afford . Why ? Because white shirts go with everything , including a " light purplish suit . " <p> As for the bow tie we would n't recommend one with such awhats the word ? unconventional suit color . You 're already edging dangerously close to " cringe-worthy " with a light purplish suit ( sorry , Mehul , were dishing out some tough love , but its still love ) , do n't  go off the deep end with any accessories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On the other hand . If you 're going to step out onto that shaky limb of the style tree that is a light purplish suit , why stop there , why not go all the way out there with a bow tie too . <p> Hmmmthats a tough one . The problem is we do n't  know that you look like or what the clothes look like . Yes , we can picture it , sort of , by your description but well never be able to truly answer the question " will I look good ? " unless we see you in the clothes . <p> One thing we do know , though . Confidence looks good . So if you 're not sure about something or feel timid about wearing it , that will show through . You 're better off walking into a room with your fly down but feeling self-assured than trying to blend in with the furniture because you 're worried that you have the " wrong " socks on . There is no wrong , Hardik . Remember that rule and you 'll be well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you need to do is scroll up . What kinds of shirts and ties do you see with check boxes next to them ?

An answer to this comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no perfect combination . If there were , we 'd charge $1 a piece for it , publish it and run off to Hawaii to sip Mai Tais on the beach . Style is not like a standardized test and we do n't  have the teachers edition . <p> This story is about how to wear the black suit so were focusing on the suit here , but if you want a set of recommendations for a shirt and tie and shoes and belt to wear with a black suit , take a closer look at the photos above . Every shirt with a check mark next to it is white . That 's because a white shirt looks good with a black suit ( and all other suits ) . And as we showed above , simple dark ties are always a good idea when you 're wearing a black suit . <p> As it says in section 4 above , black shoes are the way to go . What kind of shoe ?

If you 've never worn so much as a pocket square and then one day you walk out of the house with 20 different pieces all over you , the affect will be jarring and you 'll look like you 're just jumping on a fad . Besides , the key to pulling off a black suit is simplicity , so if you 're obsessed with white shirts and black jackets you might just be a minimalist . In which case , check out the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accidental Minimalist . <p> Hello sir Were going to advise you against wearing destroyed denim to a wedding , unless its been explicitly stated that is a super casual wedding . Even if it is , you may still want to ditch the waistcoat . That 's a lot of dark , formal layers on top in comparison to your more casual bottom half . If its not a casual wedding , the only pair of pants that would match your black suit , shirt , and waistcoat would about be black . But that 's a lot of black for your fair complexion . We think you should try a different colored suit , perhaps in a shade of gray . <p> Ive been trying to match dress shirts to my black suit , but I cant find anything suitable besides white or maybe grey . I know different seasons mean different colors . You mentioned patterned shirts above and I have considered that somewhat . So basically what color or patterned dress shirt do you recommend for occasions such as work/interviews vs weddings/graduation party ? Also I know black suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that was the only color I had at the time lol . <p> This is a problem you 're going to encounter a lot with owning a black suittheres not a lot you can do with it .

To add a little more texture to your look , you could try rocking a knit tie . Sorry , we know , this is n't very exciting , but there 's only so many ways to wear a black suit stylishly ! <p> Sorry i know you do n't  recommend all black but i read your article only now when we already purchased all black coat , vest , shirt and pants for my sons JS prom . So you mean no tie or bow tie needed sir ? Thanks so much <p> Its okay , its only his prom so hell have plenty of time to recover from this outfit <p> Jokes aside , your son should probably be wearing a tie or bow tie to his prom . Since everything else is all black , you do n't  have many options . But please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend gray , but that 's not very festive for a prom . It might be smart for him to choose a tie/bow tie in a color similar to his dates dress , but in a very dulled down version of that color . High contrast will not help his cause here ! <p> A lot . Since there 's a lot that goes with a black coat and black suit , do n't  wear a black bow tie . That would n't be very creative and you might end up looking like a waiter .

That depends on where you intend to wear the suit . If you 're going to a dressy occasion , a dress shirt is appropriate . If its a more casual affair , a T-shirt or knit can be appropriate . It all depends on where and how you want to wear it . <p> The answer to your question is sort of a mashup of sections three and five from above . As we said in section five , do n't  go overboard on black . Youve got the shirt and suit . Stop there . Do n't  put on a tie and do n't  wear a black pocket square ( nobody will see it anyway ) .

I have a dark Navy blue suit for my marriage and in confusing of wearing a dark shirt or light shirt . Please suggest whether dark brown belt &amp; shoes will go with the suit or not ? <p> A white shirt is the most formal and the perfect choice for a wedding , Kiran . A pale blue shirt would also work . Every shade darker is a step towards a more casual look which probably is n't appropriate for a wedding . <p> Dark brown shoes go well with navy blue , so you 're on the right track there . <p> Sorry , Marc , but a black suit is probably your least wearable thing you could own .

To add a touch of color without going overboard ( see section three above ) try a blue shirt and tie combination to match your eyes . <p> A black suit for evening is a fine choice . Were not big fans of the black suit and bow tie look , though . The bow tie can make it look like you wish you had a tuxedo on .

Moreover , I ca n't figure if I 'm going for bow tie or tie and of course the color of it ( white , black , burgundy ) . You can say Im going to a classy club by the way . I appriciate all comments . Thank you . <p> Since this is an evening event , a dark shirt and a black suit are appropriate . But a navy blue shirt and a black suit makes for a muddied combination . If the shirt is going to be dark , make it black or charcoal gray rather than adding a color to the mix . <p> As for the tie , we would n't suggest wearing one with a dark shirt . Dark shirts are , by nature , more casual and look best open collared . If a tie is mandatory , try a necktie instead of a bow tie . A bow tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tux . Style is not about half-steps . ( Yodas advice " Do or do not , there is no try " applies to style . ) We 'd suggest going with a black knit tie to keep the vibe a little more casual .

It sounds like some sort of George Costanza experiment where you ask us what to do and then do the opposite .

Do n't  fret over the color combination . There 's no need to perform some sort of chromatic high-wire act to make a black suit look good . Just keep it simple with a white shirt and a black or gray tie , make sure the fit is sharp and enjoy the wedding . <p> Well , Goerge , that 's a horse suit of a different color .

What do you think of A black suit with grey/dark grey waistcoat , I have a white shirt with tiny dashed line pattern , means like this - And with that a purple tie . What do you think ? If you 're ok with the waistcoat , would you recommend grey or dark grey ? And anything else I should keep in mind when getting the black suit ? And do you think a white tissue paper sticking out of upper left pocket of the suit will be a little too much ? I 'm picking the suit for my sisters wedding . <p> We were with you until you got to the purple tie , Shab . As noted above , saturated colros can create a clashing , stark contrast with a black suit making you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try a gray tie with just the slightest purple hint ( like this one ) . <p> As for the pocket square , we 've seen some pretty inventive pocket squares , but never one made of tissue paper . Were having trouble picturing it and the crinkling sound it would make every time you go in for a hug ( were assuming there will be a few hugs at the wedding ) would cheapen your whole vibe . The old standbys are old standbys for a reason . Stick with silk , cotton or linen for a white pocket square . <p> Its actually easier to pull off a black suit if you have darker skin , so youve already got one foot in the door .

I cant tell you exactly what to wear , but how you choose to wear your gray suit is up to you . <p> While we generally subscribe to the " match your ties to your eyes " philosophy , take it with a grain of salt . In the case of a black suit , as we 've noted above , monochromatic is a sure fire winner . While strong , saturated colors like red can be jarring against a black suit , grays mesh well with black suits . So we say if the tie is mostly gray with just a little bit of red , go for it . Tread lightly , though . If the tie has bold , splashy red stripes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We applaud you for starting with your skin tone , Johnson . That 's the key element that most guys miss when they put together an outfit . Its not what clothes look best together , its what clothes look best ON YOU . Bravo ! <p> In your case , well work under the assumption that you have black hair . If that 's the case , you would be considered a medium- to high-contrast skin and hair combination and you should wear medium to high contrast clothing combinations . Try a light gray shirt for a medium contrast with a black suit and a good old-fashioned crisp white shirt for a high contrast . As for ties , we almost always suggest sticking with a monochrome look when wearing a black suit . That means black ties and shades of gray . That does n't  mean boring , though . Try dialing up the texture with a black knit tie or a wool gray tie with some pattern to it . These kinds of subtle details stand out on a solid black suit and give you an overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same advice as the tie , stick with monochrome , textured choices ) and you 'll be ready for anything . <p> Nope . We believe that your tie should always be darker than your shirt . That means we never suggest wearing a white tie ever . That also means that we suggest wearing a black shirt without a tie . A black shirt with a tie is an extremely difficult look to pull off because black shirts are , by nature , casual and ties are , by nature dressy . <p> If you like black and white combos , reverse this one and go with a white shirt and black tie like in section 5 of this article . Its a surefire winner . <p> A Black Suit with a Black Dress Shirt and a different lighter colored print tie is awesome and a very powerful look .

That 's because dark blue can be a bit of a chameleon , it gets bluer when worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker when paired with white shirts and grayscale tones . <p> In your case , you can go even a shade darker and get a Midnight Blue to balance out the darkness of your hair but that 's more about your personal preference than any sort of style rule . <p> By the way , just because you have dark hair and tan skin , does n't  mean you have to stick with dark blue and dark gray suits .

That 's one of the secrets to what we call dressing from the inside out . <p> Another key to dressing from the inside out : match your ties to your eyes . If you 've got brown eyes a combination of a brown tie with a gray suit can look exceptionally strong on you . That said , you mentioned wanting to wear black leather . Combining black and brown is tough . So we say stick with deep dark colors for the tie like hunter green or a textured maroon tie . Both of these go well with either black or brown leather and a simple white shirt ( when in doubt , put on your best solid white dress shirt ) . <p> Hi , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  need tie , i have white suit , and i love to wear it with a black shirt , so i would like to ask you is it bad to wear black tie on black shirt , is it like for a funeral ? or its ok ? You can recommend me other tie colors , but please answer on that specific question is it bad ( like for funeral ) to wear black tie on black shirt with white suit ? Thanks for answer ! <p> Hold your horses there , my friend . Its not that this much black might remind people of a funeral , its just too much black to be stylish in a suit . I would n't put this much black up against a white suit , the contrast will be blinding . If you want to include black in your look , go for just a black tie ( perhaps knit ) , white dress shirt , and wear black dress shoes . That 's all the black a white suit can handle ! <p> meant wearing and not earing i 'm not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chip as in thin cut potato , although I am slim but.anyway I would like to hear your advice as another opinion is always welcome . hope english terms are understood naf=not the done thing old boy ! ; ) <p> I have fair skin and hair and was thinking of earing a black burberry suit jacket to a wedding what would you suggest to go with it ? it is not very black but still black nonetheless ! I have a pair of burberry black slim fitted trousers that are a pretty good match but not the exact tone but very close , that ok ? ? I have a nice fitted white shirt maybe a light blue tie and silk for the pocket ? ? or as a pale chp bin the lot ! ! ! ! bloody hell that was a waist of money . I thought it looked ok as I 'm not fat and it fits well ! wedding quit soon and bins go out soon so . <p> If there 's a black suit I approve of , and there are n't  many , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think its okay to wear the semi-matching trousers , your off-black ensemble will look less serious at a wedding than a stark black suit would . Since your appearance is fair , I think the light blue tie sounds like a good match , just make sure the contrast is n't too blinding ! <p> Hi , thanks for the article . I have dirty blond hair and blue eyes , and I have fair skin in the winter that gets easily tan in the summer , just to give you a sense of my features . I really would rather wear a midnight navy suit and silver tie for my sisters wedding ( its a summer evening wedding , by the way ) , but she 's making me wear a black suit and black tie . Would this wash me out or would it look good on me ? Would a peak lapel take away the " funeral " vibe of a black suit ? And lastly , would a white pocket square be good , or would a cream silk pocket square add the right , subdued splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual , small pink rose on my lapel when walking down the aisle . Thanks ! <p> Sounds like sis could use a look at this story , but she 's got enough to worry about as she gets ready for the wedding . So , assuming there 's no talking her out of a black suit , you 're on the right track with your customization ideas . A peak lapel will help to punch up the look a bit , as will a cream pocket square ( not as stark as the white so the contrast wont be quite so severe . <p> One more last ditch effort to respond to your sisters request : ask her if you can sport a black tux instead . <p> Hey , ive got the black suit jacket , pants and shoes , with white shirt but i 'm looking to spice it up a bit . my date is wearing a red dress and would like to complement that to some extent , so i was thinking a red bow tie or pocket square ? what is the best combo tie/bow tie and pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks ! <p> We much prefer the black suit with monochrome accessories , Trent . Wearing saturated colors with a black suit can create harsh contrasts that can look jarring or overpower a look . So our overall advice is to tread lightly with the red . Instead , punch up the look with pattern or textural contrast . Go with a gray tie that 's got some pattern to it , like this , or some depth to it , like this . Then you can add small touches of red like a lapel flower or a bracelet or a tie bar . <p> I am without my gray suit for an upcoming wedding and all I have is my black suit , what color pairings can I go with to brighten things up ? It is a semi-formal wedding and I would like to wear something a shade more lively than just white shirt and black tie . I have been thinking about a sky blue shirt with a salmon or navy tie ? If so , what patterns should I look for ? Additionally , what are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classic white ? Thank you ! <p> Our thoughts on brightening up a black suit with colors ? Tread very carefully . Strong colors can create harsh contrast when paired with a black suit . That 's why we often suggest going monochrome when wearing a black suit and wearing a gray tie and a white shirt and that 's what we suggest you do , Logan . <p> Remember , there are more ways to add visual interest to a look than adding colors . A tie with a pattern , like this , can really liven up a look . A solid knit tie , like this , can add texture and depth to your look . With a subtle touch you can make a black suit look more festive . <p> Hey there , Im Denom and I 'm a Sri Lankan . I 've got an evening wedding and I bought a black suit . Can you suggest me a shirt and tie color that would go along with the black suit I 've purchased . its an evening mass wedding followed by the reception . I 've got black hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits limit the amount of color you put into an outfit . The old idea that black goes with everything is n't really true when it comes to suits . A black suit often creates an overly strong contrast with colored accessories and shirts making the whole outfit come off rather loud . Our solution is to work with shades of gray . Try a simple white shirt and a black or gray tie . The gray tie does n't  need to be a boring solid . It can have a pattern , include some texture ( like a knit tie or a linen or wool tie ) and even include subtle hint of color . The idea here is to play more with pattern and texture instead of color to add visual interest . <p> You may notice a trend in our replies to the comments for this story . We almost always tell guys not to try to wear bright colors with a black suit . The contrast is usually quite jarring and saturated colors on a black suit can quickly tip the scales towards clownish . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our usual stick with monochromatic accessories , advice . That 's because of your aforementioned green eyes . With a fair complexion and green eyes and black hair you can follow our advice from Mastering Mens Fashion from the Inside Out and match your ties to your eyes . Still , we do n't  suggest going with a bright strong kelly green tie against a black suit . Keep it subdued to match the suits modest look with a pale green . <p> As for the shirt , do n't  overthink it . Get your best white out and you 're good to go . <p> Black is probably not the best option , Stephen . A black suit is more appropriate for somber formal affairs like funerals and court cases . A wedding means you 'll likely want to add some color to your look . And , as you can see from just about all of the comments above , black limits you to wearing shades of gray and white accessories . <p> That does n't  mean dark suits are off limits , though . If you do n't  have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to invest in one . These wardrobe workhorses can be cheered up with a splash of bright color for a wedding and they will still work just fine for somewhat less festive occassions ( like job interviews ) . <p> Hi going to a wedding next month have ordered a black suit with waist coat and have black shoes its an Asian wedding and I 'll be one of the only Caucasian there I 'm bald headed with swarthy ish skin . What shirt and tie should I get ? <p> Matching is all about matching the contrast from the neck up with the contrast from the neck down . That 's because we see things in contrast . Its why a zebra would stand out if surrounded by brown horses . Being bald automatically lowers the amount of contrast you have from the neck up . So you should lessen the contrast in your outfit or your suit will be the zebra and your face will be a bunch of brown horses . And nobody wants that . <p> If you had a colored suit we would advise keeping everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color family of black is gray . Play with shades of gray like a light gray shirt and dark gray or black tie and you 'll keep all eyes on you , not your choice of neckwear . <p> A black suit requires a subtle touch . We do n't  recommend wearing one with any colors in the accessories but , instead , going for the modernist monochrome look . Why ? A teal green tie is already going to scream for attention . If you wear one over an otherwise black and white outfit it will totally steamroll the rest of your outfit and draw all of the attention away from your face and towards your tie . Pair a black suit and white shirt with a gray tie and the whole thing comes together nicely . <p> Hey , I have my prom on Friday and my date insists on wearing black and gold . I was thinking of wearing a black suit over a black shirt and a slim gold tie . What do you think ? I have black hair , and I have a tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the type of pocket square and the shade of gold would help too , thanks and its this coming Friday and I want to look really epic . <p> Do n't  do it Francis ! A black shirt and a tie is a big no-no in our book . Stylish men always wear shirts that are lighter than their ties . In the case of a black shirt that 's impossible . So you 're left with a black tie and looking like Regis Philbin on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , or no tie ( which is n't an option for a formal event ) . <p> As you 'll see in numerous comments above , we recommend sticking with a monochrome look when you 've got on a black suit . Any colored shirt just creates a jarring contrast . That means a white shirt , or close shades like ivory or light gray . Your safest bet that 's guaranteed to be stylish , Francis , is a white shirt . Do n't  just take our word for it , though . Take a look at some stylish men . Prom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a look at the best dressed men at this years Oscars ( as ranked by GQ ) and you wo n't find anything but white shirts . Nuff said . <p> White . The thing about a black suit is its pretty limiting in terms of shirt colors . The stark contrast created by any colored shirt is usually pretty jarring . So , generally speaking , we recommend monochrome accents when you wear a black suit . That means white , ivory and gray shirts . In your case , with a medium complexion , a white shirt will do the trick . Do n't  overcomplicate it . Simple is the name of the game when you wear black . <p> Hey , got an evening/night event coming up ( formal wear ) . I 'm kinda limited to a plain black suit and I was thinking a slim burgundy shirt . White on black looks pretty meh on me . Do you think burgundy would work well and if so could you recommend a tie ? Thanks <p> ( Slim build , brown/v.dark blonde , not pale-skinned but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call that shade ) <p> Hey there , I 'm thinking a burgundy shirt is too dark to pair with a black suit . If white and black is too high of a contrast for your skin/hair coloring , you could try this Ivory Herringbone Shirt to mute the contrast . The color of this shirt gives you just as many tie pairing options as a white shirt would , so if you still wanted to incorporate burgundy in your look you could wear a burgundy tie ! Food for thought . <p> Wearing sneakers with a suit can look pretty boss and pulling this off at your graduation will give the whole " Yes , I 'm a grown-up but still a kid at heart " vibe . White and black sneakers are totally fine to wear with your black suit . You do you , my friend . <p> I have a graduation in a few days time ! I already have my black suit and a white shirt . I have a very dark black skin so I was contemplating on what tie to wear . Should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tie ? Thank you ! <p> Down to the wire ! Just kidding , I have a few ideas . In terms of your skin tone , wearing your solid charcoal black tie will keep the black and white contrast continuous . However graduations are a celebratory event , so I would encourage you to wear your polka dot red tie to spice things up . Have some fun with it ! <p> Hi , I 'm wearing Black suit for my sisters wedding and I 'm confused with what colour shirt should be wearing and the tie . The theme is red and gold and white . I 'm srilankan and brown skin tone . What would you suggest for my shirt and tie ? <p> I think a white shirt will look best with your black suit its a classic look that 's perfect for a wedding . The gold tie is going to complement your skin tone the best , and you 'll still fit into the wedding theme . You 're welcome in advance <p> my wife and I are going to a 30th birthday party which will be on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Deal ? Okay , so were on the honor system now and well answer your questions . <p> Since you 're wearing a black suit , were going to assume it is an evening affair . In that case , we suggest you stay close to eveningwear tradition and go with a sharp white shirt ( we like this luxurious feeling herringbone shirt for dressy summer affairs and simple black or dark gray tie . It sounds like a simple outfit . That 's because it is . So is a tuxedo . In menswear , when in doubt , simplify . <p> As for whether your wife should match your colors , we say no .

The red pocket square accent color will definitely stand out against all of the black and white , but that 's sort of the point , right ? We are n't  much for the couples matching thing but this is a case where it sounds like you 're going to pull it off with style . We approve . <p> Yes , Miguel , a black suit does n't  exactly say " I 'm here to party ! " Still , itll work because prom is at night and black is much more appropriate for an after dark event than , say , a midday party .

I would like your suggestion on a good tie and pocket square color combination that would make me look age appropriate yet " with it " . Most of the other guests will be younger and some are professional athletes . <p> A black suit and white shirt is as close as you can get to a formal black tie look without wearing a tuxedo .

Your fashion license will be revoked immediately ! <p> Just kidding , yes , you can wear a patterned shirt with a plain tie .

My fiancee is wearing a magenta colored Indian dress.Could you please suggest the color and style of tuxedo/suit I should be wearing . <p> If you 're going to wear a tuxedo , a black one is the traditional choice and one that would work well with your black hair . If you want to wear a suit , black can work , since you 've got black hair , but its not your only choice .

Pairing it with a light blue tie like you 're describing will make the tie appear neon and draw all of the attention away from your face . <p> Our advice on how to wear a black suit is above , but if that 's not enough , you can always talk to a Black Lapel stylist for some one-on-one advice by emailing us at concierge@blacklapel.com . <p> Tip #3 above applies to the shirt and tie too , Jujin . A black suit is a modest look . Do n't  mess around with the look by adding all sorts of colors and patterns .

Is this acceptable ? <p> It 's only acceptable if you want to pigeonhole yourself right into the high school skater boy stereotype . We say do n't do it . Just because your lady friend is wearing a white dress does n't mean you have to wear a white tie . You could go with a more mature look and opt for a black tie , or add a pop of color that will match the flowers and corsage you get her ( hint : do n't  forget the corsage , Alexander ) . <p> I 'm gon na go to graduation , and i 'm so confused to choose the colour of the tie , i have black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from indonesia , can you solve my problem about what colour i 'm gon na wear in my tie ?

Since it 's spring , a light blue tie seems fitting for the season and for your skin tone . Other light , springy colors will work as well . No need to go crazy with prints and patterns . A solid tie will work just fine . <p> I would like to know if it would be ok to wear a black jacket ( two buttons ) , a white shirt ( with black buttons ) , and a pair of grey pants LONG ... something like those ) , black belt and shoes , with a grey slim tie at a wedding , or maybe a red or black bow tie ?

Sounds like you 're not very confident about stepping onto this particularly thin branch of the style tree . Your fears are well-founded , Tom . Navy shoes with a black suit would be a strange look to say the least . <p> If you were to reverse it , however , and wear black shoes with a navy blue suit , that can be pretty cool . We know the style dogma you 've heard out there of late has been brown shoes , brown shoes and more brown shoes , but were falling back in love with our black shoes at Black Lapel . Are they always appropriate ? No , but with a navy blue suit and a simple shirt and tie combo , they can create a rather impressive look . <p> Since you have a darker complexion , a black suit is easier to pull off than it is for a lighter skinned guy . You also have more options when it comes to shirt and tie combinations . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a white shirt and solid gray tie for a seriously stylish monochromatic look . The trick to wearing black is keeping it simple . <p> Black tie attire ( which includes tuxedos ) comes with its own set of rules , Naved . We 've covered the basics in our Black Tie 101 story . Of course , if you want to bend those rules , you can . We show you how in the Beyond Black Tie story we published a little while back . Between those two stories , you 'll find all the guidance you need to pull off a killer black tie look . <p> If you look at the last graphic we provided you with in the story , you 'll see that a black shirt is n't your best move . The maroon tie will look good with your black suit and skin tone , but opt for much lighter shirt color . P.S. , ca n't go wrong with white . <p> A black shirt with a black suit can work , but heed our advice above about not going overboard on the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item in your outfit ought to be your socks , and that 's only if you wear a full black suit . ( If the pants are n't  black go with socks that match your pants , not your shirt and jacket ) . <p> Not if you can avoid it , Thato . The lapel question aside , a blazer is a little informal for a funeral . We suggest a suit . Black is the funeral choice , but a charcoal blue works as well . If there 's one event you want to tone down your style for , this is it . <p> That said , we 've been to some funerals for some pretty dapper guys . Knowing that they would have appreciated us adding a little bit of tasteful flair to our outfits we dropped in just the faintest touch of an accent ( like a tie bar ) . But only do things like that if you know it wo n't offend the grieving family . And do n't  do anything even remotely approaching showing off . <p> Funny you should mention this Angel . Well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coming months . <p> Larger and more muscular men do have problems when trying to shop for slim-fit off-the-rack suits . That 's the beauty of clothing that 's made to your precise measurements . Because a Black Lapel slim fit is slim in proportion to you , not a mannequin , bigger guys do n't  have to try to squeeze in to some designers vision of " slim " to get a suit that fits . <p> A black shirt is , by nature , less formal . We do n't  recommend wearing them with ties . So , no , we would n't wear this to a funeral . Its kind of a statement look and the last place you need to be " making a statement " is at a funeral . <p> Save black shirt for when you want to go out and have a good time at night . For a daytime funeral , pay your respects in a simple white shirt and black suit , Jon . <p> Loved the information , especially since I just purchased my first all black suit with vest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five essentials in mind . <p> Have one quick question though . How about bow ties , smart looking in correct color and texture ? Have been seeing them pop up a bit more and was wondering if more of a fad or always appropriate where ties are . This being the case , what kind of man and look can pull this off ? Thanks . <p> Getting back to the topic of this story , the one time we do n't  recommend a bow tie is when you 're wearing a black suit . It starts to look like a half-assed tuxedo . Better to go all the way and get yourself a tux , than to wear a bow tie with a black suit . <p> Nice call on all points , especially the last one . Ca n't be rollin around all monochromatic like Regis Philbin . I think black suits are only for certain and specific occassions . I do not consider black a good color for an office ( work or professional setting ) and I do not prefer black dress shirts , even for going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the write-ups and guides . I truly appreciate the insight and hard-work ! <p> There 's something about black that keeps guys coming back to it , and perhaps overusing it .

I have n't worn dress shoes before because really I 'm a girl but I really like to dress formally like a guy . And I have a question about the polish , the only colored polish my father has is a brown kiwi polish would that be okay for some good pair of donated black dress shoes ? Because I 've read in the comment if I wanted to lighten my shoes I can always go for a lighter color , but I want it to stay the same as possible . Any ideas ? Thank you <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never use brown polish on black shoes . This can ruin the shoes and it will make it extremely difficult ( and costly ) to restore them . <p> In general the color of a shoe is the color of a shoe . A black shoe ca n't be made brown and a brown shoe ca n't be made black . You can affect the shade of a shoes color , but that only works in one direction . You 'll only make a brown shoe darker , not lighter . <p> Playing around with polishes , you can strategically darken up a pair of shoes , but do n't  experiment with this kind of thing until you 've got a full grasp of the basics . Get yourself some black polish for those donated black shoes and follow the steps above regularly . <p> The rule of thumb for shade shifting ( lightening or darkening a shoe ) is one shade at a time . You 'll never brown a black shoe , you might lighten it a bit , but you 'll probably end up with a sloppy mess . with Brown shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color , by playing with your polishes I tend to use two polishes every time I shine my shoes , I use a cream first ( for color ) , then I finish with a wax polish ( to shine ) I have a pair of shoes that were labelled as cognac when I bought them , but were darker/redder than what you would traditionally call cognac . By using a lighter cream polish , and finishing with a light brown wax polish , over a couple of months ( shining my shoes once a week-ish ) , I was able to lighten the shoes to the color I was seeking with them . But I definitely agree the only polish that should touch black shoes is black polish . And if they are second hand shoes , the best thing you can do for the first shine is to get them done professionally by a reputable shop . That should help recondition the leather a bit more than most amateurs can do on their own . After that , its fairly easy to maintain at home with minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it better ourselves ! The cream , then wax method , when done properly , yields a great looking shoe .

Sounds like you 've got the skills to pay the bills , Adam . <p> We know this problem from experience . Our solution , separate brushes for different colors . One brush for blacks and another for browns . You do n't  have to go overboard if you have a few different shades of brown . Different shades of brown can mix without them bleeding over from one shoe shining to the next . <p> Insider Tip : If you want to play around with a more advanced technique . Use your brush that you have designated for black shining on the toes of lighter brown shoes . The resulting hint of black that comes from the residual wax polish will give you that burnished look that makes brown shoes with dark shoes look fly . <p> I really like the method and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides leave out the conditioning step , which is one of the most important for shoes to last , and some go as far as saying that the way conditions the leather ) . Typically I use both a cream and a wax polish . After cleaning and conditioning my shoes , I start with a layer of cream polish applied by brush , and then once that dries than use a rag and start with the wax polish , followed by a bit more wax polish with a drop or two of water . Then I finish it with some solid brushing and a quick buff with a chamois <p> I find the whole routine pretty zen , and tend to do my brogues twice a week at the end of the day before leaving the office ( when its quieter and I 'm less likely to offend people in neighbouring offices with the smell ) . Its a great way to book end the days ( Start the day with a wet shave and end the day with a shoe shine ) . The one tool I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've looked a few on-line and am half thinking of building one myself one weekend if I 've got the time ) . <p> Ahhhh , you 've taken it to the next level , Adam . We are big fans of the cream + wax polish method that you use . Since the drying time can make it a bit more of a commitment than most guys want to make , we did n't  put the cream polish step into this story , but it really is the best way to get your shoes to both gleam with shine and bring out their color . <p> As for the meditative aspects of shining a pair of shoes , we could n't agree more . Many a story you see on this website began as a kernel of an idea during a particularly good shoe shining session . <p> Great article , especially with the heel and sole , it is a must . So if I have a shoe that already has polish on it , but I want to get down to the leather to apply the conditioner how would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service and did n't  cross over to the darkside and buy patent leather oxfords cause I like the natural leather polished look . I never considered conditioner until reading this article . <p> Personally , I recommend shining every night prior to wearing them . Brushing to polish a scuff or two out and adding heel and toe for a quick run does the job if you are the every day kind of fanatic like the military had me do . I agree that it is soothing , especially after a long day of work . <p> We love to hear about another guy out there who appreciates some serious shoe bling , Jeremy . Polishing everyday is not fanatical , just dapper ! <p> For most shoes you 'll be fine applying the conditioner to a brushed shoe . If you 've got a lot of polish built up on the shoes and its caking you 'll have to remove the old polish to get a great shine . To do that you can get a shoe cleaning / re-conditioning service from a cobbler like The Leather Spa or you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag ( though just be careful not to rub it in too hard or you could damage the leather ) . Either way , starting a conditioner regimen is a great way to extend the life of your shoes . <p> so did you use a darker polish than the original color of the leather ? I know some like to do this . I have all allen edmonds and just get the matching polish from them that applies mess free .. except black i like kiwi to use on my blacks . <p> You 're right , we did darken up these shoes a bit . You 're taking the smart route , getting your polish from the same people who made the shoes . To keep light shoes light , some guys even go with a polish that 's a shade lighter than the shoes just to be on the safe side . <p> Good points ! And speaking of protecting your hands , if you use your fingers and a cloth to apply polish the polish will get on your hands and under your fingernails ( not a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shining fingers ( usually the index and second finger on your dominant hand ) in Saran Wrap before applying the polish . That little barrier saves you a lot of time you would spend scrubbing your hands after a shine . <p> If you want to keep the distressed look but still want to keep them in good shape , use the same technique you would apply to your other shoes . Be sure to apply only a small amount of neutral polish and brush the shoes just enough to work the polish in to the leather . This will help you keep the distressed shading and yield a low gloss shine that 's appropriate for the aged look of the shoe . <p> So I just followed these steps and my shoes did n't  come out as expected . They were used only once and after polishing they came out duller than the original shine : S. The black tint they had is gone too , I still have an unpolished shoe to compare to and noticed these differences . Should I be using black shoe polish to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polish ? For the drop of water I just dipped my finger in a bowl of water and let a droplet drip on before applying the polish . Maybe I was n't brushing hard enough I do n't  know but it feels like a downgrade . <p> You do n't  need a ton of polish . Too much can come out dull if you do n't  brush them enough . In general , the brushing is crucial . You cant really over-brush after you 've applied a bit of polish . Your water technique sounds good . Much like the polish , a little bit of water goes a long way . To get more shine after brushing you can buff the shoe by rubbing a very slightly moistened rag back and forth across the toe and top of the shoe pulling down in a sawing motion . <p> As for the black tint , do you mean burnishing on the toe and heel or are the shoes black . If the shoes are all black , yes , use black polish . If theyve just got a hint of black in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then just a bit of black to the toe and heel . <p> I have a pretty bad scuff mark on the toe of a pair of brown Aldo shoes that I have . I scratched them against the sand grip on a stair so badly that it actually peeled the top layer of the shoe off . How would you recommend restoring it so that it at least blends into the rest of the shoe ? <p> We always try to remember that leather is skin so we treat it similarly to our own . Minor scrapes can be taken care of at home , but if your leather has a deeper abrasion , it could be more serious and its time to see a doctor . We 'd suggest taking them to a cobbler who can help you restore that spot , or at least mask it . <p> For the future our first bit of , rather obvious , advice is " watch your step " but our second bit of advice is to remember that shoes are most vulnerable to scuffs when they 're brand new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do when you get a new pair of shoes is to polish them . <p> The shoes are Bostonian Collier , a decent budget-conscious dress shoe and , yes , they look good ( especially when you keep them polished ! ) . <p> As for saddle soap , it really is a soap so its for cleaning a really dirty shoe . Still , its definitely not a part of a regular shining routine and its not going to give your shoes the same moisturizing nutrients that a leather conditioner will . Is it good to have some around ? Sure , but its not a necessity . <p> Note : We have updated this story with new photos . The ones Chris was asking about were the Bostonians but the shoes we shined in the current photos are a pair of Allen-Edmonds Strands and they 're spectacular . <p> Ive read guides elsewhere that said using shoe wax is the work of the devil , and that one should use shoe cream instead . What 's your take on this subject ? I do still have a tin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream a while back . It does give me a shine much quicker than the wax . <p> Also , you guys would n't happen to have an article about oxford-sexy boots , would you ? I 'm in the market for a pair right now . Cheers <p> There are definitely wax haters out there . Cream is a great way to really bring the color back to your shoes and we use cream polish ( followed by wax polish ) for shining our shoes every so often . Cream polish can be a little harder to find , while wax polish is available at almost every corner drug store , but if you 've got some cream around , we say go for it . Shine on , Alex . <p> As for oxford boots , we do n't  have a post about them , but we know that Allen Edmonds makes a good variety of boots worth checking out . <p> Good eye , Jordan . We did darken them up a little bit . The truth is , this was a working photo shoot ( you 'll see those shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them more of the cognac look . <p> We started with the basics of shining for this post but maybe well follow up this one with a post on adjusting hues with polish . <p> If you 're lucky enough ( or un-lucky depending on your point of view ) to do some travel , take 15 minutes at the airport and have a shoe shine . You can find some very skilled " shoe techs " who clean , polish , detail for around $8 . JFK , DFW , DEN , and IAD are all excellent in my opinion . DEN probably takes the cake if you have the time , they will strip the old polish and fireshine ( yes with a TSA approved butane torch ) your black shoes .

Our fave for this kind of service is Union Station Shoe Shine in Washington DC , a must for any gent whether he s a DC local or just stopping by to testify before Congress on how to dress better ( were looking at you , Paul , " Dad Pants " Ryan ) . <p> From a very young age my mother made us get on our hands and knees every night pull out the polishing kit and a newspaper and clean our shoes for school the next morning .

Fortunately , there are plenty of ways , regardless of your sweating propensities , to go sockless while staying fresh . <p> Here 's how you can keep your feet and shoes as fresh as the look itself : - <p> 1. - Use foot powders like Gold Bond Medicated Foot Powder .

Isnt that just for special occasions ? " That 's what we thought . When we asked sommelier Peter Weltman , which wine guys underestimate , he told us most guys are sleeping on Champagne as an everyday drinking wine . We 're certainly guilty of that . So we asked him to expand . What follows is a Champagne guide that got us to popping the cork a little more regularly . <p> Peter Weltman has poured world-class wines at world-class restaurants including : The Modern at the Museum of Modern Art , Eleven Madison Park and NoMad Restaurants in New York City . He is a graduate of the prestigious Culinary Institute of America and is a Certified Sommelier through The Court of Master Sommeliers . In short , he really knows his stuff.It 's time to rethink Champagne , from what type you drink to when you drink it . Champagne is not a cast-off bubbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . Do n't be stymied by thinking that its a girly drink . Champagne deserves its place among the wine elite . It 's time to liberate this sparkling wine from hindering stereotypes . If you 're feeling clueless about how to get started , just follow this simple Champagne guide . <h> Champagne Guide <p> To start , let me answer the question few want to ask but not all know the answer to : What is Champagne ? Champagne is wine that comes from an area 90 miles northeast of Paris . No wine should be called , labeled or otherwise referred to as Champagne unless it comes from here . It is made from three grapes : chardonnay , pinot noir and , to a lesser extent , pinot meunier . Often times , they are blended together . Though , some bottles may be blanc de blancs ( white of whites ) , which is made from 100% chardonnay . Others are labeled as blanc de noirs ( white of blacks ) , and these are white Champagnes made from the regions two black ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinot Noir Grapes <h> When to Drink Champagne <p> As a sommelier , when I mention that Champagne need n't be relegated to a toast , my guest 's eyes light up with the same surprise and desire as a child who has been offered chocolate for dinner . Champagne is racy enough to start a meal and pique the palate , yet complex and dexterous enough to pair with the widest range of cuisine . Do n't like sweet wine ? Why not enliven your palate with this beautiful bubbly after a long meal ? <h> How Sweet It Is n't <p> Champagne is not a sweet beverage . Most bottles you see are labeled as Brut , which does mean that there is some sugar added to the bottle . But , it should only act as a seasoning to add complexity to the drink . However , many smaller producers are bottling their Champagne as Extra Brut , and thus not adding any amount of sugar . These Champagnes are very expressive and complex . In fact , they even start to remind of great Burgundy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the spotlight , there is a whole world of smaller producers waiting to be discovered . This quieter side of Champagne is every bit as luxurious as the more boastful brands , but heck , I still love the classics , too . And though by nature Champagnes start at a higher price , there is plenty of value and discovery left in the land of bubbles . <p> This pinot noir Champagne is muscular and complex . Boasting the driest designation , it tastes of mineral and is very savory . Drink this through the course of a meal , perhaps eschewing flutes for traditional all purpose white glasses . <p> This small producer makes Champagne from all three grape varietals and most uniquely , from entirely estate-owned fruit . Richness is achieved from full malo-lactic fermentation . However , the precision of red fruit flavor makes this Champagne . <h> How to Open a Bottle of Champagne With a Deadly Weapon <p> There is no other wine that you can open with a saber . Check out how it happens in this super-slow motion video . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champagne with a saber , dagger or any type of knife is potentially dangerous.Cover your bottle holding hand with a towel .

Do this outdoors pointing the bottle away from people , animals , cars and houses . <p> After sufficiently chilling a bottle of Champagne submerged in ice for 30 minutes or longer , dry it off with a towel . ( A warm bottle will have too much pressure inside and may explode . Seriously , take precaution ) <p> Entirely remove the top foil . With your thumb firmly pressed on the cork , loosen the cage and refasten it above the bottle 's lip . <p> Next , find the bottle 's seam , which runs the entire length of the glass . <p> Make sure this is facing up and the cork is held out away from your body . <p> Naturally , make sure you have open space ahead .

And if you 're knotting up , reach for something a little laid back like a knit or cotton tie , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your shirt collar unbuttoned with a loosened up tie knot to let people know you 've switched from work mode to play mode . <p> Go Vest + Jeans- If you 're pairing your vest with some jeans , you want to go for a dark wash with no fancy fades , major whiskering , holes or bagginess . Make sure the denim is a slimmer fit , so its consistent with your vest . With the right pair of jeans , you can achieve a smart casual look and avoid a jarring juxtaposition between dressy and casual . You never want to look business on top and over-relaxed on the bottom . <p> And please do n't  attempt to pull off some 3-piece hybrid- like this , which will make you look like you lost your pants and had to borrow some jeans from your dad . <p> As for the vest itself , make sure it fits snug , with the length long enough that the sides reach to your belt line . And remember to leave that last vest button unbuttoned . <p> So give your vest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some versatility to your outfit . Mix and match , get creative and see what you can come up with ! <p> Got any questions or outfit suggestions on wearing a vest casually ? Leave a comment below ! - <p> Hi ! I wanted to wear a navy blue vest that I own with a pair of blue jeans , a white shirt and some brown shoes ( ? ) I was wondering if that would be a good match . Also the vest has a metallic piece on the back to " adjust " it because it is a real suit vest , would that be alright while wearing it casually ? <p> The vest and jean combo is perfect for the casual look , be careful matching the colors though . We 're going to suggest that your jean is a dark blue , which will help keep your vest the main attraction . It 's good to note that even our custom made vests include a closure piece on the back , because why would anyone want to shop in the store when they can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing it smart . <p> Sounds good to us ! Just make sure it 's a dark blue jean . There 's a style risk involved when your vest and pants match , especially when you 're looking to go for a casual look . Also , the white dress shirt is the ideal look to go for , it helps your vest standout the most , and it also leaves room for a standout tie if you choose to incorporate one . However we would say ditch the tie , roll up those sleeves and complete your cool look with a brown oxford shoe . <p> I 'm trying to piece together an outfit for an audition . I normally dress casual , but am thinking of dressing it up a bit with a vest . Pink button down , sleeves rolled , with a light gray vest , dark/light jeans ( ? ) , possibly white tie with white shoes ( ? ) . <p> We were with you until you go to the white tie ( white ties are not OK with us ) and white shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bit ? ) . Stick with brown shoes and , if you do go with a tie , go with a more laid-back version like a navy knit tie for a dress up , but not really , look . <p> Hi , i have a problem . I have a vest that 's charcoal on the front but the back is light/sky blue bemberg ( or something similar , its shiny. ) is this still ok to wear without jacket as casual(ish) look ? I pair it with white shirt , sleeves rolled up . Thanks for good read . <p> Definitely . Its a little hard to tell in the photo here , but the featured gray vest has black Bemberg on its back . This is common for vests , but Black Lapel does offer the option to match the back with the front fabric on our custom vestsor the Bemberg inner lining . <p> What kind of leather jacket ? A biker jacket is a leather jacket , so is a suede duster . Neither of these sounds like the kind of thing you 'd wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomber jacket might work , though you run the risk of looking like an AmericanPresident visiting the troops . <p> Where are you planning to wear this outfit ? If you 're thinking of cruising into your office with two-thirds of a three-piece suit on , draped in a heavy leather jacket , we 'd advise against it . If , however , you 're going to the bar with a pair of jeans , an oxford shirt and a vest and you want to throw on a leather jacket to shield you from the cold , you 're cleared for takeoff . <p> I am looking for a personal smart-casual signature outfit to display a mix of competence and approachability . I think that white shirt ( knitted tie or none depending on the occasion ) , vest and chino would be an appropriate decision . The problem : I am carrying 5-10 kg more than I probably should but want to look good nonetheless . What I like : Light brown shoes , navy chinos and rolled up shirt sleeves . The question : Do you have any suggestions or hints regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Well start with this : what color combinations and patterns you wear should be determined by what you look like , Phil . We call it dressing from the inside out and we recommend reading this article laying out the basics when building your wardrobe . Knowing what looks good on you is the key to dressing well . <p> You did mention carrying a little extra weight . Its a common problem . If you 've got the look for it , which you can now figure out because you know how to dress from the inside out , then go with darker colors like navy or charcoal gray . While a brighter colored vest might call attention to your midsection , dark colors can slim your appearance . <p> I am taking my Wife , daughter and her fiancee on a cruise in September to the Caribbean . I want to wear something other than a sports coat and slacks . I would like to wear a vest and a bow tie with some casual slacks for the dressier dinners . I am completely lost as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe some slim cut slacks and a white button down fitted shirt ? What would you do ? <p> This sounds like a decent problem to have First off , we just want to say kudos to you for wanting your clothes to fit properly . A man after our own heart . Also , you 're on the right track with a white button down shirt and itll look especially good with a fresh tan . A white shirt will also match with a variety of different colored slacks . In fact , it may be smart to bring more than one white button down shirt . As for slacks , a pair of navy and khaki/tan are a solid base that should get you through most occasions on your cruise . Enjoy the vaca , Jeff . <p> Your thinking is on the right track here . As for what to match the tie color to , we think you should decide between matching to your denim or your shoes . If you choose to match to your denim , a plain or patterned tie will work equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pink polka dots " its a little more fun , but still smart casual . If you are n't  a polka dot guy , you can stick to stripes . If you decide you want to match your tie to your brown shoes instead , we also have a tie for that . In this color family , we think you should stick to a solid colored tie . Just to throw in one last wildcard , what about this maroon tie ? <p> I am getting married soon and was wondering if a vest would look good . I am wearing a dark blue shirt with a light green bow tie and gray pants . The wedding is super laid back but I want to look good for my bride .

Your dark blue shirt is a little limiting ( we usually recommend a white shirt under a vest ) , but you do have a few options . Are you gray pants dress pants or chinos ? If they 're dress pants , we recommend choosing a vest in the same gray color . If your gray pants are more chino-like , you could wear a more casual vest , like this one , to smooth the transition between your shirt and pants . Be careful not to start adding too many colors to your look since you have a green bow tie . You do n't  want your outfit to end up looking messy . Congrats and good luck on the big day ! <p> Even a Black Lapel custom made vest includes a closure in the back to adjust the fit to your taste , Erica . We do n't  shop in stores much ( why would we when we make everything custom for ourselves ? ) but wed be skeptical of any vest that did n't  offer any adjustment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could always take your vest to your tailor and have them remove it . <p> I just stumbled upon this site and I must say I am impressed . I 'm getting married in June and was wondering if dark jeans would go with a white button down shirt topped off with a black/ charcoal vest . We were originally going to go with a khaki type colored vest but the color combinatios just did n't  look right to me . Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ! ! ! <p> Imagine the vests you 've considered on a spectrum from lightest ( khaki ) to darkest ( black/charcoal ) . The khaki wo n't work because its so light it can blend in with a white shirt . With dark pants and such a light top you cut yourself in half visually with this kind of look . On the other end of the spectrum , a black/charcoal vest does n't  provide enouch contrast with dark denim and you start to look like you 're wearing overalls . The answer is to choose a fabric that is in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the picture at the top of this article is a perfect middle ground between too light and too dark . In fact , the photo at the top is pretty much exactly what you 're planning to wear ( dark jeans and a white shirt ) , so weve pretty much done the work for you by helping you to see how the whole outfit looks together in that photo . Pretty nice , huh ? <p> I am getting married in Ireland in September . I purchased an irish brown tweed vest ( waistcoat ) with a brown satin back , an off-white/vanilla dress shirt and brown slacks . The brown slacks are more of a bark brown which blends nicely with the front of the tweed vest but the brown satin back of the vest is a more red brown . He will not be wearing a jacket . Does this matter ? I am unaware of rules regarding vest back and pant color . <p> Fear not , Amanda , there are n't  any rules to worry about in this situation . The colors you described in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same family . That makes clashing nearly impossible . Unlike him , you can have a look at him in his wedding outfit before the big day . So we recommend you have him put it all on and take a look . If anything stands out or looks off , you 'll see it then , but we doubt that will happen . <p> Loved your suggestions they are very helpful . I am getting married in August ordered vests on line for the groom and groomsmen they are more of a kakhi color then a brown . ( Not exactly what we wanted but the sale was final ) . I am having a hard time figuring out what color of dress pant to go with our now Kakhi vests . It is a very smart casual wedding . <p> Smart casual , very cool wedding dress code . Speaking of smart , how about medium to dark blue dress pants ? A pair like these , with hints of green , would be easy to pair with a lighter khaki colored vest . We would n't recommend a brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from your smart casual appeal . <p> I have to dress up for court next week and I want to appear confident but not arrogant , cool but not " hey look at me " and I definitely loathe going in too formal or stuffy . So I ordered a coral haze micro stripe slim fit dress shirt with slim fit charcoal slacks and a 2 ? burgundy polka dot tie . I 'm wondering will this complete the look or should I go with a light gray pima cotton sweater vest ? I 'm open to any suggestions on the color of the sweater vest <p> Court calls for conservative power suits . Like this subtle gray pinstripe suit or the classic navy blue suit " an appropriate staple suit that should never be confused for being stuffy . Incorporating coral and burgundy already pushes the boundaries of court-appropriate attire slightly , so we encourage you to wear a full suit instead of a sweater vest . You could wear the sweater vest if this is your signature cool factor , but then you 'll definitely want to wear a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest , we suggest you wear a matching charcoal gray jacket with your charcoal slacks . Now go do justice by these suggestions ! <p> The vest and shirt combo is good , but it is a heavy look . Since those colors are dark , I would stick with the simple rule of contrast when choosing a tie . A light gray , textured tie ( wool , knit ) would be a great addition to this look . <p> Any non-collared shirt under a vest can look a little odd , Jack . Art Carney did it all the time on The Honeymooners but just like you should n't trust everything you hear on TV , you should n't wear everything you see on TV . Were not fans of this look . <p> We have seen the turtleneck and vest done well by a more modern screen star , but that was a dressier look overall . The three-piece suit with a turtleneck can be really suave . Just avoid adding a gold chain or you 'll end up on the next Lonely Island album . <p> I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal blue shirt if I should wear grey pants or black pants ? The shirt is solid . I was n't sure if it looks okay with three different colors . Its for a work function . <p> Before we get into pants , some advice about the shirt : Beware the dark shirt and vest combination . There wont be enough contrast between the shirt and vest and the whole look will come off muddled . You 're better off with a pale blue or white shirt and a charcoal gray vest . <p> As for the pants , gray is more vesatile than black ( you can wear black or brown shoes with gray pants ) , so we usually veer towards gray . Plus , black can be very jarring against bright colors , but with gray pants you can wear a wider range of colors . <p> Glad we could help , now go out there and show your co-workers what 's what . <p> Hi there !

This is what I 'm picturing . <p> We are hosting a 50th wedding anniversary party for my in-laws . Cocktail attire was requested , but its the first Saturday in August in the South . My husband was thinking about a vest outfit . He has a great pair of medium grey slacks and I was wondering what color of vest . Was thinking of dressing it up with a pocket square . Ideas ? His build is quite athletic , but recently he has been in some weddings and I love the way a vest flatters his body type . Suggestions greatly appreciated ! ! <p> Before we go into any outfit suggestions let 's first address the cocktail attire issue . If you 're the host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dress code ? Right . If so , we do n't  recommend calling for cocktail attire . Cocktail attire means full suits for men . It would be poor form for the host to set a dress code and then underdress . If there 's still time , we recommend changing the dress code to something like " semi-casual " to give guests a sense of the kind of outfits you expect them to wear . If its too late and guests are planning on cocktail attire , then your husbands going to have to bite the bullet and wear a suit and tie . <p> If you do go with a more casual look and wants a vest to wear with a pair of gray pants , the color choices are pretty much wide open .

Im sold on dark jeans but I prefer a more relaxed fit . Is that suitable to wear with a vest or would the look be thrown off due to the vest fitting far more snugly than the jeans ?

We usually field questions from men , so our you 'll have to take that into account when reading our advice . That said , women have been wearing menswear stylishly since Diane Keaton made everyone fall in love with Annie Hall back in 1977 . Diane Keaton continues to raid mens closets with fantastic results and style icons like the unbelievably sexy Sarah Ann Murray have kept the tradition going . But enough about the women who wear them , let 's talk clothes they wear <p> Vests work well for a lot of people but when advising men we generally tell shorter , thicker guys to beware the barrel/robot look that a vest can give you . However , for a woman , that 's a little bit less of an issue since you 've got natural curves that men do n't  have . So proceed , but proceed with caution . As for color combinations , a gray vest is an easy outfit starter . One thing we would change , though , is the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our book .

Also , yay or nay on a black slim tie <p> The tie decision is not one we can make for you , David . We will offer this advice , though : make a decision to wear it confidently or do n't  wear it .

You can wear the same outfit featured above with a light blue shirt if you do n't  want to wear white . The rest can stay the same , or you could even add something to tie the light blue and dark blue of the shirt and jeans together , like a knit tie with dark and light blue stripes , if you want to dress the look up a bit . All of this still adds up to a simply stylish look for any casual occasion . <p> That sounds really good . Are there any other colors you could recommend for the shirt ?

Can I wear a medium blue shirt with grey vest ? If so what color slacks should I wear ? Or do you have another combination that would work best ? Any help would be great , Thanks . <p> A light blue shirt will stand in for white just fine with a gray vest . <p> As for pants , it sounds like you 're fully stocked in the gray department , so the pairing should focus more on the interplay between the vest and the pants than the vest and the shirt . Try to differentiate between the pants and vest by choosing the light gray pants if the vest is dark or dark gray if the vest is light . A little variation on the gray theme will go a long way . Finally , with all but the black pants you can add some brown shoes to this look to keep things interesting and add a little color to this outfit . <p> You would know the answer to that better than we do .

Too many guys focus all of their attention on getting their clothes to match and do n't  think about how the clothing color works with the wearer . As we discussed in our piece about building the ultimate suit , your skin and hair color are the most important things when it comes to deciding on clothing colors . <p> All that being said , a middle of the road blue is neutral enough to work with almost any complexion and always pairs nicely with browns and tans . So , even though we have n't had a look at you , well advise you to go with a blue shirt like this . <p> No need to get all matchy-matchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looking like the wait staff at a catered affair .

Then you can go masquerading as a stylish gent everywhere you go . <p> I was thinking of being more-so on the casual side of things . I have a lot of button-up plaid-ish type style shirts that are popular and are also okay to wear at my workplace . I would love to add in a vest/dark jeans/plaid combo to add a nice dress touch to my wardrobe . So I was thinking of getting a dark gray/black vest and pairing it with the plaid shirts that have accents of either black or gray in them . <p> First thing that comes to mind is a dark purple/black plaid shirt with a black vest and dark jeans . <p> I cant really decide if this combo would actually look good , since I have never been good with styling myself . Second opinion ? <p> The combination of plaid shirts and vests is a great way to go , Mike . Black is a tougher color to wear than most guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Black can be unforgiving when set against fairer skin and can highlight flaws on anyones skin . <p> That 's why gray and navy blue vests are a much safer , and more versatile , choice . Unlike a black vest , you can wear them with either brown or black shoes and they harmonize with many more pairs of jeans/chinos . Even those plaid shirts with some black in them will look good with neutral gray or navy . <p> All of this does n't  mean the black vest is useless . Rather , it should be used with caution . But hey , why not have a few vests , one in each color ? As you can see from all the comments above , a lot of guys ( us included ) cant get enough of them . <p> Sorry to be the bearers of bad news , Nathan , but this outfit has " huge flop " written all over it . To start , a black button-front shirt is one of the hardest shirts to wear with a tie . Wear it with a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wear it with any colored or patterned tie and it looks like you were trying to dress up a casual shirt . Why ? Because a black button front really is a casual shirt . That 's why we recommend you do not wear it with a tie . <p> As for the vest , a white vest is a non-starter . Wearing a vest that is lighter than the shirt underneath it is a tough style challenge ( it can be done , but the degree of difficulty is high ) . A white vest makes pairing pretty much impossible . <p> No need to go off the menu , for this look , though Nathan . Stick with a white shirt and a neutral vest color ( like gray ) and follow the guidance above and you 'll be looking fly . <p> I 'm in need of help ! ! I have a soccer presentation coming up . Its a semi formal occasion . All I have at the moment is a light grey vest . What colour shirt , pants and shoes would look good ? ? Thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things to so many people its virtually meaningless . Since you 're asking this question in response to a story about wearing a vest casually , were assuming that you 're going for a pretty casual look . <p> Play it safe and wear a pair of charcoal slacks , a crisp white shirt and a black knit tie for a tie that is still pretty laid back and looks great with a vest . <p> My son will be wearing a medium gray herringbone wool vest with jeans for his Senior Yearbook pictures . We were thinking of dark jeans , light blue shirt with a maroon tie , wearing the same beige shoes as shown above . Do you approve , or do you think it is too much ? He really likes the vest and tie combo and I have no fashion sense on how to make it work for this occasion . To be honest , I have no fashion sense at all ( hanging my head in shame ) . I would appreciate and suggestions . Thank you ! <p> 1 . Thank you for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black to match the buttons on the vest . 2 . I am in my best friends wedding party , though I 'm the officiant of the ceremony and have no counterpart for pictures ( also the reason I have some leeway ) 3 . The happy couple is a female couple . <p> Glad we could help , Jake . The new information does n't  change our recommendations much . Since you will be the only man up there , you will likely stand out regardless of what you wear . And the brides gave you a classic shades of blue + shades of brown palette to work with . With that in mind , we suggest only minimally tweaking the original idea . It sounds like you prefer shades of black to shades of brown so you can swap those colors and stay somewhat close to what the brides intended . here 's how it breaks down ( with links to relevant Compass stories ) : <p> Light blue shirt ( though we would n't suggest wearing the white contrasting collar and cuffs shirt since that 's an uber-formal look that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My vest/dress query is for a wedding , obviously not a " casual " event though the dress code is less formal than most . " No jacket or tie , a powder blue shirt ( pattern ok ) , a camel/light brown vest with navy blue trouser . " <p> I 've gotten the Ok and have deviated a bit and I was wanting feedback on my decisions . This is what I 'm feeling , am i crazy ? Grey(dark) tweed vest over a powder blue shirt with white collar/cuff/placket , camel trousers , and I was thinking some white bucks with some blue on blue socks ? Any suggestions ? Does this sound rediculous ? <p> First off , are you a member of the wedding party , Jake ? If so , you may have gotten the OK to deviate but having the right to do something , does n't  mean you should do it . If everyone else in the wedding party is wearing the powder blue shirt with a light brown vest and navy blue trousers , you should wear that as well . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groom , not the third guy from the left in all of the wedding photos . <p> Now , if you are not a member of the wedding party you do have a lot more leeway . Still , going completely " off the menu " if you will , is not recommended . As a guest you should be able to wear a gray vest instead of a brown one and no one will have any complaints . You may even be able to get away with khaki pants ( though if you 're going to stray from the requested navy blue you might be better off sticking with dark pants in a color like charcoal gray or even black ) , but the shoes should not be white bucks . For one , Labor Day was last week . While we do n't  strictly adhere to the " no white after Labor Day " rule , white bucks are about as mid-summery as dress shoes get . But fashion faux-pas aside , white bucks will put a lot of attention on you . Let the bride and groom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicks ( brown or black ) . <p> I 'm a college student , just got a nice vest , and want to try wearing it around casually . The vest in question is light grey with a plaid patterning and black buttons . <p> Since I 'm going for the more casual look , I was thinking I could pair it with a t-shirt or a polo . What sorts of colors/patterns do you think would work best for this ? Also do you have any opinions on whether it should be buttoned or unbuttoned ? <p> Adding a vest to your wardrobe is a smart move , Akshay . ( Good to see you 're learning something at college ! ) <p> Like many young guys it sounds like you 're a little nervous about looking too " dressed up . " Do n't  be . A vest and a T-shirt has a distinctly Ed Norton-ish look ( not the gifted actor from such classic movies as Fight Club , but the garbage man neighbor from the old Honeymooners show pictured here ) . Most guys are trying not to stand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest and what does it do ? It makes you stand out for all the wrong reasons . <p> I have a ( for lack of better words ) high-class cigar bar hop planned with a few friends and this is just the style I was looking for . I was thinking dark wash denim , black vest , red button down with the sleeves up , and a loose charcoal patterned tie . Thoughts ? <p> This outfit sounds pretty straightforward ( that 's a good thing ) . Our only concern would be looking a little devilish with a black vest and a red shirt . If the red is subdued ( like this ) it can work . <p> The safer bet , though , for an evening out , would be to go with a dark red that creates less contrast with the vest . If the red is the shade of a red wine you might end up drinking with some of those high class cigars , then you 're on the right track . <p> Im having a party this Thursday and I was thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ross florham ( do n't  know if that makes a diffrence ) . I do n't  wan na look too dressy and was planning on wearing it with a white button shirt , dark washed slim fit denim jeans , but I 'm not sure what type of shoes . I was thinking of wearing my nike converses , but if you have a better suggestion I 'm all ears . <p> On the whole this sounds like an outfit that will work . Sneakers and a vest is a pretty young look , though , Trae . Judging by the Thursday night party plans , this is probably not a concern . <p> If you do want to go with a more grown-up look , but do n't  want the whole outfit to turn too formal , try a pair of brogue shoes with a slightly chunky sole for a casual , yet mature pair of shoes for this outfit . <p> I have a have white dress shirt with light blue lines running horizontal and dark blue lines running vertical . I got a bowtie that has a squared design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am also wearing brown slacks . My question is would a grey vest go well or would a blue vest work better ? <p> Blue will provide the most harmony with the blue in the shirt , so that would be our first choice . <p> The gray would work too , but only if it is as light or lighter than the slacks . A really dark charcoal gray vest with khaki pants would clash , but a gray vest like this one with medium or chocolate brown pair of pants would do the trick . <p> I recently picked up a black vest that I plan to pair with white dress shirts and ties . My question is about the pants . I plan to wear jeans occasionally , but I will also need to wear dress pants some too . I have three pair that will go well with the vest . One pair is dark charcoal grey with a subtle pinstripe . The second pair is a bit lighter color grey with no stripes , and the last pair is a standard grey with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right on top of it . <p> Will they all work , and which would look best ? I 'm wearing this to take someone dancing . I will have a black belt with silver buckle , black shoes , and planning to wear a dark red and black squares tie with subtle white dots on it . I have n't really worn vests before and was mainly nervous about mixing a pinstripe with a solid black vest . <p> Were no fans of pinstripe separates . A pinstripe suit all coordinates , but start wearing the pieces separately and our favorite part of the pinstripe ( sleek lines from head to toe ) breaks down . Plus , we would n't wear businesslike office styles like pinstripes ( separates or as a suit ) for a night of dancing . <p> Other than that , our main bit of advice when wearing a vest with dress slacks is to avoid a belt . With jeans wearing a belt may be inevitable , but your tailored pants ought to fit you well enough to go without a belt . Why ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your vests open . What 's worse , belt buckles draw attention to the problem because they 're metal and contrast with the fabric around them . <p> If you do need a little help holding your pants up under the vest you can go to a tailor for two solutions : <p> get the waist taken in so that your pants stay at your waist naturally , or <p> add suspender buttons to the insides of your pants so that you may wear suspenders under a vest ( what we do when we wear three piece suits around Black Lapel ) <p> Sounds like a lot going on , in this outfit , Dread . Two different seersucker types will likely look mismatched . Of these two well take the pants . Were not too sure what kind of shirt you 're talking about ( button front ? T-shirt ? ) but the dark shirt with a white item on top like a white tie on a dark dress shirt , can make you look like you 're wearing a 30s gangster Halloween costume . The whole outfit sounds a little forced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white button-front shirt and rolling up the sleeves . <p> The good news is , there 's no need to try to buy a pair of matching pants for your vest . The bad news is , unless you bought the vest as a separate from a suit , the chances of matching it up exactly are slim to none and nobodys going to be fooled by a vest that 's " almost " the same as the pants you 're wearing . In fact , wearing two items that are close but not the same just draws peoples attention to the fact that they do n't  match and will make you look like a rube . <p> here 's a better strategy : <p> Be sure that formal is n't that formal . If you think itll be a room full of guys in suits , beware of under-dressing . Do n't  show up in a vest or you 'll look like you 're catering the party , not attending it . <p> For pants try light , khaki chinos . <p> For shirts , a simple white shirt is an easy option , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair with pink or lavender shirts . <p> For casual looks , go with a darker wash denim for easy pairings and try a white oxford shirt or T-shirt for un-fussy Saturday style . <p> I have a light vest and my 8th grade graduation is this monday so I wanted to know if I could wear a dark-gray-ish skinny jeans-but not too tight , with a dusk blue shirt and I want to know what tie color I should wear and if my black loafers would look good with skinny jeans and the dusk blue shirt . <p> Also , I want to know if I should wear the dusk blue shirt or if I should change it , and if I do , what tie color should I buy ? <p> This sounds like a strong outfit for stepping up to the next level on your educational journey . <p> For a tie , we would suggest going with a solid black knit tie . Knit ties are great for a more casual style like you 're planning to wear and great for spring . <p> For the shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how your skin and hair look against the blue of the shirt ) . If you try it on and it does n't  look quite right , take the safe bet and wear a crisp white shirt instead . <p> The comments on this page are amazing , hoping you can help me in a similar fashion . I love the casual vest look but just bought some darker tan slacks for the first time and I 'm at a loss as to colours for vests and shoes . First look that came to mind was maybe a royal blue button down , white tie , black vest , white belt , tan slacks , black shoes . Too many colours ? Black shoes with tan slacks , is that even allowed ? Help ! <p> Using the dark tan slacks as your starting point we recommend going with brown shoes . Earth tones on your legs means you should avoid black shoes ( they 're better paired with black , gray and navy slacks ) . For a shirt and tie , keep things simple with a white or light blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( we love solid navy knits but for this situation ) . <p> Now on to the reason why were all here : the vest . The same rule of thumb that applies to the shoes applies to the vest color . Look for a vest in another earth tone , like a lighter or darker tan than your pants . Or , if you 're looking to add some color to the look , you could wear a vest in just about any color ( tan is neutral so you do n't  have to worry too much about the colors clashing ) . Just avoid bold , highly saturated colors like royal and stick with more muted color options . <p> With these guidelines in mind you 'll be able make many an outfit work with those tan slacks . <p> I 'm trying to put something together to attend a casual wedding . I have a light grey vest that I 'd like to wear with a blue gingham shirt and purple tie . I 'd like something dressier than jeans . What color trousers would go ? Can I wear another grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray , just try a different shade of gray than the light vest . With the purple and blue up top you probably should n't add another color to this outfit , but you could go with navy for the slacks as well . <p> As for shoes , with either gray or navy slacks , you 've got your choice of brown or black shoes . Stick with classics like brogues or , if the weather will be warm and dry , loafers . Any of our five essentials of the dress shoe wardrobe ought to do the trick . <p> Going to my school graduation next week , would black suit pants a white shirt with a light grey collar and a darker waistcoat be ok ? Most people are just wearing shirt and tie but i do n't  like that look : / <p> I 'm attending a wedding and I was planning on wearing my dark grey suit pants , light pink button down , black belt , black dress shoes and a black tie . When I bought my dark grey suit I did n't  get a vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do you think ? <p> The " odd waistcoat " ( a vest that does n't  match the suit ) can be pretty sharp . Black and pink can be an awkward combination , so we 'd suggest either going all the way monochrome and changing the shirt to a white shirt for a fully B&amp;W look , or ditching the vest . <p> Of course , that 's all built around your starting point of a gray suit , but if you want our ultimate advice , check out the Royal Wedding story we just published . <p> Judging by the leather laces , it sounds like you 're talking about some boat shoes . Boat shoes with dark jeans and a worsted wool vest would be a little awkward . We 'd suggest going with a pair of loafers for a somewhat casual , yet still dressy enough for the vest look . And when you do this , follow the rule of thumb and match the belt to your shoe color . <p> I wanted an outfit to wear when I go out with friends to the bar or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt with the black vest and navy blue jeans with dark grey Edmour lace-up shoes . How do you think this would fit ? I 'm trying to look for a standard casual look for when I go out . <p> On the surface it sounds like a pretty straightforward plan . A white shirt and a black vest is a really high contrast look , be sure you 've got enough contrast in your face/hair to stand up to this look . This is a good look for a medium to dark skin tone and darker hair ( pictured here . If you 're on the pale side and have light hair , try lightening up with a mid-gray vest like this , Billy . <p> I 'm going clubbing and want a vest but I 'm on a budget , I have dark jeans and was thinking Chelsea boots ? And should I wear a long sleeve white shirt with this ? I 'm quite skinny and do n't  want it to be baggy . Also what should a casual vest look like from behind as I can only find ones with a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well ? Sorry for the bombardment of questions I 've only been once . <p> 1 . The dark jeans and Chelsea boots ought to work out fine , though , if you plan to hit the dance floor hard , just be careful not to step on any toes . 2 . A long sleeve white dress shirt will work . You 're right about not getting it too baggy . Its tough getting a shirt that does n't  fit like a tent when you buy off the rack . You know where they sell shirts actually fit , do n't  you ? Not to drop names but there 's a company whose name rhymes with " smack the bell . " 3 . Vests are generally made with fabric fronts and lined backs . You can find fabric back ones , but they 're rare ( starting to sound like a broken record here , but you can special request a fabric back when you order a vest from the same guys who run this site ) . 4 . Were not on board with the short sleeve choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By nature it looks a little weird with short sleeves ( like shorts and winter boots ) . <p> Need your input for a nice but casual outfit for this weekend in Atlantic City for the club . I have a grey vest that I want to pair with a black v-neck underneath and my dress watch . Would love a suggestion on style and color of jeans and shoes that would compliment this . thanks ! these tips have been awesome <p> With the black shirt and a gray vest , we 'd suggest keeping things dark below the waist . A dark wash blue , or even black , is the way to go here . Go middle of the road here , not painted on skinny but do n't  go loose and baggy either . A standard or slim fit is in order here . <p> As for shoes , black is the way to go if you 're doing a black V-neck . If you want to keep things casual but do n't  want to go with athletic shoes , try some loafers like these from Cole Haan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for those . If that 's the case , just be sure to keep the kicks black . <p> Have fun and do n't  do anything we would n't do . In other words , do whatever you want ! <p> Were down with a little fade in the jeans in the right context . We suggest dark wash for pairing with a Black Lapel vest because our vests are a bit dressier than , say , a cotton vest . So in our context a dressier pair of jeans is more appropriate . If the vest in question is more casual , then the jeans can be too , Andrew . <p> Note : Were interpreting a little bit here , but well assume you meant " gray " pants not " great " pants . You should always wear great pants . And now on to our answer <p> As Ray Charles would say , night time is the right time ( for black vests and jackets ) . The black jacket and vest could work here . Once , for a photo shoot , we needed a photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was wearing our gray glen plaid pants , slipped on a black jacket and bow tie over a white shirt . The look came off really well . We say go for it , Matthew . <p> Black jeans and brown moccasins , you say ? Sorry , but we cant go down that road with you . Black shoes are the only way wed go here . Swap out those mocs with some black shoes ( loafers or monk straps would do the trick ) and a black belt and you 're all set for the evenings debauchery . <p> I 'm going to a wedding this weekend and want to be more casual than a suit because it is an outdoor wedding . I 'm thinking of wearing a black vest , but did not know if grey pants would be better or go with black pants to match the vest . I 'm wearing a white dress shirt with a bow tie and black dress shoes . Would this outfit work ? Thanks ! <p> If the goal is to move more towards casual , then we recommend moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants with a black bow tie will make you look like you 're either one of the caterers or you just took off the jacket of an uber-formal three-piece black suit . Neither of those scenarios adds up to a casual look . Instead , go with the gray slacks , the vest , and a more casual knit tie , like a black dotted knit . With these tweaks this outfit will keep things casual and stylish . <p> Does this style work for most body types ? I am broad shouldered and slightly on the heavier side . I really like this look . I want to dress better but Its hard for me to find something that I can casually wear but still look good in . <p> This style does work for a lot of body types . For a bigger guy , we 'd suggest going with a lower contrast version of the look . Rather than pairing a white shirt and dark vest , try a light blue shirt with a navy vest . This will take the emphasis off of your midsection . Fit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to cover your waist . If your shirt is peeking out at the bottom of the vest , that will draw attention to your stomach . Finally , avoid a belt with the vest for the same reason . With those adjustments , you can add this look to your casual repertoire . <p> Need some help please ! My wedding is just a few weeks away and we still do not have the grooms and groomsmen attire . We have looked at several options and browsed lots of styles , in-store and online . We have settled on a more casual look including dress pants , white button up shirt , and tie for groomsmen but want to add a vest to grooms attire . Im stuck on colors and what will look best . So my question is do we do a lighter color vest with darker pants , same color , or darker vest , lighter pants ? We were looking at black slacks with a medium toned gray vest OR khaki pants with a gray vest . Please help : ) <p> If only we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your groom and groomsmen decked out in some custom threads ! Alas , we wo n't bother recommending any of our own vests but , instead , well offer up a picture we really like as an example : <p> Sabir M. Peele , of Mens Style Pro , loves his vests . Here he is rocking an outfit that straddles the line between dressy and casual quite well . The color combination of darker brown pants , shoes and tie with the lighter blue shirt and mid-blue vest is a classic . Plus , he nails the details like the stubby tie clip and the brown trim on the pocket square ( do n't  forget the pocket square ) . <p> Alternatively , you could go with a lighter version of this outfit by choosing caramel/khaki color for the slacks and vests , going with a mid-brown tie and light brown shoes plus a white shirt . <p> Be sure that vest is matte . Avoid shiny gold fabric and opt for a more subtle way to express your black and gold pride . <p> Swap out the black shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem . On their own you 're good to go , but we 'd never wear one with a vest . Part of the charm of the black shirt is the " blackout " effect you create up top . Breaking up your upper half into body and arms with such a high contrast shirt &amp; vest combo destroys the blackout effect . <p> The strong pattern of the tie and colors of both the shirt and tie would need to be balanced out by a pretty understated lower half . Try khaki chinos with brown brogues , like the ones we recommended here and a matching brown belt for a classic look . <p> With a silk tie you could dress this look up a bit below the belt with light gray wool slacks . In that case , brown or black shoes with a matching belt would be appropriate , just stick with more casual styling like loafers to avoid looking like you just forgot the of your suit . <p> Sorry to have some dumb questions , its just that i 'm farely new at this and well i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I was also curiouse about one of your replies , are glossy or shiny long sleeve shirts under vests bad ? <p> We would avoid shiny or glossy shirts under vests or even without vests . We would just avoid shiny or glossy shirts . The matte look of 100% cotton shirts is more our style . There are still many different types of cotton shirts , from twills to oxfords to chambrays . All of these are suitable for wearing under a vest and on their own . <p> By cloth , do you mean cotton or linen ? If that 's the case , yes , these are a good option for warmer weather vests . They look especially good for spring in neutral colors like khaki/tan or mid-gray with white shirts . <p> Match the texture of the tie a well . We love knit ties with vests for a bit of texture . Cotton ties are another good seasonal option for spring . <p> Do you think a dark blue vest match with a white button down shirt , a dark blue jean with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a light brown sneakers ? And also do you think this outfit is suitable when I want to go out with my friends at the mall ? <p> The outfit sounds good , Aizad . The only thing we might edit are the shoes . Balance out a wool vest and jeans with a more rugged shoe like these boots in the colder months or desert boots like these when its warmer . <p> As for appropriateness , we have n't cruised the mall in a while , but with this outfit you 'll likely be the best-dressed guy in the place . <p> I am 23 and I just bought a black vest which has dark grey back to it . Can I wear this vest over a crisp white shirt , with dark wash jeans , black and black shoes ? I 'm going for a casual look , but still want to look presentable . Also , I have a black skinny tie but should I go out and buy a knit tie instead ? Thanks ! <p> That sounds like a good look , Nick . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoes . Black is the way to go here , but black shoes tend to look pretty formal . If the goal here is presentable+casual stick with black shoes with more casual styling like monk straps or loafers ( see our piece on building your shoe wardrobe for more on these styles ) . <p> As for the tie , we would suggest going with a textured tie . This can be , but is n't limited to , a knit . You could also wear a cotton tie , like this one from J.Crew , or even linen , like this one from The Tie Bar , that are just what the doctor ordered for your spring look . <p> Thanks for the quick reply ! Does the tie have to be black or can it be another color ? I am a fan of lace-ups , are there potentially a style of lace-ups on the more casual side that I could wear with this outfit ? <p> The tie does n't  have to be black . Actually , the cotton and linen ones we linked to both feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great addition to your wardrobe in general , but you can go with just about color you like for the knit tie option . And do n't  sleep on the patterned knits either . <p> As for the lace-ups , there are a lot of ways to go more casual with them . Brogues are generally more casual than smooth leather . We also love shoes with contrasting soles for a more casual touch . The main thing is to avoid the cap-toe oxfords that look great with a suit but look a little too dressy with jeans or casual chinos . <p> Family pics coming up with siblings and spouses . Everyone ( sibling and spouse/kids ) is doing their own causal look with each group selecting a color thatll accent their family . Anyway , I 'm thinking of something to throw together thatll look classy but causal . Something along the lines as this Q&amp;A ( vest ) . Any suggestions on color of vest , undershirt , and type/color of shoes Ive read most of the Q&amp;A on this page but figured I 'd let ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family that takes their photography seriously , Jesse . Its clear why you would want to nail your look . All of the guidelines about fit above apply . As for color , we love medium gray vests . Theyre neutral so they play nicely with lots of other colors so you can really get a lot of use out of them . A white shirt is a fail-safe , but if you want to go with a color , try a light blue like this twill or this light blue oxford . <p> As for the shoes , we could write a whole story on the types and colors of shoes every man should have in his wardrobe . Oh wait , we already did ! Even though its called How to Build Your Dress Shoe Wardrobe many of the shoes we highlighted there , like the brown brogues , the monk straps and the loafers , would work very well for a more casual look like the one you 're going for . If we had to pick just one pair of the shoes we mentioned in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be the Charles Tyrwhitt brown brogues . <p> One final note : if you really want to class up the casual look , slip a pocket square into the vest that brings out the color of your shirt ( like this one for a light blue shirt ) . <p> Youve come to the right place Zak ! Depending on the venue for the birthday ( let 's say just about anything but a fancy restaurant ) , your outfit sounds like itll look fresh . That said , there are definitely several colors in between kelly green and black and we fully encourage you to explore the full spectrum . A note on the shoes , going dressier is always a classy move but coordinating other accessories with the shoes is important as well . Said kelly green tie may not work so well with a pair of dark brown wingtips. = <p> Richard , were happy to inform you that your desired outfit is BL approved . Start with a tie and you can loosen the knot and roll up your sleeves for a bit of sprezz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket square and stay stylish ! <p> This is a good , laid-back look . We would caution you on one thing : While matching your belt color to your shoes color is smart , we would avoid the belt if possible . Under a vest belts create a bulge around the buckle that can look a little awkward . If you need another way to hold the pants up , you can try one of our secret tricks and wear suspenders under the vest . No one will see them but they you wo n't run the risk of a belt-induced muffin top . <p> We can do some special customizations on your vest that might work . Please contact our concierge team at concierge@gmail.com for some one-on-one advice . <p> If you are a plain-clothes law enforcement officer or agent of a three-lettered federal agency ( FBI , CIA , ATF , DEA , etc. ) you would n't be the first one who has come to us with " special " needs that we needed to accommodate when making a garment ! <p> i 'm just curious , I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be t-shirts , polos , or button up ) say like navy or forest green with khaki pants . I like the idea of being able to accessorize the outfit with a vest and just curious on what color to really go with for the vest <p> Before we get to color let 's talk texture . This outfit begs for a textured tie . A sturdier fabric will stand up nicely to the ruggedness of the jeans and boots down below and wont look like a mismatch . <p> As for the color , avoid black , since you 'll be wearing brown shoes . Instead try neutrals like navy or medium gray . If you really want to have some fun with it , try Mr. Cord with a gray pattern on the front that will stand out and you can let the brown in the back of the tie peek out to perfectly accent the brown boots . Bonus points , this tie is great for suiting up with a charcoal suit as well . <p> I 've always wanted to pull off the whole casual vest look , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . I have a black slim fitted vest that I want to use and a multitude of t-shirts and quite a few button ups . I have the feeling that I am not getting the right colors as I have a tendency to go with darker reds , blues and purples ( havent found a pink that works with my olive complexion ) . Any suggestions ? <p> I would appreciate any advice , and am more than willing to send pictures of specific outfits on request . <p> Its the black vest , Dude . The old adage about black going with everything is a half-truth . Try it with darker reds , blues and purples and the whole look turns dark and dour . Alas , you can still make the vest work , you just have to boost the contrast with lighter colors like light blue and white shirts . Also , a black knit tie and a crisply folded pocket square can go a long way toward making this outfit come off better . <p> The other thing to consider is how this vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all about how to make the vest the centerpiece of your look , you can drop in the vest under a light gray suit or under a gray blazer of a different textures ( i.e. tweed ) for a little added dimension to more dressed up look . <p> If you 'd like more specific advice , go ahead and send some pics to the Black Lapel concierge team at concierge@blacklapel.com . <p> I actually went with the light blue button down , which worked really well ( got a lot of positive attention ) with a pair of dark jeans and a nice pair of black " casual-dress " shoes . I dig the idea of a pocket square , and will have to make a point out of picking a few up soon . <p> Good afternoon , I was hoping for some advice . I have a wool charcoal pin stripe vest , dark wash slim fit jeans , lavender shirt and a tie that works with the shirt . I was wondering if I could wear a dark brown suede jacket with this combo ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you nix the jacket , I have a charcoal double breasted overcoat , or a dark grey biker style jacket I could use . <p> The biker jacket is intriguing , Matt . Of all of the choices , this sounds the most unexpected and we like a little unexpectedness in our pairings ( like this puffer vest with a suit ) . <p> This is not to say you could n't make the dark brown suede jacket work , depending on what kind of jacket you 're referring to . A suede bomber ? Sure . A suede duster ? Not so much . We would also steer clear of the double-breasted overcoat , which sounds too formal for this look . Regardless of the top layer , a pair of loafers or monk straps , like the ones we highlighted here , ought to do the trick with a pair of jeans . <p> Going to a more casual dance and really need a casual vest outfit . I 'm a very well fit guy . The bulky build , about 57 ? , and 148lbs . I want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual . Can you help me with an outfit idea ? ? I am younger and can pull a lot of stuff . <p> To get attention without overdoing it , stay away from busy patterns , but nail the details . Pair the above with a freshly laundered white shirt and a solid , non-silk ( you said you wanted it to be pretty casual ) tie that echoes the color of the pants and ( like this ) . Top it all off with a tipped pocket square and you 've got an understated but stylish vest outfit . <p> If you 're referring to a golden-hued khaki then we would n't recommend offsetting it with a black shirt and black shoes . The richness of caramel khaki works better with white or a color , like light blue or pink for the shirt and rich brown for the shoe . Its also difficult to give a denim recommendation without seeing the vest , but we generally err on the side of darker wash indigo shaded jeans . <p> We like jeans for this look . There 's something about denim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe its the fact that its old ( like California Gold Rush era old ) that makes it so cool . Whatever the case , denim is a classic pairing with this look . Why stray from what 's worked for all these years . <p> Black goes with everything , so instead of giving you matches , well give you a list of things NOT to wear with a black vest : <p> Brown shoes ( even though the shoes are far from the vest on your body , black and brown will still clash ) <p> Very dark shirts ( this look is workable , but creating a little contrast between the shirt and the vest keeps your overall look from being muddled ) . <p> Short sleeve shirts ( sorry Micky , but unless you 're going for the Ed Norton from The Honeymooners look , stick to collared long-sleeve shirts under a vest . If you want to cool off , just roll up the sleeves ) . <p> I just purchased a gray herringbone vest with an ink blue shirt and I was wondering if I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If not , could I get a few combinations that would work well . Thanks <p> There are very few times when a skinny black tie wont work . That said , if the shirt is too dark it could the black tie and gray vest could make for a generally dull look . You could boost the contrast by wearing a light blue shirt ( like this one ) or by pairing with a lighter tie like that still ties in the gray from the vest ( like this one from Everett or this plaid one from Armstrong &amp; Wilson ) . <p> Yes , you CAN , wear a black short sleeve shirt under a white vest . You CANT get in a time machine and go to the 1991 Junior Prom at a Miami high school . If you could do the latter , the former would be the perfect outfit otherwise , steer clear . <p> Should the vest be all one color ? I wanted to wear a light gray ( front ) green ( back ) vest with a black dress shirt and darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rocker look too . And I 'm not entirely sure how that would look , should I just get a all one color vest to go with it ? <p> Black Lapel vests come with fabric on the front and Bemberg lining on the back . You can choose another lining color , though , for the back to get the desired effect and , upon special request , you can even get a vest that is fabric on both the front and back . <p> In your case , Kieth , we suggest something like our Cool Gray four-button with Sky Blue lining on the back for that casual , rocker look . <p> Congratulations , Andrew , youve already begun . The vest and shirt above are both available from Black Lapel . You can rock this look in a number of settings , but when it comes to pants , we suggest you pair the vest/shirt combo with a pair of less formal slacks ( like the Brownstone , Solid Tan , and Gray ) . If you are opting for a more casual look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am going to my GFs holiday party and was wanting to surprise her by dressing very stylish and wearing a vest . She will be wearing a grey sweater dress from Inc. , black leggings and black boots . I am planning to wear a pair of black Banana Republic slacks , Marc Anthony slim textured white shirt . I am trying to decide what color vest to buy and what color tie to wear as well . Any suggestions as I 'd like to look good for her . Thank you . <p> A black and white , shirt and pants outfit leaves the door pretty wide open , Pete . The varsity move , is to keep things neutral neutral with a Solid Cool Gray vest . This would allow you to wear the vest with just about anything after your party ( nobody needs a one-hit wonder in their closet ) . As for ties , the Mr. Cord by Armstrong and Wilson would bring just the right amount of pattern to this all solid outfit and , again , would be highly wearable after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jeans . <p> You mentioned wanting to " surprise " your girlfriend by dressing very stylish . Follow the advice above and you looking stylish will never come as a surprise to anyone ever again . <p> " A big pile of indecision " huh , Bill ? Well you get points for having a sense of humor about it . <p> If it were the Black Lapel holiday party wed dress down with the charcoal vest and the brown shoes . The charcoal vest will look better with the texture of the shirt and the brown shoes will keep things from getting too serious . Its a party , after all . <p> That 's a pretty neutral combo , Aaron , so do n't  stress about matching . Just about every shirt in your closest ( barring maybe a black one ) will play nicely with this vest and jeans . <p> As for ties , match the ruggedness of the jeans and play up the casual look of the outfit with a wool tie like one of these Armstrong &amp; Wilson or Everett ties . You cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also look sharp with a suit during the cooler months . <p> I am looking at a rocker , psuedo-casual look for New Years ; a dark , pale red , short-sleeved shirt ( or dark salmon ) , with black vest and jeans . What would be the best jeans and footwear combo to go with these ? <p> Short sleeves for New Years huh ? Were assuming you 'll be indoors and warm , but we still prefer the rolled up sleeves look to short sleeves when wearing a vest . <p> As for pants , it sounds like a casual look so jeans are the way to go , Brian . Lighter ones will work with a black vest . And to take the rocker look all the way , black boots would be in order . They do n't  have to be big clodhoppers and they do n't  have to be outrageously expensive . Try some of the sleeker , but still durable options from brands like Geox or the beautiful new boot offering from Jack Erwin . <p> Hi ! I 'm looking at a charcoal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nice pair of brown rock portsdoes this work at all ? I tried it on and the light blue did n't  seem to mesh with the charcoal but i might just be over thinking it . <p> Justin , we think you might be over-thinking it but feel free to shoot us a photo of the outfit to our stylists at concierge@blacklapel.com . You know what they say about a picture being worth &gt; 1000 words ! <p> I want to wear matching colored black pants with a vest and tie should the vest be a casual suit vest or a more leather looking style vest , if not a tie what kind of shirt as in a plain one or something with patterns of some sort on it ? <p> Sounds like you 've got a lot going on , Manna . The goal of your casual outfit should be to look like you just threw something on and it looks great . An overly studied look , that 's too matchy-matchy kills the " devil may care " attitude a casual outfit should embody . Let 's simplify things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches your pants and vest . Youll be dangerously close to looking like you 're in uniform and people will start handing you the toothpicks from their hor doeuvres . If you 're going to wear a tie at all , wear one with a black background and a colored pattern . Err on the side of too skinny . A power tie without a jacket will overpower any outfit . <p> We recommend a vest like the ones we showed above . We believe leather vests should only be worn by hot biker chicks and Village People . <p> As for shirts , there 's no need to get fancy solid white works just fine and will provide a strong counterpoint to any vest ( except , of course , a white vest but who wears white vests ? ) . <p> I 'm wondering if a vest can work well here as something casual-cool , possibly a slight step up from casual . Or if not , perhaps a cardigan ( I do n't  think this works ) or a sweater ( maybe a sweater vest ? ) mixed together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest putting anything under the jacket that would cover up the shirt since we love pink the pink and brown combo . If you 're looking for another layer to add warmth , add it over the tweed jacket , instead . <p> One styling tip on the jeans , though . While we usually love dark jeans we 'd suggest going with a lighter shade to really put the emphasis on the navy wingtips and provide some contrast with the brown tweed . <p> What part of " high class dinner party " says sneakers ? There 's a reason the well heeled are called " well-heeled . " Unless you 're a successful rapper do n't  rock street wear to a dinner party ( yes , sneakers count as streetwear ) . <p> We read your whole comment , but could have stopped reading when we saw the word " interview .

This is . <p> Maybe you 're saying , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want a job selling shoes . " That 's a valid point . You do n't  need to go in there with a suit that cost a mint but you should look at the men who work the sales floor at Nordstrom . They 're in the best suits they can afford , you should be too . Follow our advice in the What to Wear to an Interview piece and you 'll make the right impression right off the bat . <p> Thanks for the info and I 'll have to do something about that Cardinal Sin very soon <p> I have another , probably more functional question do you have any tips on how to secure the extra bit of the vest adjustment strap ? On my vest the extra bit past the cinch currently hangs down once I set it to my desired fit any ways to keep it in line with the rest of the sizing strap and prevent a " tail " look ? <p> So I have this nice dark gray vest from Express , solid white dress shirt from Express , dark blue jeans and dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it to mix brands ? The fabrics do n't  clash but is it still a " no no " to mix ? <p> Dark pants or dark wash denim are a safe bet with a dark gray vest . Its always a good idea to match to your buttons so dark buttons on the vest ( which a dark gray vest ought to have ) means dark pants . <p> In our opinion a glossy gray shirt goes best with a stack of clothes to be donated . The only thing in your closet that should be glossy is a pair of well-shined shoes . <p> I got this semi-formal Presidents ball event tonight . I was thinking about rocking a vest with a shirt ( gray , blue or white ) . I have 3 vests ( black , navy blue and navy blue pin stripes ) . Should i go khakis or dress pants ? And what vest , shirt and tie combo would you suggest ? <p> There are a lot of possible combinations here , Dipen . ( This comment sounded vaguely like a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't some kind of pop quiz is it ? ) <p> This story is about wearing the vest casually , so usually we would suggest the white shirt , navy blue vest and khakis and a knit tie to pull together this casual look . Still , a " Presidents Ball " sounds pretty formal . It begs the question , are you sure casual is what you want to do here ? A jacket ( either a suit or a blazer ) and dress pants might be the way to go . <p> We think blankets should remain blankets . Anytime they try to pass themselves off as vests or anything else ( like the upholstery in the back seat of the car in Pulp Fiction ) , its a sign that something has gone terribly wrong . <p> Chad Michael Murray may only have answered " yes " to the first question in our T-shirt + vest quiz above ( were guessing he s not particularly handy ) but it looks like he s on his way to the premiere of a horror movie , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistcoat is far too short . You shouldnt be able to see any of the shirt underneath it from the front or sides . <p> This is tied into the second problem you NEVER wear a belt with a waistcoat ! You always wear suspenders beneath it , otherwise the belt creates an unnecessary bulge ( a problem you do n't  have , as the waistcoat is at an incorrect length ) . <p> Also , while this is n't a strict rule , nothing really matches here . A BLACK waistcoat , with a BROWN belt , and those shoes . <p> A much better pairing would be a properly-fitting waistcoat and black dockers . <p> Sorry for bagging on you so bad , but I 'm seeing many major faux pas here that are in dire need of correction ! <p> Need an opinion . I am thinking of wearing a white v-neck t-shirt , gray vest , very dark blue jeans and brown brogues to a casual dinner party . I have n't tried or seen anything similar but the idea sounds good in my head for some reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the vest , Jay . The V-neck and the V of the vest are likely to compete , though . A crew neck would help but we reserve the vest with a T-shirt look for lazy Sunday afternoons when we want a certain " I do n't  give a damn " quality to our look like Ed Norton from the Honeymooners . <p> The fact that you 're thinking ahead about what to wear to this dinner party means you DO give a damn , so wear a button-front shirt . White works with a gray vest ( or any other color for that matter ) , and will work with the rest of the outfit you described . <p> I am planning on proposing to my girlfriend , I have hired a photographer to capture the surprise . I am telling her we are going to stop at a park in Cleveland , OH before we go out to a nice restaurant ( so I can cover why I 'm dressing up ) . I am going to rock the following black , hooded , casual vest with a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea here is to look dressed for the occasion without looking like you 're dressing for " an occasion , " thus giving away the surprise . A silk tie you 'd wear with a suit would not only be a dead giveaway that somethings up , but it would also work against your whole casual dining look . <p> To match the rugged look of the jeans ( though we always prefer darker washes to dress up a pair of jeans and pair our lighter washes with T-shirts and sneakers ) and the athletic elements of the vest , keep things sporty with a textured tie like any of the ones we recently featured on Faceboook and a crisp white , button-down collar shirt in a hearty weave like an Oxford or broadcloth . Hint , get the shirt in the slimmest fit possible , so that you do n't  get a " muffin top " showing under your vest from all the excess fabric around the waist . <p> A three-piece suit , of course , means all three parts match , but you can wear an " odd waistcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one that can look very good when pulled off as this gentleman and this gentleman show us . Their trick ( and one you can try if you 'd like to try this look ) is making sure either the suit or the vest is solid while the other has a pattern . <p> I like this idea . My partner and I are attending his sisters garden wedding next month and he would be giving away his sister but he does n't  want to buy/wear a new suit . I was thinking of having him dressed in dress pants ( either black or dark grey ) , white shirt , burgundy ( wedding motif ) tie and a vest ( not sure what colour ) . Do you think that would do ? What about a black V neck sweater instead of a vest ? <p> Were going to pretend we did n't  read the part where you told a custom suit maker about your partner not wanting to buy/wear a new suit and skip to the part about the the black V-neck sweater . <p> We lean towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go wrong with a vest . A vest is a classic and getting one that fits is much simpler than getting a sweater that fits . Plus , they 're easier to tailor if you do need fit adjustments . As for a vest color , a little contrast between the pants and vest can go a long way . In the photo above we created contrast with texture ( the tougher denim against the softer wool ) but going with a stronger colored vest can really make it pop . <p> Ok , we cant get over this whole , no suit thing : This article is titled " How to Wear a Vest CASUALLY . " Is this wedding really that casual ? We would n't give away OUR sisters casually . If there were ever a time to wear a suit , this is it . <p> If he s adamant about dressing it down tell him to try one of the more casual looks like #3 or #4 from our What to Wear to a Summer Wedding story . If he does n't  want to wear a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit him flawlessly . We do n't  want to brag but you know what they say " Once you go Black ( Lapel ) , you never go back .

Oh sleeves on shirt rolled I 'm a former college Rugby player , and am blessed with big legs so never liked the rolling of pant sleeves . Help ! <p> That 's a REALLY casual wedding outfit , Jonathan . Go forward with caution , perhaps you should check with the groom before showing up in jeans . If you find that jeans do n't  work , try an outfit like #4 in our What to Wear to a Summer Wedding article . This one relies on the sneakers to dress down the suit . <p> If you do find the jeans are appropriate , we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal dress shoes than the Clarks . A pair of brown dress shoes will definitely do the trick . <p> I am a tall lanky guy , 61 ? 155lbs , does a vest combo look good on that body type ? Also , could you suggest some combinations to wear to a bachelor party and also to a wedding , keeping in mind that I would prefer darker colors . Thanks ! <p> The key to making sure things look good on your body type is fit . A vest that 's baggy will make you look even lankier . A vest that hugs your sides will serve you well casually and as a part of a three-piece suit . <p> I 'm trying to piece together an outfit for an audition . I normally dress casual , but am thinking of dressing it up a bit with a vest . Pink button down , sleeves rolled , with a light gray vest , dark/light jeans ( ? ) , possibly white tie with white shoes ( ? ) . <p> A vest is a great way to bring a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sleeves look says , " let 's get down to brass tax , folks " from the minute you walk into the room . For the jeans , the darker the wash the more formal they look . anchor the lighter colors up top with dark pants . As for the white tie , weve yet to see a white necktie that we liked . Unless you 're auditioning for a role as a 30s gangster , steer clear of the white tie . A pair of white bucks can work for a summer look but for an audition , keep them really tame . You do n't  want the casting people to remember your shoes more than your performance . <p> Black jeans work , so do dark blue . Faded might look too casual , especially if you switch out the Chucks for brogues . For the belt , go with leather and keep it the same color as the brogues . If the jeans fit perfectly and you do n't  need a belt , you can lose it and itll keep the vest trim around the waist/hips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your sleeves and rocking the Converse , well assume you 're going for a more casual vibeso we say , no tie . However , if you still feel inclined knot up , a very dark , midnight purple tie would complement the colors in your outfit nicely . <p> Hey Sean ! That 's a fine look . If you want our input , how about going with a lighter shirt ( like a solid light blue shirt or even a crisp white shirt ) for better contrast against the black vest ? Also , if you go with a tie , try a knit tie . Itll help achieve that dressed-down look you 're going for . Hope that helps ! <p> Bryn , here are our answers : 1 ) We recommend keep your shirt tucked as too much of the shirt billowing out from underneath the vest can tend to look sloppy . The exception to this is if the shirt you are wearing underneath is short enough to be hidden underneath the vest . 2 ) Yes , you can . 3 ) No , the pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that small casual touch to dress down the look . <p> I always see these kinds of posts with examples of suits or vests that are black , but never grey . I 'm new to the party and only have one suit , a three-piece grey Perry Ellis suit . I really want to get the vest some casual action , but I 'm feeling slightly insecure about wearing it with jeans . Is this advisable , or should I simply get a black vest if I want to look good casually wearing a vest ? <p> Travis , a gray vest makes for an absolutely fine pairing . Youve got nothing to worry about . If you 'd like , send us ( concierge@blacklapel.com ) a pic of an outfit you 'd like to rock and our stylists will give you a second opinion ! <p> Great suggestion Brandon .

Make sure it has a big geometric pattern and add a puffed pocket square that sticks too far out your pocket ( just be sure it clashes with the tie ) . <p> The shirt is essential . When choosing a color , try to match any NFL home jersey color except for the Chicago Bears . Socks in the same color will go a long way too , though no one will see them since your pants should form giant puddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see the next bullet ) . <p> Ideally you 'll borrow an old suit from a buddy who 's 15-20 pounds heavier and an inch or two taller than you to get a truly Goodman-esque fit . If you cant do that , dig deep and pull out that old three-button number you 've been holding on to for sentimental reasons and give it one last whirl before chucking it into the " donate " pile . <p> Advice from the pros <p> Bob Odenkirk on people laughing at Sauls manner of dress : <p> He think he s dressing good , man ! He thinks he s got stylehes a little mystified if they 're laughing at him . Like , he would say to them , What are you laughing at ? These socks are pure silk ! That yellow dye is illegal in America . I had to go far to get these. <p> Lesson learned , to truly embody Saul , arm yourself with a backstory for every part of the look .

Black is extremely limiting for a number of reasons . One , it has connotations that you might not want ( the undertaker look may not be appropriate for lots of situations ) . Second , black can make otherwise acceptable colors look extremely loud and make colored patterns look almost clownish . That leaves you limited to extremely muted colors and subdued grays when choosing shirts and ties . Third , black limits you to black shoes , which rules out many of the best looking shoes . If you want a dark suit , try charcoal gray instead . Gray is a good color for a job interview suit , great for graduations and weddings and can be worn with any color you like . Better still , you can wear it with black , brown and even burgundy/oxblood shoes .

I have a slight frame and would like to be made to look taller . Would I be a good candidate for a slim fit suit ? <p> You would be a good candidate , Kevin . Too many slim guys try to look bigger by getting suits that are cut too loose . This has the opposite effect and makes them look like they 're wearing hand-me-downs from their big brothers . <p> Black Lapel I 'm looking at buying some slip suit pants from H&amp;m i ORDERED A 32r back here , but they were way too tight .

If so the answer is " not really . " You could have a tailor take in areas all throughout the suit , but that will likely cause other fit problems in areas like the shoulders . The cost of these alterations can quickly add up and the likelihood of your suit fitting you well at the end of this process is pretty low . <p> If you 're going to spend the money , why not get something that fits the way you want right out of the gate ? <p> Hi , I am 57 with a lean physique and i wish to get myself a slim fit suit . Size 36 seems to be the one salesmen reccomend for my build . I , however find it bulky and i can feel the presence of excess material in multiple areas when i try it on . If i were to get a suit stitched , what are the various key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to get a closely fitting suit ? <p> Tailoring an ill-fitting suit is a dicey proposition , Nikhil . Fixing one problem can often create another problem . The main question is how do the shoulders fit ? If they 're good , you want to do as much as you can to get the rest of the suit to fit without messing up the shoulders . For instance , if your shoulders are good and you take in the chest and stomach a lot you could end up with rumpling in the shoulders and a suit that looks worse than when you started . On the flip side , if the shoulders are off , even the most skilled tailor will have trouble making the jacket look good . <p> As we covered in our tie width story , choosing a good tie width has more to do with your lapels than the cut of your suit . The slimmer your lapels the slimmer your ties . <p> This brings up a common misconception . Do n't  get the suit cut confused with a description of the wearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great shape would look good in a slim cut suit because its close to the body cut would flatter his physique ( see LeBron James ) . He would probably not opt for slim lapels , though . In his case a wider tie would be more appropriate with his suit . <p> All of this is why you get to choose the lapel width on all Black Lapel suits and blazers ( along with plenty of other customization options ) . <p> There are a lot of variables besides height and build , Dominic , but generally speaking it sounds like a Tailored Fit suit would be what the doctor ordered . <p> This is really a question for one of our stylists who can give you more detailed personal recommendations based on your body type . We recommend creating a measurement profile and then emailing concierge@blacklapel.com with some pictures to get some recommendations on customizing your suit . <p> I 'm going to a wedding relatively soon , its semi-formal and I 'm not sure on what to wear exactly . I 'm not looking for a suit off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount . I 've got a slim but athletic build so I do n't  want a baggy suit , but I also do n't  want one to make me look excessively skinny . <p> You sound like a great candidate for a Slim Fit suit , Adam . Since you 're tall and slim you want a suit that hugs your frame so it wo n't look like you 're swimming in fabric . Still , do n't  confuse " Slim Fit " with " Skinny Fit " like a pair of jeans . The only way you get a suit that looks like its painted on is if you ask for a suit that looks like its painted on . <p> As for getting your suit for the wedding , be sure to give yourself time to take your measurements , get your order in and get your suit made .

I have an athletic ectomorph body type ( bruce lee type ) , 57 with a slightly longer torso to leg ratio . I like the slim fit but I am hesitating because I have slightly big muscular thighs for my height and I feel that slim fit might exaggerate them resulting to a shorter legs appearance . I am interested in a james bond / transporter look . Please suggest which fit should I buy for that look and if the thigh tightness of the slim fit would be an issue . <p> Hey Francis !

Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well get one of our stylists to assess your body type and help you achieve that perfect fit and style you 're looking for . <p> I wanted to ask , though , are the x-creases emanating from the button , around the waist of the jacket on that model considered too prominent for business dress ? I 'm 24 , but I still do n't  want to look like I 'm trying too hard to be hip . <p> Thanks for the kind words about the site Rohan ! As for your question on the creases , the slight creasing is completely natural for a slim-fitting suit and definitely not too prominent for business dress .

I get comments like , " Nice tiewhat kind of knot it that ? " and I say , " The Eldridge , Jeff Eldridge . " Im inspired to create my ownbe right back <p> This is just amazing . Will definitely need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Tired of the same old knot . Would you be kind enough to share some other exotic knots like this . Would really appreciate it . <p> This is an excellent knot ! Something was a little strange though , I was comparing Jeffreys video with the step-by-step instructions above and it appears that they are teaching two different ways to tie the knot . The instructions above are cleaner , but definitely not the same as Jeffreys video . Did he update the knot or is this BLs variation , using the same name ? <p> Hi David , the visual instructions above is our take on the Eldredge so there may be some minor differences in the steps . The end result , however , should be the same so feel free to go with the approach that works best for you ! <p> I love your knot I tied this knot for my husband and son on Sunday for Church and recieved so many compliments , and we went to his brothers house for dinner and he saw the tie and said wow ! how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive and wants to tie the knot .

I was tired of the typical tie knot that I always had , this ones surely elegant .

I receive quiet comments of appreciation . The Eldrege ( and Trinity ) are subtle details just make them part of your every day living ( life is too short to be boring ) . <p> oh , btw I do have a gorgeous tie I found sitting all silk &amp; Marc Chagal like , in a thrift store for two bucks .. worth 50 xs as much so , I am quite thrilled to present it for the first time sporting such an elegant knot ..

After reading all of your comments i am now exhausted but then I am from the 60s. so @ least you know for sure I will be up for it in the AM Love this stuff always cool appreciate it ! thnx . <p> When starting out , is the large end of the tie on the left side or the right side ?

Many thanks and just one question , will you be doing another of these diagrams for the trinity knot ? <p> I could n't resist , but I MUST compliment the moderator for answering EVERY SINGLE post really quickly This is incredible ! I 've never seen this anywhere else on the Web . Congrats to you !

We 'd love to see the knot ! <p> Wow ! ! ! I 'm addicted to this knot w/o trying it yet , but definitely will today and thereafter . Thanks for the tutorial , I 'm going tie shopping asap to find the perfect pattern/length for this knot then I 'm rocking it daily ! <p> Wearing this knot to work right now . Took a few tries to get the length down and will still take some more work to perfect ( and I doubt I 'll ever memorize the steps ) . I feel like it will work best with the right kind of tie I 'm wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knot a little bigger/puffier than in the picture . Definitely need to experiment with which ties I own that will look the best . Now , you guys should do a follow up on the Trinity Knot ! <p> I love it ! it jumped out at me last night and I stayed up until I completed my first one . I did n't  read the part about striped ties and my wife said try a solid color . I did a second one this morning and my wife loved it . <p> Make sure you 're cinching the knot tight at the appropriate stages . The good news is that at step 10 , you 're pretty close to the finish line so it sounds like only a little bit more length is needed ! Try it again with a tie 3 or 4 inches longer !

He 's known for his dialogue-heavy , yet completely cinematic writing style . He 's known for a directing style that , due to his encyclopedic knowledge of film history , borrows from all the greats . <p> Pulp Fiction , many people 's introduction to Tarantino 's work , is a masterpiece . Pulp Fiction has had a huge influence on popular culture . Pulp Fiction forever linked Samuel L. Jackson with the word motherfucker and single-handedly revived John Travolta 's then waning career . <p> Still , Pulp Fiction holds virtually no sway over the #menswear crowd . The men 's fashion world is overlooking Pulp Fiction 's hidden gems . Buried in the plot twists and character arcs are some pretty sound concepts for dressing well and looking your best . Here are five lessons in men 's fashion every man can take away from Pulp Fiction . <p> Keep it simple <p> The first Pulp Fiction characters we meet are Honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth . They are temperamental , childish , and incompetent criminals making back-of-the-napkin plans one minute and committing felonies the next . And their outfits encapsulate their characters . The mishmash of colors , the impossibly frizzy hair , these hot messes are about to cause a hot mess. - <p> By contrast , when we first meet the professional hitmen Vincent and Jules , played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson , they are not draped in a rainbow of colors or festooned with little accessories . They are all business in their black suits as they approach their work . We recognize that from how they look.Although they could have used a trip to the tailor to get those suits to fit them better , they pulled off the black suit look by keeping the outfits simple . <p> Bruce Willis shows the softer side of Butch the boxer who fawns over his girlfriend . Is it symbolism that this tough-as-leather boxer wears the softer side of the hide , suede ? Probably not , but he does show us why the suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Perfect for running errands like retrieving your watch from your old apartment , finding a hit man in your bathroom , shooting him , cleaning the gun , driving away , then using your car as a weapon to try to kill the man you double-crossed , getting into a gunfight with him , then being taken prisoner by a pawnshop-owning , sadistic rapist , and finally , fighting your way out , saving the life of your nemesis , and stealing a motorcycle . You know , everyday errands like that . Do n't fret over exposing suede to the elements , take care of your suede and it will take care of you . <p> Christopher Walken plays a small but pivotal role in the movie as Captain Koons , a man of principles if there ever was one . ( Seriously , would you endure what he had to sit through pun intended for a friend ? ) The character delivers a crucial monolog about the importance of a certain family heirloom straight into the camera . <p> Right away we know that Captain Koons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other actors in the film like Travolta and Harvey Keitel rock the slicked back look too , but Walken 's character , being from a flashback to the Vietnam War era , shows how truly timeless this look is . He could wear his hair like that today and look just as put together as he did when Pulp Fiction came out in the 90s or when his character 's scene took place in the 70s . <p> Whatever you 're wearing , wear it with confidence . You can rock a gold turtleneck while sipping a drink poolside ( as glimpsed in the original trailer above ) if you 've got the kind of quiet confidence that Ving Rhames exhibits playing Marcellus Wallace . Marcellus does n't sweat over what people will think if he wears a turtleneck . He does n't even sweat in the turtleneck on a sunny L.A. day . That 's how cool he is.Being that confident does n't mean you have to dress as out there as Marcellus . And , for the record , we do n't suggest that you attempt to recreate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do suggest you challenge yourself to get outside of your style comfort zone every so often and do so with confidence . <p> One of the best badasses ever to grace the silver screen is Harvey Keitel 's Pulp Fiction character , The Wolf . The man who comes to the aid of Jules and Vincent in their hour of need , drives his Acura NSX to the scene , and steps out in black tie . You get the sense that this guy spends nearly all of his time at high-class affairs , decked out in a tuxedo.The Wolf is the epitome of debonair . Does he break a few rules ? Sure , it appears to be a little early for black tie , but if we know anything about the people in Pulp Fiction it 's that none of them play by the rules . The Wolf nails it with his diamond point bow tie , stud front shirt and , the icing on the cake , a double-breasted dinner jacket with extra wide lapels.

They 're asking about what to wear to a summer wedding or what to pack for a trip where they plan to explore a new city or what to wear in Vegas . So we came up with a vacation packing list of what to pack for a trip to any of our favorite summer getaways . <p> But just as important as what goes on your vacation packing list is what stays off your list . Nobody wants to be that guy who overpacks and ends up lugging around a bunch of useless clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack and what to leave at home this summer . <p> A blazer classes up a T-shirt , chills out a dress shirt and , when it 's custom made for you like this one , it keeps you looking sharp day and night .

Lightweight and linen is your best bet for a summer vacation , like this French Blue Check Custom Blazer . <p> Leave the business darks <p> When you 're off duty , you 're freed from the constraints of the business dress codes . So white chinos and lighter , brighter colors like the one in this jacket should play a leading role .

So it 's no wonder that loafers are the perfect shoe for such activities . As with the above items , loafers are good to go with a casual or dressy look , making them an all-purpose item for the vacation packing list .

At a wedding it usually signifies that you 're the groom or a groomsman . At the office it often signifies that you 're the boss or one of the bossmen . Basically any time there is a guy who has official himself-men , a three-piece suit is appropriate . But adding an alternate vest to a suit says something different . It 's a less intimidating look ( read : you should n't be intimidated about trying it ) - and a modern way to remix a three-piece suit . Pulling it off is quite simple , just be sure the vest and the suit are connected in some way .

Keep things simple , like we did here with a charcoal gray vest that anchors the whole look . <h> Classic Colors , Timeless Style <p> Blue and gray are backbone of any well-dressed man 's closet , especially when it comes to suiting . Outfits like a navy blue blazer and gray pants are traditional and easy pairings . To update this color combo , try mixing a gray vest into a blue suit . As noted above , a solid vest provides a simple backdrop on which to apply some pattern , like a check suit and a striped knit tie .

What color shirt and tie . I 'm returning to Texas from New Orleans where the suit was made and where Im retired . Want to make a last good impression ! <p> The thing about a white 3-piece suit is , its a statement piece .

But if worn in tasteful moderation , a tie bar can be another option in adding a touch of class to any suit-and-tie outfit .

So make sure you clip both ends of the tie , as well as the placket of the shirt . This will keep your tie centered on your body , which keeps your look clean , structured and sharp . <p> For a classic tie bar you cant go wrong with , try our- stainless steel tie bar .

Everywhere you look there is some rule-enforcing , self-appointed , fashion police officer waiting to pounce on you . Every decision you make when you get dressed in the morning can haunt you for years to come . It can be some pretty scary stuff . But fear not . Unlike , say , womens clothing , mens style changes at a pretty slow pace . ( Score another one for guys . ) You can build a pretty bulletproof wardrobe that will stand up to the test of time . More good news when it comes to tailored clothing the pace of change is downright glacial . So there 's really no excuse for guys to make so many style mistakes . Yet , men still find a way . With Halloween only a week away , we thought wed offer up our list of the top three mens style mistakes that give us the heebie-jeebies . But this is n't just any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit wearing segment of the population ( aka Compass readers ) , so we focused on common mens style mistakes seen in suits ( for a list of mens style mistakes that includes a mix of casual and dressy style , check out Kinowears list of forty fashion faux pas for men ) . The second thing that makes this list unique is that its not just a list of screw-ups or an excuse for us to troll on celebrities looking like chumps on the red carpet . This list consists of only easily correctable problems . If you check out this list and see a mistake that you make , fear not . Each of these mens style mistakes can be fixed by your tailor ( probably for less than fifty bucks ) . Ready to be scared straight ? Check this list out and see if anything sounds familiar . If so , fix it . With the quickness ( like before next weeks Halloween parties ) or people will think you 're dressed up as a scrub for Halloween . <p> The Mistake <p> Not tapering the legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they are at the bottom ? If you answered no , you are probably some sort of tree/human hybrid ( BTW , that would be a badass Halloween costume idea ) . If you answered yes , then your pants ought to follow the shape of your legs . <p> The Solution <p> Take your pants to your tailor ( or a dry cleaner that does alterations on site ) . Try them on and have the tailor pin them so that you can see how much better theyll look when they taper as they reach the bottom of your leg . Once you get them dialed in , the tailor will handle the rest and itll be so long tree trunk legs . <p> The Mistake : <p> Wearing your pants too long The pants puddle , that collection of fabric around the ankles is a sure-fire sign of a guy who has n't  mastered fit . Somewhere along the way men got it into their heads that their socks should be hidden away and their shoes engulfed by their pant legs .

Stop by any dry cleaner with an in-house tailor or seamstress and they can probably make this quick alteration for you in minutes . <p> The Mistake : <p> Losing your shirt cuff under your jacket sleeve The style rule is : your shirt cuff should stick out a quarter- or half-inch below the jacket sleeve . Were a little less strict about this rule . Show too much shirt cuff and you 'll be forgiven , but do n't  show any and youll look like the high school kid at the dance wearing his dads blazer . <p> The Solution : <p> This is probably the trickiest of the tailoring jobs on this list .

Side tabs are essentially mini-belts made of the same suit fabric , attached on each side ( see the diagram above ) . Side tabs can be easily adjusted on the go and help you stay comfortable after a meal . Just make sure he has the matching fabric to add the tabs ( you may have to provide the fabric ) . The easier option is to have your pants made with them in the first place in lieu of belt loops when you order one of our custom suits . Just do n't  try to be too ambitious ( or indecisive ) and get both belt loops and side tabs . This just defeats the whole purpose of having side tabs . <p> Another option , for those who feel inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go for suspender buttons and pick yourself up some suspenders ( also called " braces " by our friends across the pond ) . Why suspenders ? According to the venerated tailor Alan Flusser , properly worn suspenders allow the pants to be hung from the shoulders rather than the hips , creating a completely different drape and fluidity to the look . So if you 're looking for a little more support from above , opt for the suspender buttons . The great thing about suspender buttons is that they 're on the inside so they 're discrete and you do n't  feel them . Opt for the button-type suspenders as clip-on versions can snap off and cause needless embarrassment . Suspender buttons will double with your side tabs for a pair of functional and stylish alternatives to wearing belts. - Suspender buttons and side tabs are available as an advanced customization option in all of our suit pants ( no additional charge as always ) ! <p> Hope this helps !

A lot of times I wear my trouser around the house without the belt and find it so much more comfortable .

With Veteran 's Day on the horizon , we thought we 'd pay homage to the styles that have made the leap from the armed services to civilian life . <p> You ca n't open many guys ' closets without finding some relic of a soldier 's outfit . You do n't  have to shop at an Army surplus store to find military inspired items either . If you go back far enough you 'll find that just about every item we wear has seen it 's share of the battlefield . Even the most pedestrian items like the necktie ( originally worn by Croatian mercenaries to signify their allegiance to France in the Thirty Years ' War ) has its roots in fighting . <p> More recently , the military has inspired mens style both at work and at play . Here are our top five pieces from the fighting man 's wardrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ khaki colored cotton pants have been the go-to pants for the semi-casual American man for years . <p> Cargo pants were originally created for paratroopers to carry radios and extra ammunition during WWII . They stayed in men 's closets after the war due to their rugged good looks . <p> Trench coats , as their name implies , were an integral part of the trench warfare in WWI . After slogging through the muck in them , veterans held on to these coats for their practicality and utility . <p> In the early days of air combat the pilots had little to protect them from the elements except for their trusted leather jackets . When early flyboys returned home they held onto their jackets and the heavy leather with the shearling neck that we know as the bomber became an instant classic . <p> Napoleon once said that an Army marches on it 's stomach . It 's true , a hungry army is n't much use , but that does n't mean they do n't need good footwear . Enter the combat boot . <p> The original desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed in North Africa when they were off duty . Modeled after shoes they found in the bazaar in Cairo today you can find desert boots anywhere stylish men are kicking back . <p> The regimental necktie is so ubiquitous most people do n't realize that they have their origins in the military . Leave it to the Brits to bring us yet another army inspired look . Back in the days when each regiment had its own unique colors officers would wear those colors in thickly striped ties long after they had left the service ( some refusing to wear any other colors ) . <p> Taking a page out of Mother Nature 's book , fighting men have turned to camouflage to elude their enemies for centuries . Camouflage is a relatively new addition to stylish men 's repertoire emerging as acceptable street wear in the Vietnam era . <p> On duty and off , perhaps the most useful and stylish part of any soldier 's getup has to be a pair of aviator sunglasses .

Actually you can also find some stuff in womens closet but there are more in mens closet . I guess because military stuff or clothings look cool and there is a sense if ruggedness when men wear these stuff . <p> The long coat worn in The Matrix is a leather version of the classic duster . <p> Dusters have their roots in the Wild West .

Keep up the good work ! <p> Having recently transitioned from the Army to the business world , and being a fan of this website , I find this article interesting . For me cargo pants never went too out of style because of their usefulness . I was a pilot and the Aviator Sunglasses they gave us were horrible !

You do n't  need to look hard to see this done well . For instance , regardless of where your politics lie , we can all agree Ronald Reagan definitely brought a bit of dash to Washington with brown suits ( previously unheard of in the White House ) that complemented his auburn hair .

Drop in to many an office and you 're likely to find at least one guy taking his fashion cues from Mad Men style . <p> Even those who have never seen the show can describe Mad Men style . Who is n't at least vaguely familiar with the look of Don Draper with his no-nonsense business suits , and traditional styling ( those narrow repp ties and stiff , square folded pocket squares ) ? Those who do watch the show ( aka : nearly everyone with a TV or an internet connection ) can also tell you that Don Draper gets regularly upstaged ( sartorially speaking ) by Roger Sterling . This is no accident . <h> A Method to the Madness <p> Jon Hamm , who plays Mad Mens central character , Don Draper , has the cards stacked in his favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiseled good looks , Hamm is the embodiment of the phrase tall , dark and handsome . So , making him look good is almost too easy for Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant . But making the characters look good is not the true goal of a costume designer . Ultimately , they are a part of the storytelling . <p> In the case of Mad Men , it is a story of a man whose life keeps unraveling and he keeps pulling it back together . That shows in his clothes . He must keep everything in his life buttoned up , pulled together and neatly folded or things begin to cave in . And so his clothes stay buttoned up , pulled together and neatly folded . <p> As Don struggles with his demons , he works to keep his appearance clean cut . Every crease in his slacks is exactingly sharp . Every shirt , is exceedingly white . In order to maintain the mask of Don Draper , there can be no loose ends , no strand of fiber ( or hair on his perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting look is cool , calm and under control , but also , a bitwelltame . <p> By contrast , Roger Sterling , is free to dress more boldly . Roger , who has never worked anywhere that did n't have his name on the door ( thanks to his father ) , is the face of the agency . His look matches his status . He 's no peacock but he 's not afraid of a little punch ( both the sartorial kind and the alcoholic kind ) . <p> Giving the actor who plays Roger , John Slattery , more aggressive styling is almost mandatory . His sharply featured face , crowned by his signature shock of silvery white hair , commands the viewer 's attention and can make any outfit appear timid by comparison . And so , character and casting conspire to ensure that Roger Sterling looks like a boss . And even though every episode of Mad Men takes place over 40 years ago , you 'd be every bit the badass if you dressed in Roger 's style today . <h> How We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draper and Roger Sterling were around today ? If Don Draper and Roger Sterling stopped by the Black Lapel Headquarters to get suited up , what would we offer them ? For starters , we 'd mix them up an Old Fashioned and a Gibson Martini to help ease the sudden transition to the 21st century . We 'd give them a contemporary fit , for sure , but we would n't stray too far from their go to looks . Check it out . <p> In keeping with Don 's conservative palette and style , we would suggest a gray suit for him . But not just any gray suit . We would follow our own advice and echo his hair color in his suit fabric . The result , a Warm Gray Sharkskin Custom Suit , with its subtle whisper of tan , that plays perfectly off of Don 's skin and hair color and is still subdued enough for the cool , calm and collected man . <p> A striking face like Roger 's deserves a forceful suit like this Navy Windowpane Custom Double-Breasted Suit .

We see too many grooms waiting until the last minute and then rushing to get things altered the day before the wedding . <p> As to your conundrum , you are right to be concerned about white showing through the jacket .

If you 're looking to shake things up only slightly , try breaking rule #4 above and wearing a knit bow tie . <p> I want to add , since it wasnt said in the article , there are benefits to wearing the Navy Tuxedo from a colour standpoint . The fabric is actually more like a midnight blue blue that is so dark it is nearly black . Black wool fabric can actually look more like dark brown , dark green , or dark charcoal under artificial lights . Midnight blue remains darker and richer under the same conditions . Compare the Navy Tuxedo with the black ones to the right . Note how the black looks almost washed out under the studio lights compared to the depth of colour provided by the midnight blue fabric . The subtle difference in colour also looks better on men with summer complexions and hair ( such as the Royal Blue Tuxedo model ) while remaining perfectly traditional . <p> I have a black satin jacket with grosgrain lapels and silver floral brocade embroidery .

I have recently lost weight and decided to not have it altered ( I only gave $10 for the jacket and am surviving my final semester of dental school ) but love the look of it . What do you think , is it enough to zag where others zig ? <p> The idea might be to streamline the look , but an uncovered waist can interrupt it . If you look at the model on the top right ( in the peak lapel ) , that little triangle of white underneath the button sticks out quite a bit ( even though its relatively small ) . If your jacket opens up at all under the button when you move your arms , an uncovered waist is always going to show and because its white on black , it will be very noticeable . I do n't  think there 's anything sleek about a floating white triangle at your navel . This is n't essentially a question of tradition , but of functional aesthetics .

That was no summer wind , friends , that was the crisp air of fall making it 's way to a street near you ( that is , for you Northern Hemisphere guys ) . Fall means changing colors , changing temps and changing your wardrobea little . <p> Fall presents a unique sartorial challenge . The temperatures will start to dip a bit and sometimes , unpredictably " it 'll test the versatility of your wardrobe . The air might be cool and windy but the sun still shines through , so it 's warm during the day but much cooler at night . You need to stay suited up for work but the typical suit and shirt combo might not be warm enough . At the same time , it 's not yet time to don the overcoat or a trench . What 's a well-dressed man to do ? <p> Layer . The thin layers of fall is the smartest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've rounded up three looks for three different types of guys . Each has a unique personality , unique style , and now , a unique way to add a layer of warmth without sacrificing style . <p> You may be a stone cold negotiator , you may have ice in your veins when you have to make tough business decisions , but there 's no reason you should freeze your ass off on the way to the office . <p> Add a richly hued , merino wool V-neck to a gray suit for an uber-classy look . This look will not only keep you warm , it 's appropriate in both business formal and business casual settings . Just remember to keep the sweater neutral , like the taupe one featured here and use accessories to dash your outfit with color " i.e. , your tie or pocket square . <p> Why it Works : A merino wool sweater like the one featured here is thin , yet warm and soft , yet durable so it makes an ideal layering fabric . <p> You 're a business man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field or maybe you 're just a business man who likes to think creatively . So , you believe in good form , but not without good function . And layering up with a puffer vest under your suit is fashion forward , but extremely practicalespecially on those windy fall days . <p> The key to mashing up formal and casual ( like this look here ) is not to split your look 50/50 but to choose one element of casual wear to mix in with an otherwise formal look . Do n't shy away from ties and pocket squares , hell , even a French cuff shirt would play . All of these more formal touches add interest and make the interplay between the vest and the outfit even stronger . And if you need to revert back to strictly business , just lose the vest . <p> Why it Works : A thick vest would push against a well-fitting jacket , but a thin one like this works because it does n't  make you look stuffed inside the jacket . <p> You 're an artist and a stylish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex ideas and emotions through different artistic mediums " it might be pictures , graphics or wordsbut definitely through your clothes as well . <p> The cardigan sweater is a layering tool that provides ultimate versatility " it 's a creative way to dress down a formal outfit or dress up a casual one . When wearing it under a suit jacket , think of it almost like a vestbut a casual one . Since a cardigan is cut with a lower button stance , it allows you to keep your jacket , shirt and tie as the primary focal points , which means that there 's no limit to what you can do with the colors and patterns of your outfit . <p> Why it Works : The buttons on the front of this sweater and jacket , along with a polka-dot tie create a repeating circle motif that helps tie together the various colors and keeps the look fun . <p> We love medium or navy blue with a light gray suit , Patrick . For a little less contrast you can go with a dark gray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern contrast . With a solid suit , try a vest with a pattern , like a herringbone or a windowpane . If the suit is patterned , then stick with a solid vest . <p> So the past few days , the temperature has warranted more layers and I 've been wearing a cardigan underneath my sport jacket . I even have the sport jacket unbuttoned ( without a cardigan I always have it buttoned ) . I like the way I look . Now I know all my future suits will be three-piece . <p> Wow . Found this website yesterday when googling shirt and tie combinations , and I cant pull myself away . Three hours last night and again first thing this morning I ca n't help myself , my brain is exploding with fashion sense . You guys are life changers . <p> I love you . <p> I live in Canada and fall can be harsh . I will definitely be pulling off the merino wool sweater and the cardigan . I would have never imagined these combinations . You are awesome . <p> Thats sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shot under natural light that , naturally , changes . Add the different models and different layers under the suit jackets and you get some different looks . We have since updated the story with more evenly shaded photos . Hopefully this clears up any confusion about the suits . <p> Are the suits that the article links to correct ? The first suit looks greyish/blue , but the link is for the Solid Charcoal Suit . And the third Blazer looks more like the Solid Royal Blue suit than the Solid Navy Blue one . <p> Yes , the links are correct , Bryan . These photos were shot under changing natural light ( the sun is a fantastic studio light , but it sure does change on you ! ) . To compare the suits , its best to use the product photos you see when you click on the links . Here we 've focused on how the layers underneath the suits look . Got a favorite look ? <p> The suits in the first two pictures are , in fact , both charcoal gray . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , obviously , with different models . All of that contributed to the suits looking somewhat different . <p> Hope this wasnt too confusing . What did you think of the layers under the suits ? <p> Great post in time for fall . It would be great to hear your thoughts as winter approaches on overcoat etiquette , with most of us having far fewer shades of topcoats than suits . I.e. Gray suit : black or navy topcoat ? etc . <p> Good idea , on the overcoats , well discuss that in an Ask the Black Lapel Stylist post as winter approaches but to answer your question about the gray suit , it depends . A good basic rule of thumb is black shoes = black coat , otherwise go with a color . <p> I love the cardigan and sport coat look . If I add a coordinating scarf Im set for the entire day . Here in Montana we can see daytime temperatures start at around 32degrees and reach into the high 70s by mid afternoon . That combination keeps me comfortable and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If its cold enough for a sweater then wear a coat . Otherwise be a man and brave it out . Putting a sweater , cardigan or anything else under a suit is horrible . A great scarf to protect the throat may be stretch but a sweater is a total yuk . Wear a white tee under the shirt if you are that nesh . Come on BL this is the first time Ive ever disagreed with you : - ) <p> The trick for you , Joshua , is to get a sweater that 's not too long so that it does n't  fall too much below your waist . <p> Tucking your sweater is a smart way to ensure it does n't  show below the bottom of your jacket , but wed suggest a V-neck in that case . Tucking a cardigan , with its buttons in the front , would look a little clunky and probably cause some discomfort in the last place you need it !

Rock your traditional dark suits and you 'll be drenched in sweat by the time you reach your office . We 're here to show you that summer does n't have to mean dressing down . How do you keep your wardrobe professional and still beat the heat ? There 's the cotton suit , as seen at high school graduations everywhere but not exactly appropriate for , say , a day in court or in a board room .

They are n't  cheap but i cant back them harder , they are simply amazing .. you have to see them for yourself oh and they are super comfortable ! ! ! <p> Try to find something that is n't cotton also .

Unfortunately , they do n't  carry them in v-neck <p> My personal " hot weather survival secret " is to wear some kind of athletic compression , sweat-wicking , technical fabric underneath my dress shirts such as Under Armour , Nike Dri-Fit , etc . There are plenty of different colours and necks available , but usually a white v-neck style is the most versatile ! <p> While we usually keep the compression shirts to activities in which the word beast is thrown around ( i.e. " Dude is a beast on the bench press , right ? " hand slap ) you can also put them to use under a dress shirt . <p> Who knows , maybe you 'll even get a little extra-oomph out of them like when you wore your underoos to school and nobody knew it but you were a superhero that day . So go ahead and beast that staff meeting , Christopher ! Your secret is safe with us and 100,000 of our closest readers . <p> I live in Trinidad here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what its like . Wearing the undershirt helps alot . Applying powder , yes baby powder below your undershirt as well also helps with the absorption . <p> Look at the type of deodorant you 're using as well , it might be time to try Right Guard if your Speed Stick is slowing down Right Guard Sport and Old Spice has worked great you can try those . Apart from that try getting dressed on a morning atleast 30 mins before you have to commute so your body can adjust and walk on the cool side of the street , trust me Im always crossing the road to keep in the shade . Every little bit helps keep that sweat off . <p> Also a good habit is to have an extra undershirt and dress shirt at the office to change if you have meetings to attend . Hope this helps , cheer . <p> Great tips , Christopher ! Of course , wed be willing to put up with a little sweat to enjoy the island vibes of Trinidad on the regular but that 's a separate topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but be careful using it , especially aroundoddly enoughbabies since talcum powder can get into their lungs and do serious damage .

Lots of guys keep an extra dress shirt , but if you 're still wearing a drenched undershirt you wo n't feel ( or be ) completely fresh , now , will you ? <p> Tommy John makes terrific undershirts as well . Their V necks go down just far enough to unbutton two buttons on the shirt over it , which makes them perfect for situations like that . They also make the crew-neck that goes all the way to the top . <p> All these years we thought plunging necklines looked best on women ! Yes , Carleton , you 're right , the deep V neck makes a big difference .

These jackets are great for transitional weather and are damn good at transitioning from dressed up to casual . Yet , many men neglect these sartorial workhorses when building their wardrobes . So we 've put together this guide to blazers . Below you 'll find four essential blazers for fall ( though they look good any time of year ) for four different guys . <p> The Ivy Leaguer <p> You do n't need to have an Ivy League degree on your resume to look smart in a preppy blazer with traditional gold buttons . The buttons are a nod to this jacket 's clubby roots . Today they 're mostly decorative and add a bit of shine to a subdued dark jacket . <p> The trick to pulling off the traditional preppy look is not trying too hard . Pair this jacket with pink pants and a tie with whales on it and the whole ensemble starts to look like a costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and style accordingly . In this case , we used the ultra-preppy blazer to lend a certain New England prepster vibe to this jeans and shirt look . <p> If sipping a little bourbon while tailgating at an Ole Miss football game sounds like a little slice of heaven to you , then this look is for you . <p> The jacket is light in weight , so it 's perfect for the warm fall weather down south , and heavy on style . The check pattern makes this jacket a little sportier than a solid sport jacket , thus it 's great for transitioning from the office to weekend wear . This blazer is easy to throw on with a pair of jeans but be careful not to match the shade of the jacket and jeans too closely or you 'll look like you 've got on an all denim suit . Pair it with a simple solid shirt and jeans , like we did below , and you 've got an easy combo of dressed up and casual . <p> The West coast has a style all its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ping pong and foosball tables ) , stylish left coasters still sport blazers to dress up a casual look . But , the warm temps and bright sun make old-school dark blazers look ( and feel ) a little stuffy out West . Instead , opt for a lighter fabric and lighter color like the Solid Tan Tropical Wool blazer below .

But you 're not the average guy , are you ? The average guy wears an average dress shirt and comes out lookingwellaverage . Do n't  let this happen to you . So what do we mean by " create your own shirt style ? " What follows is a guide to defining your own shirt style by making choices that you get when you get custom shirts . But even if you have n't yet made the switch to custom dress shirts , you still have choices when you shop off the rack and most of what you 'll see below applies to any dress shirts you 're considering . So what should you be looking for ? See Below <h> 1 . Create your own shirt fit <p> Getting a good fit is one of the toughest things to do when you buy a shirt off the rack . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable and with sleeves that are pretty close to your arm length , but since most dress shirts are made based on the FCD ( fattest common denominator ) , the one that fits your neck and sleeves will likely resemble a tent when you put it on . That is , assuming you 're not too tall or short or , God forbid , you have one shoulder that sits slightly lower than the other like most men do . If so , you 'll have a tough time getting a good fit out of any dress shirts you find in stores . <p> The solution to these problems , of course is a made-to-measure shirt that is crafted to your exact size specifications . <p> Made-to-measure shirts allow you to define your fit . Want to show off that sweet V-shape you 've been working on in the gym every morning ? Get yourself a slim fit shirt that hugs your waist and highlights your shape . <p> Maybe you do n't  have abs of steel but you 're just looking to get rid of the fabric-bunching muffin top effect you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to go . Even if you 've got a bit of a spare tire , do n't  accentuate it with a shirt that leaves you with excess fabric everywhere you look . <h> 2 . Choose your shirt color wisely <p> Most guys should spend less time trying to match colors in their shirts and ties . Instead , they should be focusing on choosing shirt colors that complement their own coloring . As we highlighted in our How to Build a Suit story , stylish dressers match the intensity of the contrast in their clothes to the amount of contrast in their faces and hair . <p> So if you 've got light skin and dark hair , create contrast between your shirts and jackets . The easiest way to do that is to wear white shirts that create contrast with every jacket in your suit wardrobe ( unless you happen to be wearing a white suit , in which case , you should probably be heading out to make a guest appearance at your local KFC instead of reading this story ) . <h> 3 . Create your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've got a shirt color that looks great on you . Now its time truly make the shirt your own . One of the easiest , and most stylish , ways to customize your shirt is to add a monogram . Weve discussed adding a monogram to a suit before . Unlike suit monograms , shirt monograms have very utilitarian roots . In the days when men regularly sent all of their shirts out to laundry services , a monogram served as a label and ensured that you got back the same shirt you sent to the cleaner . Today many dry cleaners have robust systems of tracking clothing , yet they still manage to give your shirt to the wrong guy from time to time . So , well keep monogramming our shirts , thankyouverymuch . <p> Aside from monograms , there is one more practical thing to consider when you create your own shirt style : the right collar type for your face . Choosing the collar that works best for your face will go a long way towards stylishness . <h> The Perfect Dress Shirt <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about more than just following a set of rules to create the perfect shirt . That 's because style is less about getting it " right " as it is about getting it right for you . A great dress shirt ought to frame your face and accentuate your positives . If you create your own shirt that fits your body , harmonizes with your coloring and includes a touch of your personality , you 'll have a shirt you 'll want to wear everyday . Itll look great when you wear it . Itll feel great when you wear it . In short , it will be , the perfect dress shirt for you . <p> Got a question about how to create your own perfect shirt ?

What we saw was nothing short of brilliant as the actors breathed life into the tragic love story with a modern style that has n't been seen since the original West Side Story ( minus the finger-snapping greaser gangs ) . What caught our eye the most , aside from the angelic Condola Rashad playing Juliet , was all the dope gear that Orlando Bloom , as Romeo , and his crew , the Montagues , wore . <p> Clockwise from top:The Capulets and the Montagues throw down , Christian Camargo as a Mick Jagger inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When we caught up with Fabio Toblini , we got to pick his brain on the style choices for this traditional Shakespearean play with not-so-traditional clothing .

We started looking at the origin of hip hop from the 80s , the Rolling Stones from the 70 's , and military uniforms , and blended the elements together . Yes , it 's contemporary , but I really wanted to go for timeless . It can be anywhere in the last 20 years , and anywhere in the Western world .

This is the perfect time to bust out a sport jacket . Its classy enough to show that you paid attention to your look but not as strong of a statement as a suit . With a micro-check shirt and khakis you 'll look put together without looking like you spent all day putting yourself together . <p> I actually had my office party this past Saturday and I rocked the navy blue suit with a navy blue shirt .

Is that good or a " no , go back home and do n't  show your face " ? ? <p> Sounds like you 've got a lot of colors in this look . Color can be festive but too many will make you look like a Christmas tree . We say simplify this look . If you want to use the black suit as the base then we suggest going with black shoes and picking one lighter accent color . ( Navy can muddle the whole look , but if you like blue a lighter pale blue would work . ) <p> As we have noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with color in your accessories . A pair of colored laces , some patterned socks and a pocket square that all echo the same color in varying hues will bring your whole look together and still be celebratory . <p> Both of these jackets are extremely versatile , Jonathan .

The navy is a bit darker than the blue charcoal , so if you 're prefer darker , more understated blue , then the navy is for you . <p> Of course , you could just get both and start a whole blue blazer collection ! <p> Highly disagree about the black shirt &amp; suit combo . It is extremely unflattering on nearly everyone , especially in later hours . The reason why is due to the lack of any contrast .

I 'd want to avoid that , especially with coworkers . A white shirt would avoid that . It would also give the option of wearing a white linen pocket square if one so desired . <p> Usually I agree with the majority of what you guys say , but I do n't  know that I quite agree with the " black on black " idea .

So we think it 's time to reconsider mens jewelry . After all , if you want to look good , something so integral to your style ought to be more than just an afterthought . <p> You 'll also notice that men 's watches , men 's bracelets and cufflinks are all competing for the same real estate , your wrist . For men , it 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style acumen . <p> So what 's the secret to a well-dressed wrist ? That depends on who you ask .

On the other side of the spectrum are those who lay it on thick with everything they can think of from watches to cufflinks to bracelets . We believe that somewhere between the two extremes lies the style sweet spot , but ultimately it 's up to you to decide . <h> A- Mens Jewelry Minimalist <p> For the man who eschews any unnecessary items the well-dressed wrist conversation starts and ends with watches . Michael Thompson , Editor-in-Chief of International Watch magazine suggests that guys who are looking to keep their look simple stick with simple watches .

That means cufflinks and bracelets are on tap for you . " Cufflinks are your opportunity to inject your personality into your otherwise very formal outfit . " says Dennis Green , who covers men 's style for Business Insider . While Dennis shuns the bracelet ( more on that later ) , he believes in the power of cufflinks , noting that " there 's really no way to go wrong with cufflinks .

In that case , you 're probably looking to take the advice Dennis wrote in his story entitled " The only 3 pieces of jewelry men should wear . " There he makes the case for a wedding band , a watch and a set of cufflinks being the only mens jewelry you should be wearing . When asked why bracelets did n't make the cut , he explained that bracelets " always look out of place with higher levels of formality .

If you go with the bracelet , we suggest a simple I 'd bracelet in a metal that matches your watch . Wrap one of these understated around the wrist of your dominant hand ( opposite your watch ) to identify yourself as stylish . <p> If you go down the cufflinks path , Dennis suggests adding some personality : " My favorite is when guys use a bit of their favorite hobby , interest , or background .

For more personal recommendations , take advantage of our free concierge service by emailing a Black Lapel stylist at concierge@blacklapel.com . <p> We can custom make you a vest out of any of the fabrics you see made into a suit or blazer . <p> I will attending a wedding on the 25th of September . I 'm planning to wear a charcoal grey double breasted suit . What color shirt and tie should I wear with it . I would something out of the box and no plain ties and shirt . <p> Bad news , good news , Atif . Bad news is , we 've got no idea what color shirt and tie you should wear . There are two reasons for that : 1 ) Charcoal gray is a neutral so the possiblities are endless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you . What colors look good on you is the name of the game . Forget about trying to devise some algorithm to come up with the " perfect " combination , and just focus on what looks good on you . <p> A white shirt always works . Just be sure its freshly pressed and clean as a whistle . As the last section above points out , blue and gray are pretty much the Romulus and Remus of a mans closet and either will work as a vest color with blue gray chinos . Since you 're looking for something to wear in a few days , ordering a made-to-measure vest from us is not an option , but a vest like the Cool Gray would work for this situation . <p> Big wigs are tough cookies . A lot of times they set the dress code standard in an office . If you think you can wear a three-piece suit remix without getting your rear end handed to you , we still encourage it as office-appropriate ! <p> Yup , Lenny , the three-piece remixes you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any of the links to see the products and youll see that the suits and vests are separate pieces that we put together into outfits . <p> As for a vest for a broad guy , use slimming patterns to get the job done . A solid swath of color across your front ( like the last photo featured above ) can accentuate a larger chest/belly . A windowpane pattern ( like the one in the vest shown at the top of this article ) features boxes that are shaped like windowpanes . Those boxes are taller than they are wide and have a slimming effect on the wearer . <p> The fabrics we chose to highlight above are just a few of the many options you could choose . Since we make all Black Lapel clothes to order , you could , theoretically , combine any of our fabrics into a three-piece remix like the ones above . If you 'd like more specific advice , email us at concierge@blacklapel.com and one of our stylists will help you get the look you 're after . <p> This is just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the suits in different shades can I use my VISA Card to get those vests ? I must point out though I am a 55 ? person and therefore do n't  really know how I will look like in the public eye . <p> If you currently do n't  own a vest and are interested in adding one to your wardrobe , what 's a good color/pattern to start with ? Most of my suits and dress pants are solid blue or gray with some subtle patterns . <p> Since your suits are solid or subtly patterned , vests with more spaced out patterns ( like the Cobble Hill Houndstooth Vest above ) provide a little more contrast and can really make the outfit pop . Another way to do that is through color . Lighter colors ( like the Cool Gray Vest seen above ) create contrast with darker blue and gray suits . <p> Whether patterned or solid , choose a vest with neutral color(s) like gray or tan , and you 'll be able to mix and match it with a wide range of suits .
